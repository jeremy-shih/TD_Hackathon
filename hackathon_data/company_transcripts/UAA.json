At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Lance Allega","Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Under Armour\u2019s third quarter 2017 results. Participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found on our website at uabiz.com.","During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning\u2019s release. We use non-GAAP amounts to lead into some of our discussions because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to amounts in accordance with U.S. GAAP, reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables including the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management\u2019s view of why this information is useful to investors.","Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Under Armour Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Bergman. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, I\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge the disappointment that we feel about our financial performance in 2017. We understand the issues that put us in this position, and we\u2019ll speak to you today about how we\u2019re addressing these challenges and how we\u2019re proactively working to move our company forward.","On our last call, we detailed a number of strategic initiatives and a restructuring plan geared at aligning our resources to make us a better company. Essential to this ongoing transformation is balance, strategic, financial and operational. In 2017, our equilibrium has been out of sync with our long-term expectations.","We\u2019ve not performed to the level we originally aspire to. Some of this imbalance is due to things in our control like product, consumer connectivity and structural changes and some things from out of our control, like the macro environment and shifting consumer behavior. Amid this backdrop, 2017 has been a reset for Under Armor and while certainly a challenging year, it is a time that has taught us invaluable lessons, strengthened our results and will prove to be a year that helps redefine us as a brand company and culture.","Before going into our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of the year, I think it\u2019s useful to put our story into context and chapters, where we\u2019ve been, where we are today and the actions we\u2019re taking to position this brand for the future.","Chapter one was a basement start up. There was a scrappy, hard-fought fight that established our DNA and laid our foundation.","Chapter two is about expanding into women\u2019s and International, while driving the product innovation engine, drilling consumers and taking to the limit of what was possible as a private company. Then we went public in 2005 and entered Chapter three, a period anchored in the idea of getting big fast and rapidly expanding our business to gain scale, scale and innovation, product, sport categories and global footprint ultimately scale to be able to compete.","We hit $1 billion in 2010, which kicked off a 6.5-year run of greater than 20% plus quarterly growth getting us to nearly $5 billion by the end of 2016, a run that certainly met our strategic objective. Along the way, we\u2019ve built the world\u2019s third largest athletic brand, a performance brand, created with an underdog, fighting DNA. While the scrappy never went away, the fight has never been stronger. And while we sit here today writing the early pages of Chapter four evolving to become a truly operationally excellent business. We are proud of the speed to size we\u2019re able to achieve.","Yet for as much as this rapid growth, realize amazing milestones, stories and accomplishments, we are now dealing with issues related to that growth. In the past few years, while we delivered industry-leading innovation, built an amazing roster of athletes and assets, accelerated our footwear business, expanded DTC in our wholesale distribution, while gaining traction in our International business, our operations have become increasingly more complex.","So with three chapters behind us, here\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about 2018 and beyond. Right now, we\u2019re sitting squarely at the intersection of two concurrent events. The first is an uneven macro environment highlighted by geographic variance, retail disruption, competitive undercurrents and changing consumer preferences. For Under Armour, this is played out in a binary manner geographically.","Our International business by every cut continues to exceed our expectations strategically and financially. However, our North American business predominately on the wholesale side has gotten progressively tougher since the fourth quarter of last year amid a greater retail landscape that remains pinned in a multi-year struggle to evolve past its legacy architecture.","A confluence of events that have occurred in the North American athletic sector, including bankruptcies and store closures, declining productivity, traffic and shifting fashion preferences has contributed to what has now been more than a year long promotional environment.","Strategically, while we try to manage the brand as best as possible in this environment, the pace of sector-wide inventory work through has sustained at a much slower pace than we anticipated. This continues to contribute to lower demand and consequently contracting wholesale revenue for our business.","As we look to close out 2017, we do not expect these conditions to improve. And although too early for us to provide an outlook for fiscal 2018, our initial assumptions anticipate continued strength across our International and DTC businesses, contrasting with a difficult environment in our North American wholesale business well into next year. Appropriately, we are assessing our distribution model within this key market and working to identify opportunities to optimize our strategic wholesale partnerships along with our own DTC business during this transformation.","Independent of macro challenges in North America, the second side of the intersection are the growing pains that came as a result of such rapid expansion. As detailed on previous calls, we\u2019re well underway with a strategic transformation designed to simplify our go-to-market, correct our inefficiencies and take advantage of the scale and infrastructure we\u2019ve built to better serve our consumers.","In the midst of standing up our category management structure this year that includes distinct leaders, strategies and teams. We\u2019re ensuring that our product and story connects with the consumer, fulfilling the promise of what they expect from a brand like Under Armour.","By building a stronger ecosystem with consumer at the center of a disciplined go-to-market strategy, we\u2019re in the process of improving our ability to drive better consistency, consistency with respect to product, demand creation and the ultimate goal of creating a more predictable pull model capable of delivering financial flexibility to drive back into the business, while delivering value to shareholders.","Again, we are incredibly disappointed with our 2017 performance. Yet given the uneven choppy environment in North America as a $5 billion company with the scale, resources and conviction to get through it, we know who we are, how we got here and our confident in our path forward.","Our eyes are wide open and we\u2019re well invested in the strategies that will leverage our strength to emerge stronger, faster and leaner, but this will take sometime. In 2017 and 2018, as we work to reset and strengthen our underlying business, we have three main goals: operate, fuel and innovate. As we define the issue in our business right now, we see two contributing factors, tough conditions in our largest market and complexities as a result of rapid growth.","To address this issue, we must operate a better company, from design, sourcing, process and planning, the speed-to-market, consumer connectivity and innovation, we already have multiple strategies in play to right-size and amplify the business throughout our portfolio.","Walking hand-in-hand with this is the need to address our cost infrastructure, which is built for a much larger company than we currently are. In light of this, we have a restructuring plan in place and continue to dig deep into all areas of our business with an eye toward creating underlying operational leverage. The difficult aspect is that, a large part of our cost structure is committed from our asset build over the last few years. So lower top line expectations will moderate short-term leverage.","That said, we are working to engineer multiple levers across our P&L by optimizing our supply chain, employing pricing volume strategies, prioritizing and deemphasizing investments based on ROI and utilizing more efficient global operating models to create better flexibility for the long-term. Flexibility is critical to driving and funding the virtuous cycle of invest to grow and grow to invest and ultimately, what will fuel this brand.","Essential to fueling the brand is innovation, making the best product possible and storytelling through demand creation, amplifying our message of making you better, it\u2019s the reason that we exist. Every product deserving of a UA logo should perform for the athlete for our consumers. It should make them better whether it makes them faster and stronger through efficient cushioning, temperature management or architecture, or the style, design and finish that powers a creative expression of one\u2019s unique personality, Under Armor must make you better.","With products like Threadborne Fleece, seamless and ColdGear Reactor, along with footwear like Curry 4, the Patriot and a brand-new cushioning platform known as HOVR, which Patrik will detail in just a bit. We\u2019re fulfilling that promise and look forward to amplifying it even greater in 2018 and beyond.","Of course, innovation is about much more than product, it\u2019s native through our DNA, and what we believe to be the reason we\u2019ll become a better company. We will run a better business by innovating our way through this, innovative product, storytelling, speed-to-market, supply chain, merchandising, customer relationships, all becoming sharper. This means, putting the consumer at the center of everything we do and what Patrik is driving with our new go-to-market strategy.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrik, a leader that in short order has bought an incredible amount of perspective, process and professionalism to this transformation. He, Dave and I are partying together with full transparency and result to impact both short and long-term strategies to increase our ability to drive more profitable long-term growth. Patrik?","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Kevin. In the past four months, I have traveled to Europe, Central America, Canada and all around the United States, meeting with many of our top retail accounts, manufacturing partners and the Under Armor team, and even working the floor in our own stores engaging with consumers.","Following strategic deep dives in the areas I have direct responsibility for strategy, supply chain, product, marketing and sales, we have absolute clarity around the challenging impacting the company. The related root causes and the steps necessary to address them. It\u2019s a new time and a new time requires a new playbook. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here. And what I see here is an incredible team, a team that\u2019s used to winning. And I also see an incredible brand, a brand that is winning, but one that is not fully optimizing its strength or potential.","Today, I\u2019ll detail some initial observations and put context around our strengths and opportunities. As Kevin mentioned, we have numerous work streams in place to address our current challenges and structural complexities. Our year-end call in mid-February will provide even more detail on our plans and we\u2019re working toward a comprehensive Investor Day next year.","To build on the operate fuel innovate construct, let\u2019s start with innovation and the importance of making great product, because our success must start and end with making great product that lights consumers, distinct, authentic, and unbelievably high-quality product, it\u2019s our reason for existing. Blending high-performance innovation with function and style has been and will continue to be at the core of who we are. Under Armor is a performance brand.","Looking back over the last few years, we\u2019ve been inconsistent with this promise, that inconsistency stops now. Going forward, you\u2019ll see us accelerate our purpose as a performance brand by doubling down on innovation and creating even deeper connections with our consumers, underscoring how Under Armour makes you better. That\u2019s not to say, there\u2019s a pause in our current pipeline though.","So now I\u2019d like to take a few moments to review some highlights for the rest of this year and into early 2018. Starting with apparel, our focus on investment around staying lighter longer has resulted in a more diversified, less key item focused assortment. New silhouettes, styles and expanded offerings in key technology platforms like Threadborne and Reactor combined with our growing sportstyle product continues to show solid demand.","With our Threadborne platform from lightweight highly breathable T-shirts in warmer conditions to our fleece, seamless, and ColdGear Reactor collections for cold weather, our execution has never been sharper. This is an early, but good example of becoming consumer led, listening to their needs and delivering a layering solution that doesn\u2019t sacrifice function for style.","While we remain focused on continuing to lead with our performance positioning, another category showing strong traction is our sportstyle product. And although not yet approaching meaningful scale, these products along with early reads in our Unstoppable collection gives us confidence that we\u2019re taking the right steps towards creating balance and our performance sportstyle offering to better align with ongoing trends.","Switching to footwear, our year-to-date performance has fallen short of our expectations with results being negatively impacted due to lower demand in our North American business, especially the sports specialty channel and the continued overhang in basketball. Accordingly, we are working diligently to proactively fine tune our footwear playbook and ensure we deliver the right innovation, style and price to value equation at the right place and at the right time.","To touch on a few highlights, we launched the Curry 4 Basketball shoe earlier this month, first in China and then around the world versus its predecessor, the Curry 4, used a much more direct design process taking steps to vision and ideas and bring them to life through elevated design and functionality. We\u2019ve also revamped our flow and scarcity model in a very different approach than past versions. Less than a month in, the response has been incredibly positive from consumers, retailers, influencers and media.","Moving to our largest footwear category and biggest long-term growth opportunity running, we remain focused on delivering innovation, innovation in manufacturing and innovation in functionality and performance. Starting with manufacturing, we\u2019re excited to announce our limited release, UA Charge Patriot footwear in November.","The Patriot is the first footwear to come to market from investments in our advanced manufacturing Lighthouse center right here in Baltimore. Available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles, it\u2019s an important step in driving design and innovation closer to market with every shoe assembled here in the United States. And very exciting for us is the spring 2018 launch of our new cushioning platform called HOVR, that\u2019s HOVR.","The new HOVR cushioning system features the rare combination of superior energy return and impact absorption. They wrapped the HOVR cushioning in Under Armour\u2019s energy web technology to control and direct energy right back to the runner stride. The goal here was to give runners a zero gravity feel and that\u2019s exactly what HOVR accomplishes.","This new platform becomes our third distinct cushioning technology along with Micro G and Charged and further demonstrates our commitment to running as one of our largest growth opportunities. And the technology in these shoes is not only limited to cushioning.","Our first shoe using HOVR also features our next generation embedded connected sensor that tracks distance, cadence, pace and shoe life. This ties into our overall Connected Fitness strategy connecting runners to our global community through our run apps. The HOVR launch demonstrates the first true manifestation of digital, meaning physical, providing runners with advantages that make them better, smarter and capable of more than they ever knew possible.","Our Connected Fitness strategy stretches beyond connected shoes with an ecosystem of nutrition, sleep, activity and fitness. With more than 220 million registered users and growing, we continue to lead in digital health and fitness from athlete performance to athletes recovery, driving brand awareness and ultimately selling more shirts and shoes.","Moving to operate, an area where I\u2019ve been spending the majority of my time. This is where I believe I can have the largest impact to establish more consistency and our ability to delight the consumer, strengthen our brand and deliver sustainable profitable growth. In order to drive stronger operational discipline, I\u2019ll break it out into three key areas, structure, process and go-to-market.","From a structure and process perspective strategically and mechanically, I see a company that has in many ways willed itself to get to where we are today. Our approach has certainly been successful in many fronts, but inefficient in others. While we stand up our category management structure, we\u2019re making real-time course corrections to improve our speed, efficiency and quite frankly, our profitability.","In this effort, we\u2019re in the weeds, working to create dramatically better synergy between how design, supply chain and our segmentation approach is supported by our merchandising, demand creation and distribution structure. Within our quickly evolving matrix organization, it\u2019s just about that organization.","From standardizing everyday procedures like planning, business reviews and the use of data and analytics to establishing a team, capable of making business and brand right decisions quickly, we\u2019re optimizing our ability to commercialize and make our business stronger and faster.","We\u2019re also executing on our restructuring plan to narrow our focus and shift our privatization into areas with the highest opportunity for growth and profitable returns. And we have implemented systems upgrades, including the July 1st launch of our integrated ERP Business Solution. This includes our point-of-sale, warehouse management, inventory control, merchandising and product allocation systems in both North America and Europe.","And while these enhancements are designed to enable us to more effectively and efficiently operate our business and ultimately enhance productivity for the long-term, the implementation caused disruption in our supply chain operations during the quarter. This led to delayed shipments and loss of productivity, which negatively impacted our third quarter results.","During this system migration, we have encountered a number of change management issues impacting our workforce and manufacturing partners as they adapt to the new platform and processes.","That said, while this is a key factor impacting our fourth quarter and full-year outlook, we\u2019re seeing improvements to our service levels and expect them to begin to normalize through the balance of the year. And finally, we\u2019re managing our brand to the marketplace by adjusting our inventory strategy to work toward a position, where we can better protect the brand and drive healthy growth in our direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels.","In total, once the structure is set and the processes in place, that becomes the core of our go-to-market and GTM strategy. This end-to-end approach then becomes repeatable ensuring a more consistent and predictable outcome. Crucial to a successful GTM strategy is consumer insights, an area that we see as a tremendous opportunity to both strengthen and elevate.","In this respect, we\u2019ve begun to work on a consumer segmentation study, targeting more than 20,000 people from around the world, coupled with tens of millions of active users in our Connected Fitness community. The combination of this rich data set will help to more clearly define our global consumer target.","Defining our consumer will further enhance our ability to maximize our GTM strategy from product design, development and manufacturing to marketing, segmentation and merchandising. At the end of the day, addressing our structure process and go-to-market opportunities is an engineering undertaking that becomes an incredibly powerful tool as we look to reduce the friction in our current 18 to 20-month product calendar down to about 12 months.","When well done efficiently and repeatedly, it yields flexibility, flexibility for choices and strategies to fuel this brand and to \u2013 and our ability to engage, maintain and grow our consumer base. And on the macro level, what\u2019s happening right now is a change in the consumer, how the consumer chooses to engage with our brand and how they choose to shop our brand. Achieving our growth potential means, we need to continue to fuel the brand to maximize our connection with consumers.","We have one of the most unique brand communities on the planet, the relationship we cherish and never take for granted. As consumer behavior shifts, we must ensure that we are delivering compelling, creative and inspiring content as quickly as they are moving. The speed and relevancy at which we can promote our brand ethos through our storytelling is critical to our success and ensures a seat at the table and consumer\u2019s intent to buy. Category management, digital and obsessing the details of product will enable Under Armour to continue to deepen and strengthen our connection with the consumer, while we continue to delight and inspire them in new ways they have never experienced before.","Before handing it over to Dave, I will close by saying that in 2017 and 2018, we are slowing down to speed up. What does that mean? It means that independent of the macro factors compounding the outlook for our North American wholesale business, we are simultaneously reengineering our foundation, sharpening the organization and learning what it means to operate as a big company.","Based on my 30 years in this industry, I\u2019m resolute and optimistic about the opportunity for Under Armour. Within use we\u2019re delivering today, it might sound a little bit out of sync. But I assure you, we are clear headed and well aware of the issues at hand and a tremendous amount of work ahead of us. Nearly a year into what we believe will be a two-year journey, the strength of this global team are accelerating global scale and share willingness to evolve and become a better company is undeniably confidence inspiring. Dave?","David Bergman","Thanks, Patrik. Before we get into our results and updated outlook for 2017, I\u2019d like to provide some more context around the restructuring plan and the one-time items that impacted our quarter. In the restructuring plan announced on August 1, the company detailed expectations that we\u2019d incur total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $110 million to $130 million.","In the third quarter, we recognized $89 million of these charges, which includes $29 million of goodwill impairment related to our Connected Fitness business. The goodwill impairment, which was not included in the originally estimated range was a result of the reduction of expected future cash flows for the Connected Fitness business due to a decision to deemphasize certain ancillary revenue streams, including connected hardware and related web and mobile app development. Including this goodwill impairment charge, we now expect to incur approximately $140 million to $150 million of total charges, with substantially all occurring in fiscal 2017.","However, we are continuing to dig in and we may uncover additional opportunities that could be realized in 2018. With respect to anticipated savings and what that means for run rates moving forward, because we are executing real-time against this plan, we are not currently prepared to share that information. We anticipate providing greater color on our year-end call in mid-February.","Moving to our third quarter, revenue was down 5% to $1.4 billion. As noted in our call today, the operational challenges we faced from our ERP system implementation and related service levels, along with lower North American demand negatively impacted our third quarter results.","Clicking down further into revenue, let\u2019s start with product type. Apparel revenue decreased 8% to $940 million as growth in Golf and sportstyle products was more than offset by declines in our outdoor women\u2019s training and youth categories. Revenue for our footwear business was up 2% to $285 million as strength in running and outdoor was tempered by declines in basketball and youth. Accessories revenue was up 1% to $123 million in the quarter, driven by strength in golf and men\u2019s training tempered by a decline in outdoor.","Looking at revenue by channel, our wholesale business was down 13% to $880 million, reflecting operational challenges in the quarter, as well as lower demand in our North American business, particularly within the sports specialty channel. Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 15% to $468 million with growth in both our retail and e-commerce businesses around the world. DTC in total was 33% of global revenue in the quarter. Our licensing business grew 16% to $34 million, primarily driven by new and expanded licensing relationships within North America.","By region, revenue in our largest market North America was down 12% to $1.1 billion as continued promotional conditions lower overall demand and operational challenges meaningfully impacted results. Outside North America, our international business continued to deliver strong results posted a 35% increase in revenue to reach $305 million or 22% of total revenue in the third quarter. On a currency neutral basis international revenue was up 34%.","Clicking down into the international regions, EMEA revenue was up 22%, driven by balanced growth across our wholesale and DTC channels. We continue to expand our global presence through new market entries like Russia, while also driving increased presence in key markets like the UK and Germany. Revenue in Asia-Pacific increased 52%, driven by continued strength in China, Australia and Korea as we see the UA brand resonate well with consumers across key categories like running, training and basketball.","Our Latin American business was up 33% led by balanced growth in our DTC and wholesale channels across the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and Chile. And finally, our Connected Fitness business was up 16%, driven primarily by new partner relationships.","Turning to gross margin, we saw 160 basis point decline 45.9% in the third quarter. Excluding the restructuring, which contained about 30 basis points of inventory impact, adjusted gross margin was down 130 basis points to 46.2%.","Clicking down into the components of the decline, the negative drivers included approximately 100 basis points from continued actions to manage our North American inventory, including pricing and higher composition of third-party off-price sales, 50 basis points from higher airfreight expenses and 50 basis points of regional mix headwinds due to challenged results in our North American business in contrast to the continued strong growth of our international business. These pressures were partially offset by approximately 50 basis points of product costing improvements and 20 basis points of tailwind from changes in foreign currency.","SG&A expense was flat compared to the prior year, it was better than planned due primarily to expense management efforts, lower incentive compensation expense, and timing shifts in demand creation in other expenses to the fourth quarter.","Third quarter operating income was $62 million. Excluding the restructuring, adjusted operating income was $151 million. Interest and other expense was $11 million. Our tax rate was negative 5% in the quarter, compared to 33% last year, primarily due to challenge results in the North American business resulting in a higher mix of international pre-tax income, as well as impacts from the restructuring.","Excluding the restructuring, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29%. Taking all of this to the bottom line, net income was $54 million, or $0.12 in diluted earnings per share for the quarter. Excluding restructuring, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were $100 million and $0.22, respectively.","Turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were up 43% to $258 million. Inventory was up 22% to $1.2 billion, partially resulting from operational challenges from our ERP system implementation and related service levels, which delayed some shipments into the fourth quarter. Total debt was down 1% to $1.1 billion, and finally, capital expenditures were down 28% to $52 million.","As we look to close out the year, we now expect full-year 2017 revenue to be up at a low single-digit percentage rate, reflecting lower demand in our North American business along with residual impacts from the operational challenges experienced in the third quarter. Clearly, this is a much different profile from the fourth quarter and full-year than we discussed 90 days ago.","On that call, we outlined several key factors we thought would come to fruition. And while still relevant, demand and operational challenges in North America significantly altered the terrain. To reconcile these factors, I\u2019ll walk through them again.","From a distribution perspective, although new North American distribution is exceeding our original expectations, it\u2019s not enough to offset lower than planned wholesale demand, particularly in the sports specialty channel. Internationally, we continue to execute against our strategy seeing strong growth in all regions and channels.","With respect to product, while we believe our pricing, segmentation and assortment strategies have put us in a better position to compete in this highly promotional environment, demand and service level challenges are expected to negatively impact the balance of the year.","And finally, in DTC, continued traffic pressure and a greater promotional environment mostly in North America caused us to temper our expectations in this channel. Although we typically don\u2019t provide further breakout to our revenue, given the magnitude of changes, we thought additional color would be helpful. Thus, for the full-year, we now expect North America revenue to be down at a high single-digit rate and our International business to be up 350%.","Apparel and footwear revenue are both expected to grow at a low single-digit rate. DTC revenue should be up at a high single-digit rate, in contrast to our wholesale business, which we\u2019re expecting to be down at a low single-digit rate globally.","Moving to gross margin, due to increased pricing and other actions to manage our inventory, including higher airfreight, along with the higher expected mix of sales coming from our International business, which carries lower margin than the overall company and the impact of our restructuring activities, we expect our gross margin to be down approximately 220 basis points in 2017.","Excluding the impacts of the restructuring plan, full-year adjusted gross margin is expected to be down approximately 190 basis points. Given our revised top line outlook, we now expect our reported full-year operating income to be approximately $0 million to $10 million in 2017. Excluding the restructuring, adjusted operating income should reach $140 million to $150 million.","Interest expense and other expense combined is now expected to approximate $35 million for the full-year. Excluding certain tax-related effects in the restructuring plan, we expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.","Our updated adjusted effective tax rate projection is lower than previously planned, due to our challenging North American results, coupled with continued strong profitability within our International businesses, thereby driving a favorable international mix to our pre-tax income.","Taking this to the bottom line, excluding the impacts of the restructuring, we expect full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.18 to $0.20. And finally, we expect full-year CapEx to be approximately $300 million, down from the $350 million we cited in August, as we prioritized spend against the current environment.","To close, in the short-term, we are disappointed, we\u2019re not delivering to the level we said we would. As we finish 2017 and continue to work through challenges in our North American business in 2018, the same result that got us this far is becoming even sharper, more efficient and more effective. With a long-term goal of creating a more profitable and predictable trajectory, we\u2019re confident in our ability to create the fuel necessary to emerge a stronger and better company for consumers, customers and shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp of Baird. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. Hi, thank you. Kevin, want to dig in a little bit more on the North America backdrop and especially wholesale, which has gotten progressively tougher. I know you highlighted three different areas, bankruptcies, declining productivity, shifting fashion preferences as the sources of pressure externally. And I\u2019m just curious, in the past, it seems like the brand has been strong enough to stand on its own and perform, while despite whatever is going on in the environment. Clearly, the pressures are more intense now. But I\u2019m just curious if you could kind of give more detail on why you think it\u2019s more impactful now, and just broadly, the overall health of the brand as you see it today?","Kevin Plank","Yes, let me begin with North America and I\u2019ll get Patrik actually weigh on this, and so we\u2019ll get full perspective. Let me just say, again, in my own words just how disappointed that we are in the 2017 results. And you\u2019re right, I think, the brand has always been able to stand on its own two legs.","And hopefully, that still comes across today, we\u2019re just doing it as a much larger organization that\u2019s going through a shift. And I think, as we\u2019ve demonstrated throughout our 12-year history as a public company what we\u2019re telling you today is exactly how we ever expect to deliver for the market, our shareholders for our business.","So today that we are using 2017 as a bit of a to reset, it\u2019s a reset for our business and our brand as we look to get and run and operate as a bigger company. We\u2019ve been evolving our structure throughout 2017. We\u2019ve talked about the things we\u2019ve done is that hopefully which you feel is that, we\u2019ve been making decisions and being proactive throughout really the balance of this year from since the beginning of this year from standing up our new category management, which gets us closer to the consumer, the restructuring that we went through this year implementing our new system.","So we\u2019ve placed a lot of pain sort of on to ourselves, and none of it was meant to be self-inflicted, it was all meant to be thinking about the business that we\u2019re going to be. And so from a brand health standpoint, number one is that, we have great confidence. I think in the company that we are and the consumer that has a relationship with our brand that we have a relationship as well. But there\u2019s several things that are going on right now. So maybe just dig into the map, I can let Patrik talk about some of the contributing factors that led to that.","Patrik Frisk","Yes, I think \u2013 thanks, Jon. I think, Jonathan, we have a couple of different things going on. We look at it really from an internal and an external perspective. We certainly have seen some effects of the \u2013 what Dave talked about as well, the ERP implementation and how we dealt with that internally and how it actually affected our service levels. We\u2019ve also not been spending against the brand to the extent that we think we should have in 2017, as the environment has become more challenging.","So there\u2019s a couple of internal things that we believe has not helped drive the brand. And that from an external perspective, we mentioned the bankruptcies before, but there\u2019s also a lot of traffic pressure. The promotions in the environment currently are still ramp and we believe they\u2019re going to continue throughout the remainder of this year. And that creating a lower demand in general is, because we haven\u2019t done as good of a job as we believe we could have, it\u2019s also hurting the brand at this point in time.","So I would really, for us, look at this is kind of a perfect storm at the moment, both internal and external factors hitting us really hard in Q3, and it\u2019s going to remain affecting us in Q4 unfortunately.","Kevin Plank","And if I can finish with that, too, as you know, we want to be clear that we\u2019ve certainly got some places where we\u2019ve got significant challenges, particularly in our North American wholesale business that represents about 50% of what we do with specialty sporting goods. But we also have a lot of places \u2013 several places where we\u2019re doing really well and we want to make sure that that is highlighted, that there is a consumer that is out there looking for our brand, but some of things we\u2019ve seen from the shifting consumer preferences, performance which represents 90% of what we do as a business, you are obviously seeing that shift to lifestyle, so we\u2019re answering that move and I think we\u2019re there, but when you look at sort of the big movers, when we talk about opportunity for this company, it comes down to footwear, international and our women\u2019s business. And obviously our international business is kicking really well for us, but footwear and women\u2019s is a place where we feel like we can be and do a much better job.","The last thing that I\u2019ll say Jonathan is that, as difficult it is to give you the news on this call, we have a really clear line of sight, I think we have a really deep understanding of who our consumer is, with what we are doing with the leadership in place, the structure and the strategy that we\u2019re putting forward as well. We feel that we\u2019re fortunate to be going through an instance like this as a $5 billion brand has the ability to absorb and more importantly drive forward and so we\u2019re incredibly focused on the future and we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s ready to run and march forward. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color towards how the way we are thinking about North America right now.","Jonathan Komp","Yes, it does, thank you. And just a follow-up on the last point and really tying the broader outlook, partly relates to 2018, but more broadly. I know on this year you are on pace to be a low single-digit operating margin business. As you think about that normalizing to something higher over time, I\u2019m just curious are there enough levers in terms of the operating efficiencies you are starting to see, the more normalized pricing environment that you think you can get to a more normalized margin or is there a sense that you need to maybe shrink the revenue base that it is today and then grow from a more profitable base, I\u2019m just curious to hear how you are thinking about that dynamic?","David Bergman","Jonathan, this is Dave, it\u2019s great, great question. Obviously as we look across North America and look at the wholesale side, we\u2019re going to continue to look at our distribution and prioritize how we work with our accounts, but relative to going forward in operating margins and efficiencies, we\u2019re not at this point going to be sharing information on 2018, we love to do that in the February call, but obviously as I mentioned in my script, we are digging deep in the cost structure and we\u2019re going to continue to look at opportunities everywhere we can. So we\u2019re going to keep driving forward to make sure that we can look for long-term sustainable profitable growth that\u2019s my mission and we\u2019ll give more color on that in the mid February call.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Konik of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Randy Konik","Yes, thanks a lot. I want to have a two-part question, first I want to just dig into apparel and after the response can I just go into footwear. I guess Kevin, on apparel, if you think about your Golf business and then everything else ex-Golf, your Golf business has done very well on its own in terms of the product that\u2019s out there, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 there is \u2013 it\u2019s immune to promotions by others, it just \u2013 really just performs very well.","So, when you think about how your Golf business is performing and then you kind of think about everything else, and you said the words, there\u2019s two things going on there, so promotions going on in the environment and then there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s sounds fashion shifts more towards lifestyle. If you were to assess what\u2019s impacting more the business ex-Golf, do you think it\u2019s more promotional related or is it really more shift in preference towards the lifestyle offerings and in that regard, do you believe that \u2013 how you think about changing pricing architecture or assortment architecture going into 2018 and 2019, that\u2019s my first question.","Kevin Plank","Yes, thank you. I think there is a lot of things that come into play is, number one, you\u2019re right, our Golf business is doing really well, maybe it starts to top with externally, you know we\u2019ve got a representative like Jordan Spieth out there that makes it easy for people to see Under Armour as an authentic Golf brand. And the trend line there is, it\u2019s incredibly basic, look, it\u2019s about pants, polo shirts and quarter-zips. And so I think what you can learn to expect from us is that, we\u2019ll continue to be pushing the narrative of how we are going to be driving categories we\u2019re already doing and having finding success like golf.","What we see though is that where our in-line product that we\u2019ve seen across the brand and we just think about what\u2019s the positioning of the consumer preference of the kids today. How do we speak to them? Because a generation of kids have grown up in love with this brand, seeing us as their authentic on-field, on-court, on-pitch brand.","And as we have watched them grow up, they actually \u2013 they\u2019ve continued to evolve and so what we need to do and what you\u2019ve seen us really take action beginning going back to the fourth quarter of last year as we started seeing some of the softness, especially with the heightened promotional environment is that shift of preference away from performance that really went to lifestyle.","The kids still wants performance, I mean they still want us on field, they\u2019re designing additional wearing occasions and we believe that our authenticity and our credibility that we have as a performance brand, it gives us license to make categories in other places. Meaning every owner of our product does something, that something is really special and important for us and that the consumer continues to come back to us for that reason.","But I believe that you\u2019ll continue to see our lines move, Patrik talked about the speed at which we can move our supply chain and when you\u2019re in a 18 to 22 months supply chain, it\u2019s very difficult to be able to impact. We\u2019re 12 or 15 months in the decisions that we\u2019ve made of moving with this market and we seem these things come, it just takes us a little bit more time, but I think you\u2019re starting to see it in the fourth quarter for sets. I think you are starting to see it in some of the layering that we\u2019re putting out in the marketplace and the way that we\u2019re addressing style across men\u2019s, women\u2019s and youth.","And so we\u2019re certainly not standing still taking these blows and saying, we accept this at any level, this is a proactive move forward brand and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with our merchandizing right now, so Golf is a \u2013 it\u2019s a great highlight for us, but it\u2019s about us really winning in men\u2019s and women\u2019s training is where we\u2019re really focused on having product that\u2019s trend-right, style-right, fit-right, color-right et cetera and being there in the right place at the right time at the right price.","And so I feel that all those things reconciling, it\u2019s a really promotional environment, it\u2019s basically where we are right now which is why we\u2019re giving you the sort of the look that we\u2019re giving in the Q4 is just making sure that we\u2019re contemplating everything, but we feel good about the plan we have in place and how we\u2019re coming back strong through the balance of 2017 and through 2018 as well.","Randy Konik","And just to clarify, do you feel that from an apparel standpoint more changes are going to be made on the product architecture rather than the pricing architecture of that apparel? And then separately on footwear, you\u2019ve done \u2013 you\u2019ve gotten very high remarks on the Curry 4 from an aesthetic look perspective, so what are the learnings from that Curry 4 product line that we could potentially anticipate being put forth in the traditional running categories et cetera on the footwear side?","Kevin Plank","Yes, when I look at 2017, I don\u2019t think that we were frankly differentiated enough for our consumer and so in no way, shape or form do we anticipate changing the pricing model that makes Under Armour special and unique is that \u2013 we invented the $25 T-shirt, we\u2019ve pressed the balance as to what consumers will pay for apparel of thinking about it as a piece of equipment and so that\u2019ll continue as that no one is looking for Under Armour to have the $25 hooded fleece, they want Under Armour at the $75 and $100 price point.","And so we\u2019ll continue to push and to drive there from an innovation standpoint, but you\u2019ve seen us get caught and so we\u2019ve been more promotional this year reacting to a broader market and so to ensure that we\u2019ve got a differentiated product and again with a price-to-value relationship of that product is something which is \u2013 it just got to carry. We catch and stick a logo on it and expect the consumer to buy it because they like the logo, so you won\u2019t see that happen from us, it\u2019s always been in the DNA of our brand and they\u2019ll continue to be going forward.","As far as footwear goes, we\u2019ve got a tremendous opportunity with a franchise like Curry. One thing I think it\u2019s important to put in perspective is just the sheer scale of our footwear business which is over $1 billion. And so when you have these marquee franchises like Curry, like what Patrik spoke to as well about our new HOVR midsole cushioning technology that\u2019s coming out in the spring as well, how that connects into our Connected Fitness of truly driving differentiation. You know you look for the spikes of these really high super aspirational products that will position to consume \u2013 to sell a lot of product that is more in the wheelhouse of where we can push.","We\u2019ve talked in the past about \u2013 I think we probably were a little braggish about things like the number of styles that we\u2019re selling over $100. And the fact is, when you look at some of our key distribution, from our mainline sporting goods is they are selling footwear at $90 and so we\u2019ve done \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done the best job of being in position with the price-to-value of where we sell and how we sell and identifying that consumer, which goes back to understanding our consumer being consumer led at the center of everything we do. At the same time you\u2019re right, we have some incredibly bright spots.","The Curry 4 is something we\u2019ve applied the lessons from Curry 1, 2 and 3, and we put them in a Curry 4. And so we\u2019re seeing incredible demand. You\u2019re seeing sellout type of approach on the products. And frankly, we\u2019ve applied that going forward in the Curry 4, the 5 and 6 upcoming 2.","So this is the long-term strategy one that positions really well in basketball, but more importantly, I think, it helps position our overall footwear franchise that we have as being and identifying ourselves as a footwear brand. So with only 20% of our business being footwear today where it\u2019s more than 50% for our chief competitors, we see a massive runway of opportunity for us there.","Randy Konik","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Edward Yruma","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, two parts. First, on U.S. wholesale, obviously, some challenges and made especially sport stores put some strength in your new doors. I just set back how do you think about overall door count? Are there places where you think you could exit? And then on the direct front, from a store comp perspective, should we expect to see you slim that out? And then finally, on ERP, how long will it take to get mitigation kind of in place? Thanks.","David Bergman","Yes, this is Dave. I\u2019ll just jump in a real quick. Relative to doors, as far as our own doors, we\u2019ve really been adding more in China than anywhere else and a lot of those are going to be partnered doors. So we\u2019re probably going to be adding about 300 doors this year in total globally, and we should be ending the year closer to 900. And again, most of those are are going to be the partnered doors that we have in China.","But relative to the SAP implementation, what was your specific question around that?","Edward Yruma","Well, just how long until you can kind of get service levels back to an acceptable level?","David Bergman","Okay. So, the SAP implementation, I think, as we look at that, there\u2019s a couple different pieces to it that we\u2019ve been working through. I think, one of the aspects was the change management, that\u2019s been a little bit tougher than we expected, including working even with our inventory partners, our vendors, trying to get them up and trained on the system as well and just getting all the things in place.","So right now that \u2013 the system is operating well, it\u2019s stable. But the change management in the learnings and the reporting is what we\u2019re still working through here. So, we expect that in Q4, we won\u2019t have the same level of impact that we had in Q3, but they won\u2019t be completely gone yet. We\u2019ll continue to work through it, and they continue to fine tune as we move into 2018.","Kevin Plank","Yes, and maybe I can add some color on the wholesale there as well in terms of number of doors in our distribution. We\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at right now, and we will not be adding any additional distribution in our wholesale channels going forward the way we look at it at this point in time. But again, as the environment continues to change out there, we\u2019re going to continue, of course, to evaluate where the brand is going to show up in the future, but there are no plans at this point in time to expand any distribution further.","Edward Yruma","Great. Thanks so much.","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan of Cowen. Your line is now open.","John Kernan","Good morning, guy. Thanks for taking my question.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, John.","John Kernan","Kevin, could you talk about how comfortable you are with the inventory of 22%, given where the U.S. wholesale trends are running, and where that inventory is located by category and geography? Thank you.","David Bergman","Yes. John, this is Dave, I\u2019ll take that one. I mean, relative to our inventory, it is a little bit larger than we would like it to be in Q3. Some of that was the impact of the service levels and the implementation challenges that shifted some things out to Q4, that was probably 2 to 4 percentage points of growth there. And when you look at the inventory between North America and our international markets, the international inventory growth rates are significantly higher as we\u2019re expecting a very large Q4 revenue for international.","So the inventory growth rates in North America are definitely small. We\u2019re continuing to manage that down. I also want to just remind you that, 9 days back we talked about how we would be carrying over some core styles internally to be able to move through our factory house relative to keeping the wholesale floors and partners a little bit cleaner and bringing in returns a little bit more. So we\u2019re seeing that as well and not a carry through in the year-end as well.","So you will continue to see a little bit elevated inventory levels probably in those low-20% range, as we get to the end of the year as well. And then we\u2019ll be moving through more of that inventory in the front-half of 2018 and working that down as we move forward.","John Kernan","Okay. And then just one final up \u2013 follow-up. The direct-to-consumer guide for high single-digit for the year implies a pretty enormous deceleration in the fourth quarter. Is there anything going on there? Are you closing doors and how does domestic DTC in international DTC play into that guidance? Thank you.","David Bergman","Yes, John, I mean, when you look at Q4, it\u2019s not necessarily around closing doors, it\u2019s more around continuing to kind of watch the environment and wanting to make sure that we\u2019re playing prudently relative to the traffic patterns that we\u2019re seeing both on e-comm and within retail and also our factory house doors.","So, we\u2019re tracking against that everyday, and we\u2019re continuing to try to make the best calls and want to make sure that we\u2019re protecting the brand in the right way and not going too far on discounting relative to the environment. So really it\u2019s more just about the most prudent planning we think for Q4, it\u2019s not really about closing doors.","John Kernan","Okay. And then just one final question. The international sustainability\u2026","Kevin Plank","Coming in and out.","John Kernan","Sorry, guys. Just sustainability of international growth into next year, obviously, that highlighted the whole portfolio at this point. Can you just talk to the sustainability of 20%, 25%-plus top line growth into next year in international? Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Yes, I can take this one. So I\u2019ve had the opportunity to travel around and I\u2019ve been both in Europe and Latin America and also up in Canada over the last four months. And we\u2019ve been digging into understanding the distribution that we currently have and what we\u2019re looking at going forward.","And I think, the components of where the growth is going to come from differs a little bit depending on where you are. We believe we still have a big opportunity in Europe, for example, both in wholesale and direct-to-consumer. As we continue to roll out our e-commerce platforms and opening up more wholesale in Europe, we see a continued opportunity in Asia Pacific to grow in partnership stores and some owned direct-to-consumer, as well as e-commerce as well. And in Latin America, it\u2019s a little bit of a mix, depending on whether you\u2019re in Central America or in South America.","But the fact is that, we only have about a $1 billion of our business in international. And if you compare that to the opportunity that\u2019s out there, we believe we have an enormous runway for international, and we\u2019ll give you guys a lot more color on that as we go into the Investor Day next year, and a lot of work to be done to quantify all of that. But in terms of my experience and what I\u2019ve seen before, that\u2019s currently an enormous opportunity for us, and it\u2019s different depending on where you\u2019re looking in the world.","So, the great thing is, we have the capability and the capacity to expand into that either one of those different distribution channels. And what we\u2019re really spending a lot of time doing now is making sure that we\u2019re also building our category management to be able to segment ourselves into that kind of a structure and also in international, not just here in North America.","John Kernan","Okay, thanks, guys. Best of luck.","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew McClintock","Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Kevin, just to follow-up on some of the comments just the magnitude of the inventory build, as well as the continued promotional environment in North America wholesale, how do you think about launching new innovation into that kind of dynamic? And I guess, more broadly thinking, it doesn\u2019t seem like the North America wholesale environment is going to get much better anytime soon. How are your thoughts of all being using the DTC channel to maybe shift more into where you can control the environment a little bit better? Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Yes, I\u2019ll take that one. So, hi, Matt. I think, when we think about our ability to manage the brand across our distribution channels, Dave highlighted that how we\u2019re going to think about our inventory positions differently thing going forward. We have a lot of different levers to still pull there. One of the things that we\u2019re, of course, also doing as we look into the future is thinking about how we actually plan our business, which I think we could do a little bit better in terms of where we\u2019re building inventory and how we think about our go-to-market strategy.","Ultimately, we believe that by tuning our go-to-market strategy and dropping the innovation into the go-to-market in a commercially ready way at regular intervals, building actually our innovation funneled to be connected to the go-to-market for our commercial business is part of the key and unlock to us being consistent in delivery. And at the same thinking about how we build our inventory through our planning. Those two things in combination, they\u2019re working together.","So when we think about our process here, we think about three components of that process. We think about our innovation process, we think about our go-to-market process, and we think about our S&OP or Sales and Operations Planning Process.","They all three work together and we see opportunity in doing a better job with all three making sure that we\u2019re dropping the right innovation into the commercial funnel at the right time and then planning our business, so that we don\u2019t build as much inventory as we have previously and actually also supporting the innovation in a better way and then ultimately being able to deliver that product and innovation on time to the right place. It\u2019s going to be the job, of course, of our back-end. I see opportunity in all those three and putting it together is, what\u2019s going to ultimately drive a more efficient machine for us.","Matthew McClintock","Thank you very much.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Robert Drbul","Hi, good morning. Two quick questions, I think. The first one is, in the quarter, you called out declines in the youth business, I think, both in footwear and apparel. So I was just wondering, the initiatives in place to recapture growth in that segment, I think, would be appreciated?","The second question is, can you just give us an update on your Amazon business and how that\u2019s been trending for you this year especially? Thanks.","Kevin Plank","Yes. Thanks, Bob. Let me maybe just jump at the top and sort of give an overarching, where we think we are right now from a consumer standpoint. So youth is always a great indication for us and one we\u2019re really excited about the future of youth. We\u2019ve had great indications and we\u2019ve looked forward to some of our lines.","But really where we believe the brand is right now is that, we believe we have a bit of a pool problem. A pool problem for us is just what we\u2019re doing to entice the consumer to ensure that they\u2019re desiring the Under Armour brand. And there\u2019s three ways that we\u2019re thinking about doing that.","And first and foremost, it begins with product, delighting consumers with product that just exceeds our expectations and has them saying wow, 90%-plus of our service have been focused after \u2013 at performance. And as we continue to move ourselves in a sportstyle that\u2019s something that\u2019s not exclusive to just men\u2019s and women\u2019s, but it does go all the way down in the kids.","We\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re going to double down on our performance heritage is something we\u2019re really proud. And frankly, we think it\u2019s what gives us the ability and the capability to sell to this kid and make sure that we remain incredibly compelling to them.","Secondly, a segmentation, particular around something like youth. With our new distribution, I think, that we could have done a better job from segmenting our product lines, but we believe that consumer is very much there for us. Our current composition is something that we feel good about.","As Patrik mentioned about our distribution, we believe we\u2019re in the right doors as we\u2019re talking to this kid. We just can do a much better job of how we show up and the way that we execute that play.","Third and finally is around demand creation. As we said, we\u2019re a pretty quiet brand in 2017, and we\u2019re looking to continue to add that up. As that relates to our youth business and this is much more of a holistic answer just across the brand is that, we\u2019re looking at 2017 as a year that we use and focus on internal growth and deciding for ourselves what we\u2019re going to do to truly be a \u2013 an externally focused company that is talking and telling the story of what this brand is, which is what makes us unique. And the reason for us being is that, every product does something and makes you better. So we are going to make sure that comes true and comes out in every single product that we build.","Amazon Bob?","Robert Drbul","Yes.","Kevin Plank","Yes, sorry, Patrik you want to go ahead?","Patrik Frisk","Yes, I think, we continue to make good progress with Amazon, and I would actually include other pure players in that, too. I\u2019m thinking now about Zalando in our International business, as well as ASOS in the UK and Zappos in North America. So I think, in general, that\u2019s where we see a lot of growth and continued opportunity going forward in our business, of course.","As the consumer decides to move differently in their purchase journey, we want to make sure wherever they decide to shop with the right content and with the right tone of voice. And as you guys know, we\u2019ve been with Amazon for a while now and we believe that it\u2019s part of our distribution footprint. And we continue to make progress in the same way that we\u2019re also making progress in our own e-commerce.","And we\u2019re also very excited about actually the work that we\u2019re doing currently to roll more of our e-commerce out in Europe, where we see great traction for our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business. Hope that helps.","Robert Drbul","Thank you very much. Yes, thank you.","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole","Great. Thank you so much. Kevin, my question is this, yes, it\u2019s been very promotional out there. And Under Armour had just kind of play a part in that. You\u2019ve always talked about how Under Armour has the brand equity to endure. But where do you draw the line, where you just have to say, we have to stop promoting, we can\u2019t participate with what else is going on in the environment, because otherwise we risk doing the long-term damage to our brand that will be a very difficult to recover from. And what we get into say stop, we\u2019re just going to stop promoting and we\u2019re going to start to think about the very long-term future of this brand of the 5 and 10-year long-term gain? Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Yes, thank you, Jay. I think, we\u2019re really saying that right now. I think, that\u2019s a lot about this call in this quarter. The way that we\u2019re looking at our business and our brand thinking about it long-term. You think about through the sort of the streak of growth that our company had, I hate ever thinking that we were sort of caught up or compelled by trying to manage something just for the sake of we did at the quarter before.","We really are thinking long-term and globally. The business is balanced between $1 billion women\u2019s business, $1 billion footwear business, $1 billion International business, so all combined into business that\u2019s still today though is 80% or close to 80% done here in North America. Balance is incredibly important for this business in this brand.","And hopefully, you always get that thought from this for us \u2013 from us about the way that we\u2019re thinking it long-term with the brand. I \u2013 as I said earlier, we\u2019re not thrilled with things like what we\u2019ve delivered from footwear, where we have product that will delight, incredibly excited about our new upcoming HOVR running launch that we\u2019ll have this spring, incredibly excited about the demand driven around Curry. We just see the ability for us to just be better to be better across the organization, to be better across the brand, and that\u2019s what 2017 was really about us doing is focusing on the internal growth to put ourselves in a position for long-term scale, and to be able to exercise across those.","So we\u2019ve never had to pull the pricing lever. You\u2019ve seen with the promotional environment that began in the fourth quarter of last year, that has caught us by a bit of surprise and found us reactive and as that extended with not policies basically going away from the competition, made an incredibly promotional environment.","And so there\u2019s places where we just frankly had to play, we believe that. But long-term, particularly as we look at the relationship of what\u2019s happening with wholesale versus what we\u2019re doing with our own digital, and our ability to really be able to segment that product and differentiate that product as we become a brand that moves beyond A, cold-geared mock or A, heat-geared T-shirt where we have true diversity in our line.","I think, you\u2019ll see us the ability to do that. And so we don\u2019t want to claim \u2013 Under Armour was never intended just to be at a really expensive product that was sort of out of reach was meant to be affordable luxury. But it was also meant to be full price affordable luxury. And so hopefully that comes across in everything that we do, and we don\u2019t expect to see for sale signs on our brand.","2017 has definitely taught us that we need the capability of that stroke when we\u2019re clearing product. But for the most part, we want to be smart, we want to be prudent, and we want to be product that\u2019s been built to sell at full price.","David Bergman","I think it\u2019s also a change in culture internally from being a sell-in to more of a sell-through mentality. In other words, being more of a direct-to-consumer mentality versus just a wholesale mentality. And I think that\u2019s important and Kevin and I both recognized the importance of staying closer to consumer in the current environment, so that means, planning your business. So, that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re really looking at to ensure that we plan into less promotions as we go into 2018 and beyond.","Jay Sole","Okay. Thanks so much.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one to ask. Kevin, you mentioned early in the prepared remarks about kind of reprioritizing and deemphasizing certain investments. I was hoping maybe you could give us some insight into the internal management process for capital allocation and resource allocation, and how that\u2019s evolving from kind of yesterday, today, tomorrow? How you think about making those investments? And maybe some anecdotes about where you\u2019re shifting your investments from and to? Thanks.","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Omar. I\u2019m going to let Dave jump on that one.","David Bergman","Yes, Omar, I mean, we are looking at it from a lot of different angles here. I mean, we\u2019re prioritizing the new CapEx to ensure everything aligns with a long-term strategies. We\u2019ve got a great capital committee that focuses on that. In that, we\u2019re doing some things around. We talked about flowing down North America Brand House builds and tempering some of the North America wholesale fixture buying just keeping really an eye on the market and investing where the best return is going to be.","Also looking at relative to our DTC and office and distribution center expansion space and trying to be as prudent as we can relative to when we need to do any of that, continuing to review our operational structure and how we can simplify and add it better there, continuing to address real estate, looking at store locations, looking at our office space and distribution center space and how we have tight and operational effective there as we possibly can be, continue to dig in on other SG&A, professional service fees, T&Es and all the customary areas there.","So we are kind of looking at that across the board and looking at it much more within ROI lens than we\u2019ve done in the past. But at the same time, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re protecting those areas of long-term growth. So making sure, we\u2019re protecting and prioritizing international expansion, e-commerce development, footwear design development, areas like that, while we continue to dig in deep and kind of right-size the cost structure.","So, there\u2019s a lot of different angles that we\u2019re looking at it right now. But again, trying to making sure that we\u2019re looking at things from an ROI lens and really driving all the way down through to ROIC is what we\u2019re trying to do.","Kevin Plank","And Omar, so we\u2019ve always had, I think, that ROI approach, it\u2019s obviously coming through a different lens, as Dave says. But that\u2019s what the addition of Patrik being here sort of the trinity of Dave and Patrik and myself of really making sure that they were partnered working together that we have a clearly articulated strategy that\u2019s understood by the organization throughout the company and that we\u2019re driving that through and putting money on the things that will get us to return.","So we\u2019ve got a lot of low-hanging fruit. You hear me say sort of anecdotally women\u2019s footwear international, the places that we\u2019ve invested in, we\u2019re there. We just put the right kind of smart spending we can win. So, I\u2019ve used the saying is that, we can do anything. We just can\u2019t do everything that\u2019s ever been \u2013 ever more true. We\u2019re really focused and I think really thinking about through the things that will get us the biggest return.","We don\u2019t need anything else. We don\u2019t need to buy anything else. We have plenty of real estate. We have plenty of assets. We have plenty of categories that we\u2019re in, we just need to focus on becoming excellent everywhere that we do business. And so that\u2019s hopefully one message that comes across in this call is our commitment, our teamwork, the strategy that we have in place and the way that we\u2019re looking at just go run the play in 2018 put this company in firm footing and allow us to storm and march forward and get us back in that growth pattern. Right now, we\u2019re going to be internally a great operationally excellent company.","Omar Saad","Thanks, guys. Thanks for all the detail today.","David Bergman","Thank you, Omar.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Omar.","Kevin Plank","That will conclude our call today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Lance Allega, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.","Lance Allega","Thank you, and good morning everyone joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Under Armour\u2019s second quarter 2019 results. Participants on the call will make forward-looking statements and these statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. To start off our call, I\u2019d like to take a moment to congratulate a number of Under Armour\u2019s family back-to-back World Cup Champion Kelley O'Hara, who along with the entire U.S. team showed the world that passion and a relentless commitment to excellence can achieve greatness, inspiring, energizing and dominant. ","Their accomplishment is an incredible representation of the power of sport and while we love what we do here at Under Armour. In these pinnacle moments, it is sometimes easy to forget about the day-to-day grind of training, competing and recovering. And the absolute physical and mental grip required to consistently operate with excellence, over and over again. That\u2019s exactly what it takes to compete at the highest level. ","In our own journey toward excellence, during this third year of our strategic transformation, the same disciplines apply becoming stronger, faster and smarter and importantly positioning ourselves to be able to deliver consistent profitable results for years to come. Half way through 2019, I am very pleased with the progress we continue to make against our near and long-term objectives. ","We are running our playbook at precisely the right pace, dictating our tempo to ensure we are in command and control holistically and proactively. The numerous operational improvements that we made to eliminate inefficiency and drive standardization across the enterprise are better empowering us to meet our highly discerning consumer when and where they choose to engage Under Armour. ","In products, advanced apparel innovations like Rush and the continued expansion of our Hover footwear cushioning technology is making athletes better and underscoring our position as a premium athletic performance brand of choice. And in the back half of the year, our product offering continues to evolve with tighter, better segmented assortments bolstered by improving return-focused marketing. ","This mirrors our great products reinforced by inspirational story telling is what athletes, retailers and shareholders have to come to expect from Under Armour. And while our product-specific marketing efforts have yielded solid results and demonstrated the power of what is possible, when all the pieces are in alignment, from a brand marketing perspective, we\u2019ve been fairly quiet. ","We have not however been idle internally. Within our transformation in the same spirit of our reengineered go-to-market process, we are working diligently to advance the ecosystem of how we engage and inspire athletes across both physical and digital experiences. And with considerably more science added into the art, we are strengthening the foundation and understanding of our consumers to ensure return-driven, data informed marketing helping us unlock the full power of the Under Armour brand. ","In our landscape our seamless, physical and digital connectivity is table stakes for consumer engagement. We are laser-focused on driving deeper interactions with our athletes at the moments of training, competition and recovery. ","With momentum continuing to build across our suite of apps from connective footwear and coaching tips, to hydration, nutrition and exercise tracking, athletes are getting real-time feedback to help them improve their performances and quality of life. ","Now, switching gears, our supply chain continues on its path of significant improvements as well. With our vendor-based consolidation nearly complete, and customer service levels improving, our ability to meet consumer demand continues to gain better precision and efficiency. ","It\u2019s also exciting to report that following the successful second quarter implementation of SAP in China, the vast majority of our business is now operating on one global ERP system. Inventory management is also an area that we are particularly proud of with a 26% decline in the second quarter representing a reduction of one-third of $1billion in year-over-year levels. ","This metric validates significant and continued progress against our goal to more effectively manage the marketplace for Under Armour does business around the world. ","Finally, from a financial perspective, we are creating greater stability and consistency to deliver against our expectations. With a disciplined approach, distinct operating principles and measured return-based investment starting to come into alignment, our ability to drive long-term shareholder value is getting back on track. All of this, of course drives a healthier, stronger Under Armour brand. ","So to close, a solid first half where we are executing well against our plan to deliver on our expectations for 2019. The work we\u2019ve put in over the past few years to define, prioritize and organize our brand and company is yielding more consistent results throughout our business and giving us increasing conviction in our long-term strategy. ","Moving forward is while continuing to execute the play with patience and discipline, letting the structure methods and tools we\u2019ve architected drive greater capabilities across Under Armour, strategically, operationally, and culturally. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrik who just a few weeks back celebrated his two year anniversary with us. Welcome and congrats, Patrik. ","Patrik Frisk ","Thanks, Kevin. I am incredibly proud of the transformation we\u2019ve accomplished over the past couple of years and the achievements are lengthy from transitioning to a category focus, defining our target consumer and enhancing our regional organization to reengineering our go-to-market process and optimizing our supply chain, we are putting ourselves in the best position possible to realize Under Armour\u2019s full potential. ","Moving forward, it\u2019s all about staying disciplined, focused and methodical working smarter. There is still a lot more work to do and while we are not declaring victory, the stability across the business and the pace at which we are realizing financial and operational improvements continues to validate that our strategy is working. ","As a reminder, this strategy which we laid out at our Investor Day is grounded around five main elements. First, Under Armour is an athletic performance company. It\u2019s our DNA. It\u2019s where we compete and there is no grey area in how we are aligned across our enterprise in this commitment. ","Second is sharpening our consumer-centric approach with the deep body of research, data and analysis completed, we are beginning to activate more holistically across our target consumer known as the focus performer. At the intersection of product grabbing consumers, we see significant opportunity to deepen our connection with Under Armour athletes globally. ","Third is our go-to-market process where five fewer months in our seasonal calendar significantly less SKU styles materials, better managed inventory, less airfreight and higher service levels have begun to show beneficial productivity across our business, especially in our gross margin. ","Fourth is marketplace management which for Under Armour is primarily about two things, inventory and channel optimization. Given our recent track record with inventory management, I believe our results speak for themselves. ","At the center of our channel approach is the emphasis on protecting our premium athletic brand positioning with our wholesale where we remain vigilant around who we partner with, or in our own direct-to-consumer business, we will continue to ensure that consumers get the most premium experience whenever and wherever they engage our brand. ","And finally, it\u2019s driving shareholder value. When all of this works in concert, margin expansion, cost efficiencies, return-focused investments and cash generation, we create optionality for ourselves ensuring our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth to build long-term shareholder value. ","With that, let\u2019s turn back to the quarter and take a look at our regional performance. In North America, revenue was down 3% reflecting declines in both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses. ","To provide a bit more color to each channel, let\u2019s start with wholesale where our strategy to reduce off-price sales on a year-over-year basis is on track, a positive brand right move to be sure but still a negative impact to this region\u2019s revenue growth for the quarter. ","And on another positive note for the balance of the year due to orders in hand and improving service levels, North America\u2019s premium wholesale business is trending slightly healthier than we had originally anticipated. ","In direct-to-consumer, we are expecting softer than anticipated demand as we work to reset the business towards full-price selling within our stores which as a reminder is 90% outlet-based in North America, we are seeing higher conversion and slightly higher AUR which strategic is encouraging, however, it\u2019s not enough volume to offset the store traffic that we are seeing right now. ","In our online business, we are seeing traffic in AUR, but lower conversion, so, all in for North America direct-to-consumer, a bit of a mix bag with challenges to work through and pockets of strength to build on. ","And while this presents challenges to Kevin\u2019s earlier point, we have begun to benefit from the optionality that our strategy is providing us. In this case, the combination of cleaner inventory positions and better service levels along with SG&A efficiencies is helping to provide top and bottom-line mitigation. ","Later in the call, Dave will reiterate that there is no change to the expectation that Under Armour will grow 3% to 4% in 2019, the same outlook we\u2019ve provided on February 12th. Within North America, however stronger wholesale expectations combined with softer direct-to-consumer demand translates to an updated view of the full year where we now expect revenue to be down slightly while admittedly a modest, we believe it accurately reflects the executional success, as well that the challenges we are seeing in this business. ","Turning to our fastest growing region, Asia-Pacific. Revenue was up 23% with growth in wholesales driven by continued expansion in our key partners, as well as sustained momentum in direct-to-consumer business. The story here remains fairly balanced among product and channel. So, overall, we are very pleased with this region\u2019s progress. ","In fact, based on continued strength in the business overall, we now expect revenue to grow at a rate in the low 20s for the full year, up from the previous high-teen expectation. Now before moving on to our other international regions, I want to take a moment to provide an update on our Japanese business, which is serviced through our licensee. ","Based on evolving factors their business was negatively impacted in the second quarter. Although working to address these challenges in the short-term, they are anticipating operating at a loss for the balance of the year.","Accordingly, given our minority interest in our business and the requirement to record a portion of their results, we now anticipate a negative impact to our full year earnings per share which is considered in our unchanged full year EPS expectation of $0.33 to $0.34. ","In EMEA, revenue was up 6% driven by continued growth in our wholesale and direct to consumer businesses. And finally, revenue in Latin America was down 3%, a result directly related to the change in our Brazilian business model. Excluding the Brazilian impact, Latin America revenue was up in the second quarter driven by continued growth in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer. ","So to close, the stability and repeatability of processes and structures that we work so hard to transform and embed into how we operate are enabling us to drive greater efficiency, precision and focus than ever before. We are committed to protecting our premium performance brand and are moving toward a better position to support and amplify the power of Under Armour for our consumers, customers and shareholders. ","Dave? ","Dave Bergman","Thanks, Patrik. I echo Kevin\u2019s comments by saying that our second quarter results speak to the progress we continue to make against our near and long-term objectives and the strength of our long-term strategy. ","By staying focused on execution, which includes delivering innovative product, maintaining a strong connection with our consumers, and strategically managing our business with discipline, we are beginning to deliver on the long-term operating principles that we laid out at our Investor Day. ","The power of these principles have fostered greater stability across our business and with a few puts and takes, we have confidence that the optionality we are building is keeping us squarely on track to deliver on 2019. ","Turning to our second quarter results, revenue was up 1% to $1.2 billion or up 3% if you exclude the impacts of foreign currency. ","Clicking down, let\u2019s start with revenue by channel. Our Wholesale business was down 1% to $707 million driven primarily by planned lower sales to the off-price channel. Excluding the reduced sales to the off-price channel, wholesale revenue would have been up slightly. ","Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 2% to $423 million, which is lower than expected due to traffic and conversion challenges, primarily in North America. However, we have remained disciplined in our shift toward full price selling. ","Licensing was up 20% to $25 million, driven primarily by a settlement with one of our North American partners. By product category, apparel revenue was down 1% to $740 million, footwear revenue was up 5% to $284 million, accessories revenue was unchanged at $106 million, and our connected fitness business was up 10% to $32 million. ","Turning to gross margins, we saw a 170 basis point improvement to 46.5% in the second quarter. To walk you through the components of the improvement, gross margin was positively impacted by approximately 110 basis points from continued supply chain initiatives related to favorable product cost and lower airfreight, 50 basis points related to prior year impacts from restructuring efforts and 30 basis points of regional mix primarily due to the higher gross margin Asia-Pacific business outpacing the growth of our other regions. ","These improvements, were partially offset by approximately 30 basis points of foreign currency headwinds. SG&A expense increased 2% to $556 million, which was better than expected due to our continued cost management efforts, as well as a shift in marketing spend out of the quarter, coupled with lower than planned depreciation from capital expenditures and timing of store openings. ","Second quarter operating loss was $11 million. Interest and other expense was $7 million and our effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 31%. Taking this to the bottom-line, net loss was $17 million or $0.04 in diluted loss per share, which included one penny of negative impact due to the performance of our Japanese licensee. ","On our balance sheet, where we are particularly proud of the progress we are making, cash and cash equivalents were up 131% to $456 million. Total debt was down 24% to $591 million. Capital expenditures were down 23% to $27 million and inventory was down 26% to $966 million.","Turning to our 2019 outlook. There is no change to our expectation that revenue should increase approximately 3% to 4%. Based on factors that Patrik discussed earlier with respect to our North America and Asia-Pacific regions, this 3% to 4% growth should consist of a low to mid-teen percentage rate increase in our international business, offset by a slight decline in our North America business. ","Additionally, with improving wholesale expectations, generally offset by a softer DTC outlook in North America, global wholesale and DTC should each grow in the 3% to 4% range. We continue to expect gross margin to be up approximately 70 to 90 basis points, compared to 2018 adjusted gross margin due to ongoing supply chain initiatives, including more favorable product cost and lower air freight, coupled with channel mix benefits from lower sales to the off-price channel. ","Recall that in 2018, we had approximately 40 basis points of negative gross margin impact due to our restructuring efforts. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, gross margin should be up approximately 110 to 130 basis points in 2019. ","We now expect operating income to reach $230 million to $235 million compared to our previous expectation of $220 million to $230 million as we continue to see the results of our operational transformation yielding greater productivity throughout the business. ","Moving forward, we are laser-focused on creating greater efficiency and agility in our cost structure enabling us to better prioritize investments in key strategic areas, while remain disciplined in our commitment to driving operating margin rate improvement. ","Interest and other expense net is now planned at approximately $30 million, compared to our previous expectation of $35 million and we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22% due to some expected puts and takes in country-by-country profitability. ","As mentioned earlier, there is no change to our diluted EPS expectation of $0.33 to $0.34 as the additional cost efficiencies we are seeing in the underlying business are offsetting the expected negative impact to earnings that we currently see from the performance of our licensee in Japan, which we continue to assess. ","Finally, given the continuing improvements and efficiencies we are experiencing within our supply chain, we are expecting end of year inventory to be down at a mid-single-digit rate. ","Before shifting to Q&A, I want to provide some color on the balance of the year starting with the third quarter. We expect revenue to be down 2% to 3% driven by lower sales to the off-price channel, tempered expectations in our DTC business, and impacts from the timing of distributor sales in our international regions which are meaningfully more fourth quarter weighted. ","Third quarter gross margin should be up approximately 120 to 140 basis points versus last year\u2019s adjusted gross margin or up 130 to 150 basis points on a GAAP basis. This increase is primarily due to channel mix benefits with lower off-price sales compared to the prior year and supply chain initiatives including lower air freight and product cost improvements. ","Operating income in the third quarter should reach $115 million to $120 million and diluted earnings per share should be approximately $0.17 to $0.18. ","In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be up at a low to mid-teen percentage rate. And to break that down a little more, in North America, cleaner inventory positions and service levels should enable us to more efficiently meet wholesale demand earlier than last year. Thus an incremental benefit as we begin to ship products for 2024 sets. ","In our international business, expanded distribution including new store openings, along with improved service levels meaningfully benefit the fourth quarter. As a reminder, within the Latin America region, the impacts in the Brazilian business model change normalizes in the fourth quarter. So the growth rate there should accelerate as well. ","Globally, it\u2019s important to note that off-price revenue should be considerably higher in the fourth quarter based on expected timing of sales. Regardless, we remain on track against our plan of lower full year off-price sales compared to 2018. ","Finally, the fourth quarter is our largest DTC period and is expected to deliver measured growth based on traffic conversion and new door assumptions supported by an easier comparison for North America against 2018. ","With that, I\u2019ll conclude our prepared remarks, and turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. ","Edward Yruma ","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first on the DTC business, I know, much of it was deliberate as you pull back on some of the promos, but kind of talk about the full price conversion, things you are doing to maybe improve it? ","And then, second, Kevin, I know you said you\u2019ve kind of deliberately pulled back on brand marketing, I guess, when is the right time to kind of get that message back to the marketplace and how long do you intend to be? Thank you. ","Patrik Frisk ","Yes, hi, good morning. This is Patrik. I\u2019ll start and take the direct-to-consumer question. I think, in general, across the business, whether it\u2019s in our full price stores or our e-com business, we are driving the brand towards less promotional activity, more full price sales and some of the things that we are doing on that \u2013 doing to do that is of course focusing on improved newness, more frequent drops for example in e-com. ","We are also optimizing our mobile site and that\u2019s coming into effect here especially in the back half of the year. We are also driving some of our customization initiatives with our Icon. And so there is a lot more freshness, especially on e-com that we are driving and we are also seeing higher traffic in that specific part of our direct-to-consumer. ","One thing that\u2019s important to remember is that, about 90% of our store business in North America is still outlet. Now, what we are seeing in that outlet business, which is interesting we believe is, yes, there is a little bit of a softer traffic pattern, but at the same time, we are seeing higher conversion and higher AURs. ","So, our stabilizing of the promotional cadence together with better markdown optimization in that channel is also yielding results. So, in general, if you take also into consideration the fact that our wholesale business in full price is actually trending better than we thought. ","All-in-all, this strategy is working and is taking hold and we feel really good about how to think about that for the back half of the year and going onward. So, it\u2019s a bit of a mix bag in our direct-to-consumer business, but we believe that some of the initiatives that we have now coming on in the back half of the year is going to stabilize that business. So, do you want little bit of color there, Kevin on the brand? ","Kevin Plank","Yes, let me come back to just how we are thinking about investing in the brand and what that means for us from brand strength standpoint. So, for roughly the last 30 months, this company has been in real transformation mode. And I think what you\u2019ve been able to see especially through things like our balance sheet highlights, the growth in our gross margin is that, it\u2019s paying off and it\u2019s a little more immediate. ","Now things like brand and product take a little bit longer for the processes to really kick in and that\u2019s what we are looking to do and make sure that everything we do inspires and builds belief in our consumer. ","As you look at just if I could reset in some of the internal things we\u2019ve been doing as our focus has effectively been looking towards inside of this company, we\u2019ve been doing a complete rewiring from the new global operating model growth from the U.S. company Shell and things and other places to building up the four regions. ","The upgraded new systems with SAP, the leadership with Patrik who is celebrating his two anniversary as well as bringing in people like Tchernavia Rocker a new Head of HR that we have onboard. And then the some of the difficult things we\u2019ve been doing of implementing a new go-to-market process that we are really not going to see until the Spring of 2020. ","And so, this isn\u2019t about when are we going to run the next ad campaign. It\u2019s more of a holistic process that we are putting together. We really feel that beginning to kick in. So, we haven\u2019t been able to run this play repeatedly yet and that\u2019s we know we are going to get. ","The good news we\u2019ve been able to call it. We\u2019ve been able to orchestrate it and everyone understands what it is and now it\u2019s just a matter of our execution. So, I think we feel really good about that. Again, we\u2019ve used to talk about being a quiet company and a loud brand. We feel the steps we\u2019ve been taking over the last two or three years just something really put us in our position. ","And so, this is a great stabilization quarter for us. Again, nobody is declaring victory. But we like the way that we look and we are set up for the future. So, his company is hungry and we are ready to run. ","Patrik Frisk ","Yes, and if I could add a little bit more on the direct-to-consumer. I think, the fact that what you are seeing now with our inventory levels, you know the cleansing of our channels is starting to really pay-off with more new products being on the floor and when we actually have that, we see that working for us, right in our wholesale channel and it\u2019s really encouraging. So, good about where we are at, right now, like Kevin said, we are stabilized and moving forward. ","Edward Yruma ","Great. Thanks, so much guys.","Patrik Frisk ","Thank you, Edward. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ","Matthew Boss ","Great. Thanks. On North America, I guess, what\u2019s your view on the overall athletic landscape today? And as we break down the back half, what\u2019s your level of visibility into the forecasted 4Q and fraction that\u2019s embedded in the forecast today?","Patrik Frisk ","Hi, Matthew, this is Patrik. I\u2019ll begin maybe you want to way in a little bit there, Dave at the end. What we see in the back half of the year comes back to a lot of different things for us. First of all, I think the stabilizing of the business, the cleansing of the channels as it relates to some of the off-price that we\u2019ve had as a hangover in previous years, our ability to service the business, you are really starting to see that really happening right now. ","And a progressively better product, right, more newness, more innovation, we believe that that\u2019s really going to help drive our business in the back half of the year. And I think that\u2019s what you are already starting to see a little bit with this slightly better performance in our wholesale than we had anticipated. I don\u2019t know, Dave, do you want to add little bit on the extra weighting there in terms of the financials?","Dave Bergman","Yes, I mean, as you think about running out the rest of the year, I mean, in North America, it is a lot of kind of a put and take between wholesale and DTC a little bit there. And the service levels are really improving which is great. So we are able to ship earlier for those large launches which has been very beneficial for us and we expect that in Q4 of this year. ","And then, when you just step back and look at the total company for the back half of the year, and you think about Q3 and Q4, just to give you a little bit more color there, on Q3 of 2019, again, we are expecting to be down 2% or 3%. When you break that by region, North America, we are expecting to be down kind of in that mid-single-digit range, which is driven largely by the timing of the off-price sales. ","They are down significantly in Q3 and then up significantly in Q4. And on the international front, you are probably going to see that Q3 being up in the mid-single-digit range. It is our lower quarter for international this year, but we are working through the Brazil business model change which will be comp as we get into Q4 and then also the distributor order flow for international is very Q4 weighted as well. ","And then, when you think about Q3 by channel, wholesale is obviously going to have the biggest impact of that lower off-price sales in Q3. And then, DTC, we are expecting Q3 growth to be kind of similar to Q2 growth. Q4 is a different story. Q4 we are expecting to be up low to mid-teen rate. A large driver of that is channel mix with a much higher off price sales in Q4. ","But again, no change to our overall expectation that full year off price sales will be down. And within North America, it is our easiest comp in Q4. I think we are negative 6% in Q4 of last year and the improving service levels have a big impact for us at the end of the quarter. And then on the international front, the service levels are helping a lot as well. ","But you also have a larger impact internationally for new door opening both partnered and owned. And then also the normalization of the Latin America business with the Brazil change. So, different puts and takes there, but hopefully that helps a little bit with the Q3, Q4 flow for you. ","Matthew Boss ","Yes, that helps a lot. Maybe Kevin, just larger picture, on product innovation, how would you rank the brand\u2019s pipeline, if we looked out over, maybe the next 12 to 18 months? And on the marketing, what\u2019s the best way to compare your go-forward marketing strategy maybe to campaigns of the past.","Kevin Plank","I think it\u2019s about getting stronger. We want to make sure everyone understands that we are incredibly clearheaded and sober about the way we are thinking where the business is right now. We are really proud I think of what we\u2019ve been able to do from driving operational excellence and giving us that stroke that we frankly didn\u2019t have before understanding what it means to become a big company. ","One thing we are clear on though is that, Under Armour has demonstrated, it has the capacity and is a great brand. And we know that great brands indoor. We also know that our brand resonates and also translates, once consumer comes to expect us they want a superpower, every time they put an Under Armour product on and our job is to deliver that to them. ","In the last three years as I said, we\u2019ve been in this real operational mode, but we believe that that operational strength is what it will truly unlock our creative stroke for this company. And we are in the process of moving much better towards that. ","And so, that\u2019s going to happen through great products, because great products always wins and we have great brand moments and as moments of Tom Brady winning his seventh Super Bowl and Stephen Curry and his fifth NBA final it's Kelley O'Hara winning another World Cup in Under Armour boots. ","And I think that, as we said that we probably been not as loud of a brand as we expect to be and that\u2019s one of the things that you will see at begin to play out for this brand as we move forward. The wiring is what enables us to that through things like the new go-to-market process and putting us in a position to really anchor the brand. ","But the innovation pipeline that we see is strong. We are actually \u2013 we are editing and that\u2019s the beauty that we are in the position of right now as we have innovation coming from a number of different places and it\u2019s more of the biggest issue we have is picking and choosing of what is actually going to get center stage and top billing. ","And so, creating that good, better, best, creating segmentation and showing that innovation in the superpower that\u2019s included in every of our product isn\u2019t something is just one distribution channel, but throughout every place where you show up and you combine the Under Armour brand. ","And so, we frankly have never been more confident in what we see in the team, in the structure, the process, the ability do on a repeatable basis and most importantly, the brand and the story. And so, when all those things come together in concert, you have the magic that makes what a great brand is and we think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been here in the process of building. ","So, we feel incredibly positive about where we are going and our ability to do on a consistent basis too going forward. That\u2019s probably the best news. ","Matthew Boss ","Best of luck. ","Kevin Plank","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Alex Walvis from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Alex Walvis ","Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. Thanks for the color on the North America business so far in the Q. Very clear that some of the changes that you are seeing in the North America business have been driven it seems by some low traffic to the stores and some low conversion online. ","I wonder you could also comment on the state of the U.S. consumer? And whether there has been any change there in the backdrop of how you are thinking about spending patterns going forward?","Patrik Frisk ","Hi, Alex, this is Patrik. I think, right now, to be honest, I think in the North American business in general in terms of retail, it\u2019s pretty kind of stable. There is no really big aha moments for us, we think for us, specifically for Under Armour. A little bit slower in Q2, which is actually the impact that you are seeing on the traffic patterns for us. ","We were stronger in Q1. It\u2019s just a little bit of a slowdown after Easter. That\u2019s happened to us specifically in our \u2013 as we said in our outlet business, that\u2019s where we are seeing the traffic it just drop. And when we say drop, it\u2019s you know a percentage point or so. So, it\u2019s a very, very minimal, but of course, we have a large business there. ","So it has an impact right, overall. But in terms of the consumer, no really big callouts I think, and no really big callouts I think for the back half either in terms of how we are thinking about it for us. Like Kevin said, it\u2019s a lot about driving our focus around newness, more frequent drops, marrying that with better messaging across all of the channels where we compete. ","We think we have a strong go-to-market for fall this year. We think we have an exceptional go-to-market as we turn the corner into next year simply because we are getting better at what we do. And the coordination across every part of our business is improving together with our service ability which then translates into better execution. ","So, I think we are kind of bullish on the North American consumer to be honest with you in terms of that being a fairly stable picture for the back half of the year. ","Alex Walvis ","Great. Thanks so much. And then, you talked about on the North America wholesale side, it actually been a little bit surprised to the upside in terms of ordering from in the full price piece of that channel. Can you talk about which types of customers are particularly strong? And then perhaps share some commentary on your conversations with those customers about why those trends are stronger?","Patrik Frisk ","Yes, sure, I think is what you are seeing \u2013 what we are seeing right now happening to the brand in the wholesale channel is, we are finally starting to show up like we would like to show up. ","What I mean by that is, a lot of the excess situation that we\u2019ve been dealing with over the last 24 months or so is starting to dissipate from the floor and you are actually seeing us execute a better expression on the Under Armour brand with better products, more elevated products, more consistent messaging, better messaging across all channels of distribution, showing up as a coherent brand and ultimately servicing the business better. ","So, in other words, everything arrives at the right time to the right place and you know the confidence that that gives us is the fact that, when we do that well, the consumer responds and that\u2019s what we are seeing. So we are seeing slightly elevated sell-throughs compared to what we had expected. And that\u2019s an encouraging sign for us. ","And it\u2019s the same encouraging signs that we are seeing as we think about also what we are doing actually in our retail business in terms of elevating to a more fuller price approach and a less promotional approach going forward. ","So, all in all, the strategy is working I think and at the end of the day, the plan is still the plan, right, we are delivering on the year, what we said we would where about two quarters into a five year plan and what you are starting to see I believe is, simply the strategy working, but it takes time, right. ","You got to \u2013 we are living in a 22 month calendar still, we are moving to the 17 month calendar. But for that to take hold and kind of wash through, it\u2019s a time factor in there and you are starting to see us coming out of that 22 month calendar that went into two years ago and it\u2019s starting to work for us. ","Alex Walvis ","Great. Thanks very much. All the best. ","Patrik Frisk ","Thank you, Alex. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is now open. ","Paul Lejuez ","Hey, thanks guys. I am curious if you could quantify the impact of lower off price sales to the third quarter revenue. And similarly, what sort of a bump are you expecting in the fourth quarter as a result of higher off price sales and I guess, just bigger picture, with inventories down as much as they are, I guess, I am just trying to understand why we are talking about higher off price sales in 4Q at all. ","And then, just secondly, SG&A came in a little bit better than guided, curious how much of that was shifting or timing-related versus just better efficiency if we can think of as more of ongoing savings. Thanks. ","Dave Bergman","Yes, Paul, this is Dave. We don\u2019t quantify the actual points relative to the off price liquidation impacts. But I will tell you that, it is down significantly year-over-year in Q3 and that is up significantly year-over-year in Q4. So, it does have a fairly dramatic impact on the growth rates, Q3 to Q4. And we appreciated little bit of an interesting flow. ","Some of that has to do with availability, as well, as we are getting a lot cleaner with our inventory, the availability of the right excess to be able to go out the door, because obviously we want to make sure we would never put something out that is close to what\u2019s on the floor already with our full price partners. So, we have to monitor that very well and make sure that we are clean there. ","And so, sometimes that means you have to wait a little bit before you can ship that out and that\u2019s part of what\u2019s happening with Q3 versus Q4 flow of the off price. But it\u2019s really not any different than what we\u2019ve been expecting all year. ","And we are continuing to drive towards our plan of off price liquidation for the total company being down year-over-year. And when you think about inventory in general, we did overdrive our inventory target a little bit relative to June 30. ","And some of that had to do with timing of receipts of inventory in addition to just continued improvement with how tightly we manage the order process, production process versus demand and lining that up better from a timing and amount perspective. So, a lot of different improvements going on there at once. ","Kevin Plank","It is a hats off to the team, I think even to our improvement in general of coming down more than $330 million in a year is just \u2013 it\u2019s just a massive task and it something really sets us up well for the future. So, I think that speaks with the last two years have been for us as well. We are really just getting our house in order, getting ourselves shift and ready and clean and ready and march forward into 2020 in the future. ","Paul Lejuez ","Are there any pockets where you feel like you are missing sales that you\u2019d like to see come through just as a result of the lower inventory? And then also just want to circle back on net expenses question.","Patrik Frisk ","Yes, Paul, hi, this is Patrik. No, I would say that we are evenly balanced right now. I think we are absolutely able to service the business in every channel and every region of the world. Some of that is definitely due to what Kevin talked about which is a much better planning process going into 2019 and we see that further improve in 2020 going forward. So, at this point in time, I think we are well balanced. ","Dave Bergman","And then, Paul, on the SG&A, we did come in a little bit better than expected for Q2, as well. And it\u2019s largely due to the more disciplined cost management, also the marketing spend shifts that moved out of Q2. And then the lower planned appreciation based on timing of store openings and other CapEx which I mentioned earlier. ","But, and although we are seeing some efficiencies come through on a small-scale, as we continue to make progress on the cost structure, we clearly have more work to do in 2019 and beyond. And so, it\u2019s all about balanced and make sure balancing there is investments in key areas to support our long-term growth and still delivering operating margin expansion. ","So, we are continuing to drive through and we are expecting a slight amount of leverage this year. But we\u2019ve got a long way to go beyond that. ","Paul Lejuez ","Thank you. Good luck. ","Patrik Frisk ","Okay. Thank you Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Komp from Baird. Your line is now open. ","Jonathan Komp ","Yes, hi, maybe just a bigger picture question to start. I know you\u2019ve had a lot of discussion about stabilizing the business and kind of becoming a more boring and predictable company. I just want to maybe mirror that up against the second half cadence that you pointed to and maybe just to ask if anything has changed in that backdrop or if this is kind of how you saw things playing out for a while?","Patrik Frisk ","Yes, I think - hi, Jonathan, this is Patrik. Thank you for your question. Well, you know the plan is still the plan. We are still on the same outlook that we provided on February 12. There has been a little bit of a optimization if you like in terms of how we think about the different channels. So, we are not \u2013 there are no surprises here for us, I think. ","That\u2019s a good way to think about it. Now in terms of being going back, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard that about Under Armour before. But I think, we are not going to show up as boring brand, we never will. And we\u2019ve got incredibly, we believe exciting plans for what this brand is going to do in the back half of this year going forward. ","And the advantage we have now is we are actually able to orchestrate the play better, right. We are able to think about those innovations that Kevin talked about, the marketing that we have, servicing, putting that together with the great marketing and the great products and actually delivering it all together as a package into different channels, different regions, and four different moments in time across the world. ","And that\u2019s really what you need to be able to do today, right, because the consumer expects you to be able to do that, no matter where they are able to or where they are in their purchasing journey or decision journey. ","So, with all the work that\u2019s happened here over the last three years in terms of being able to play that coordinated play, the belief we have is, that as we move into the future, you will see that coordinated play really play out and become more and more effective with a louder brand and more exciting proposition to the consumer from both an innovation and a brand perspective. ","So, we are very confident. We are quietly confident that we are going to be marching forward with this plan that we have and again, I reiterate, we are two quarters into the five year plan and nothing has really changed in that plan. ","Kevin Plank","And Jonathan, I think that question deserves two answers. So to be clear with Patrik is that, we of course, expect to be a much quieter company and a much louder brand. And if that continues to sound like a sing song, and because it\u2019s factional. ","We understand more than anything is that North America is the straw that sort of serves the drink that happens around the world and the globe and you\u2019ll see t his hyper focus for us which is why Patrik has been so intent on getting close to North America and understanding what\u2019s happening here. ","But with all the while, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to be underplayed of how powerful it has been for us to do this rewiring of the company of literally changing tires while you are driving with still the ability to stabilize and demonstrate that stabilization of the business with an eye towards what we are going to be able to do from a growth perspective going forward. ","And that always begins and ends with the brand, begins and ends with the product that we have. And so, we feel like we are on our front foot. We feel like we would have been able to say that a year ago or 18 months ago. ","But we are in a much better place with that and while we don\u2019t think that we are in a perfect place yet, we are certainly in a better one and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the future with this brand and the team that we have driving it. Period. Full stop. ","Jonathan Komp ","Understood. And as I think about some of the drivers called out in the fourth quarter, does any of the earlier service or anything like that impact the projection that you see entering 2020? And maybe, just more broadly, could you talk about today how you view transitioning to the next phase of growth which I know you talked about entering in 2020 and beyond? ","Dave Bergman","Hey, Jonathan, this is Dave. The change in North America wholesale, it\u2019s really only a slight change. I mean, we have been expecting the improved service levels, we are going to allow us to deliver earlier in the ship windows for 2024 sets. So we\u2019ve been expecting that all along. But we\u2019ve been seeing actually a little bit more improvement than we have been anticipating. ","So that is helping a little bit on the wholesale side as we think about Q4, and helping to offset a little bit of that DTC tempered expectation. Relative to 2020, it\u2019s too early really to speak to 2020, but we feel good with the plan we laid out at Investor Day relative to coming out of this Protect This House phase and moving into Perform With Balance in 2020 and we will be excited to talk about that more in the future. ","Jonathan Komp ","Okay. Understood. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Jim Duffy ","Thank you. Good morning. ","Patrik Frisk ","Hey, Jim. ","Jim Duffy ","I wanted to ask about the North American outlet business. I recognize traffic has been a challenge. Can you guys speak to the merchandizing strategies in the outlets and I am curious are the inventories per door down meaningfully in the outlets and is that perhaps all getting into the comps? Do you feel that you have enough made for to offset the reduction in excess, color there would be helpful, thanks.","Patrik Frisk ","Yes, hi, Jim. Yes, and this is Patrik. Hi, Jim. I think, the only thing that\u2019s really affecting our ability to execute in our outlets right now is just that, slight, slight decline in traffic. To be honest, I think in terms of how we are executing in our outlets, the fact that we are having higher conversion and higher AURs makes us think that what we have actually as a merchandizing point of view in our outlets right now is actually very good and we believe it\u2019s going to continue to improve in the back half of the year. ","So, there is no lack of products on the floor or in our inventory levels for our outlets right now and we planned it the right way. And we feel pretty good about the back half in terms of what we are going be doing from a merchandizing inventory shipment perspective. So, we also think that in the same way that we are improving products for our full price offering. ","We are also of course making sure that we are providing the right product for the outlets and we believe that over the last two, two-and-a-half years we have actually started to improve that slightly as well. So, we are confident. ","Jim Duffy ","Okay. Next question, on the Japan business, you guys mentioned exploring opportunities, it sounds like the drag from minority interest was a surprise. Can you talk about the state of that business, size, the exposure to potential drag in the future and maybe speak to the prospects return and improvement in profitability?","Dave Bergman","Yes, Jim, this is Dave. I think first, I think it\u2019s really important to note, this is a longstanding partnership that we have had in Japan in a very important market, obviously. And as a reminder, we did increased ownership to 29.5% which requires us to record an allocable portion of their earnings through our EPS. Again for Q2, it\u2019s about a negative one penny impact for us. ","And based on what we know now, it could be an additional penny or two in the balance of the year and that\u2019s factored into our updated outlook that we gave this morning. We are continuing to monitor their business and work with them. We should be able to provide more color later in the year. But right now, it\u2019s a little too early for that. ","Jim Duffy ","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. ","Erinn Murphy ","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on your footwear business that was very strong in the second quarter even against your toughest comparison of the year, last year. Can you just speak to some of the drivers if that just the continued rollout of Hover across many different franchises? And then, how are you thinking about the footwear business in the back half? ","Patrik Frisk ","Yes, hi, Erinn, this is Patrik. Yes, we are very happy actually with how our footwear is developing. And the Hover expansion this year with additional models have done very well and we could see continued traction for that franchise across the world. And we are very proud of that and a lot of that has had to do with the new go-to-market. ","If you remember, we launched that last year and that was the first time that we launched a model or a platform with a 360 degree approach through digital and had a great success last year. We are building on that with all the learnings that we got from last year and you saw that as we came on and we actually launched our Infinite already in February, became a recommended style from on the front cover of Runner's World. ","I don\u2019t think anybody would have thought that Under Armour is going to get into the running game with such a strong point of view just a couple of years ago. What we are seeing is, the traction it continues and what\u2019s encouraging for us is that this malls we have in the market last year continue to build and we are layering on new products, we\u2019ve elevated the products. ","Infinite for example is a $120 shoe and that\u2019s doing very well in the market for us right now. So it\u2019s giving us confidence that the consumer is absolutely willing to side with Under Armour in running in a footwear if they have the right product and the right messaging, it\u2019s the same as SPF that we talk about, the Style, Performance and Fit and when we do that right with the right messaging and at the right timing, the right distribution, the consumer is there for Under Armour. ","So, we are very encouraged by that and what\u2019s exciting for us is, we have new innovations in footwear coming in the back half of the year, new styles. We also have a strong line-up going into the future. Kevin was alluding a little bit to that as it relates to innovation. ","So, we now believe that we are very rapidly as a company starting to really learn and understand how to launch platforms in footwear and then build on them which is of course critical to our future growth, especially as we think about not just channel segmentation and penetration, but also from a global perspective. ","So, it\u2019s a real highlight and thank you very much for calling that out and it\u2019s been really, really encouraging for us. ","Kevin Plank","And let me give some color to just from a historical standpoint on what footwear really means for the brand of looking over the history of how important it is to driving our AURs, competing in the industry where we do of getting or shelling up for each footstep that walks through the door. But we are finally in a position where we\u2019ve got the context of having a good, better, best strategy. ","Our Micro G platform, our Charged Midsole platform, our Hover Midsole platform, the ability for us to then segment that. The ability for us then take that from one category into another, from cleated, from encore, from on field to what people are wearing when they go to and from as well. ","So, I really feel confident that as doing that as Patrik mentioned things like the biggest global market opportunity being something like running, where our introduction in the running isn\u2019t just another pair of shoes, but it\u2019s actually a connected shoe that comes with an App that\u2019s unique, that ties in with the world's largest Connected Fitness health system in the world. ","And so, we believe that giving people coaching and giving them real-time understanding of what\u2019s happening, it gives us the unique position that makes Under Armour just a very special and unique player that secures our future and gives us the reason to be in this business to begin with. And so, our job is delivering those superpowers in every product we build and footwear is certainly no exception to that and so we feel good about our ability to march forward with that goal and our next steps too. ","Erinn Murphy ","Great. And then just, my second question is in the recent past, you guys have talked about doing a smaller store test here in North America I think in the back half of this year. Just list what you\u2019ve been seeing in DTC. Has that changed your thinking about rolling out some of these test stores? Just any update on that strategy? Thanks. ","Patrik Frisk ","I think our strategy in terms of DTC both here in North America and going forward in international, it hasn\u2019t changed. We laid it out at Investor Day we believe that direct-to-consumer for us is going to be the majority of our business long-term around the world, in many parts of the world, the expansion happens through, as you know, either e-com or mono branded stores. ","So, we will continue to invest into direct-to-consumer. And here in North America, we have a plan of how to do that as we spoke to you guys about at the Investor Day. It starts carefully. We are building out what we believe is a new way to think about retail for the brand and in the back half of this year with a handful of stores in North America. ","It will accelerate slightly next year and into the five year plan. But we have continued belief in the brand. I think what you are seeing in our retail right now is just a little bit of a tempering as we are adjusting ourselves into this premium full price model again. And then for us it was expected. We just perhaps weren\u2019t expecting it to happen in our outlets necessarily in this quarter. ","So, I think what we are seeing right now, what we think we are seeing right now is a quarterly thing, not necessarily a long-term thing. So we are confident in what we are doing with our retail formats and one thing that\u2019s important to understand about that too is, it\u2019s not a bunch of guys and girls sitting here at Under Armour thinking about how to build the new retail store. ","We\u2019ve done over a 40,000 consumer interviews over the last two years across the entire world. We have done an enormous amount of in-store exploration and we understand we believe today much better from a consumer insights perspective what the consumer is expecting from this brand through the allowance of this focus performer that is our core consumer target. ","And so, we believe that, through this work we\u2019ve done, we are going to be able to launch in a very strategic way and it is a long-term play. So, we are not going to rush out and build hundreds of stores in North America. We are going do it in a thoughtful, methodical, strategic way and win long-term and direct consumer. ","And we still believe very much in direct-to-consumer for the brand going forward as per our plan that we laid out in January \u2013 I am sorry, in December of last year. ","Erinn Murphy ","Great. Good to hear. Thank you guys. All the best. ","Patrik Frisk ","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. ","Brian Nagel ","Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions.","Patrik Frisk ","Good morning, Brian. ","Brian Nagel ","My first question, it will be a little bit of a follow-up to that that prior question. But just you talked about the direct-to-consumer and the e-commerce piece of that. So the question I have is, as you\u2019ve began your market stabilization to regrowing the brand, you're taking the consideration of what others in the at least your athletic experience you are doing, do you see a need for further or stepped up investment in e-commerce to connect with consumers? ","Patrik Frisk ","Hi, this is Patrik. Yes, we do. Digital in general, is just a bigger component of everything that happens. And so we are encouraged by what we see today, right in our e-commerce platform, the fact that the traffic is healthy to our e-commerce platform. ","What we are doing though is, we are not standing still as it relates to the functionality and the merchandizing aspect and the freshness and newness that needs to happen in digital today. So, what you will see from Under Armour going forward is an acceleration in those areas. ","We are also migrating to a new platform in e-commerce in 2020 that we believe is going to give us better ability to merchandize, better ability to service the consumer and tell our story. And so there is a lot of work that we are putting into getting better from an e-commerce digital perspective. ","And what\u2019s interesting we believe also is our ability to more and more connect the dots between what\u2019s happening in our connected fitness business and our Under Armour brand business and we believe that\u2019s going to become more and more of an advantage to us as we move into the future as well. ","Brian Nagel ","Thank you. And then a follow-up if I could, maybe a shorter term question, but, clearly gross margin has been a nice bright spot for Under Armour here as the product mix, the channel distribution turns healthier. How should we think about the longer term potential for gross margin? ","Or maybe said another way, a structural type runrate for gross margin as the business continues, the structure of the business we continued - the conditions of the overall business continue to improve? Thanks. ","Dave Bergman","Yes, Brian, this is Dave. We have been excited about our continued gross margin expansion and we are continuing to drive that through Q3 and Q4 of this year in a considerable way. And again, the recurring themes there are going to be the supply chain initiatives which are really driving better product costing, lower air freight. ","And a lot of the things that have gone into that is the SKU reductions that we\u2019ve done, the volume benefits from now, the improved cost in transparency, the vendor consolidation that we work through, the improved go-to-market processes, all those things are coming into play to drive better product costing and we are also getting more analytical and deeper in how we do our pricing. ","And then from a channel mix perspective, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the off price channel, which we used more heavily in 2017 and 2018 to actively get beyond our inventory overhang that we had. And so, we are now looking to step off that each year and we are doing that in 2019 as we have planned and get back to what we think is more of an optimal mix for that. ","We will continue to look at that as we go forward in 2020 and beyond. And the cost improvements should continue to be helpful for us going forward. And then also, Asia-Pacific is our highest gross profit region. In Asia-Pacific we are very excited about the future growth there and that should continue to be a tailwind for us as well going forward. ","So, at this point, we are not going to be giving color to 2020 specifically. But a lot of these things are going in the right direction this year and we are going to continue to drive forward in 2020 and beyond. ","Brian Nagel ","Great. Thank you. ","Patrik Frisk ","Thank you for your question, Brian. And just for all again, this is the second quarter in a five year plan that we laid out back in December. We feel very confident about where we are. There is certainly a lot of work to do. And again, this team has never been more committee and more prepared and more in a position to actually be able to impact our business moving forward. ","And so, you will continue to see us work like crazy, but we\u2019ve got the greatest brand in the world with the greatest team in the world with this understanding that the brand that's meant to be, because we do deliver those superpowers in every product that we build and you count on that from Under Armour. So, thank you very much, operator. You all have a great day. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations for Under Armour. Sir, you may begin.","Lance Allega","Thank you, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's call to discuss Under Armour's fourth quarter and year end 2017 results.","Participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning's press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found in our website at uabiz.com.","During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning's release.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Lance and good morning everyone. On our last call we spoke at length about our strategy of getting big fast and the rapid expansion of our business to gain scale. Scale and innovation product, sport categories and global footprint. All gear helping us to become one of the world's largest athletic brands.","We also detailed some of the operational inefficiencies as a direct result to this growth, including an inconsistent go-to-market process, change management related to shifting toward a category based construct. In the mix match in our cost structure that was built to support the expectation of being a much larger company by 2018.","These issues along with some macro challenges in the North American market including retail consolidation, changes in consumer preference and intensified competition, created a tough year for our company in 2017.","It was tough, but also an opportunity to begin the work to transform ourselves into an operationally disciplined organization, capable of supporting the powerful global brand that is Under Armour.","Over the past year, we've made strategic and proactive decisions to advance our systems, reset our structure and recalibrate our leadership in an effort to simplify our go-to-market address our inefficiencies and utilize the scale and infrastructure we built to better serve our consumers and retail customers.","As we slowdown to speed up and simplify everything we do to become smarter, faster and stronger, our team is collaborative, humbled and hungrier than ever. Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year end 2017 results, relative to where we are in our journey in the offensive and defensive strategies we're employing, let's take a moment to review some full year highlights, which were fairly in line if not a little better than the outlook we gave in our last call.","Revenue was up 3% to $5 billion. Our wholesale business was down 3% and DTC revenue was up 14% driven by low double-digit growth in our own stores in a high-teen increase in our e-commerce business. In total, DTC represented 35% of our global revenue for the full year.","By region as expected, North American revenue was down 5% and our international business was up 46% driven by continued strong growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Having crossed the $1 billion mark, so could quadrupling in the past three years at 22% of global revenue, the size and scale of our international business is on the freshness of being able to deliver more meaningful return on the large investments we've made over the past several years.","By product type, full year results for apparel, footwear and accessories were also in line with our outlook up 2%, 3% and 10% respectively. Full year gross margin was down a 140 basis points to 45%, a decline due primarily to inventory management initiative and heavily promotional environment that we operated in North America throughout much of the year.","Looking at SG&A we continue to be challenged by highly committed cost structure and asset for over past few years when that levers mathematically even higher due to the change in our top-line trajectory.","In 2017, our SG&A spend was up 14%, which was 41.9% of total revenue. The fact that there is a four in front of this ratio is unacceptable to us and we are working to address it as quickly, efficiently and as brand right as possible.","In this respect, we're making progress. SG&A dollars were up 22% in 2016, they are up 14% last year, respected fee up at a mid-single digit rate in 2018. So over the three years stack we'll basically have the growth rate percentage each year. In short, it's very difficult to unpack five years of investing to scale in just five quarters.","But, we are completely committed to improving this ratio toward industry best practices. In addition to SG&A across the whole business we are working to engineer additional areas for longer term leverage.","Last year we announced a $140 million to $150 million restructuring plan intended to help better align our resources against our biggest long-term growth drivers. For the full year, we recognized a $129 million of pre-tax charges under that plan.","After going deeper, broadening our scope and recalibrating our leadership with even greater financial discipline, we've identified additional opportunities to improve our operations. Accordingly, our board approved expanding our restructuring efforts to include approximately $110 million to $130 million of additional charges expected to be recorded in 2018.","Dave will provide more details on the 2018 plan later. So to finish at our 2017 results, adjusted operating income of $157 million and adjusted EPS of $0.19 were also in line with our outlook. In summary, 2017 was a year we reset and reorganized our business at a level and pace unlike anything we'd ever executed.","To finish out the year in line with the outlook we provided in October should be taken as an indicator there are actions that we're going to take hold and our efforts of putting the brand in a much healthier position to move forward.","In 2018, we are anticipating more stable operating environment for Under Armour. The year that should financially prove to be similar to 2017 and that's perhaps for the similarities end, because within the context of further strengthening our foundation during this fiscal year, we are constructing our long-term operating model, cauterizing the strategies to support it and architecting precisely how we will ensure a more consistent predictable path to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","To caps on these efforts we're working toward an Investor Day in the second half of 2018 that we'll be announcing soon. At this inflexion point, there are two simultaneous connected efforts that we are working on an operational transformation and our long-term strategy.","Patrik will give more detail about our operational transformation, but at the highest level there are currently several major initiatives that we are tackling with the goal of putting the consumer first, simplifying our operations and driving sustainable, profitable growth.","With respect to our long-term strategy, the position strength and creativity of our brand is job 1. To support this, there are four foundational pillars that have served and will continue to serve to fuel the brand through Under Armour's unique personality and performance based point of view, product, story, service and team.","So, let me start with product. In 2017, we moved to a category management structure to ensure that our understanding of athlete needs is central to everything that we do. We take deep athlete consumer insights and innovate to solve their problems and inspire them to push the boundaries of what is possible.","In order to do this consistently to elevate innovation and be a product machine, we are completely reengineering our go-to-market by focusing on our design approach, revamping the process, counter and structure and prioritizing being premium at every price point all within the consistent margin structure.","Much of this process began at the first half of last year and with the 12 to 18 month lead time; we've already begun to see some success with product like our ColdGear Reactor and Unstoppable apparel collections. In the carry for speed 2 and UA Hovr Phantom and Sonic running shoes that we just launched just a couple of weeks ago.","Second is all about bringing product to life helping globally relevant stories and connecting through social platform supported by go-to-market approach that promotes growth and scale. In 2017, we were a loud company and quite brand. In 2018, our plan is to be quite company and a loud brand. Getting to that point is our Hovr launch.","Starting with strategic seating thus fall to the release this month in the ongoing efforts throughout this year, you will see and hear a lot about Hovr for marketing PR and social to athlete, pacemaker and consumer touch points, the saturation of this effort has created a significant amount of buzz for our third cushion platform which joins Charged and Micro G.","Through a combined product and story lens Hovr is a fantastic example of Under Armour firing on all cylinders. As a product, Hovr is an Under Armour DNA tri-sector of style, performance and fit. And from a story perspective without comparison, the story telling that supported around UA Hovr is the largest and most comprehensive campaign that we've ever done on a global basis and this is just the beginning of some of the amplified story telling you'll hear from us in 2018.","Next about is service, and putting our consumer athletes at the center of everything we do, always from start to finish and back again. No exceptions. Constantly serving our consumer athletes whenever and wherever they choose to engage our brand.","As we elevate our gain and validate some of our assumptions along the way, while digging it even deeper to truly understand the consumer decision journey. I believe that our perceived short-term weakness, our focus on athletic performance will ultimately prove to be our greatest long-term strength.","Our product must of course drive style, but we will continue to invest in being an authentic athletic performance brand, that's us. This focus along with global operational discipline will ultimately ensure we are able to deliver a seamless consumer and customer experience time and time again.","And finally our team, the DNA that fuels the bones, muscle and blood of Under Armour is our people. It's been a tough year in this team; our team is resilient and ready to win. The best part of my day is walking the halls connecting with the teammates that are building this company from the Rookie cost center teammate to the season industry veteran. From Portland, Austin, San Francisco and Hong Kong to Amsterdam and New York and Baltimore, we are single minded in our passion, purpose and commitment that articulates through our new mission statement which is Under Armour makes you better.","That means in every way we connect through the products we create, the experiences we deliver and the inspiration we provide we simply make you better. In summary, we see you and we hear you, know that we're heads down stabilizing, prioritizing, executing making measured incremental progress for the company we know we can be.","It takes time which can certainly be challenging on both sides externally and internally. Yet we have the patience, plan and fortitude to see this through methodically and successfully. And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrik.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks Kevin. On our last call, I spoke about operate fuel innovate at the central construct of Hovr strengthening our underlying business. Thing accurate in product story service team, today I would like to detail some of the major initiatives we're working on within our operational transformation.","This transformation has three main objectives, put the consumer first, simplify our operations and drive sustainable profitable growth. And its core starts with the consumer, as we work to significantly sharpen our knowledge and connection with our consumer athletes, it's critical that research and design, innovation engagement and does our overall go-to-market are based in consumer insights to create a demand centric growth model.","To base this work, we've finished our global segmentation study targeting more than 20,000 people and gained an even deeper understanding of how consumers engage our brand; use our product and one and why they shop Under Armour. Within this consumer decision journey we are using both quantitative and qualitative attributes to further strengthen our building to analyze existing market spaces and identify unique areas of wide space where we might play.","Now part of every seasons consideration, this data and analytics that serves to inform and support the tough decisions we have to make with respect to resource allocation and the financial discipline necessary to provide high returns.","High returns then provide more agility for our business. Playing the central part of the strategic planning process, this enables us to refine our positioning, prioritize product, pricing and segmentation and ultimately unlock additional value drivers and growth levers.","Second, following many years of rapid growth and infrastructure build, we are in the process of simplifying our operations. To reset, state well said earlier it's challenging to unpack 5 years and 5 quarters, but we are making progress. As we work through this transformation, we're focused on keeping structure process and go-to-market continuously aligned to ensure repeatable outcomes.","A lot of the foundational work and touch decisions that team has implemented along with the expansion of our restructuring plan that we announced this morning, are direct yourself that our team digging in deeper and narrowing our focus even more directly to ensure we have greater operational agility.","And it is this agility that allows us to align against the largest opportunity for growth and profitable returns. And at the highest level, what does this look like, while from a channel perspective its optimizing our direct consumer business amplifying e-commerce and demonstrating first hand that this is an amazing experience for consumers to engage Under Armour and for us to tell our brand story.","From category perspective, replacing a high level of focus on men's training, running and women's training. The areas with brand strength the largest market opportunity and most consistent growth. It's also about being a product machine and turning out consistent innovation to delight the consumer from sketch materials and production to discovery purchase and the entire lifecycle of the product.","We are 100% focused on the consumer and creating the world's best performance products. With this respect to geography it's strategically managing our business in North America through better segmentation aligning inventory to ensure brand health and continuing to evolve our distribution relative to the quickly changing market.","Internationally, it's continuing to build our footprint and scale leveraging the investments we have already made and distorting toward more profitable hyper growth markets like China and the Greater Asia Pacific business as an example.","As we continue to transform toward a more efficient global operating model we are also evaluating opportunities to redefine key processes and simplify the ways of working to optimize work streams and productivity. Assessing organizational responsibilities and designing key functional and cross functional processes to drive faster decision making and in very tight partnership with Dave emphasizing and driving accountability and financial discipline throughout the organization.","With our operating structure and processes and the alignment, the go-to-market now falls into place allowing us to make great strive in several areas such as shortening the curve go-to-market calendar and moving from biannual to quarterly cadence that will see continuous improvement going forward and will reach its full effect by early 2020.","From an innovation perspective, it enables us to redefine the criteria for innovation platforms to transition from concept to in line and powering the development of seasonless innovation which is central toward driving that shorten go-to-market calendar and skew optimization which is really about doing more with less.","With greater structure and process and alignment, we anticipate that our full 2019 product will have 30% to 40% skews than our 2017 assortment. We're also getting much sharp with demand creation, storytelling and our overall ability to connect even more deeply with consumers. We want to be a loud brand and quite company in 2018 like Kevin said.","To support this, we are simplifying and focusing our marketing PR and social elements to better leverage the brand equity that has already been built while creating strategies drive high returns for our efforts. And a few of the things that we're working on include significantly evolving our marketing return on investment to determine exactly what the best makes of sport, social, traditional and digital best supports are building for Under Armour to make you better.","Next is an absolute acceleration manifestation of digital, how the intersectional product Connected Fitness and experienced interfaces with the ultimate goal of getting the world's best performance products to our consumers. Having assessed our digital capabilities, we are executing pilots and constructing a repeatable quantitative and qualitative playbook which is a significant improvement for the brand.","Now in this respect, moving from seasonal and one time brand moments to a continuous horizon conversation with our consumers telegraph the same passion we live and breathe inside these walls. So to close it out we are making measurable progress against our transformation.","By putting the consumer at the core of everything we do having a more frequent innovation cycle, increasing our speed to market, executing holistic launches and better segmenting our product at the channel and store level, we're setting out to be a loud brand and operationally disciplined company in 2018 and beyond.","And now I'll turn it over to Dave.","David Bergman","Thanks Patrik. Before we get into our fourth results and our outlook for 2018, I'd like to provide some more contexts around the 2017 restructuring plan and one-time items that impacted our quarter as well as the 2018 restructuring plan that we announced this morning.","On our last call, we provided an update to our restructuring plan that we expected to incur approximately $140 million to $150 million of pre-tax restructuring and related charges in 2017. For the year, we recognized a total of $129 million in charges against that plan, including $37 million in the fourth quarter.","As we move into 2018, we have uncovered additional opportunities to more closely align our financial resources to drive operational discipline and effectiveness. To that effect, we approved the new 2018 restructuring plan which is expected to include $110 million to $130 million of pre-tax restructuring and other related charges.","This plan anticipates up to $105 million in cash related charges consisting of up to $55 million in facility and lease terminations and up to $50 million in contract termination and other restructuring charges. As well as up to $25 million in non-cash charges comprised of up to $10 million of inventory related charges and up to $15 million of asset related impairments.","In 2017, we made several strategic decisions to drive toward a more efficient and effectively operated company. We are proud of the work we have done thus far and we use 2018 to further drive efficiencies and streamline our business to become more profitable.","Based on our restructuring efforts in 2017 and 2018 we anticipate a minimum of $75 million in savings annually from these efforts as we move into 2019 and beyond. We already reviewed some of the full year highlights, so let's take a few minutes to review our fourth quarter results before turning to our 2018 outlook.","Revenue was up 5% to $1.4 billion clocking down let's start with revenue by channel. Our wholesale business was down 1% to $733 million in the quarter reflecting lower demand in our North American business particularly within the sport specialty channel.","Direct to consumer revenue grew 11% to $575 million driven by continued strong results in our international businesses. DTC in total was 42% of global revenue in the quarter. Licensing was up 10% to $33 million primarily driven by strength in our Japanese business.","By region revenue in our largest market North America was down 4% to $1 billion, which was in line with our expectations. Outside North America our international business continued its strong momentum posting a 47% increase in revenue to reach $317 million or 23% of total revenue in the fourth quarter.","On a currency neutral basis international revenue was up 43%. Clocking down into the international regions. EMEA revenue was up 46% driven by growth across our double sale and DTC channels. One highlight in the quarter was the opening of our first brand house in Europe which is very exciting for the team and the future of DTC in this region.","Revenue in Asia Pacific increased 56% driven by strong growth in our DTC as we continue to drive both digital and physical touch points with the consumer. Our Latin American business was up 36% led by balanced growth in DTC and wholesale across the key markets of Mexico, Brazil and Chile as well as our recent entrance into Argentina.","And finally, our Connected Fitness business was up 31% driven primarily by new partner relationships. Turning to gross margin, we saw a 150 basis point decline to 43.2% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the restructuring which contained about 10 basis points of inventory impacts, adjusted gross margin was 43.3%.","To walk through the components of the decline, the negative drivers included approximately 160 basis points from certain inventory management efforts including promotions and affray and 50 basis points of channel and product mix due to a higher composition of half price and footwear sales.","These pressures were partially offset by 50 basis points of tailwinds from changes in foreign currency and 40 basis points of product costing improvements. SG&A expense increased 41% to $591 million driven primarily by timing shift and demand creation from the third quarter low incentive composition in the prior period and continued investments in our DTC footwear and international business.","With respect to incentive compensation, recall that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we've reversed the substantial amount of full year incentive compensation. So that impacts the year-over-year comparison.","Fourth quarter operating loss was $37 million, excluding the restructuring adjusted operating income broke even. Interest and other expense was $12 million. And turning to taxes, our fourth quarter and full year tax expense included $39 million of expense related to the December 2017 U.S. tax act. This included $14 million for tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings as well as a $25 million non-cash charge to reduce our deferred tax assets to reflect the change in U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.","There were no cash impacts in the fourth quarter related to these charges. However, the charge associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings will have a minor impact on future cash flow.","All in, the impacts of tax reform made for an effective tax rate of negative 80.8% in the quarter, on an adjusted basis which could exclude the impact of one-time charges and changes due to the tax reform; the quarterly tax rate was 94.8%.","Taking all this to the bottom-line, net loss was $88 million or a $0.20 loss in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. Excluding restructuring and one-time tax reform impacts adjusted net loss was $1 million and adjusted diluted EPS broke even.","Turning to our balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were up 25% to $312 million. Inventory was up 26% to $1.2 billion; important to the inventory story is the split between North America and our international businesses. In North America inventory was up at mid-teen percentage rate, while our international inventory was up nearly 50% supporting the strength of this business. Total debt was up 12% to $917 million and finally capital expenditures were down 20% to $74 million.","Let's now move to our initial outlook for 2018, which we believe will end up looking similar to 2017. For the full year, we expect revenue to be up at a low single digit percentage rate. Anticipating a mid-single digit decline in North America where we believe strength in our DTC business will be more than offset by wholesale contraction.","Building on a strong momentum in our international business which passed the $1 billion mark, we're expecting growth to be north of 25%. Many of the macro factors that we experience in 2017, we expect to carry over into 2018. Thus for the full year, we expect apparel, footwear and accessories revenue to each grow at a low single digit rate.","DTC revenue should be up at a mid to high-single digit rate, in contrast our wholesale business which should be down slightly to flat. Moving to gross margin, for the full year we currently anticipate about 50 basis points of improvement compared to 45% in 2017.","Primarily due to a higher percentage of DTC in the channel mix, changes in foreign currency and lower product cost. To note, we are expecting meaningfully lower promotional activity in the back-half of the year of 2018, compared to the back-half of 2017.","As discussed earlier, we are currently executing in several initiatives that address our overall operating structure, many of which are geared specifically getting SG&A into better alignment over the long-term.","In 2018, we're expecting our SG&A to grow at a mid-single digit rate with higher growth rates in the first half primarily due to the timing of marketing support for our Hovr and training campaigns.","To be clear, SG&A to revenue percentage is not where we wanted to be in 2018. But following the step down from 22% to 14% over the past two years and given the magnitude of committed and fixed cost within this line item, we believe we are making meaningful progress.","Also keep in mind that concurrently it remains a priority to support our growth in our DTC and international businesses, which require continued investments. So, we're balancing that in the mix appropriately. Thus I want to emphasize this is not just the cost cutting right sizing only exercise.","Kevin, Patrik and myself along with the entirety of Under Armour are aligned that this is about running a smarter, leaner and more efficient organization that gives us constant agility and ability to generate sustainable returns to invest in our brand and drive shareholder value.","Back to our P&L and taking this through to operating income. We're expecting to generate about $20 million to $30 million in 2018. Excluding the restructuring, adjusted operating income should be approximately $130 million to $160 million.","Interest expense and other expense combined is expected to be approximately $45 million for the full year, with respect to tax while corporate reform in the U.S. will provide a benefit over the long-term. In 2018, due to our challenged U.S. results we don't precede benefits from the rate reduction and we'll instead see some unfavorable tax impacts due to new base broadening provisions and limitations on certain deductions, coupled with unfavorable tax impacts due to our stock performance over the past year.","These negative impacts will be primarily offset by the beneficial accompanying of larger valuation reserves recorded in 2017. Longer-term as we execute on our operational initiatives in U.S. income growth, our effective tax rate will benefit from the lower U.S. corporate rate. Excluding the impacts of one-time restructuring charges we expect our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range. Taking this to the bottom-line we're expecting full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.19.","Turning to a few items on our balance sheet; due to the revision of our North American revenue trajectory in the second half of 2017 we anticipate that our inventory growth rates will be fairly consistent with our year end growth rate through the first half of 2018. And then should move more in line with revenue.","Demonstrating our focus capital strategy, we expect full year CapEx to be down more than 20% to approximately $225 million compared with $275 million in the 2017. And finally, with respect to leverage for the year, we are expecting some quarter-over-quarter fluctuations that combined with the cash impacts of our restructuring plans on our trailing 12 month EBITDA will cause our leverage ratio to flex above historical levels during parts of 2018.","Accordingly we are in a process of seeking an amendment to our credit agreement to address this short-term issue. Lastly, to give a little more color on our outlook. We're expecting our second quarter revenue growth rate to be the highest of the year as we work through elevated inventory in North America.","With respect to the first quarter, we currently anticipate revenue to be flat to slightly down versus the prior year. First quarter adjusted gross margin is expected to be relatively flat and adjusted operating income is expected to be a loss of approximately $15 million, which puts adjusted EPS at a loss of $0.06 to $0.07. Also important to note that we anticipate the majority of our restructuring to be completed in the first half of 2018 with the second quarter seeing higher than the first quarter.","To close out our call today, we remain committed to driving a more efficient and effective company throughout 2018. As we continue to optimize our North American business and our operating model, our result remains unwavering and we believe our long-term goal creating a more profitable and predictable growth trajectory is intact. We are confident in the work we've done, in the work ahead and our ability to build fuel and feed Under Armour into emerging as a stronger and better company for our consumers, customers and shareholders.","With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Randy Konik","Yes. Thanks a lot. I guess I had couple, two questions. My first question is for Dave. Dave there is a lot of moving pieces to the gross margin, I think the good news here is the gross margins moving up in 2018. Can you give us some perspective on some on the tailwinds that would be more sustainable to the gross margin beyond 2018 such as you mentioned some improvements in costing that you guys are seeing as well as, you mentioned that the promotional environment should be better in the back-half of 2018. So, I'm assuming that in tax, your gross margin in the front half of the 2018, so I want to get some perspective on how we should be thinking about long-term gross margin opportunity not maybe get the number, but you know some of the factors that you are looking at that kind of driving full gross margin on a, more than 12 month basis as we look out into the medium-term? Thanks.","David Bergman","Sure. And we definitely feel good about the 50 basis point increase. I think the start and maybe just understanding that some of the past headwinds are definitely diminishing. So, we are assuming less promotion in the back-half of 2018 versus 2017. That's a planned perspective, a brand protection perspective and we feel pretty good about that. So, you will see a little bit better basis point improvement in the back-half versus the front-half.","But also as far as some of the headwinds that are diminishing, international is no longer headwind for us, that's trending favorably especially with when you think about Asia Pac being our highest growth region and also with are now highest gross margin region as well. So that's helping. We also expect less airfreight as we are not maneuvering through a major ERP system implementation this year, which created some elevated airfreight last year.","And then also when you think about FX after years of headwinds, this is now shifted to a slight tailwind and then we're also as you mentioned seeing some early success from some of the sourcing initiatives, Colin Browne on the supply chain working really well with our vendor base, working on various initiatives there, but relative to visibility negotiation consolidation et cetera. We're seeing some benefits of that in the back-half of this year, but full year benefits in 2019 and beyond.","And then I think, as some of the past headwinds are diminishing some of the past tailwinds are continuing. So, if you think about channel mix, we should continue to see positive impact there primarily driven by the higher DTC growth. So, in summary we feel pretty good about the 50% basis points and what that could mean for 2019 and beyond.","Randy Konik","Yes. It's really helpful. And then Kevin, congratulations on this Hovr technology, I guess what I wanted to ask around that is, since it's been, it looks like selling really on the website and new stores. What if you learned from, you are not just the technology, but the esthetic of what the product actually looks like, especially Phantom and success you had with design improvements? So, what we kind of take away that you guys learn and bring forth either and continued in the footwear or even in the apparel category or whether it would be on product design or marketing around these products going 2018 and beyond? Thanks.","Kevin Plank","Yes. Thanks Randy. I think one of the best things about our industry is as simple as it is at the end of the day. When it comes down to it, the consumer as a very basic expectation and we've defined that we call the tri-sector the Under Armour, and its style, performance and fit and that what makes us unique as a brand and I think what really makes our product differentiated is that when we deliver on those three things, first and foremost it looks great, number two, it's got performance through a technology in it which is what makes it Under Armour and as a reason and purpose for being. And then also just the comfort and the fit that goes into the product I think that's one thing that Hovr really exemplifies for us and our brand.","It also it's a simple story, I think it falls on what we call a franchise, is that the consumer can look for, they know what it is, it was a program that we're able to execute globally, all around the world including we got a, we have one of our UA Hovr houses which will be kicking off in Los Angeles this week and then the All-Star Game, we've been and, uniquely been in Shanghai, so the team has really done a great job as our first two global launch. But I think it says it's very challenging it's that, the consumer comes to Under Armour for first and foremost great product that's delivered in design right way. But they also want to easily communicate it through a story.","So, we believe we have massive opportunity, I think in footwear for us a brand and we think about footwear women's in the international being our three big growth drivers all that are now above $1 million for us and give us the ability to look to lean on. But, it really comes back, I think to just make it sure that the product is right.","We've learned a lot of lessons in 2016 and 2017, there is nothing that says I think for any brand we'd be able to show up, put a logo on our product and assume we'll sell. It's got to hit that tri-sector and we feel pretty good about what we're doing. And beyond the fact is, the point of best thing about Hovr is just the discovery factor. A), it looks great, number two its probably one of those, one of not the most comfortable shoes ever put on your foot, I would look for the latter and number three hits also connected shoes. There is a technology in it that allows you to have this community clock that you can run with yourself and against friends and against seeing how many people having, how many miles have been logged on in that as well.","So, it really is the first product that, I think really drives the manifestation between the digital and the physical what we've been doing with our Connected Fitness business and our teams in Copenhagen, San Francisco and Austin. So, like I said, that product is just a home run and I think you can look to see more of those type of franchise types of approach on a clearly communicator way going forward from this as well.","Randy Konik","Very helpful. Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Your line is open.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. Hi. Thank you. Kevin, you've done a good job of really summarizing a lot of what's going on currently to address some of the issues, I want to take a step back, I know you've talked about the recovery is being really a two year journey for the company, and I love it, if you can maybe take some time to talk about specific examples that have given you more or less confident Matthew.","Patrik Frisk","I think I'll take this one -- this is Patrik here. I think some of the things that are giving us real confidence. Kevin touched on the Hovr story here, but I think it's the way we're now approaching everything that we're doing putting the consumer at the center of what we do. We've just completed as I said a major global consumer segmentation study as well as some other interesting work in the space where we compete which is giving us more insight into understanding where we can be competitive in the space. We're coupling that together with the process improvements that we've made around our go-to-market and are driving now a much more coherent calendar if you like which is also giving us a line of sight into improvements in the calendar as it relates to speed to market.","So the teams are really starting to work much better together. And the reason, we're referring so much to Hovr is because it was the first time we were able to execute a 360 degree campaign a few weeks ago across the world simultaneously at the same time. And we clearly see that when we do that the consumer responds. So for us it's kind of the first showing if you like inside the new go-to-market. And that's one of the big things for us as we look into 2018 and beyond which gives us a lot of confidence.","And the second thing is also as you think about efficiencies inside of the work we're doing around SKU optimization for example. The fact that we're driving 40% less SKUs more or less over a two-year period and 25% just in 2018 to 2019 alone also shows that when we put our mind to it and when we really understand the consumer in the space we're able to make those difficult decisions of what not to do as well. So that's giving us a lot of confidence in our team's ability to execute in this new environment that we're in.","Kevin, I don't know if you want to add something to that maybe.","Kevin Plank","Yes. I think it's important that as a company we really focused on scale over the last several years. And I think it's probably one of the most debated topics, if is it right, is it wrong, as you hear there. It's a decision that we made and frankly really glad that we're able to go through I think what many companies are facing especially what we're seeing right now is $5 billion brand. So having built that and one thing we know is, they're building a brand is frankly much more difficult than becoming streamlined the way we want to be in operations and so we feel like we've done one. What you're hearing from us is that we have a heavy focus to what we're going to build into we've done in 2017, what we're building into 2018 and we're not done and we're not going to probably take either one easy. We're going to focus on continue to be a great brand but, of course, getting operationally excellent.","And the good news about this as Patrik said is, this journey began back in 2017. We made a lot of really hard difficult decisions from modifying our structure of going from a head of apparel footwear and accessories to category management with distinct categories that really like running and Soccer and Golf and training et cetera.","We also upgraded our ERP systems with SAP and something that we're continuing to see the fruits of what that's going to mean for us going forward. And then, of course, bringing in the leadership with Patrik joining our team. So we have to say all three of these things are about seven months into it right now. And so 2017 was about us getting started and 2018 is about us really optimizing. And I think you'll see us do that. But we want to be clear there's a lot of work for us to do in 2018. But as I think hopefully you're hearing from us is that we feel very confident with the strategy and the plan that we have in place, so we'll keep running on that.","Jonathan Komp","Great. If I could follow up specifically on the cost efficiencies and SG&A reductions and I'm curious if you could share a little bit more on the pay scene of some of the benefits you expect. I know the guidance is for at least $75 million of savings by 2019. Will you be getting some of that this year? And then also, longer term when you look to get the G&A ratio back below 40%. Does that sound like a one year or a three year, a five year type aspiration, just curious how you think about kind of the duration of the path to get there?","David Bergman","And this is Dave. I'll give you a little bit of feedback on this year and what were driving through. I think we'll hold future years to our Investor Day, which will be excited to talk about later in the fall. But relative to what we're doing now first it's really just driving through a lot of it is the fixed cost and the committed cost that we're working on. If you think about it North America is deleveraging due to top line that's really distorts and imbalances SG&A even more.","But, within the fixed cost area we've got global distribution center 3 PL expansion. We've got offices, facility run around the world, the FMS and IT systems. We've got pretty significant depreciation expense from previously higher CapEx years. Just to name some of those order areas. So it's not easy to slow down or turn off quickly. But we've made meaningful progress in 2017 going into 2018. When you think about those fixed costs they were growing well, well ahead of revenue in 2016 and 2017 and we're getting them much closer in line with revenue growth in 2018 which is great.","And then, when you look at the variable expenses we've got to continue to prioritize there because we want to be able to support the growth in our DTC and International which are SG&A intensive. So it's definitely something that we're balancing in the mix appropriately. It's all about running smarter, leaner and more efficient.","So when you think about the benefits from the 2017 restructuring, there are definitely benefits that we're already seeing in 2018, the benefits are bigger -- be bigger in 2019 and beyond. You're not really maybe seeing externally those benefits from the 2017 plan as well mainly because they are partially masked by those higher fixed costs and also the SG&A intensive international expansion and DTC growth that we're going through.","So again, it's a little difficult to unpack the five years in five quarters, but we're driving hard and we're excited about what it means for 2019 and beyond.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Edward Yruma","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It seems like some strong enthusiasm around international results this year and your guidance for next year. You also talked about improving profitability there. So would you help kind of quantify how we should think about international profitability and the trajectory?","And then as a follow up there's been a little bit of noise around covenants, so kind of comfort around your debt and the covenants that you have. Thank you.","David Bergman","Sure. This is Dave. From an international perspective, you're right. I mean we've been doing extremely well there. The teams in these international regions are simply amazing. I honestly I hope they're listening to this call and I'm sure they are because they've just been doing a phenomenal job growing in each of those regions and doing it in a brand right way.","We've been exceeding 40% growth in the international regions for the last three years. When you look at Asia Pacific we're very bullish especially in China and Korea. We have the highest growth, but also with the sport and performance becoming more important culturally there. So we're uniquely positioned I think to capture and gain that momentum.","Also in EMEA there's great strides and traction there with some of our larger wholesale partners along with accelerating DTC growth and helping to drive improve profitability there. Latin America, which is our most recent and the smallest international market right now, but quickly become a significant contributor to the international portfolio. So they have balanced growth in DTC and wholesale.","To your point around profitability that's probably just as exciting or if not more exciting. From my position is that after years and years of investment in these international areas they are really turning the corner at this point and becoming profitable. And take an example like Asia Pacific becoming very profitable and really starting to contribute back to the consolidated pre-tax income of the company which is great to see, which we're also excited about what that means for future tax rates as well.","So again, international up and down doing very, very well for us. Those teams have been amazing. We continue to drive on that together.","On your other comment relative to leverage and the debt covenant. This is really a short-term issue partially it's the math with the 12-month trailing EBITDA. But due to the combined impact of two-year pivot period that we talked about with a little bit lower profitability and roughly two years or in total $250 million in potential restructuring charges. However, we do anticipate having over 50% available within our revolver even at our peak leverage points in Q2 and Q3. And we have line of sight to being free cash flow positive by year end.","So we're in good shape but we do have some short-term pressure on the leverage ratio driven by the forecasted EBITDA. So we've been in discussions with our banks and we're in the process of obtaining an amendment to alleviate those short-term pressures. And we expect to execute quickly. So we feel like we're in a good spot to work through that.","Edward Yruma","Great. Thanks so much.","David Bergman","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jim Duffy","Thanks. Good morning. My question is on inventory management, what are the key steps to bring inventory growth more in line with revenue growth and what are the expected consequences to the margin in doing so. There are a lot more clearance and discounting that you'll need to see before the back half of the year.","And then, building on that what are the plans to improve inventory turns to more industry appropriate levels in the future and some of the steps necessary to get there?","David Bergman","Yes, Jim. This is Dave. I will start and then pilot Pat chime in as well. I think first just make sure we have the context around that fact that if you step back to October 31, we took over $300 million out of our top-line plan for 2017. And obviously, at that point a lot of that inventory had already been produced was either on its way to us or was already within our distribution facility. So there's definitely some overhang coming into 2018 that we're dealing with and we're going to be actively moving through that in a brand right way through our own outlet stores but also through our third-party off price partners which have been great as well.","So we're going to get after that pretty hard in the first half of the year. We expect to be much more in line towards revenue growth in the back half of the year. And that's part of the reason why you'll see gross margin improvements a little bit more in the back half versus the front half. But as far as a lot of the different levers, I can turn it over to Patrik can give a little more color on that as well.","Patrik Frisk","Yes. I think it's for us very much also planning the business correctly right. So for us going into 2018 especially the back half we've thought about our planning differently. We talked a little bit about this SKU optimization that we're implementing and how we're now thinking more holistically around our inventory levels across our distribution, across our segmentation and that's going to continue into 2019 as well. So we feel that we're more in control if you like in terms of how we think about inventory across the world across our channels of distribution. And we feel that we're planning our business much better and that will accelerate through the back half of 2018.","Jim Duffy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good morning. The questions I have are around -- it's just different segments in the business. Can you talk about where you think you are in women's and in the youth businesses and how they trended in the fourth quarter and the expectation for 2018?","Patrik Frisk","Yes. I'll take that on here. This is Patrik. I think in terms of how we think about our opportunity for growth going forward we still believe that women's is a tremendous growth opportunity for us across the world. Together with of course footwear and we talked also about our international business. We believe youth continues to be a very, very important part of our business and an area where we want to actually increase our market share going forward.","We have a lot of engagement especially in North America with youth and travel and club organizations. We have contracts with over 400 of those organizations across our business. We currently deal with about 1000 high schools directly with contracts out of the 16000 that exist and we sell through another 1000.","So as we think about our youth business, it's currently in a state where we feel that we're going to be really having an opportunity to grow that also as we expand our direct-to-consumer and our e-commerce and digital business going forward. So we feel very good about our youth business.","Our women's business we continue to invest into this. And remember we're about seven months into our category management where we really stood up our women's business in a stronger way. And as we're coming out of 2017 and heading into 2018, we feel that our assortment and our distribution is now much more put together and getting sharper. And that's what Kevin said before the SPF factor, the style performance and fit factor is getting that specific Under Armour point of view across much, much better in the back half of 2018. So we believe that as we look into 2018 and beyond with the category management that we put into place. With the understanding -- the deeper understanding of the consumer, with a deeper understanding of the segments where we're competing into, we're going to get a stronger and stronger business for women as we move forward across the world.","Kevin Plank","And if I could too Bob, if there's one thing about this brand is that kids love this brand. This brand was built because of the aspiration that the little boys and little girls put on our products, apparel and footwear and make them feel that they could jump a little higher, be a little stronger, run a little faster. And so that's something you'll continue to see as double down on.","As far as the women's space again to echo what Patrik just said, we can just be better. So we're invested there. We're positioned there. But what you'll see from us is a brand that gets and understands that what we need to do for her is simply deliver on fit, style and color. And I think you'll see that coming up from us in a progressive way as we continue to get better and better in our women's business. But we believe in it, we're focused and we think that she likes us. We just have to do a better job, give them more reasons to buy Under Armour that's head to a toe statement as well.","Bob Drbul","Great. I guess the second question I have is, you talked about I think its 30% to 40% reduction in SKUs in the fall if 2019. Can you talk about your segmentation of product by channel with a lower number of SKUs and sort of where you think you are from that perspective?","Patrik Frisk","Well, I think it's really thinking through our distribution across the world right and every channel and understanding our positioning in each segment. And as we stood up category management about seven months ago as we've said here today and we've coupled that now also with a deeper understanding of the consumer and as well as our channels. We're getting just more pointed and we're getting a stronger point of view. We're taking out the noise if you like in terms of the SKUs that we believe should be driving our business going forward ensuring that every product that we put into every channel has the right price value equation, has the right SPF, style performance and fit equation.","And we just looked honestly at ourselves and said listen what do we really need to drive the business in the brand appropriate way for each channel. And we made those hard decisions and that's what just you're going to start seeing from Under Armour going forward, us making those really hard decisions.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Kevin Plank","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is open.","John Kernan","Good morning everyone. Thanks to my question.","Kevin Plank","Thanks John.","John Kernan","International seems to be obviously a real point of strength, Asia Pac was up over 60% in 2017. What are you learning about China besides that market, we can all see that the popularity of Steph Curry in China, two of your biggest competitors generate operating margins north of 30% in that region. So just want to know what you're learning about that market and how big you think it can be for Under Armour?","Kevin Plank","Yes. I think I'll take it. I will go. Okay. So I think what's interesting for us in China is that if you compare us to most of our competitors we're still relatively small. And we're very premium. We've definitely come in at the upper end of the marketplace. Most of our distribution right now in terms of the direct-to-consumer business that we have there is positioned in the Tier-1 and into the Tier-2 cities. We believe we have an enormous amount of opportunity to continue to grow our brick and mortar business there. But what we also see is an expanding digital e-commerce business that is really resonating with the consumer.","So we believe like Dave said earlier that our teams have done an incredible job in terms of positioning the brand in that marketplace. We're fortunate to also have some of the best athletes on the planet to support that business especially inside of the basketball category. And for us that's of course a great asset. I don't know, Dave if you want to expand on the gross margins.","David Bergman","Yes. I guess I'm just adding a little bit to that. The Asia Pac region is definitely going to be or continue at least in the near term to be one of our highest growth areas. But it also is becoming one of our most profitable. Their gross margins are strong and now that we've actually over the past years been building up the distribution structure that we need, the office structure that we need a lot of the foundation has been laid.","So now Erick Haskell and his team in Asia Pac are really driving forward hard. And now that we've got some scale we can really start returning some of that profit to the bottom line. So we might not be driving right away to the profitability that some of our competitors have in the region, but I think we're trying to make sure that we go with the right pace to stay in line with the brand and make sure that we're working with the best partners out there and we're going get a good steady pace that's right for Under Armour and we'll continue doing that.","Kevin Plank","And just again to pile on sort of the energy excitement we have around Asia as a whole that started with Japan a relationship that goes back nearly 20 years now for the brand. So we've been there for a long time. China since 2010, but really amplified in the last couple of years due to the leadership that Dave mentioned. But we have a terrific team on the ground hundreds of doors opened in China last year. We'll repeat that again this year. There's a tremendous amount of capacity. We're now over 60 cities right now across China. And we see the ability for us to begin to backfill and obviously there's many more cities that we have the opportunity to go to as well. We just opened our largest store in Asia over 20,000 square feet. So I mean in Beijing.","So we feel like we're in a really good position and really proud I think of what this team has put together, I think the opportunity that we have so great things. But international again we talked about going for scale in the last several years really doubling down and getting behind our international business is something that is paying dividends for us today as we are able to manage through North America right now and be able to lean on what we have coming in from the international markets.","John Kernan","Okay. Thanks. If I can just ask a quick follow-up on a North American wholesale market. Dave, what's was embedded in your guidance for North America wholesale as we go through -- go into the back half of the year when compares obviously.","David Bergman","Yes. I mean I guess a couple of things we mentioned a lot of the same factors that drove business in North America in 2017 are going to carry into 2018. I do think that we're going to be challenging ourselves to make sure that we're brand right and potentially tempering some of the promotional activity in the back half of the year and we plan for that accordingly.","We expect there's going to be a little bit of additional contraction in the U.S. market as we continue to optimize our distribution there. There is a little bit weaker consumer demand driven by a variety of factors there that are impacting us that we talked about over the past. So we're not expecting a miraculous turnaround in North America.","Again that's why we've been kind of talking about 2018 being fairly similar to 2017 and we're continuing to maneuver through that in the most strategic way.","John Kernan","Okay. Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Thanks John.","David Bergman","Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. Your line is open.","Omar Saad","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to ask about the comments you made early on about evolving the creative process that the product design and development process. Maybe you guys can elaborate on that and what your aim is and what you think the outcome will be in terms of elevating the company's ability to produce better products that are more relevant. Thanks.","Patrik Frisk","Hi, Omar. This is Patrik, I think what we're referring to there is the entirety of the process. And we're now starting out with the consumer first. And that goes for all of the teams that we have engaged. And the idea is that they're not just starting with the consumer first, they are starting out with the consumer first inside of the space where we're competing. So it's about purpose ultimately and making sure that to Kevin's earlier point the SPF factor, style, performance and fit is part of that equation all the way through. But it's being more purposeful in other words we're cutting SKUs, we're being focused on the consumer. We understand the space that we're going to be competing in. And as a consequence the design teams and the product development teams are being more focused around their execution. We believe that this will ultimately drive better product from us in both the short-term and the long-term. If you couple that with a great go-to-market process, we're actually both marketing and product start out together.","We're having the teams joined at the hip as they go through the process that enables us to better build out our 360 degree approach to the consumer truly understanding the consumer journey as the consumer moves through the purchase journey and understanding each touch point for the consumer what they they're expecting from us at each touchpoint. And then, understanding what we are best delivering against that expectation for each touchpoint consistently time and time again.","So a lot of it is about consistency and a lot of it is about the process itself enabling our teams both from a design product development and marketing perspective to learn and how to better [indiscernible] right in terms of incremental improvement for each season that goes by that gives us a lot of confidence going forward. I don't know Kevin, if you want to add on to that something may be.","Kevin Plank","Yes. Omar, I've got a pretty unique perspective of 21 years in this company, 13 now nearly as a public company in sort of the difference in being the ability to be an entrepreneur to be able to move from when there's a problem you just you go sit on the problem for a day, a week, a month until it's fixed. And the size and scale that we've been able to get through as a company, I think it's a real testament to the team and the hard work that we put in. But it also requires the process that we need. And while Patrik was such a great fit to be able come and help our organization as the industry experience and just the understanding really in the go-to-market process of being able to drive all the way through, to drive the calendar discipline and to put the things in place that as a growth company that was could build and just maybe make a few SKUs and put it in aisles and have second high and let it fly. That's not the case.","Our competitors are very good and are the expectation, the shopping experience is incredibly competitive and something that we've got to be great at. And that means, we need to be great with a product that we put into the existing distribution, we did make sure and ensure that distribution is segmented. And so now because it translates and crosses over so many different languages, we've got to be simple in that messaging to. And so it really is a bit of a process that really has us rethinking the way that we bring product to market as a company.","Our job is simple -- again it's not to be over complicated. Our jobs unlike consumers' where product exceeds our expectations. And we got to be able to tell in a really simple way. And one thing we know is that when we innovate we win and I want to be clear too for the call is that, while you'll see us talk about how incorporating style and of course to be Under Armour, let's have performance and the fit and comfort must be great. But, we do believe in our performance heritage. We do believe that the current perceived weakness of performance is something that's going to prove to be our long-term greatest strength.","So we are not going to back off of that. You will continue to see us double down. But I'd probably use again Hovr as the archetype for as we make this definition of what is our brand. Our job is to make you better. And that's frankly where our new mission statement says. So every time [indiscernible] just going to make you little bit better.","Omar Saad","Kevin I was going to say it feels a little bit like as I listen to you guys talk about the brand and where its core competencies are and you mentioned I think focusing on running and men's training and women's training. Is it's hard to interpret from you guys that there's a little bit and I don't want to say back to basics, but back to the core and origins of what the Under Armour brand has stood for albeit on a global scale in a much bigger platform. Is that the right way to think about it, especially in the construct of the market seems to be moving so much towards lifestyle and sport fashion. Are you really kind of just carving out the Under Armour positioning in the marketplace as a performance leader, is that fair to interpret it that way?","Kevin Plank","Yes. We are not ignoring the market and I want to make sure people understand. We're not tone deaf. We just understand who we are and who we are as what's built this company that we have today. And I think what's exciting for everyone here and the reason that our team came to work in this brand to begin with is because the belief that they had that we could make athletes just a little bit better. And so there's a lot of people that are running the play right now. What it means to turn strictly to our lifestyle and frankly ignoring performance at some level. So what we're saying is that we get it. But we believe that every product that we make yet, it has to look great, it has to be stylish, but it has to have the DNA that makes it Under Armour.","So again, when you see it, you should start with wow what an amazing looking product and b) wow is that Under Armour and c) is wow, if it's Under Armour what to do. That's the thing that makes it the DNA for our brand. And we won't be able to answer that with it's not just a normal sweatshirt, but you can wear this thing in a rainstorm.","We want to be able to say that, it's not just a pant, but it's a golf pant with super stretch and you can spill on it or you can take mud or dirt and wash in the wash and that after the dry cleaners. So the things that make the DNA, the amount of science and technology and time that goes into the products that we build. I don't think we've got enough credit for. And I think other people are trying to enter our categories and not get and not probably do the homework that we do in order to put the products out in the marketplace that we do.","So Under Armour special, when you see an Under Armour logo it means that the product does something it's doing something to make you better. And so we're going to make sure a) that comes through in every product that we have. We're going to make sure because I don't think we've been as emphasized on design as we can be to take credit because all of the cost and the structures been in the fabrications. So we're going to make sure that we're not going to back off on the fabrics, but you're going to see a bit more thought and a bit more finish and things are completely relevant to what we do. But it'll be marketing trend right and something that you'll continue to see us evolve into.","Omar Saad","Thank you. That's helpful to hear.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Omar.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Lance Allega, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. ","Lance Allega","Thank you and good morning everyone joining us for Under Armour's third quarter 2019 results earnings call. On today's call, participants will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning's press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found on our website at about.underarmour.com.","We may reference certain non-GAAP financial information including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning's release. We do use non-GAAP amounts as the lead in some of our discussions because we feel that they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.","You may also hear us refer to amounts in accordance with US GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.","Joining us on today's call will be Under Armour's Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Bergman. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Lance. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today's call by touching on the announcement we made a couple weeks back that effective January 1, 2020, I will be transitioning to Under Armour's Executive Chairman and Brand Chief and Patrik Frisk will become our Chief Executive Officer.","This was my decision and the culmination of a rigorous approach to succession planning in partnership with our Board of Directors. Patrik's proven command of this business and the confidence we have about Under Armour's prospects as we shift from defense to offense.","Inside the most transformative three-year chapter in our history, as my direct partner, Patrik has helped strengthen the foundational elements of our current vision, mission, and values, and co-architected the strategic playbook we are currently executing against.","His demonstrative, transparent style of leadership, centered around a clear strategic vision, unparalleled discipline, and an outright passion for our brand positions us smartly to reach our goal of making Under Armour the best athletic brand in the world. This transition will empower Patrik to have the freedom and oversight to holistically execute against our playbook.","Now, anchored by our strategic pillars of product, story service and team, we have been decisive in proactively improving underperforming areas of our business, while balancing the investments necessary to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.","And just like the athletes we serve, this journey is about getting better \u2013 better for our teammate, consumers, customers, and our shareholders.","At the center of this pursuit, the very reason we exist is our mission. Under Armour makes you better. A humble passioned obsession that has fueled our company for nearly a quarter of a century. I am extremely proud of the powerful brand we have built, the global team that is our family, and the athletes we continue to serve by equipping and inspiring them to push beyond the boundaries of what is possible.","Being Under Armour means showing up with integrity every day, strapping on your HOVR Infinites, putting in the work, recognizing the scars while learning from them, celebrating the wins and looking to tomorrow where the hard work helps you get a little bit stronger, faster, and smarter.","All of this, of course, centers around three critical aspects of the brand \u2013 making great product that is authenticated to the power of sport, magnified by incredible storytelling and delivered by a team that loves this brand.","These three things define who we are, how we show up, and ultimately how we will maximize our long-term potential. And moving forward, in my new role as brand chief, these are the areas where I will be focused to help reignite our growth.","Now, looking at 2019, we continue to execute the play with patience and discipline. From a product perspective, with performance innovations like UA HOVR, Rush, and Recover, we know that when our product delivers SPF \u2013 that's Under Armour\u2019s style, performance, and fit \u2013 we win with athletes.","Armed with a shortened go-to-market calendar, increasingly better segmented assortments, and a clear pipeline of innovation to come, we are building an arsenal that will continue to demonstrate why Under Armour is a choice alternative in an otherwise commoditized marketplace.","From a brand and storytelling perspective, where seamless physical and digital connectivity is table stakes for our consumer engagement, we have been working diligently to better activate our assets to drive the highest returns.","At the moments of training, competition, and recovery, we continue to see great potential in our ability to better personalize consumer touch points through a sharper, data-driven point of view.","And while we\u2019ve certainly realized some success in product-specific marketing efforts over the past couple of years, 2020 will be the first year since our transformation began that we will have the ability to put the right resources combined with the scale behind our brand marketing efforts.","In 2020, you will see a more singular, powerful, rooted-in-performance brand voice that harmonizes with elevated product marketing, clearly and definitively telegraphing how Under Armour makes you better.","Now, earlier this year, on our first quarter call, I mentioned that if we were to see additional top line or gross margin expansion above our plan, we may choose to further invest in marketing and product initiatives to support building the brand against our long-term goals.","As we close out 2019, while there are some changes to the top line that Patrik and Dave will take you through, our gross margin is stronger than what we planned for just 90 days ago.","Along with ongoing cost efficiencies, we're taking this opportunity to proactively invest back into the brand through increased marketing spend, giving us a head start on 2020 and a deliberate shift from defense to offense for this brand.","This optionality should be seen as a sign that our efforts are beginning to pay off and a demonstration that we are committed to our long-term strategy.","And in that respect, I will close by underscoring that we are on track with the plan and metrics that we set forth at our investor day in 2018. By staying disciplined and executing against this plan, we put ourselves in the best position to reignite growth to unlock the full potential of the Under Armour brand. We will.","With that, I'll turn it over to Patrik.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everybody. I might have a little bit of a coarse voice this morning, but we had ourselves one heck of a football game here in Baltimore last night. So, I'm going to power through this thing.","So, when I joined Under Armour in the summer of 2017, the one thing that struck me was a companywide relentless pursuit of innovation and attention to detail and the outright grit that goes into making all athletes better. This obsession is omnipresent and infused into our culture, one that prides itself on serving athletes and an unmistakable desire to win. ","This same vigor has been applied in everything we've done over the past few years to continuously improve our operations and executional abilities.","And I'm pleased with the progress we're making. And although we may see some puts and takes in the short term, there is no departure from our confidence in delivering on our long-term plan.","Our foundation continues to get stronger; our structure, process, systems, and leadership are in place; and our discipline and patience are steadfast as we work to wrap up 2019. ","With respect to the announcement that I'll be assuming the role of CEO January 1, I am humbled and honored by the trust that both Kevin and our Board of Directors has placed in me.","Both professionally and personally, it's a perfect opportunity for me to blend more than 30 years' industry experience with my lifelong love of sport and human performance. We are truly just getting started.","So, now, let's turn to our third quarter results. I'll start by addressing three areas of our business that I'd like to focus on given our results \u2013 direct to consumer, footwear, and Asia-Pacific.","Starting with direct-to-consumer which came in slightly less than expected, third quarter revenue was down 1%, driven primarily by results in North America. The reasons for reduced volume are very similar to our second quarter, with our outlet stores experiencing lower traffic, yet slightly higher conversion AUR. ","In our e-commerce business, we continued to see higher traffic, but lower conversion with relatively flat AUR.","Independent from general traffic challenges in North American outlets, our full price stores are showing encouraging signs from some of the reset work that we're doing, including new brand house concepts that have recently launched. ","For the full year, we now expect D2C to be up slightly.","Turning to footwear, revenue in the third quarter was down 12%, slightly lower than what we had planned. As expected, this result was driven by softer demand, lower sales through the off-price channel, and improving service levels that are enabling us to meet customer demand in a timely manner.","Related to service levels, footwear shipments are distributed differently in 2019, with increased amounts in this year's second quarter compared to 2018. ","As we think about our opportunity in footwear, our expectations have not changed. We're playing the long game and the work we've done to recalibrate the business, reduce inefficient volume and improving segmentation across price points are enabling us to drive greater focus on prioritization into the categories where we believe we can win.","With a clear innovation pipeline delivered through a methodical launch cadence, along with an aligned go-to-market process that includes amplified marketing initiatives, we are confident in our ability to create a sustainable runway of growth moving forward.","The third area I wanted to address is Asia-Pacific, a region we remain incredibly excited and measured in our approach to growing the brand. In the quarter, revenue was up 4% and included continued growth in our DTC channel from both new door openings and e-commerce.","And as we laid out in our last call, improved service levels across our international business, particularly with distributors, have seen shipments distributed differently in 2019, with increased amounts in this year's second and fourth quarters.","Additionally, compared to 2018, new store openings are more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter. Certainly, a little bit lumpy, but in line with expectations.","Now, moving on to the other regions. Revenue in North America was down 4% in the quarter, which was in line with the outlook we provided on our last call. As a reminder, the primary negative impact in the quarter was driven by lower sales to the off-price channel relative to last year.","On a positive note, within our wholesale business, excluding sales to the off-price channel, year-to-date, we've seen a slight increase in full price revenue, a good sign that the underlying business is trending healthier.","In EMEA, revenue was up 9%, driven by continued growth in our wholesale and direct consumer businesses. Within wholesale, our results were positively impacted by improved service levels and earlier-than-planned shipments related to Brexit. ","And finally, revenue in Latin America was down 4%, a result directly related to the change in our Brazilian business model. Excluding Brazil, Latin America revenue was up slightly in the third quarter, driven by balanced growth in both wholesale and direct to consumer.","As a reminder, the business model change in Brazil occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. So, moving forward, this change won't impact the year-over-year comparisons.","So, before I wrap it up, I'd be remiss to not talk about the incredible progress we continue to make in inventory management. Coming in well ahead of our expectations, we posted a 23% decline in inventory, improving service levels and much tighter buys to customer demand, coupled with product selling through at a rate higher than we had anticipated means we've had lower returns and, therefore, don't have as much excess product to sell in the off-price channel.","While Dave will provide more color in our full-year outlook, it is important to note that this shortfall in sales to the off-price channel is a contributing factor to our updated revenue outlook for the full year.","So, in closing, as we finish out 2019, I have never been more confident in the long-term strength of this brand, this team and our path forward. Dave?","David Bergman ","Thank you, Patrik. Let's dive right in. Third quarter revenue was down 1% to $1.4 billion, while flat on a currency-neutral basis.","Clicking down by channel, our wholesale business was down 2% to $892 million, driven by planned lower sales to the off-price channel, timing shifts relative to distributor order flow and third-quarter impacts related to continued service level improvements which shifted some sales into the second and fourth quarters.","Direct to consumer revenue was down 1% to $463 million, which was slightly lower than expected due to continued traffic and conversion challenges, primarily in our North American outlet and e-commerce businesses.","Licensing was down 6% to $30 million, a result driven by softer demand from our partners in North America.","By product category, apparel revenue was up 1% to $986 million. Footwear revenue was down 12% to $251 million, driven by the factors Patrik previously discussed. Accessories revenue was up 2% to $118 million. And our connected fitness business was up 22% to $39 million, primarily driven by higher subscription revenues and a one-time development fee from a partner.","To give a little more color here, along with our connected products continuing to drive increased brand strength, newly launched training plans for gym workouts and nutrition plans for premium members add to our growing confidence that we are building more sustainable momentum in this business.","From a regional perspective, North America was down 4% and our international business was up 5%, both in line with the outlook we provided on our last call.","Turning to gross margin. We saw a 220 basis point improvement to 48.3% in the quarter. Clicking into the positive factors, we realized approximately 90 basis points of channel mix benefits, primarily due to a lower mix of sale to the off-price channel; 80 basis points from continued supply chain initiatives related to favorable product costs and lower airfreight; and 40 basis points related to prior-year impact from restructuring efforts. ","SG&A expense increased 4% to $551 million, which was better than expected due to our continued cost management efforts as well as unrealized marketing spend that will be utilized in the fourth quarter, coupled with lower-than-planned depreciation from timing of store openings and capital expenditures.","Third-quarter operating income was $139 million. Interest and other expense net was $6 million. And our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 22%.","Taking this to the bottom line, net income was $102 million or $0.23 in diluted earnings per share.","On our balance sheet, we continue to make great progress. Cash and cash equivalents were up 147% to $417 million. Total debt was down 26% to $592 million. Capital expenditures were up 10% to $21 million. And as Patrik detailed, inventory was down 23% to $907 million, which was better than expected.","Turning to our 2019 outlook. We now expect revenue to be up approximately 2% compared to our previous expectation of 3% to 4%, driven by lower-than-planned excess inventory to service the off-price channel, ongoing traffic and conversion challenges in direct to consumer, and continued negative impacts from changes in foreign currency. ","Relative to gross margin, we now expect improvement of approximately 90 basis points to 110 basis points compared to our prior expectation of 70 basis points to 90 basis points in improvement compared to 2018 adjusted gross margin due to ongoing supply chain initiatives, including more favorable product cost and lower airfreight, coupled with additional channel mix benefits from lower off-price sales.","Lastly, recall that, in 2018, we had approximately 40 basis points of negative gross margin impact due to our restructuring efforts. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, gross margin in 2019 should be up approximately 130 basis points to 150 basis points.","As we noted earlier, we have made the strategic decision to reinvest the portion of this upward revision in gross margin, along with underlying cost efficiencies, together approaching $20 million to fund incremental digital and marketing investments in the fourth quarter.","In this respect, we now anticipate holding SG&A flat as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis. ","Even with this additional investment, we are updating our full-year outlook for operating income to reach the high end of our previously given range of $230 million to $235 million.","Moving forward, our efforts to create greater efficiency, agility and leveraging our cost structure remains a key priority and focus for our company. In this respect, we will continue to balance key long-term strategic investments with a disciplined commitment to driving operating margin rate improvement.","Interest and other expense net is planned at approximately $30 million and our effective tax rate is unchanged at approximately 22%.","We expect our diluted EPS to be at the high-end of our previously given range of $0.33 to $0.34 which includes about $0.01 of negative impact related to the performance of our licensee in Japan.","To provide a little more color there, our Japanese licensee is currently working to address a number of strategic and operational challenges and building out and beginning to execute against the plan.","And finally, given the continuing improvements in efficiencies we are experiencing within our supply chain, we now expect end-of-year inventory to be down at a low double-digit rate.","Now, I would like to take a moment to provide color on a few of the main drivers of our fourth quarter revenue growth expectations. First, cleaner inventory positions and improving service levels around the world are enabling us to more efficiently meet our wholesale demand closer to need.","As anticipated all year, more timely delivery should serve as an incremental benefit to Q4 as we begin to ship product for spring floorsets.","Second is DTC. With assumptions based on measured improvements in traffic, conversion and new door openings, also supported by an easier prior-year comparison in North America, we expect to see some Q4 improvement.","And finally, we expect our licensing business to be up in Q4 due to contractual royalty minimums, in addition to a settlement related to one of our North American partners. ","Before we turn over the call to the operator for Q&A, I'd like to break from our typical company policy of not discussing any regulatory or litigation matters and briefly address an article published yesterday regarding an investigation by the SEC and the US Department of Justice.","We have been fully cooperating with these inquiries for nearly two-and-a-half years. To this effect, we began responding back in July of 2017 to their request for documents and information. We firmly believe that our accounting practices and disclosures were appropriate.","Now, back to the quarter at hand. I'd underscore that we are staying disciplined, focused and methodical in our tactics, which includes delivering innovative premium product, amplifying our brand to connect even more deeply with our consumers and strategically managing our business with an eye toward constant operational excellence.","We have made great strides in our transformation. Strides that are beginning to harness the energy, power and strength necessary to deliver prudently as we work to grow our brand over the long-term.","With that, we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alexandra Walvis","Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question this morning. I wanted to start by digging into the change in revenue guidance a little bit. So, you give three key reasons for the slightly lower revenue guide. Could you possibly help us to size each of those in terms of its magnitude on the change?","And then, perhaps more specifically, on the North America backdrop as part of the driver of the lower guide, can you help us perhaps explain what's changed since we spoke last quarter in terms of outlet traffic or in terms of that online conversion which is weighing on sales growth a little bit?","David Bergman","Sure Alex. This is Dave. First of all, relative to the updated guidance, we did talk about the three main drivers there. Availability of excess inventory for the off-price channel is lower than we anticipated, also the weaker expectations on DTC and also the foreign exchange rates. ","Quite frankly, all three of those are fairly similar in impact for us as we finish out the year. There is not one that's really driving larger than the other relative to the updated guidance in Q4.","When we think about North America, in Q3, with the down 4%, the largest driver was the decline in the lower sales to the off-price channel. DTC was a little weaker than expected, but then on the flipside, we were able to overdeliver a little bit on the wholesale side, some of that with the operational improvements we're driving.","And when you think about Q4, obviously, we're implying a higher growth rate in Q4. Some of that is the service level improvements that we mentioned and being able to ship more of that spring product earlier in Q4 than previous Q4 in 2018, but also some of the DTC improvements to a degree. The new commercial door concepts, which we're excited about, the amplified marketing that we've talked about, improved e-com fulfillment levels, and then also just having an easier comp for Q4 for North America as well. So, a lot of different factors going into that. ","Patrik, do you want to add some more color?","Patrik Frisk","Well, I think I said a little bit in my script, the plan is still the plan, right? We're in third quarter out of a 20-quarter plan. And what we feel really good about is the leadership that's now in place in North America. I think Stephanie has done a phenomenal job onboarding and is really hitting the ground running. The continued stabilization and strengthening of the foundation, which gives us an opportunity to reinvest into the brand earlier than we had originally planned, which is very exciting for us, and we also feel very strongly about the actual content that we're going to deliver against that.","And then there's some good news like Dave said, right? We have full price trending better which is great for us. We're winning with the winners, we believe, in the marketplace. We're growing where we need to grow. And we feel good about how we have thought about Q4 in terms of being balanced there, so I hope that gives a little bit more color adding to what Dave said.","Alexandra Walvis","That's helpful. Thanks so much for the color. One follow-up, if I may, on the reduced sales to off-price now planned for the year. Can you help us to understand what's driving that? Is it a better full price sell-through perhaps in the wholesale channel or is it kind of better supply chain operations than you had previously expected?","Patrik Frisk","Hi, Alex. It's Patrik again. It's a combination of both. So, we're able to service the business better as we go into the season. In other words, delivering the right stuff to the right place at the right time. The product is also better. So, we believe that the type of product we're now putting into the marketplace, the fact that we have less old product on the shelves is helping drive the sales. And then, ultimately, that then gives you less returns, right? So, it's a combination of these three things that's really helping us now decrease the amount of inventory that we have for the off-price channel quicker than we first had anticipated.","Alexandra Walvis","Fantastic. Thanks very much for all the color.","Patrik Frisk","Thank you, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Komp","Yeah. Hi. Thank you. I want to first just follow-up on the North America business. Can you just comment on where you expect that to fall for the full-year 2019? And then, I think it's been three years of decline in top line for that business. Do you expect, going forward, that you'll be able to reverse that trend?","David Bergman","Hey, Jonathan. This is Dave. When you think about the full year, North America, we expect to be landing down slightly on the full year versus international, which should be up at a low double-digit rate. Obviously, there's a lot of great things that we're working on. We're excited about 2020, but we'll be giving more color on that in early February. ","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. And then, Dave, I wanted to just follow-up on your comment of the federal inquiries into the accounting practices, and really two questions. I think, first, wanted to just ask maybe more insights on your view internally of materiality and any comments there relative to the presence of document requests for the last several years, but just hearing about it now.","And then secondly, could you just give a little more insight internally kind of the degree of resources being applied and any sense of distraction from any of the requests involved?","David Bergman","Yeah. Jonathan, we can certainly appreciate that you'd like us to provide more details regarding that matter. However, we are prohibited from doing so. That said, the most important message, I think, to convey is that we firmly believe that our past accounting practices and disclosures were entirely appropriate, and we've been fully cooperating for the past two-and-a-half years on this. So, now, we're focused on 2020 and beyond. We feel like our foundation is strong and we're looking forward to reigniting the Under Armour brand as we continue into the next chapter. And we'll leave it at that for now.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, understood.","Patrik Frisk","Thank you, Jonathan. ","David Bergman","Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, first, bigger picture question. If you guys round out year three of your initial turnaround plan, you guys have done a really nice job of keeping inventory lean, hitting your bottom line despite just broader macro noise. But kind of to the point of the first question, sales has been a little bit light. So, what accelerates sales from here? And are there any tweaks that you need to make to the five-year plan that you provided last year?","Patrik Frisk","Hi, Erinn. This is Patrik. Thanks for the question. I love that question because I can answer it very confidently that the plan remains the plan. And if you remember, at the investor day, we laid out that 20-quarter plan and the Protect This House timeframe that we're currently in, that we're turning the corner to in 2020. Nothing has changed there. There are, short-term, a few puts and takes here and there. But, ultimately, we're still confident in that plan. ","And when you do these kind of turnarounds, it takes time because you have to actually work through the calendar. Unfortunately, it's kind of a \u2013 the way it works when you enter into a 22, 24-month calendar and you start to do the work. We feel really good about how we think about the future of this brand, all the work and the foundation that we've done. And we're going to continue to work through that plan. And as we turn the corner now into the Perform With Balance chapter, which is the next chapter, we feel we have the product, we have the marketing, we have the team to be able to really drive the business more going forward. So, we're happy about it.","Kevin Plank","Erinn, let me just weigh in on that as well that I covered in my script. First of all, big picture, we know that great brands endure. So, our job is continue to remind ourselves and demonstrating wider world to see Under Armour as that it were special and the reason that we exist. We've talked about the ability for us to start playing offense. And I mentioned that in my prepared comments as well about moving and creating room that we can actually begin to invest here in the fourth quarter, and especially as we turn the corner into 2020 that we're going to be even more aggressive where you'll finally \u2013 I guess gives the ability to see the benefits of the true go-to-market with strategy, supply chain, product, marketing, sales, all hitting and amplifying at the same time. ","So, we know that we're not expecting perfection at the first time. That version 2 will always be better than version 1, but you're about to see a really harmonized play come from this company and something we'll be able to deliver on a consistent basis due to the culture and the process that we've been able to implement and put into this brand. ","So, we are looking to light our brand up more effectively and holistically since our transformation began and where the new criteria that we have for that is using data really as a high accelerant into how we're making those decisions and it's really smart about the way we're spending our money. So, we are continuing to work on quieting our company and amplifying our brand and we really look forward to that happening in 2020.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thank you both for that response. And then just a follow-up. Maybe, Kevin, for you. Just \u2013 and kind of how you answered that last question, but can you just share a little bit more about the pace in innovation in 2020 both on the apparel and footwear side. Just anything you can share with us today on what some of those stories that we can be expecting. Thank you so much.","Kevin Plank","I think we've got so many franchises that we have at the company, beginning with the fundamentals and the foundation of the basics \u2013 heat care and cold care. It's amazing how much smarter we get as the weather started to turn here in the last week or so, watching things begin to accelerate for us, is that's such an anchor and aspect for our business. ","But I think it's really holistic. I think this is part of the process we've had in the go-to-market of truly setting up this funnel of technology and innovation that points toward specific date where we can either, A, launch or announce building that franchise with things to be done, like Curry, Rock product, HOVR, our overall training line, and then also being able to do it and talk about it through amplified moments of things like building spacesuits through the new Virgin Galactic program and taking eight technologies we have in our in-line commercial products that we're demonstrating are capable of going to space. ","And so, I think innovation is the heart and soul, and I think it speaks to the focus and the commitment that we have to the athlete of us really narrowing the range and the target that we have for our consumer of identifying it as this focused performer. And so, building product for them that will help them train, compete and recover in is going to really be our difference, I think.","And I think you see it showing up. You see it showing up in sports marketing. And whether it was, as Patrik mentioned, the Patriots and the Ravens going at it last night here in our backyard and watching the excellence of a Tom Brady who we continue to help drive and innovate with athletes like that in that perspective or if it's relative teenagers like Soto for the nationals, winning the World Series last week. ","The innovation, I think the commitment to this brand is really consistent and one you'll continue to see come from us over and over. So, we've got platforms, we have franchises, we continue to have an innovation pipeline that we're really excited about and it only gets stronger and stronger going forward.","Erinn Murphy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Randy Konik","Hey, thanks. I guess, Patrik and Kevin, I agree, great brands endure. Just want to get your perspective. There's other lesser enduring brands that kind of can create some noise in the marketplace. One of those, you see in the youth market. Lower-priced has been gaining some traction for some time. How do you think about those lesser enduring brands that are \u2013 that can come and go? How are they impacting the market from a pricing perspective, wholesale order perspective? Where are we in that kind of cycle from your perspective with these other one or two lesser-known brands that are kind of impacting the market, particularly on the apparel side right now? Just want to get your perspective there first. Thanks.","Patrik Frisk","Hi, Randy. This is Patrik. I think I'll kick it off and I'll see if my partner here wants to chime in. You know what's interesting with our transformation has been this evolution in terms of how we think about creating product and services for a specific consumer mindset that's really allowed us as an organization to become incredibly consumer-centric. And this has been an evolution over the last two years. It's not that the company wasn't consumer centric before. It's just that we're now able to use data, like Kevin said, much more purposefully to actually understand what matters to this consumer.","So, when we think about other brands that are coming up or entering into the marketplace in a category or in a space, there's an opportunity today, of course, to do that more easily than ever before. But there's also some really big hurdles once you get to get some scaling in terms of sourcing and an ability to innovate long-term where we believe that we now have set up an ability to understand what problems we're trying to solve for and how to actually make our focused performer better. That is now taking on a whole new scientific level that I believe is going to be a game changer for the company going forward that I don't believe that these smaller companies can sustain to the same degree that we can because size actually does matter in this space, especially when the stakes are as high as they for brands like us where we play on the national and international fields every day.","So, we feel very, very good about how we've transformed ourselves from just making great products to actually making great product for a specific consumer, driven by data and an incredible attention to detail and process.","I don't know, Kevin, do you want to chime in because you've got the history here?","Kevin Plank","Yeah. I'll take it a step back maybe and sort of reflect on what it means of where we find success. Today marks the 56th earnings call that I've participated on. And when I think and reflect on that, it's how much of the external noise that continues to come at a public company, yet the ability of how we manage that. And more importantly, how we put the blinders on to focus on ourselves and not be concerned about the others of the outside and either who's above or who could be below. But really what this relentless sort of energy and probably mild paranoia of always thinking about what's next and how we can obsess on the next great product and for us to be the first to deliver it for you.","And I don't think that's changed at all. I think what we have now is where we were built by many forces of personality and forces of energy and forces of will to underlie and underpin that with really the world's most dedicated team and processes and systems that can keep up with it and do it on a repeatable basis, is a position we're in now. And so, whoever the competition is, be it above or be it below, we're prepared for it. But most importantly, we understand that our criticality toward success, the definition of what will actually get us there, is our ability to focus on ourselves to block out the noise and to keep marching forward and always going through. You'll see that and feel that from this brand today and you'll continue to see that through 2020 going forward. And I can't wait for the future.","Randy Konik","Great. And then, can I ask you just for some clarity on footwear side of things. It sounds like the reduction of sales into the off-price channel impacted the growth rate of that category. So, how do you guys think about normalized growth rate of the footwear category going forward and discuss some of the wins and losses in the category? Obviously, HOVR seems like to be a nice win for you guys from a platform perspective. Just curious on how we can think about the long-term growth algorithm of the footwear business going forward. Thanks, guys.","Patrik Frisk","I'll start off. Dave, maybe you want to chime in. But, ultimately, for us, footwear is playing the long game. We talked a little bit about innovation here earlier today and how well we have been able to place the HOVR platform in the marketplace, in the run performance marketplace specifically, and how successful that's been.","It's taught us a lot. And I think the teams now have a much better understanding of what it takes to do an orchestrated disciplined play in the footwear space, which is very different than what it is in the apparel space.","But we've also been reducing inefficient volumes throughout this year. And especially in Q3, we're annualizing some off-price coming out of 2018. There's some shift in timing between Q2 and Q4 this year. Ultimately, for our footwear this year, we're expecting to grow. We're flat year-to-date and we're expecting to grow in 2019 and we expect that to accelerate as go into the out-years. And we're very encouraged by what's happening in our performance run and also in our women's training footwear.","So, you're seeing a bit of a shift in terms of the footwear portfolio, if you like, that we have this year, but we have, like Kevin alluded to earlier here, a very, very strong belief in our footwear innovation pipeline going forward. I don't know, Dave, do you want to add some color?","David Bergman","Yeah. I guess I would just \u2013 quick reminder, the Q3 growth rate down 12%. We had expected Q3 was going to be a lower growth rate for the reasons that we already mentioned. And as we think back to investor day and expecting that footwear growth from a CAGR perspective long-term is going to be a fair amount higher than apparel, possibly double apparel, we still believe in that and we've got the momentum for that. So, we're excited about talking about that further in early February.","Randy Konik","Thank you, guys.","David Bergman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Edward Yruma","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just first, kind of a housekeeping question. I know you're not guiding to 2020, but just maybe contextualize how much the improved service level is showing into 4Q, so we could start to think about, I guess, our 1Q estimate correctly.","And then second, bigger picture. Kevin, I know we've talked a little bit about footwear. How pleased have you been with the follow through on HOVR. And then, I guess, some of your competitors have multiple kind of cushioning lines. I guess, when can we expect something similar from Under Armour? Thank you.","David Bergman","Yeah. This is Dave. We have talked a lot this year about the improving service levels, which we're really excited about. And when you think about shipments towards the end of June and shipments towards the end of December, that's when those impacts of the improving service levels can really benefit us. And that's we're anticipating for Q4.","So, it is something that we've been forecasting for quite a while at this point. We're expecting that to continue when we think about Q4 of 2020. So, from a full-year perspective next year, that's all considered. ","Although we're excited about 2020 and where we're going, where we're driving, we're going to hold further comment on that until the first week of December. But, Patrik, if you want to add more to or Kevin?","Kevin Plank","Edward, let me address that because I think you bring up a good, valid point. Starting as an apparel company, it had us adjusting to what does it mean to make footwear. And from the learning curve, going back to 2002, making my first trips to \u2013 speaking to the right footwear factories, of understanding how we can be there and be effective, of knowing what that would mean and the time that it would take. So, the investment we've made there is extraordinary and we're now set to run. And all the way down to the things that make it important from an innovation standpoint of having the right products, making sure that we're segmenting correctly, the distribution, truly a holistic approach to how we're thinking about it.","So, today, we stick with roughly four, we call, midsole technologies for our footwear. Micro G, Charged, HOVR and something we've just launched actually in a truly segmented manner, which is called Liquify. So, we are continuing to invest on this and you'll see more midsole technologies come to bear in 2020 as well going forward. And just watching the evolution, the sophistication really begin to build in our footwear capability is something that's frankly taken us 15 years to get to this point, but we're ready to run and we understand what it can mean as we continue to unlock footwear, having the right product, the right time, the right price, we believe that we are truly going to be a player there and take this billion plus dollar business that does something really important.","Patrik Frisk","Yeah, it's a great question. And it's a really important one in footwear. And to Kevin's point, we have four different technologies today. And it's really important to us in terms of how that has enabled us to think about segmentation as well this year, to some extent, but even more so going forward.","We believe there is an opportunity for us to add some additional cushioning technology at the very high end of the spectrum. So, we're going to be focused on doing that in the very near future, but we believe that the unlock for footwear for any company is to be able to drive franchises on these platforms. We've demonstrated that we now are starting to understand how to do that and that is definitely, to Kevin's point, one of the unlocks for the company going forward.","Edward Yruma","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Robert Drbul","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just two questions for me. I think the first one is, when you look at the North American market and your performance there, do you have a sight line on when you think you can return to positive growth in North America? And then, the second question that I have is, can you just update us on the margin differential in footwear and apparel and if you've been able to really close the gap between the two? Thanks.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Bob. I'll start this off and I'll hand it off to Dave and he'll give you a little color on the margins. As we think about North America, we haven't changed our thoughts in any way compared to what we told you guys at the investor day in December last year. ","There's a time horizon to how we think about those things. And a lot of that starts with leadership. We have what we believe strong leadership in place. We have a strong go-to-market . We have started to really see the effects of cleansing ourselves in our wholesale channel. We've seen the early success of opening three new brand houses full price in North America in the last quarter. That's the first time we do that in a very, very long time. All three of them are performing at or above plan, which gives us great encouragement for the additional ones we're going to open up next year. And it also shows us that when we show up in the right way as a brand to the end consumer in full price, with the entire breath of our innovation and our brand for them, they respond, which is very encouraging to us. ","So, I think a combination of the work that we're doing in wholesale, the addition of a better work we're doing in our full price stores in North America, in combination with moving on to a new e-com platform and new e-com site next year that's going to greatly enhance our ability to service the customer and layering on top of that the additional marketing that we plan to do. So, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to actually start doing that earlier at the back half of this year, which is a few months earlier than we would have hoped. And a lot of that comes on the back of the stable foundation, the hard work to make sure that we're really doing the work that needs to happen in terms of driving the business the right way.","And with that, I'll hand over to Dave and he'll give you a little color on the margins.","David Bergman","Yeah. Bob, relative to gross margin, we have been working hard driving footwear forward. Some of that is volume. Some of that is the costing improvements we've been driving through with the supply chain efficiencies and the new go-to-market process.","So, over the last few years, we continue to drive forward and increase our footwear gross margin. So, we are closing that gap versus apparel. But it is still a pretty substantial gap at this point. But we are definitely chipping away at it every single year. We're gaining anywhere from 100 basis points to 200 basis points each year on the gross margin increase for footwear. So, we're going to keep driving their forwarding and continue to close that gap.","Thank you Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jim Duffy","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one for me, I wanted to ask about gross margin. You're tracking ahead of pace there. To what extent, guys, do you view that as a pull forward of benefits versus reflective of a new foundation upon which you can continue to see improvement? And what are some of those key levers for improvement as we look around the corner to next year and beyond?","David Bergman","Yeah, Jim. This is Dave. As you think about what we delivered in Q3, obviously, we mentioned the bigger ones, with the lower off-price sales in the quarter and also the continuing supply chain initiatives of product cost and airfreight.","There are a couple of smaller puts and takes too. We saw some smaller benefits from higher connected fitness mix. And so, as you think about what's driving in the Q4, continued channel mix benefits with licensing and a higher DTC mix will help us out in Q4.","The supply chain initiatives are probably the biggest one that carry through the whole year. including Q4, and we expect to carry into 2020 as well with the product costs and lower air freight. So, we're continuing to drive on all those.","And then, as we've mentioned on many of our previous calls, we continue to work towards stepping down our mix of off-price channel, and that's something that we'll continue to do as we step into 2020. So, a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing this year with product costing, with air freight, with stepping off the off-price channel, with higher DTC mix, all of those things should continue to drive forward as we going into 2020 and beyond.","Jim Duffy","Okay, great. And then, you spoke to a planned step up in brand marketing, turn from defense to offense. Can you guys maybe foreshadow some of the marketing initiatives we should be looking for in fourth quarter and into 2020? Is it going to be more brand specific or product specific? Are you planning to spend more digital or more through traditional marketing channels? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.","Patrik Frisk","Yeah. thanks, Jim. This is Patrik. What's really exciting about what we're going to do in Q4 is we're able to spend against more upper funnel brand marketing, which is helpful for us as we'll take learnings from that and enable a more precise spend, if you like, in 2020. But in 2020, it's all going to be about a 360-degree approach to marketing.","So, over the last two-and-a-half years, we've been building capabilities to be competing with other people in our space in terms of how to think about everything from digital to social media, to out of home, whatever you want, and understanding that impact and effect it will have on the consumer that we're focused on.","We weren't able to do that necessarily three or four years ago because we didn't have the capabilities. We have diligently been putting those capabilities in place and we're now starting to understand much better how to unleash them. And that's truly what you'll see in 2020, is a coordinative play, like Kevin said, where we'll go and market ourselves across every channel that we need to market ourselves across to make sure that we're increasing consideration with the consumer. So, it'll be a holistic approach to both upper funnel marketing and also sports moments marketing where you'll see Under Armour show up, where our athletes show up. And so, we're very excited about that.","So, we're really starting the journey in terms of how to think about that little earlier this year, taking the learnings to apply them to do an even better job for 2020.","Kevin Plank","And, Jim, just a little perspective on that too. I'd say, Patrik and I will probably be in alignment that we haven't done that type of top-of-funnel storytelling to our consumer in several years. And so, bringing this back, getting this amplitude \u2013 when you're looking for the from\/to of what's different now versus what can we expect differently going forward is you're going to hear about this brand, you're going to hear us tell our story. That's for sure.","Patrik Frisk","Yeah. That's a great way to say it.","Randy Konik","Great. Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, guys. Paul Lejuez. Can you give a little bit more color on the deceleration in the APAC segment? Just the deceleration you've seen in the first half of the year, any color that you can add by country in terms of where you've seen the biggest drop off, how you're thinking about 4Q and into next year? ","And then, second, curious what drove the CapEx guidance lower for the year. Was there any of that that was a timing shift and just how you're thinking about CapEx for next year as well? Thanks.","David Berman","Sure, Paul. This is Dave. Relative to APAC, the 4% growth in Q3, we had always planned that this was going to be our lowest quarter of the year for APAC. From a channel perspective, DTC does continue to drive growth in both retail and e-commerce which has been great. But timing of shipments have been a little bit more out of Q3 relative to flow with the distributor orders. So, it's more Q2 and Q4 heavy. And then, also with the improved service levels, we're delivering more to the actual demand which puts a little bit more in Q2 and Q4 as well. ","And you can kind of expect that, going forward, as you think about 2020, that the quarterly fall will be a little bit more normalized because those distributor revenues are going to be more heavily weighted in Q2 and Q4. We also have bigger e-commerce events that are normally in Q2 and Q4 as well.","When you think about kind of driving forward through Q4, international, in general, we're continuing to see those improving service levels which is great. We have a larger amount of door openings in Q4, both partner and own doors. And then, also as Patrik mentioned, we finally normalized the Latin America business with that Brazil model change that we've been discussing. So, a lot of factors going into that and seeing that growth for Q4.","When you think about CapEx, to your question there, a couple of things that we've changed a little bit. The full year, we're still driving hard as far as investments in DTC expansion, new APAC office investments, APAC and LatAm SAP investments, all well within our investor day operating principle range of 3% to 5% of revs.","When you think about some of the things that brought down \u2013 why we're guiding -- lowered the 180, some of that is around store build cost efficiencies which have been great to drive through. Some of it's timing of digital initiatives, timing of office renovations and related efficiencies. And then also, some cost savings as we completed our new distribution center here in Baltimore, but some different puts and takes there.","Paul Lejuez","Yeah. Just one follow up on APAC. Anything you'd talk about on country. If you want to take about it in terms of point of sale, where are you seeing the strongest response to product? Maybe talk China specifically, progress there. Anything you can you give on a country by country basis. Thanks.","Patrik Frisk","Yeah. hi, Paul. This is Patrik. When we think about APAC, we're very happy with the performance across APAC actually. And I think the investments we've made that Dave alluded to, which has been expanding the China office and also putting our new Hong Kong headquarter in place, has really enabled our leadership teams there to continue the work that we're doing to really penetrate the market through category and also distribution in terms of opening stores.","As we told you guys at investor day, we're on plan to do exactly that, but also working hard to protect the premium positioning of the brand. And we have been evolving the China business model over the past couple of years, and we're now in a place where we believe we have a really strong foundation in terms of our distributors doing a great job for us there. The leadership team is in place. So, we feel really good.","And I think as an added thing too, I think as it relates to the APAC, we're also very happy with our sourcing model that we have. Only having about 10% of our product that comes into the US being sourced out of China. So, we're protected from that perspective as well. ","So, I think both the front end and the backend is working incredibly well for us in APAC.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Patrik Frisk","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole","Great. Thank you so much. Kevin, just want to ask you about how your day-to-day will change now that your title has changed. If you'd give us some more color on that.","And then, secondly, I know you guys don't talk about weather's impact in 3Q, but it was like the warmest September, I think, [indiscernible]. I wondered if that has an impact on your business.","And then, Kevin, you did mention that you've seen the business accelerate in the last couple of weeks. I assume that's weather related. Can you just talk about what cold weather through November might mean to the business relative to the guidance that you gave? And that's it for me. Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Yeah. Thank you, Jay. So, let me just start by adding some clarity around the decision why, how I got here, 47 year old, what does that mean. My goal is to build \u2013 our goal is to build an eternal brand. And we're not going to stop until that happens which, obviously, that's a long \u2013 that's a self-fulfilling prophecy that's going to keep going forever. You've got to get the flywheel going. And I believe that we started that. But it's also thinking about something that we can do with the brand. As I say, great brands do endure. But setting this up truly for the long term.","Patrik and my partnership has really grown over the last several years. Having the ability to bring in \u2013 and I'm really proud of being able to find someone like Patrik who had the perfect balance of industry experience and expertise with, frankly, just professional maturity, being able to come in and handle a situation where we had to lead into heavy transformation for ourselves as a business and as a brand and going through the last two or three years of really right-sizing this business, getting ourselves in line and seeing some of those benefits come through as things as clear as whether it's inventory or gross margin improvement as reducing what we're doing of taking down \u2013 as we're looking for off-price, of just getting our inventory levels clean and really getting ourselves structured. And the professionalization of the company wasn't meaning that we weren't professional before. It's just taking your company from $5 billion to $10 billion is really different step. ","I want to be clear is that I love Under Armour and it is now today, tomorrow, will always remain my full-time priority and job. I also want to be clear that this is my decision for all those reasons that I've just mentioned and gone through.","And what I think what we have now is the strength that Patrik and I have combined, really creates a force that, I think, is unmatched in our industry and I think it's really unique for business as a whole. And so, the way that we balance that and that we work together tirelessly with each other on communication and making sure that we're aligned, but also making sure that Patrik has the freedom and the ability to lead and do the part that he can, running the day-to-day aspects of the business and really running and managing the business. It will be a partnership. It will continue to move forward.","But as I said, there's three places where I think I'm going to have the best impact and it's not going to be from sort of the, I don't know, how do you say, HR and legal and some of those things, with the ability for me to really focus on the elevating product, amplifying our story, really empowering our team and really simplifying my job description to that of just obsessing on product. ","I've got to spend more than a dozen hours last week in our product line review, and it was just terrific. I brought home one of the shoes, a new product technology we should have out. And I stared at this thing all weekend. It's just the ability for us to think like that in that capacity, I think, is one of the aspects we'd be unlocking.","So, we do pretty well and we put our backs to each other and face that and we're looking forward to that fist fight.","Jay Sole","Great. And then, if you could just talk about the question on the weather in 3Q and 4Q, what you've seen in terms of the acceleration in the last couple of weeks, that would be great. Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Yeah. So, Jay, maybe I can add a little color to that. I think we've seen a gradual acceleration in the back half of this year as there is not just the weather, but actually our execution that's coming to play here too. And we believe that, as we turn the corner into 2020, we're going to be even more well positioned to benefit from the executional aspect of putting the play together, now supporting also with a little bit more purposeful and heavy up marketing effort.","Jay Sole","Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, Jay.","Patrik Frisk","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad","Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First one, I wanted to ask about, last quarter, you had mentioned weaning the consumer of some of the online promotions have been a little bit of a challenge and a drag on the business a little bit. Can you give us an update on where we are on promotionality and getting the customer a little bit more used to the fact that Under Armour is not going to be as on sale that it has been in the last couple of years? And then, I have a follow-up for Kevin.","Patrik Frisk","Yeah, sure. Hi, Omar. This is Patrik. Yeah, that is a balance as you go through the turnaround, if you like, or the transformation. And as you're trying to wash through some of the excess, there's a time component to that, of course, and you're not immune to what's going on around you in the marketplace.","And what we're trying to do as a company is really balancing the two and we'll continue to do so and it's a gradual process. We think we have a good plan for how to do that in beyond 2019 and it will be a gradual process for us.","But, ultimately, what we've been saying all along has been that we're going to drive this brand to a more premier positioning again and we're absolutely determined to do that. So, we'll add a little bit more color perhaps in the next call on that, but I think it's something that we're looking forward to. And depending on where you are in the world and what channel you're in, we're more or less successful with that, and it depends a lot on the type of inventory that we have in the channel.","Omar Saad","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Kevin if I could ask one last question of you. Congrats to you both, by the way. You talked a lot about product and it sounds like you're going to be a lot more focused and that sounds where a lot of your passion lies. Maybe you could talk a little bit at a higher level how the Under Armour approach to building product, product lines and platforms has evolved from the earlier days and how your role will fit in? Thanks.","Kevin Plank","Yeah. Thank you, Omar. I think just adding some holistic perspective to what's happened over the last several years here \u2013 and we use the word transformation. Really repositioning our business, restructuring, reorganizing, reshadowing the processes, so that we can be clear and make sure that there's not double work happening as we just get as efficiently and lean as possible.","You can tell that my energy, of course, it fits within the dream and the vision that we have for product, but one of the best things we did is we implemented a go-to-market process. We implemented a global operating model and creating the four regions with APAC, EMEA, Latin America and North America.","We also went to category management, which really allows us to put the consumer at the center of everything we do, both men's and women's to allow us to really align ourselves. And this process is \u2013 I've mentioned before, heard people talk about sort of that growth of getting to $5 billion. Getting to $5 billion was something that we roughly got close to it around 2016 and then we've been fighting. And since that time, since the end of 2016, we're telling you that we're going to grow our revenues nearly half a billion dollars over that period of time through all this transformation and some of the things we've had to do with the restructuring charges, the pain that we had to go through with things like risk for our teammates, of just getting this business set up and organized.","I think we say really quieting the company and amplifying the brand, that is truly the goal that we have for this next chapter. And I really feel like we're set up for it. We just need to start running the play and running the same play over and over, which is why decisions like, that to be done eventually should be done immediately.","I'm thinking about Patrik and the ability that he's brought to our team and looking and saying that he can be a better CEO at this point in time than I could be. And being able to I think always put the brand first. And I think that's where we are right now from a structure standpoint. And it is something that we can look out several years and say there's no imminent change. As Patrik likes to say, the plan is still the plan. You see our management team. You see the structure we have in place. We're calling the play and now it's a matter of us executing.","And the good thing about this, there isn't a massive change coming. It's a matter of us just putting our heads down and really going to work, and that's what we look forward to doing, I think, in this next chapter as we head and move in through the end of 2019 and really head forward into 2020.","So, Under Armour is ready to run. It's tough getting to $5 billion, I'll tell you, in this industry. It's a reason why there's only a couple, three or four companies that have done it at this point. But we're looking forward to the next chapter and we're set up and we're ready to build and be that great brand that we talk about so often.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Best of luck.","Kevin Plank","Thank you very much.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Jared Orr","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Jared Orr on for John. You gave some cover surrounding the shifts out of Q3 into the Q2 and Q4 based on the service improvements. I was wondering if you either quantify that or talk about what products that that is benefiting and what geographies?","David Bergman","Yeah, Jared. This is Dave. We don't actually quantify that. We're just trying to give a little bit of extra color. The majority of that, we've expected as we planned out the year. A fair amount of it is international with distributor flow and that being more heavily weighted to Q2 and Q4, but then also, again, those service levels improvements, when you think about the product that we would be shipping in late June, early July and the product we ship in late December versus early January, those are the two phases where improving service levels can be most impactful in a good way. And it's the play we want to continue to run as we go into 2020.","So, those amounts are not dramatic, but they're not that we want to note and give extra color around that and we're going to continue to drive forward and, hopefully, we can continue to operationally improve each month as we move forward.","Jared Orr","Thanks. One quick follow-up. Are you guys taking any pricing, especially with the tariffs coming forward?","David Bergman","Right now, we're in a very good position. We've been very proactive starting years back and kind of mitigating the amount that we import into the US from China. So, we feel pretty good about that. Relative to all the enacted tariff policies that are out there with List 3 and List 4A and 4B, all of that's considered in our outlook and we feel like we're in a really good spot. So, we're working with our vendors and continue to drive forward in our sourcing strategy. But we're well prepared for it.","Jared Orr","Yeah, thank you.","David Bergman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Lance Allega","Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Under Armour\u2019s first quarter 2018 results. Participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all of which can be found on our website at uabiz.com.","During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning\u2019s release. We use non-GAAP amounts as lead in some of our discussions because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to amounts in accordance with US GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-US GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables including the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management\u2019s view of why this information is useful to investors.","Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Under Armour Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and our Chief Operating [ph] Officer, Dave Bergman. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Lance and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today's call by revisiting something you've heard us say a few times over the past year, Under Armour is a great brand and a good company. As a growing global brand, our core purpose and reason for existing is athletic performance. Through a relentless pursuit of innovation and compelling experiences, our vision is to inspire you to performance solutions you never knew that you needed and can't imagine living without. An endless pursuit, our mission is to make you better. As we deliver on this mission, and the Under Armour brand continues to gain even greater visibility, respect and consideration globally, we are amplifying our investments in innovation to ensure our product pipeline is in a better position to constantly delight our consumers moving forward. ","As a company, there is no question that 2017 and 2018 make up one of the most challenging, yet opportunistic periods in our history. In the midst of this inflection point, we are holistically transforming the company to ensure that the consumer is always first, simplifying our operations, increasing speed across our global ecosystem and prioritizing investments based on return. The ultimate goal, greater agility, decisiveness and ability to drive long term profitability through consistent and repeatable execution. Over time, we have every confidence that the work we are doing to reposition and engineer our company will deliver an even stronger brand for our consumers and retail partners, while simultaneously creating greater consistency and therefore confidence in Under Armour as an investment choice for our shareholders. ","Our first quarter results should be taken as an indicator that we are making solid progress against these goals. Global revenue was up 6%, driven by a 17% increase in our direct consumer business and a 27% increase in our international business. These strengths were tempered by a relatively flat result in North America. While Dave will dive deeper into the quarter and balance of the year, at the highest level, we are executing well against both our transformation and operating plans. Accordingly, with today's report, we are reiterating our full year 2018 outlook. Using the four pillars of our long term strategy, product, story, service and team, I'd like to take a few minutes to run through some examples of the progress we're making.","Starting with product. With our category management structure now in place in putting the consumer at the center of development, design and usage occasion, we are obsessing every stitch, function and finishing detail of our products to the distinct sport category lens of the consumer athlete. Equally important as creating innovative product are our distribution and segmentation strategies. ","Going to market with significantly less SKUs, optimized margin targets and meaningfully shorter calendars means our ability to segment gets sharper with each new season. Given historically long lead times, 2018 sees a hybrid of both old and new processes coming to market. As we get deeper into this year, we're excited to unlock the power of the category management structure combined with our improved go to market process, all of which strengthens our ability to execute more effectively across innovation, design, supply chain, marketing and sales.","Few examples of how our go to market has changed during this hybrid period include our ColdGear reactor, and unstoppable apparel collections as well as our signature Curry 4, Curry 5 and Speed 2 footwear releases. Additionally, UA HOVR Phantom and Sonic running footwear along with the new UA Project Rock collection have already virtually sold through. There are other examples as well and certainly more to come in the second half, but all in, it's good validation of what we're capable of when we're firing on all cylinders.","Our second pillar is story and how we connect, demonstrate and inspire athletes to make them better. On our last call, we spoke about being a louder brand and we're doing just that. To support the launch of our UA HOVR technology platform in the first quarter, we used the first two expressions of Phantom and Sonic to drive a technical cushioning story for the running category. ","In this effort, we have three objectives: increase brand awareness, establish deeper credibility with runners and drive reverence through experience and conversion. As our first ever synchronized and digital only global launch, this effort has far exceeded our initial goals for engagement. UA.com visits perception scores and sell through. Building our credibility and awareness in these important long term growth drivers, running in footwear and at just three months in, we couldn't be more pleased. ","And when you factor in our training campaign, which just launched, an effort featuring a number of UA athletes including Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, Natasha Hastings, Dennis Smith Jr., Zoe Zhang and Jessie Graf to name just a few, we've realized more than 1 billion impressions between these two campaigns. We are definitely focused on being a louder brand this year. Both products and launches for UA HOVR and training are executed under our new go to market framework and continue to elevate our brand by engaging consumers globally in ways that delight and inspire to make them better.","Looking out over the year ahead and we're excited that this is just the edge of a flywheel that will continue to build momentum from here forward. With respect to service and how we deliver to our consumers directly into our key wholesale customers, we are working under the objective of continuous improvement. Following last summer's ERP upgrade, we have greater visibility into our business in ways we did not before. From factory orders and warehouse receipts to sell in and sell through, we\u2019re gaining greater clarity with respect to forecasting and inventory management, all of this is working toward optimizing our ability to reach consumers as quickly and effectively as possible through better service levels.","This is a work in progress and I'm very proud of the effort our team is putting forth to make service once again a center of excellence for our brand. And speaking of team, as competitors, we like to win, but also know that winning isn't a given. The tough decisions, hard work and incremental improvements that we are making are moving us in the right direction. This team is hungry, knows what we're capable of becoming and we're putting in the effort day in and day out to ensure that we deliver on the expectations among all stakeholders, including consumers, customers and shareholders.","In summary, our operational transformation and long term strategy to architect a global operating model capable of driving sustainable and profitable growth is on the right track with where we expected to be. Heads down and focused, executing smartly and building muscle to win. We are playing the long game and we are the best at getting better.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrik.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Kevin. Since I joined Under Armour last July, we've gone through a significant amount of. Change in business is constant, inevitable and necessary, especially when you grow and scale as quickly as we have. How a company and its culture choose to embrace change determines its ability to succeed. In this respect, our entrepreneurial routes and athletic DNA continue to serve us well in executing against our aspirational and operational goals. We know who we are, where we are and what it will take to emerge as an even stronger brand and company. ","This result along with strengthening competencies and the agility necessary to better advantage the scale we\u2019ve built puts us in increasingly better position to win. Fundamentally, this transformation starts and ends with athletes and our ability to solve their needs through the innovative performance product we create. With insights and analytics from our global consumer segmentation study, we continue to prioritize our resources and investments to support our largest global growth opportunities, while also driving toward higher long term rates of return across the entire portfolio. ","Understanding our consumers\u2019 journey, the way they work out, eat and sleep and how they engage the Under Armour brand digitally, socially and as a purchase consideration further validates our strategy and gives us permission to capitalize on our strength in athletic performance. Accordingly, we have identified white space occasions in the existing market landscape as well as opportunities to increase marketplace capacity or more directly fight for incremental parts of the pie, while driving growth in the overall pie. ","It's important to note that we consider this approach to be fairly channeled and region agnostic, especially given the size of our most direct competition and their existing distribution, direct consumer and international footprints, let alone, an incredible distortion toward footwear. No matter how the data is cut, there's substantial difference in size, scope and scale and regardless being smaller affords agility as a company and more directly authenticity and community as a brand. ","So to support all of this, we're also driving meaningful improvements in our supply chain and our overall speed to market with several initiatives geared at improving elements of both the income statement and the balance sheet. From vendor based consolidation, flow optimization and tighter inventory buys, this translates to considerably fewer SKUs, improved capacity utilization and a reduction in lead times. For our customers, this means less complexity to merchandise our product, better service and a healthier business model. For our consumers, it means increased product flow with performance solutions they didn't know they needed and can't imagine living without.","Switching gears, I would like to add some color into how we performed across our business globally in the quarter. First, revenue in North America was essentially flat at 868 million or 73% of global revenue with a slight wholesale decline being offset by growth in our direct consumer business. This result was better than we had expected, primarily due to inventory management actions and higher service levels and this does not impact our full year expectation for this region. As we continue to work through inventories coming out of the second half of 2017, we are confident in our ability to become a healthier business in North America, but it will take time and a disciplined execution against our plan, which is exactly what we're doing.","In EMEA, revenue was up 23% to 127 million or 11% of global revenue with balanced growth across wholesale and direct consumer, including particularly strong growth in the UK and solid results in Spain and Italy. As we continue to build our presence in this important market, we're proud to officially welcome Massimo Baratto on his first day as Under Armour's Vice President and Managing Director of the region. Based in Amsterdam, we look forward to Massimo grabbing the reins and helping to drive more profitable growth, brand awareness and strategic partnerships across the region. ","Revenue in Asia Pacific was up 35% to 116 million, representing 10% of global revenue in the quarter. This region also saw a strong balanced growth in both the wholesale and direct consumer sides of the business and continued significant momentum in China. Building off Kevin's earlier comments, on the Global Campaign for UA HOVR, I\u2019d be remiss not to point out that China got the largest allocation of product at launch time. ","This is a testament to knowing our consumer and their demand profile, investing in areas with the highest rates of return and overall utilizing our global scale to significantly amplify our brand. With the combination of adding more than 200 doors this year and the highest distortion of e-commerce as a percent of revenue of any of our businesses around the world, we remain bullish on China.","And finally, revenue for Latin America was up 21% to 47 million or about 4% of total revenue. In this region, we're focused on optimizing our mix of the right partners and businesses with certain countries to better control the brand and drive high return. The continued momentum in Mexico and Chile along with expansion in Argentina and Colombia give us a wide berth to tackle these dynamic markets while protecting the brand.","So to close, a little less than a year into my role here at Under Armour, knowing what I know today, what I see ahead and how this company, this team and this brand are building best of class professionalism into everything we execute against, I'm thrilled with the progress we're making and the opportunity to help lead this brand.","Dave?","Dave Bergman","Thanks, Patrik. Given today's results and the reiteration of our full year outlook, we feel confident in the progress we are making against our short term strategies to become more operationally efficient and thus the foundation we are setting to become a more sustainable and profitable business in the long run. Before we dive into the first quarter, I\u2019d like to provide some context around the 2018 restructuring plan and the one-time items that impacted us.","As announced on February 13, we're estimating pretax restructuring and related charges of approximately 110 million to 130 million in 2018. In the first quarter, we recognized 45 million of these charges, comprised of 32 million in cash and 13 million in non-cash related charges. Revenue in the first quarter was up 6% to 1.2 billion or up 4%, if you exclude the impacts of foreign currency. ","Clicking down, let's start with revenue by channel. Our wholesale business was up 1% to 779 million, driven by strong results in our international business. This was tempered by a slight decline in North America, which was a better than expected result due primarily to the factors Patrik noted. Direct to consumer revenue grew 17% to 352 million, driven by continued strong results in our international and global e-commerce businesses. DTC was 30% of total global revenue in the quarter.","Licensing was up 9% to 26 million, primarily driven by growth in our youth and Japanese businesses. By region, revenue in North America was essentially flat at 868 million, which was better than our expectations for the quarter, based on factors we mentioned earlier. On a currency neutral basis, North America revenue was down 1%. Our international business continued its strong and balanced growth, posting a 27% increase in revenue to reach 289 million or 24% of total revenue in the first quarter. On a currency neutral basis, international revenue was up 20%. And finally, our connected fitness business was up 34%, driven by increases in subscription and advertising revenue. ","Turning to gross margin, on a GAAP basis, we saw 120 basis point decline to 44.2% in the first quarter. Excluding the restructuring, which contained about 60 basis points of inventory impacts, adjusted gross margin was 44.8%. To walk through the components of the decline, adjusted gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 130 basis points of channel mix due to a higher composition of off price sales related to inventory management initiatives. This was partially offset by about 70 basis points of tailwinds from changes in foreign currency.","SG&A expense increased 3% to 515 million, driven by continued investments in our DTC, footwear and international businesses. Additionally, a meaningful amount of marketing expenses associated with our new training campaign shifted into the second quarter. First quarter operating loss was 29 million. Excluding the restructuring, adjusted operating income was 16 million. Interest and other expense was 5 million, which was better than expected due primarily to beneficial changes in foreign currency.","Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 12%. Excluding restructuring charges, the adjusted tax rate was approximately 93%. As a reminder, the weight of discrete international items recorded in certain foreign markets are particularly impactful to our effective tax rate in periods like the first quarter, which has smaller consolidated pretax income or loss levels. ","Taken this to the bottom line, net loss was 30 million or $0.07 loss in diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. Excluding restructuring impacts, adjusted net income was approximately 1 million and adjustability diluted EPS broke even. On our balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were up 65% to 284 million. Total debt was up 1% to 921 million. Capital expenditures were down 46% to 35 million and inventory was up 27% to 1.1 billion.","Relative to accounts receivable, which was up 28%, it is important to note that during the quarter, we had opted ASC 606, a new revenue recognition standard. Due to this change, a large portion of reserves that were previously recorded as offsets to gross accounts receivable are now being classified within other areas of the balance sheet. Without the accounting principles change in 2018, our accounts receivable for the first quarter would have declined 16% on a comparable basis.","With respect to full year 2018, we are reiterating the outlook provided on February 13. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I want to provide some color on the balance of the year. Based on factors previously discussed, we now expect second quarter revenue growth to be similar to the first quarter as we continue to execute against our inventory management initiatives. We expect all of our gross margin improvement to come in the back half of the year due to anticipated shift in back half channel mix, driven by a lower planned composition of off price sales and higher DTC mix, coupled with continued product costing improvements.","We expect SG&A to be up at a low double digit rate in the second quarter, driven by the marketing shift I mentioned earlier, efforts to support our global UA HOVR and training campaigns and store expenses associated with the expansion of our international DTC. In total, when taken in to context for the first half of 2018, SG&A should grow at a rate slightly higher than the rate of revenue growth.","Second quarter adjusted operating loss is expected to be approximately 30 million and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be a loss of $0.09 to $0.10. With respect to inventory, on our last call, we indicated that we thought our first half ending inventory would be consistent with our prior year end inventory growth of 26%. Given our accelerated actions, we're now expecting inventory growth at the end of our second quarter to be up less than 20%, so better than our previous expectation and then should move more in line with revenue growth by the end of the year. And as a reminder, we anticipate the majority of our restructuring charges to be recorded in the first half of 2018.","That concludes our prepared remarks. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Kevin, you started the conversation by saying Under Armour is a great brand, but a good company. And I was just wondering what is your definition today of what a great company is and how do we get Under Armour through that to that standard and maybe help us think about the sequencing of that pass over time, given that 2018 is a hybrid year?","Kevin Plank","I think it's probably -- it's a two part answer, which is probably art and science. And so let me actually let Patrik kick it off and start with some of the science and what we're doing and then I would put all that together.","Patrik Frisk","Yeah. So, hi. I think one of the big changes that I talked about as I opened my script today has been around a structure in terms of how we think about category management, streamlining and really optimizing our entire organization to ensure that we're more agile, flexible and actually faster as well. The process that we\u2019ve put in place, as it relates to go to market, has been dramatic for the company. You have seen some of that starting to come through in the HOVR campaign and our current training campaign which we're very, very satisfied with. How we're driving our [indiscernible] to support our go to market and also now through our innovation funnel, that's tying into the go to market funnel, so driving more upstream in terms of future innovations that we're very, very excited about. ","And then of course being consumer led. We've done a lot of work around the consumer, understanding the consumer from a global perspective, both the space that we're competing in, but also the consumer through our massive global consumer segmentation study of over 22,000 people around the world and then editing and really amplifying, prioritizing, reallocating resources to the categories that we want to drive the most and then just making sure that we're segmenting our product much better as well as we do that and driving stronger financial discipline in everything that we do thinking more around ROIC, making sure we're prioritizing investments, as I said, and becoming more EPS driven as we go forward, all these things together really driving a more holistic approach through the entire organization as what we believe is going to make us really great.","I don\u2019t know if you want to add something to that, Kevin.","Kevin Plank","Yeah. I think as I close my script, I use the words that we're playing the long game and what's really important I think is for, everyone understand what it means is 23 years in business, 13 as a public company and sort of the moment where we are today, there's a reason why in our industry, there's only a couple or a few companies that have made it through this $5 billion level. It's because the force of nature, force of will that sort of gets you to this moment means that process and structure and systems are what must become a part of the way that we operate and how we do business and that's why I wanted Patrik to kick that answer off.","But I want you know is that the DNA that got this brand to where it is today is something that\u2019s still very much a part of what and who we are. So when we say Under Armour is a great brand and a good company, it means that we just have so much runway of opportunity to be a much better company and that's what we\u2019re focused on now. That's what 2017 was about and that's what 2018 is about as well. We mentioned what we've brought to bear with the changes made in 2017 of standing up our category management structure that we have, which is a huge undertaking, implementing our new systems with SAP and then also what we've done with the addition of Patrik coming and help us to really work out and work through our go to market process.","And so we're putting those pieces in place. As far as it relates to what the company is doing, what I'm focused as the CEO of the brand is something that the four pillars that really founded this company, product, story, service and team, they highlight and they lay out an architect really, the structure that we're going to use to go forward for our strategy as a brand and as a company. We need to make better product. We just need to make the best product. That's what put Under Armour on the map and that's what we do today, but we need to make sure that it comes through at every touch point in places where we can be better like footwear. ","We see a massive opportunity there and the good news is that we put the pieces in place and the best news is that we have the team to execute on it. Our story is great simple story that comes across explaining our product. Service is something that, it was a push force in 2017 because we've reached a breaking point with our systems that we had implemented a new ERP system and those are the kind of things which are herculean in nature to take on, but once you have them in, you start seeing the progress and you see yourself getting better, which is why I say we're turning to making service a center of excellence for this company. ","And then of course like, as I just mentioned, the idea of team. These four things really define the strategy, literally define the strategy that we've laid out for our total company. And when I look and think how am I going to spend my time and this is a long answer for what you ask now, but I think it unlocks a bit of what we want to say is number one, raising the product bar, making the best product in the world. That's what Under Armour is and that unique positioning of that every product does something is what gave us permission to be to begin with.","Second is amplifying the brand as we talk about being a loud brand and a quiet company. We want to amplify the story of this brand to make sure that people heard us and we don't think we were very loud in 2017. And so you'll hear us tell our stories and then finally, where I focus is on, a, the team, the team, the team, and the best thing that I can do to build that team is to ensure that we have the right culture here. So what you're seeing is this entire rebuild in this company of taking the best aspects that we had that allowed us to get to where we are today and amplifying those to the company that we intend to be and I'm really proud of the team, what they've done and I think this is a quarter as a great sentiment of us being put our heads down, chopping wood, going to work and you'll continue to see and feel that from us.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies.","Randy Konik","Thanks a lot. Just on the inventory. The up 27%, can you give us a little bit of maybe perspective or insight on what the composition of that is and how much of it will go into an off priced channel or are subject to mark down? And then relatedly, as you think about like SKU proliferation or reducing SKU count, do you think that being, just the higher SKU count was partly what led to the inventories being elevated and when you think about some of these product wins with the HOVR, the Project Rock and the Curry 5, how do you think about amplifying the supply chain because these products are sold out either on your own website or in footlocker.com. So when you kind of think -- get these wins, how are you trying to figure out ways to amplify the supply chain and manufacturing capabilities to kind of get those products in a bigger scale out in the marketplace. Thanks.","Dave Bergman","Randy, this is Dave. Relative to inventory, we're not actually going to give the composition, but we talked a lot about the overhang that we had from late 2017 and we're clearly actively moving against that, especially in the first half of this year and we're making a lot of progress there, we've got great partners that we work with on the offprice channel and it's not just in North America, we're doing some things around the world too to make sure we spread it out in a brand right way and really get after and move forward to get cleaner towards the back half of the year. ","So, you will see our inventory growth rates get more in check. We're doing more relative to how we're going to lay in Q2 on inventory growth and again, I think as we get towards the back half and towards the end of the year, much more in line with revenue growth. So, we would not expect to carry a lot of inventory or challenge the inventory into \u201919 at all and that's really one of our goals in \u201918. ","Relative to SKU count, I\u2019ll let Patrik touch on that a little bit more, but obviously every time there's less SKUs, that's more or less locations in our DH, it's less product we have to order. So there's a lot of different puts and takes there, but generally that's going to be a big benefit as well.","Patrik Frisk","Yeah. I think SKU \u2013 hi, Randy and this is Patrik. So I think the SKU count is of course really important to us. We talk a lot about SKU count, but the reality is of course we're not just managing our SKU countdown. We're also doing the same thing as it relates to materials, trims and all the other things that come with it. What it's actually enabling us to do is also be more specific about our segmentation. So it's actually helping our segmentation because we're now and through our go to market building into the line versus creating product and then trying to assort it through the line. ","So we're being much more specific about the intent of every product that we have. We\u2019re also being much more specific about the amount of product that we're making. So, call out on HOVR being sold out. It's not necessarily a bad problem to have right. So -- and it's maybe not one that we've had so much of lately, but I think as we think about the future and future releases, the way that we dealt with the HOVR campaign, first of all, it was our first totally digital campaign from a 360 degree perspective. It was global and what's so encouraging for us is that the sellthroughs were similar across the world. In other words, it was a success wherever we launched the product. ","We're now building off that methodology and also that platform to some extent, as it relates to HOVR, but we've also got other things coming down the pipeline and that's now a new methodology for us also in terms of how we think about segmentation, segmenting, the right product at the right channel and actually making the right amount of product for each product. ","So, of course, the intent is not to always be sold out, but it's certainly part of the game here and a game plan, the long game is to really make sure that we're managing our franchisees going forward as it relates not just to apparel, which we have traditionally done fairly well, but also in footwear and that's kind of a new muscle for us, but we're learning fast and we're getting faster, better -- much faster than we thought we would. And like Kevin usually says, we\u2019re the best at getting better and when we're going to be proving that out in terms of our footwear and apparel as it relates to the SKU maximization and efficiencies that we're building.","Randy Konik","And does SKU count have to come down equally between footwear and apparel or is one category being more distorted versus the other in terms of getting more focused on the SKU count side and can HOVR be more or less like the company's boost moment, if you will, like, do you see this technology in this and the style that you're seeing resonate with the consumer as an opportunity to kind of scale it out more to more kind of aligns with the technology and utilizing the design that\u2019s been I guess a success in the marketplace to kind of go forward with the footwear franchise?","Patrik Frisk","Yeah. We think HOVR is definitely a really important platform for us. We also have Charge and Micro G, two other platforms. We now have three strong platforms we believe in our tool bag, in our tool kit, we believe we can continue to build on HOVR. You've just seen the first iteration of HOVR. We have some really exciting stuff coming down the pipeline, but we're being very, very careful and deliberate in terms of how we think about that going forward. So yes, we believe it's a strong platform. It's resonated with consumer, functionally, performance wise, it's outstanding and we\u2019ll continue to build on it and we believe it has lots of runway and lots of legs in terms of what we can do with it. So it's certainly one of the platforms. I also talked about the innovation pipeline. We have very exciting things coming down the line also to complement HOVR going forward. So very exciting, but that's I guess is one way to look at it is one of the new strong platforms and footwear for Under Armour going forward.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of Omar Saad of Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Kevin, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about the evolution of the brand and how consumers perceive it and the strategy around the brand positioning, especially as you kind of go through the transition on the business side. Maybe where the brand is coming from and where you'd like it to go in the marketplace, keeping in mind maybe address, style versus performance fashion versus performance, as you think about the strategy for the brands specifically. And Patrik maybe you have something to add as well? Thanks guys.","Kevin Plank","Yeah. Thanks, Omar and good to catch up. And I really enjoy this opportunity to just explain to people sort of where we are. When you look at the continuum of the journey of this company, we're really fortune about our moment in time, because every company has to evolve the saying, you've got a small company, you\u2019re a mid-sized company becoming a large business and we spent a lot of time as a small company that could compete and use that as an advantage and then we became a big company that net-net with others in our industry are a smaller good company. ","So we have to create the centers of excellence that give us the ability to compete in a different way and that means everything from our global scale to our product engine to creating a go to market process to frankly the partners that we do business with. And where you find us right now when you talk about the evolution from performance of what it means to be where the market is today, where it is much more broader and open as to the sport style attitude the consumer is looking for, we can answer that. Sports style isn\u2019t a place or lifestyle isn\u2019t a place, it's just everything that you do and so the evolution for our company isn't one thing that you -- we would -- anyone would want us to point out, it's just everything of who we are and how we create product. ","When I think of where we're going now, we've heard a lot of conversation around our product pipeline and our innovation pipeline. I just want to be clear is that innovation is like the core of this company. And I talked about the two components of what gives Under Armour the reason to be. I said number one is that every product that we make does something. That's a unique position that's very different than other brands. I mean when you pick it up, if it's Under Armour, it better be special, it makes that Under Armour is not just the logo on it, the fact that the consumer will ask the question of sometime, well, what to do.","The second thing is that when you look in our category is that our competitors have done a really good job and they have captured hearts and minds of consumers globally and there's just not a lot of brands that are positioned to do that. And so take the first point of everything doing something and take the second point, but the fact that we can do it from a credible basis of the fact that we are authentic, our brand was born on field. ","We understand the athlete and what you're hearing from us say today is our focus with what we're doing with the demand sensor growth and really dialing ourselves into, living at the hearts and souls and minds of every consumer that we want to do business with, that was our switch to category management and now have a nine distinct leaders that are focused on these categories who will make a difference of staying as close to consumer as possible. ","So building ourselves with that and then building product that is relevant and makes sense for them is something that we are highly, highly motivated to doing and then watching it come out and watching the go to market calendar come together and watching all these touch points to be able to express themselves is an incredibly powerful, powerful place for this brand to be. So we're fortunate to have the size and scale of a $5 billion business that as you can see is stabilized and what we're doing now is now, we're getting really good. ","We're going to build muscle, we\u2019re going to get strong and you\u2019re going to watch us grow in the way that we're going to define growth in the short term, there is going to be growth from the bottom line and how we\u2019re focused on becoming a really good business is that we're not concerned with how do we grow the top line today. We're focused on how do we become an incredibly profitable company that is delivering the best products to our consumer, delivering them great value at the same time. So we are hyper focused on that and as we get strong, you\u2019ll continue to watch us march forward and the good news we're doing this a way that's pretty, pretty balanced.","Patrik Frisk","And I think something that should give you some confidence, I guess, Omar is if you think about the HOVR campaign that we just launched a few months ago, that was launched without any specific asset or athlete per se or persona, right. It was launched in digital, it was launched endemic, it was launched as a performance product targeted at a specific end consumer and it was a tone of voice at every touch point with the great build up and when we did release it, it's all true. So yes, of course, we have been too quiet. We believe we're now ramping up and becoming a louder brand and a more quiet company and in doing so, when we do have the right product, the right style and when we communicated with the right story, the consumer is there for us. ","I see it also with the Project Rock that we have just launched recently that's basically sold out across the world. In that case, we're also able to do it with the right asset or with Curry, that's really working well for us, both the Curry 4 and the Curry 5 that we're releasing as well as looking forward into this year later, later in this year, with Curry 6. So we're able to do both, so we've built this new muscle now in the company that we're starting to really be able to drive harder and like Kevin says, the performance aspect of this brand, which might be looked upon as bit of a weakness for us at this point in time in the marketplace we believe is going to be our longest term strength, if you like.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward Yruma","Kevin, you talked a lot about becoming a louder brand. I guess how should we expect you to kind of articulate the stories of Under Armour? Should we expect this loudness to kind of be in tandem with innovation that you launched and I guess are there particular channels that you think are effectively \u2013 that are most effective in this environment? And then maybe one other follow up. There is the -- on the balance sheet, a customer refund liability, is that tied to the accounting change?","Kevin Plank","I think being a loud brand, it it's not about a big campaign, it's not about assigning, it's about a great product. Everything that we do, when we make great products, we win. When we get behind something, we win. So what you saw and I don't want to run it ad nauseam, but you've heard us talk about HOVR and the success that we've seen there and that's a first step, but the first step began with, it's a terrific product that at first glance, it is something that consumer wants to buy and wants to wear and put on their foot. The good news is that it also engages, it's got a terrific fit to it as well as it's got incredible performance from the step and cushion and comfort and feel that you feel in the shoe and also the fact that it's connected and a part of our 230 million person ecosystem that we have at connected fitness. ","So it's really the trifecta of style, performance and fit that come together that allows us to become a louder brand when that happens. At the same time, we want to continue to press on that pipeline of innovation and we want to make sure that our customers are winning with unique and segmented products and if there is anything I want you to take off of this call is our focus on segmenting our line and ensure that each and every distribution partner or channel that we're in is something that's unique and positioned with the right product at the right price at the right time for the consumer. ","So we feel like we've made great strides in making that happen beyond just being, launching product into the market in the spring and in the fall, but truly becoming a company that is channel specific and more importantly customer specific with differentiated products. Now again, we've heard a lot of, I just want to be clear, and this is an opportunity for us to get to speak a little bit about what we see out there. So from our product pipeline, we're incredibly intrigued and enthused about the products we have coming down like the expansion you'll see and feel with HOVR. We also are very excited about the partners we are doing business with today. Our goal is never to trade distribution or to trade partners. ","We want everybody to grow and that means creating platforms as Patrik said like HOVR, like Charge, like Micro G that we have of differentiating our partners by the end use as well as what the correct and proper price point is. And so we're very proud of the partnerships we have in place. We have the right amount of distribution and we tend and expect to amplify each and every one of those customers to make them great. DICK'S Sporting Goods is going to be great with Under Armour in their stores and we\u2019ll be stronger with it and we've got a number of other partners in the same thing that we look to do in the mall channel, the same thing in every channel we're doing business. ","So we're not adding any new channels at this time, we just look to make everywhere we're doing business now, we want to amplify it, we want amplify the story and the way we're going to do that with terrific product at a fair and reasonable price for the consumer, that gives them something that they never thought they never knew they needed and then once they have it, wonder how they ever live without it.","Dave Bergman","And Edward, this is Dave. On the second part of your question relative to the customer refund liability, you are correct. That's just an accounting standard change that we had to implement in Q1 of \u201918 that ASC 606. So not really any business change of any kind there. It's just a reclassification in 2018 and going forward. So we adopted that prospectively, so that used to be an amount relative to returns reserve, et cetera that used to net down gross accounts receivable and so you wouldn't actually see that individual amount would be in the net AR in 2017. And that prospectively with the new accounting rule change, we\u2019re showing that separately in 2018 and going forward.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy","The commentary around the inventory expectations is encouraging. If we look at the composition of the gross margin compression we've seen over the last few years, and year to date for that matter, it's been a function of liquidation as inventories better match with demand, how do you guys see the prospects for gross margin recapture, is that unreasonable to think that gross margin could get back into the high-40s as supply is better matched with demand.","Dave Bergman","Jim, this is Dave. It's a good call out and I think you'll see just as you play out our gross margin outlook for this year, obviously in Q1, it was more pressured as we're moving forward on dealing with some of that overhang inventory and we're going to be doing some of that again in Q2. And then in the back half of the year is where you see our gross margin improvements, because you're not going to see as much of a large year-over-year composition of the offprice channel as we get healthier there. ","And then obviously the plan would be that as we move into 2019 and beyond, we're going to be healthier from an inventory perspective and from an excess creation perspective, relative to all the go to market and supply chain initiatives that we're working on that Patrik mentioned and the supply chain team is working on as well, so we are excited about \u201919 and beyond. We're not going to get into that level of detail right now, but between supply chain changes and how we're getting tighter on the buys coupled with continued costing improvements that the supply chain is driving through with our vendor base, we're definitely excited about 19 and beyond and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking to that more at Investor Day towards the end of the year.","Jim Duffy","Great. And then a follow up on that, with the SKU management and the tightening of lead times also suggests working capital as a source of cash. Dave, any thoughts on cash flow opportunity from tightening the working capital management.","Dave Bergman","Yeah. Great question and definitely one that we are much more focused on now and going forward. This year, 2018 is still going to be a little bit of a fight, as we're dealing through the restructuring charges and the fact that probably about 80% of those restructuring charges are cash related. But as we get into \u201919 and beyond, when you do think about tighter inventory management and you think about not having the cash impact of restructuring charges in addition to heightened focus across the company on working capital Management and CapEx prioritization, you should see meaningful improvements there and we're driving it through from a longer term free cash flow improving, but also longer term and even more focused on ROIC improvement.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird.","Jonathan Komp","Dave, first, I want to just clarify a couple of things on the guidance. Q2 for gross margin. I know Q1 was down just under 60 basis points year-over-year, how do you expect Q2 to trend relative to that? Will it be down that much or any thoughts there? And then I know previously you talked about SG&A growth being half weighted for the year. Assuming that's still the case, can you just walk through some of the puts and takes for the first half versus the second half.","Dave Bergman","Yeah. I mean on gross margin, we didn't give specific guidance to Q2. There would still be some pressures in Q2 as we continue to deal with the inventory management initiatives to get us cleaner going into the back half of the year. Still see some of that pressure in Q2 and then when you think about the back half of the year, we\u2019re definitely going to have the lower year-over-year North America offprice sales in back half, which is going to help year over year margin in back half. ","Also the improved costing is really going to be kicking in, so we talked about that a little bit on the last call and also a little bit towards the end of last year, but a lot of the initiatives that the supply chain is driving through and working with our vendors, consolidating vendors, increasing volume, working on better costing transparency with our vendors, a lot of those initiatives you're going to start to see those come to light and the actual inventory being received in those purchase orders for the back half of this year. ","So that's going to help a little bit as a tailwind in back half of this year. And then you'll see some smaller benefits relative to regional mix with North America and Asia-Pac and then also DTC mix will be a little bit higher, back half of this year versus \u201917 as well. So, a couple of different things going in our favor in the back half that are going to help out with that gross margin.","Jonathan Komp","And maybe just to clarify that point Dave, I know if you assume revenue growth close to Q1, SG&A up low double digits, it's hard to embed a lot greater pressure on gross margin than you saw in Q1 and maybe even less. So I just wanted to make sure they were at particularly around that was clear.","Dave Bergman","Yeah Jonathan, that's fair. You probably won't see as much pressure on gross margin in Q2 as you did see in Q1. So that's fair.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. Great. And then just a broader question, as you talk about shifting the focus near term to improving the bottom line, I know, previously you talked about getting SG&A below 40% from a percentage of sales basis and that would get you back at least to a mid-single digit operating margin, if you can achieve that piece, but how do you think aspirational over time what type of margin is fair for this business, you don\u2019t have to commit to a timeline, but just curious how you think about the overall opportunity.","Dave Bergman","Yeah. I mean I think we're going to be looking at it more as a longer term play from a CAGR perspective. We are going to be looking to continue to find ways to leverage SG&A and take advantage of a lot of the restructuring benefits from the 17 and 18 plans that we\u2019ll see in \u201919 and beyond. So we\u2019re not ready to really discuss details on that or timeline on that, but we are excited to be able to talk about that in Investor Day later in the year, but again when you think about the combined impact of what Patrik is driving from a GTM perspective and therefore an effectiveness perspective, and you couple that with the benefits of the restructuring activities and digging deep and trying to reset the cost structure, we're going to be pretty excited about what we can share towards the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Plank for any closing remarks.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, operator. We\u2019ve spent a long time defining ourselves as a growth company and I want to be clear that that definition is no different today. I explained that we want growth in the bottom line, so we can show you and demonstrate how great of a company that we can be, but it doesn't take anything away from the opportunity and the runway we see in front of ourselves as we do play the long game with what's in front of us. I just want to take a minute and I want to thank our team that has demonstrated such incredible strength and resilience going back now nearly 18 months. So we've been in this thing and we've been in the fight and I'm incredibly proud of the hard work and the effort that they\u2019ve put through and I think you're seeing it come out in days like today where we get to have a very proud explanation of where our company is and more importantly where we're going. So we\u2019re in this fight, we look forward to it and we appreciate your support. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Lance Allega, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Sir, you may begin.","Lance Allega","Thank you, and good morning to everyone joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Under Armour\u2019s first quarter 2019 results. Participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Plank","Thanks Lance, and good morning, everyone. With the first quarter in the books, we are off to a solid start to the year for Under Armour\u2019s business and brand. As laid out in our last call, we are focused on four objectives as we work to deliver 2019. ","First, the brand, amplifying our story and delivering innovative products and experiences that make our athletes better. Second, continuing to optimize our operations and investments, prioritize our premium athletic performance brand positioning. Third, building stronger relationships with our customers; and fourth, delivering on our financial plan to drive sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. ","With the first quarter as a backdrop, let\u2019s quickly touch on some of the progress we are making. Starting with Under Armour brand performance. We are seeing strong momentum among athletes, products and experiences. ","Perhaps the biggest athlete highlight was the NCAA Basketball Tournament where we had teams competing in both National Championship Finals with Notre Dame on the Women\u2019s side and Texas Tech on the Men\u2019s side. ","When considering that only five years ago, we had just a handful of teams in the entire tournament having 29 this year, we are excited to see our product innovation well on the court and our overall presence in basketball continued to drive brand heat and consideration. ","In products, our big innovation story for the year Rush, Recover and Hover are in the markets delivering on our promise to make athletes better. Rush and Recover use mineral-infused fabrics to enhance performance by recycling the body\u2019s natural heat to promote blood flow thereby improving endurance, strength and repair. ","Turning to UA Hover, with more than 12 styles across Run, Sport Style. Basketball, and golf now available, we are driving positive results and reception. In fact, the Hover Infinite running shoe is featured as a top pick of both Outside and Women\u2019s Running magazines. And Runner\u2019s World featured the shoe on the cover with Spring 2019 shoe guide with a coveted Recommended Award. ","We are also continuing to build momentum in our Digital business as we move to more aggressively integrate our Connect With Fitness Community at the intersection of strain, compete, and recover to connect even more deeply with our consumers. ","From an operational perspective, in order to deliver on our brand promise in this highly competitive landscape, and most importantly, to be able to do it again and again. Our investments must be optimized, targeted and return-driven. With a clear focus on athletic performance, supported by an improved go to market process, and the alignment of our category and regional structure now firmly in place, the integration into our long-term strategic planning process is considerably strengthening our ability to be consistent. ","By operating more effectively across innovation, design, supply chain, marketing and sales, we are making the best decisions collectively for our brand. This cohesive effort further empowers our ability to reinvest back into our largest long-term growth opportunities including footwear, women\u2019s, direct-to-consumer and our international businesses. ","Two highlights supporting the strategic objective in the quarter included, opening our new EMEA headquarters in Amsterdam, which during this period of transformation and stabilization in this region, meaningfully amplifies our culture and brand energy gaining us great confidence in this team\u2019s ability to tackle its next chapter of growth. ","We are also now opening of the first UA brand house in India, where Michael Phelps joined Patrick and myself along with others helped celebrate our entrance into a market that is immensely passionate for sport and represents a solid opportunity for Under Armour over the long-term. ","Next up is building stronger brand right relationships with key customers. Relationships that protect our premium positioning that allow us to mutually manage the marketplace with sustainable profitable growth. At the core of this effort has been a reset predicated on better segmented products, manage inventories and ultimately improved service levels, all of which we\u2019ve made excellent progress with. ","With respect to differentiation, throughout much of 2019, we are still in a bit of a hybrid period in between our previous go to market, the short-term things we were able to impact like SKU rationalizations and channel optimization and our new go to market which commercializes more meaningfully toward the end of 2019, and in the spring summer of 2020.","Of course, this is difficult if there is too much inventory in the marketplace and in this respect, our global supply chain and sales organizations continue to do an extraordinary job managing our sourcing and customer relationships, getting our products to retail and empowering our ability to manage our marketplace more effectively. ","With quarter end inventories down 24%, this is a significant accomplishment that allows us and our customers to ensure that our newest products are available at the right place at the right time. Whenever and wherever consumers choose to engage Under Armour. ","A key element of our success with our retail partners is how we service them and I am proud to say that we are seeing improved year-over-year service levels due to the ongoing process and structural improvements across our supply chain. We are just running a better play period. ","With that, lets finish out on our fourth area of focus, which is delivering on our financial plan. In the quarter, slightly higher than planned revenue and gross margin, along with more disciplined cost management delivered a better than expected bottom-line. With this slight overdelivery, we favorably adjusted our full year outlook. ","This is not to say however that this will be our typical approach moving forward. In fact, if we were to see additional top-line or gross margin expansion above our plan, we may choose to further invest in marketing and product initiatives to support building the long-term Under Armour brand. ","To sum it up, there is of course, still more work to do on this journey, yet it is one we are really pleased with the progress we have made to ensure that we put ourselves in a best position to win. ","There is little doubt that we are running more efficiently with clear, greater purpose than even just a year ago, great brands enduring Under Armour will emerge from 2019 as an even stronger brand and company for our consumers, customers and shareholders. We are exactly where we want to be.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrik. ","Patrik Frisk ","Thanks, Kevin. Today\u2019s results are a good indicator that the discipline stability and process improvement efforts are working. Our go to market framework continues to strengthen our business by driving greater efficiencies, quicker decision-making and repeatable executions across our product, category and regional portfolio. ","And it\u2019s this repeatability just like training that is necessary and a vital foundation as we step up every day to compete in the global market. When competing the margin of victory can also in time be determined by one shot or by losing focus for even one moment. ","Throughout our multi-year transformation, we have obsessed every detailed process and decision to ensure that we build the appropriate muscle over time to be able to compete consistently at the highest levels by remaining disciplined and committed to optimizing our greatest strengths as a brand rooted firmly in premium athletic performance, we are indeed exactly where we want to be.","Turning to our business, let\u2019s take a look at our regional performance in the quarter beginning with North America. Revenue was down 3%, a little better than planned due to a slight benefit from operational enhancements and improved service levels. ","As expected, our results reflect fewer sales to the off-price channel and softer demand in our direct-to-consumer business as we were to reset toward a more premium price point. ","All said, we are right on track with our revenue expectation for the full year being relatively flat. In the near-term, with our foundation stabilize in this region, I am looking forward to digging in deeper with the North American team and continuing to execute against our long-term strategic plan by working to reestablish Under Armour as the performance authority in our largest market. ","Turning to our other regions and as a reminder, on our last call, we spoke about applying the lessons learned in North America in 2018 across our international business in 2019 including distribution optimization and a strategic inventory management actions to ensure that we protect our premium brand positioning. ","Starting with Asia Pacific, revenue was up 25% with growth in wholesale, driven by continued expansion with key partners and higher sales to the off-price channel, as well as sustained momentum in direct-to-consumer. ","In the EMEA, revenue was up 3%, driven primarily by growth on direct-to-consumer business and revenue from Latin America was up 6%, driven primarily by wholesale and keep in mind that this result was negatively impacted by a few points from the change in our business model in Brazil.","Also we noticed that toward the end of quarter, in Mexico, we converted nine partner doors to own locations, a measured investment in this region\u2019s largest market. ","Now turning to some of our category highlights, Hover Infinite is definitely creating opportunities for our Run business. With accelerating visibility and consideration seen across the price points throughout our running business, our disciplined approach to our channel allocation strategies means we are delivering the right volume of premium products for our consumers and customers at the right time. ","Having gone from just two Hover Run styles last year to five today, and more to come this year, our aperture is opening to include highly technical runners an accomplishment we are particularly proud of. ","With the expansion of our digitally-enabled footwear offering, along with our connected fitness ecosystem of apps, content and experiences from training, competing, recovery and nutrition, tracking has never been easier. ","Among our target consumer, the focus performers who use our apps especially advanced features like training and running plans and gate coaching, we are seeing higher rates of engagement and conversions to buying Under Armour product and those who don\u2019t use our plans. All of which demonstrates that when we combine innovative products with premium experiences to make athletes better in the moment of sweats we win. ","In our Sports Style category, by leveraging our innovation technologies and remixing them with street inspired design language and products like Forge 96 and Hover FLK, we are providing unique opportunities for athletes to stay in brand and creatively express themselves as they travel to and fro in their active use wearing locations. ","And in our Core Sports category, the incredible roster of athletes and teams we support have had some amazing performances and moments in the first four months of the year. This category, as we discussed at our Investor Day is at the heart of our brand. It\u2019s where we authenticate our position and performance, earn trust with consumers, and deliver products that make our athletes better for the moments they compete. ","Wrapping it up with our Train category, it\u2019s all about Rush, Recover and Hover this year. All of these innovations platforms purposely consider the athletes holistic fitness journey by delivering products that recharge, return and recycle their energy giving them every edge to improve their performance. ","And with our first UA Hover training shoe coming this fall, we are excited to continue to build on the momentum we have seen thus far and drive even greater consideration and opportunities to grow our footwear over the long-term. ","So before wrapping it up, I would be remised to not mention that from an operational perspective, our Rush campaign which launched a couple of weeks ago, was our first apparel innovation that was commercialized and launched globally through our fully integrated go to market process. ","While still very early, we are encouraged by the initial reception and sell-through, this gives me great confidence that when we run disciplined repeatable plays, trusted process and deliver innovation that has style, performance and fit, we win. ","So in closing, we are making significant progress against multiple initiatives that prioritize our investments to high returns that support our largest global growth opportunities and strategic plans. Dave?","Dave Bergman","Thanks, Patrik. Given today\u2019s results, we are on track to deliver on our full year expectations and as we progress through the final year of our operational transformation, we continue to run more efficiently and effectively toward driving long-term profitable growth. ","Before we dive into the first quarter, I\u2019d like to briefly touch on the change in how we are now reporting our segments. As discussed on our last call, starting with the first quarter of 2019, we have realigned our segments to exclude certain corporate costs and are now reporting these costs as Corporate Other. ","This includes the portion of global corporate overhead costs which to-date have previously been recorded primarily within our North American operating segment. ","A few examples include, support functions like supply chain, digital, and IT, as well as the portion of sports marketing related to marquee athletes leverage globally to grow brand awareness and consideration. ","We feel this change provides improved visibility with respect to the performance and underlying business results of our operating segments. For easier comparability, we recast certain historical financial information to reflect this change, which was filed separately in our 8-K this morning. ","Now turning to the first quarter results. Revenue in the first quarter was up 2% to $1.2 billion or up 3% if you exclude the impacts of foreign currency. Clicking down, let\u2019s start with revenue by channel. Our wholesale business was up 5% to $818 million driven by strength in our international business and slight growth in North America. ","Direct-to-consumer revenue was down 6% to $331 million due to softer demand and impacts from our shift toward more premium price points and lower levels of discounting. DTC was 27% of total global revenue in the quarter. ","Licensing was down 18% to $2 million driven by softer demand across our Japanese and North American businesses. By product category, apparel revenue was up 1% to $775 million, footwear revenue was up 8% to $293 million primarily driven by growth in our Run category. ","And within our accessories business, revenue was down 11% to $82 million primarily driven by continued softer demand and planned lower volume in North America related to a relaunch within our bags and backpack business. And finally, connected fitness was up 4% driven by subscription revenue. ","Turning to gross margins, we saw 100 basis point improvement to 45.2% in the first quarter. To walk you through the components of the improvement, gross margin was positively impacted by approximately 90 basis points of supply chain initiatives, including more favorable product costs. ","60 basis points related to prior year impacts from restructuring efforts, and 30 basis points of regional mix, primarily due to the higher gross margin Asia Pacific business outpacing the growth of our other regions. ","These improvements were partially offset by approximately 70 basis points of channel mix due to higher margin businesses including licensing and DTC representing a smaller mix of the business in the quarter. This was coupled with a higher composition of off-price sales related to planned inventory management initiatives. ","As a reminder for 2019, we expect the mix of off-price sales to be down year-over-year, therefore providing a tailwind to our full year gross margin. SG&A expense decreased 1% to $510 million, which was slightly better than expected due to the timing of certain expenses shifting out of the first quarter along with overall cost management. ","First quarter operating income was $35 million. Interest and other expense was $5 million and our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 27%. Taking this to the bottom-line, net income was $22 million or $0.05 in diluted earnings per share for the quarter. ","On our balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were up 2% to $289 million. Total debt was down 36% to $590 million. Capital expenditures were down 23% to $27 million and inventory was down 24% to $875 million, demonstrating our continued commitment to operational excellence. ","Also in the first quarter, we implemented a new FASB Standard on lease accounting ASU 842 which requires all assets and liabilities related to our operating leases of 12 months or more to now be recognized on our balance sheet. ","Turning to our 2019 outlook. There is no change to our expectations that revenue should increase approximately 3% to 4% with relatively flat results for North America and a low double-digit percentage rate increase in our international business. ","Gross margin is now expected to increase approximately 70 to 90 basis points compared to 2018 adjusted gross margin due to ongoing supply chain initiatives including more favorable product costs and lower airfreight coupled with channel mix benefits from lower sales to the off-price channel and a higher overall percentage of DTC. ","Recall, that in 2018, we had approximately 40 basis points of negative gross margin impacts due to our restructuring efforts. Therefore, on a GAAP basis, gross margin should be up approximately 110 to 130 basis points in 2019. We now expect operating income to reach $220 million to $230 million taking up the bottom-end of the range by $10 million. ","Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate and prioritize investments in key strategic areas to support our long-term growth initiatives balanced with driving operating margin rate improvements. Interest and other expense net is now planned at approximately $35 million as we paid off our outstanding term debt in the quarter. ","And we now expect to be toward the higher end of our effective tax rate range of 19% to 22%. Diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.34 and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $210 million. ","Before we turn it over to Q&A, I want to provide some color on the balance of the year. Based on our factors previously discussed, we expect second quarter revenue to be up 1% to 2% led by growth in our international and direct-to-consumer businesses, tampered by a slight decline in our North America business. ","As a reminder, the second quarter of 2018 was our highest growth quarter of last year with elevated inventory management actions as we work toward healthier inventory levels in North America. ","Second quarter gross margin should be up approximately 80 to 100 basis points versus last year\u2019s adjusted gross margin or up 130 to 150 basis points on a GAAP basis due to improved product cost and regional and channel mix benefits. ","Within channel mix, the benefits are primarily being driven by lower planned sales to the off-price channel compared to the prior year along with improving expectations for our DTC and licensing businesses. ","We expect second quarter SG&A to be up about 4% to 5%, driven by additional planned marketing to support our innovation stories including Rush and Hover, along with increased facility, distribution and store expenses associated with the expansion of our international business, as well as some of the timing shifts I mentioned earlier. ","In total, when taken into context for the first half of 2019, SG&A to grow at a rate slightly higher than the rate of revenue growth. Second quarter operating loss is expected to be approximately $25 million and diluted loss per share is expected to be approximately $0.06. ","And finally, we are expecting inventories to decline at a mid-teen percentage rate at the end of the second quarter, which should then start to normalize during the second half of the year landing closer to flat as we enter 2020. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Your line is now open. ","Jonathan Komp ","Yes. Hi. Thank you. I want to follow-up on some of the comments really implying momentum that might be building on the premium footwear side with \u2013 at the Run category and then Patrik your comments on the initial response to the Rush apparel that\u2019s in the marketplace. ","And I just want to understand, maybe what you are seeing in terms of how some of those factors are really showing up in the marketplace and just given that you are still projecting slightly lower North America revenue in total. At what point do you think some of these new initiatives that are announced to really drive an inflection in the overall business? ","Patrik Frisk","Hi, Jonathan. This is Patrik. Yes, we are really excited about what\u2019s going on in \u2013 especially in our Run category right now with our second year into the Hover platform. If you remember, we launched Hover last year with two styles and that\u2019s was the first time we really did it in a coordinated play in this new kind of go to market approach that we have had for the last little while in terms of doing it in a coordinated global launch. ","That was very successful. We are not expanding that with five styles this spring and adding more this fall. And what you are seeing is, our ability to really do it in a coordinated repeatable way and we are seeing the same kind of encouraging results in terms of sell-throughs this year than we did last year now with more products in the marketplace. ","So, we are really encouraged by this, because it shows that when we do it right, in terms of innovation, in terms of messaging, in terms of distribution, segmentation and allocation the consumer responds. And so, we are now thinking about how we can scale that of course going forward. And with Rush, it\u2019s a similar story. ","It\u2019s a limited allocated approach from our end applying the same kind of methodology and discipline that we have done in the Hover Run category. And then we are very encouraged by our ability to now execute also in apparel in the same way. So, this is a beginning of a play that you will see from Under Armour and we just feel really encouraged by what we see early on. ","Now remember, Rush has only been into market a few weeks. So, there will be more to come on that in the next call that we have for the next quarter. ","Jonathan Komp ","Okay, great. And then, maybe a follow-up on just the gross margin progression that you are seeing especially with the inventory work down which has been impressive and given the comments that you could look to reinvest some upside if there were some. ","But when you look at gross margin started to recover in the state of inventory today and yet, you are only projecting a modest recovery in the gross margin relative to where it was several years ago. Can you just talk about, as you continue to focus on a more segmented and premium product approach, if there is kind of any upside potential that you see is really into 2019 and 2020 from a gross margin perspective?","Dave Bergman","Hey, Jonathan, this is Dave. We are definitely excited about the progress we are seeing in gross margin and bringing that back up to where we want to be longer term. When you think about the full year, a lot of it is driven by the supply chain initiatives that we talked about before and really starting to see more of a full year impact of those initiatives that we started to see some benefits in the back half of 2018. ","When you think about the vendor and cost optimization we\u2019ve been doing, reducing the SKU to new count, reducing the number of key vendors that we work with and really driving those cost down through those negotiations, also just with better pricing strategies as we kind of use deeper analytics around the architecture there. ","But then also just improve GTM process and supply chain management are also allowing for less airfreight. So, a lot of good things coming out of the supply chain initiatives as the processes in the transformation really kind of take hold for more a full year impact this year. And you know, from a channel mix this year as well, we are stepping off the off-price channel and we want to continue to do that in the future. ","And we also have a higher DTC mix as we finish out the year as well. So, all of those things are going in our favor and we are excited about the continued improvement as we go forward as we talked about back in our investor call in December. ","Jonathan Komp ","Okay, great. That\u2019s encouraging to hear it. Thank you. ","Dave Bergman","Thanks, Jonathan. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. ","Erinn Murphy ","Great. Thanks. Good morning. And let me add my congratulations. I guess, just following up on Jonathan\u2019s question on product momentum. I am curious what you are seeing from some of your key customers in terms of how they are thinking about future space allocation just given some of the momentum you\u2019ve seen over the last kind of three to nine months in some of your footwear initiatives and apparel. ","Are they actually changing what they looking for in fall or spring of 2020? And then, just a follow-up on the direct-to-consumer business, what did you see in the Digital side of your business this quarter? Thank you. ","Patrik Frisk","Hi, Erinn. This is Patrik. I think what we are really excited about in \u2013 and you know, every region is a little bit different here. But in North America, we now feel that we have stabilized this region and as you see by our inventory numbers done a lot of work over the last year, year and a half actually to really clean up the marketplace. ","So it\u2019s a much healthier marketplace and we clearly see that when we are providing newness into the channels, it really works really well for us. So, we are going to continue that, that work with our retail partners with a strategy to really win with the winners. And I think, earning it back takes a little time and that\u2019s really what you are seeing from the brand now. ","But as I said before, what we are doing in terms of some of these more premium offerings, we are learning a lot from our ability to actually execute and drive sell-throughs when we do it in a coordinated play. So, we will continue to do that and we will earn our place back into the retailers. We feel really good about how the channels now are cleaning up in North America. ","In our other markets, it\u2019s a little bit of a mix. In Europe, it\u2019s a mix between partnerships, as it relates to doors and also in terms of wholesale, and we have done the same kind of work there that we\u2019ve been doing in North America right now. I am very encouraged by some earlier results there too with these new initiatives around Hover and Rush and so forth in terms of being able to coordinate it. ","And in Asia of course, we continue to build out our direct-to-consumer business. We will be doing about 300 more doors a year. We are building a store every 36 hours or so. So, we are still on track to really drive that business. ","But it is a process and it\u2019s going to, over time improve. I would say that, from a global perspective, we now feel that we are much more balanced and we have stabilized North America, which gives us great confidence for the future. ","Erinn Murphy ","Great. And then, you found the Digital business. I was just curious what you saw there in the quarter?","Patrik Frisk","Yes, I think in Digital, it\u2019s also again is a little bit of mix. As we are stepping off the gap in terms of the promotional activity, and moving into more premium price points, we are doing that across the world. And so, it\u2019s a measured play from our perspective. And we feel really good about our plan. ","The plan is still the plan. Same thing that we\u2019ve talked about at Investor Day in December, that\u2019s still holding true and we are really executing on that plan right now. So, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of the response in terms of what we are doing from a full price perspective in that channel and we are going to continue to play our play. ","Erinn Murphy ","Thank you, guys. All the best.","Patrik Frisk","Thank you. ","Dave Bergman","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Alexandra Walvis ","Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. So, my question is on the marketing spend. You mentioned little bit of a ramp in marketing spend into the second quarter to support some of those new product stories with the Rush and Recover and Hover and so forth. You also mentioned some timing shifts going on there. ","I wonder if, taking a step back you could comment on how happy you are with the level of overall marketing spend in the business. So the rate came down a little bit in 2018 versus 2017. ","And I wonder if you could talk about the ongoing efficiencies that you have there and some of the discipline in that marketing spend which is new apps offsetting the ability to support some increased spend behind these new initiatives?","Patrik Frisk","Alex, this is Patrik again. We are really encouraged by, the go to market ultimately, because that\u2019s the one process that we have where we are able to now also use a lot of our learnings from an analytics perspective. So as we learn more, we are also understanding much better of how to get a good return on investment, good rollout from our spend. ","And as we see opportunities, like Dave said, if we have opportunities, we will certainly be looking to see what we can do about those opportunities going forward. But right now, we continuously see more effectiveness in our spend as we drive our business through the go to market and using more and deeper analytics to really drive the business. ","Dave Bergman","This is Dave. When you think about just from a total dollar perspective, we are going to continue to kind of maintain in that 10% to 11% to 12% range of revenue. But we are picking that up a little bit as a percentage of this year versus last year. ","But I think the more important thing is the power of that spend is going to be a lot better because we did step out of multiple commitments through the restructurings in 2017 and 2018 that probably didn\u2019t give us a return that we are hoping for. ","So, now, you still have that same percentage or even a little bit higher percentage of revenue that we can invest in a smarter way. So we should be able to get more bang for the buck, which we're excited about.","Kevin Plank","That\u2019s good point. We got enough \u2013 we got plenty of money and we said in the past is that, we are big enough that we can do just about anything. We just can\u2019t do everything. And so, I think being more thoughtful and strategic and targeted with how we are spending those dollars, but we\u2019ve got plenty of money. We just need to make sure we are putting toward the right thing. I think you are seeing the brand doing that. ","Alexandra Walvis ","Splendid. That\u2019s solid player. Thanks very much. I wonder if I could ask one more here on the direct-to-consumer business. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that some of the softness that was a result of softer demand and I wonder if you could elaborate on that comment specifically where that was being seen and perhaps drivers of that?","Patrik Frisk","Yes, it needs to be taken it to the context of what we are doing in terms of protecting our premium, positioning as a brand and stepping of the gaps in terms of being discount it online and so forth. So, as you do that, it would be normal to see some softening in demand for sure. So, we are expecting that to continue a little bit. ","And again, I reiterate the fact that we are on plan. We plan to do this just like we said in December and on our last call and we feel really good about where we are at. We are right on plan right now. So, you kind of see us continue to move to that more premium position across digital across the world. ","Alexandra Walvis ","Thank you so much and all the best.","Patrik Frisk","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. ","Bob Drbul ","Hi, good morning guys. I just wondered, you talked a lot about the NCAA Tournament, but can you just talk about how basketball is performing for you especially what\u2019s happening in the NBA playoffs as well, today? ","Kevin Plank","Yes, well, I think just large part of the story that we wanted paint in basketball is that if you look back at just the men\u2019s side of the drum, NCAA Tournament in 2014, we had one team. We had one team in the NCAA Tournament. This year we have 17 teams or 25% of the bracket and that was done through a strategy that we put in place. ","So, we typically, we overestimate we can do in the short-term and underestimate we can do in the long term and that\u2019s something I think we are really proud of. When you look at our basketball resume today, and again back in 2014 we had less than a 1000 high school teams, today we have more than 5,000 high school teams. ","We have just a few of the mid majors. We put a strategy in place to go sign mid major teams with for short calls money but actually, the kind of teams that we make money on, we were just getting started with Stephen Curry. And we since signed Joel Embiid. So two All Stars on our roster today, both in the playoffs. So, basketball from a brand sports marketing standpoint, I think we are demonstrating that our product works. ","I mean, two teams in the final four, one of the championship game on the men\u2019s side, one of the championship game on the women\u2019s side. So, we\u2019ve demonstrated that the product that we build, we are capable and leaning into our performance back. So we believe that you will continue to see that play out at the grassroots authenticity level. ","Again, from 1,000 high schools in 2014 to more than 5,000 that we have today. So that\u2019s just in the United States and obviously it\u2019s a global game. But I think if you have to look positioning-wise, Under Armour is, we are one of the top two positioned basketball brands in the world right now. ","And you will see that begin to inflect with a signature series that we have with Stephen Curry and what he means and represents to us. But this is a long game. This is not something that\u2019s going to happen overnight. But we t think that we are grinding them down and we will continue to build our presence in the sport like basketball. We like our resume. We like our positioning and we like the future. ","Bob Drbul ","Got it. And could I just question, in the U.S. business, North America specifically, can you just talk about like the outlook in sporting goods for you guys, athletics, specialty change doors, just what you expect the rest of the year to get you back to flat from what we are seeing right now? ","Patrik Frisk","Yes. Hi, Bob. It\u2019s Patrik here. I think, coming back to what I said a little bit earlier, first of all, we feel really good about where we are at in North America right now. Moving our brand into that premium athletic positioning again. We\u2019ve stabilized the region. We are working hard to really win with the winners. ","And we are doing that through servicing our accounts better, launching better products, making sure it\u2019s on-time. It\u2019s the right product, consumers responding, segmenting the product correctly, allocating it correctly. Behind all of that, though, there is a long game here, because what happens is, once you are out of favor, you got \u2013 you get back in favor. And that takes a little bit of time. ","And we are kind of caught in the calendar a little bit, right. So, we are working our way through that, earning our trust back with the retailers. Having said that, we feel that, going forward into 2019, like Dave said that we are on plan. So in other words, we are able to continue to run the play that we\u2019ve orchestrated. We feel very good about that. ","We feel very good about the partnership that we have with our large retailers in every channel right now. We feel we have better segmented products, better innovative products and we are understanding better how to talk to the consumer and we are able to orchestrate to play through the go to market. And you will continue to see that from us, this efficiency play if you like in terms of ability to execute. ","So, we feel great about 2019 and we are also really, really looking forward to continue to fight in 2020. ","Bob Drbul ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. ","Edward Yruma ","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the continued momentum. It seems like one of the kind of callouts in the past couple of quarters has really been the strength of international. I was wondering if you could give us little bit more color on performance in Asia Pacific, specifically China. ","And then, as you think, kind of broadly, I know, it\u2019s still early days in India, but kind of what gets you really excited about the market and from a dimensioning perspective, how big could that market be over time for you? Thanks. ","Patrik Frisk","Hi, this is Patrik. I would say that in general in international right now, we feel really well about the balance that we have stabilizing North America, continuing to have strong growth across all of our initiatives in Asia and taking a really good premium positioning approach in Europe and as well as Latin America. ","I would say that India specifically is something we are excited about. But again, India is a long-term play for us. We want to be present in that market. It\u2019s a huge market for the future. We are very encouraged by what we are doing there. We are going to be opening a number of new stores this year. First signs are very positive. ","But again, India is much more of a longer-term play. But it\u2019s an important play for us. We want to make sure that we are everywhere in the world where the focused performer wants to engage with us and India is certainly one of those places and we had a great time going there and engaging with the consumer face-to-face myself and Kevin. ","And that we are looking forward to continuing to drive the business there. ","Edward Yruma ","And maybe one quick follow-up. Kevin, as the brand is probably newer to the APAC consumer, I guess, how have you changed the way you go to market from a brand perspective and I guess what\u2019s the perception of the brand today? Thanks. ","Kevin Plank","I think a lot of lessons learned. We want to be careful is, we are proud I think the work the team has done. Just some of the metrics that we put up as a company, particularly the ability to drive inventory down, drive gross margin up, I think it demonstrates health in the brand and something that\u2019s very, very positive for us. ","But we are a long way from declaring victory. I mean, it is a journey and that we sit here in our 14th year as a public company. I get the luxury of perspective of looking back and just see all that\u2019s been accomplished. I look at the lessons that we\u2019ve learned in North America, as a North American brand and we are in the middle of that journey again is because, in order to be a great brand, you have to be an enduring brand and that means you have to continue to reinvent yourself and I feel I was doing that. ","But our ability to take the lessons that we\u2019ve learned here in North America and now apply them globally, specifically in markets like Asia Pacific where getting healthy making sure that while top-line is critical for us as we grow, we want a strong business. ","And it\u2019s being able to implement the things that we\u2019ve painstakingly done through our transformation over the last couple, two, three years here that looking at things like our go to market process having that in place the ability for us upgrade our systems across the world and so, we will have a lot of the pain that we\u2019ve taken in the last few years is something that\u2019s going to set us up. ","We are getting us to $5 billion with a lot of physical muscle lift. I feel a lot better about our ability to we will do it by being a lot smarter and our ability to get from five to ten is going to be a lot more thoughtful, of a lot more experience and not requiring so much to our physical labor. So I think we can be a much smarter brand. ","And you are seeing us apply that in APAC. The global operating model that we now have in place, it really empowers the regions. And so, little to be said about what\u2019s happening in Europe and it kind of feels like it\u2019s the same story that\u2019s playing out in each region around the world. And so, we are obviously like many. ","We are incredibly excited about what Asia Pacific, China in particular to mean for us, but we\u2019ve got great leadership. We are setting up our new headquarters. Our Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong right now and it\u2019s a lot of upside. But it is taking the lessons that we have learned here and getting smarter and becoming a true global brand. ","But we also know it\u2019s exciting as Asia Pacific and other regions around the world. Winning here at home in the U.S. is something which is paramount to this brand and you will see us get smart about that too. ","Edward Yruma ","Great. Thanks so much.","Kevin Plank","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Michael Binetti ","Thanks for taking our questions here. So, could you just speak to the past? I think, can you just remind us, is mid-single-digit increase still the target for direct-to-consumer this year? And then of the number in first quarter that\u2019s obviously a pretty meaningful swing in the rest of the year. ","Would you mind just kind of given us the path, maybe some of the components you see back from the first quarter to get to that mid-single-digit increase for the year?","Dave Bergman","Yes, Michael, this is Dave. We still are on plan and so the mid-single-digit increase for DTC full year is still the plan and that\u2019s what we are driving through. And yes, you do see a lower number in Q1. But there is a lot of underlying reasons, some of those we have given before relative to some of the doors that we are working through. ","Also some of the changes in how we are continuing to optimize conversion. We also had the Easter shift that we talked about that affected us a little bit more in North America relative to Q1, Q2 flows, that was a challenge on Q1, as well. And Q1 was also of 2018 our largest growth DTC quarter. So the comp is tough as in Q1, as well. ","So, there is a lot of different factors in play there. We are also opening a fair amount of new doors around the world, especially in the Asia Pacific region as we go through Q2 through Q4. So, again, multiple things at play there, but we feel good about the mid-single-digit guidance for full year on DTC. ","Michael Binetti ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the \u2013 just maybe some housekeeping on the gross margin, I think you mentioned that the channel mix was 70 basis point headwind and licensing DTC smaller mix in the quarter. Would you mind breaking out how much is from licensing and DTC? ","And then, I think going forward, licensing should still be a headwind baked into your 2Q gross margin. But it sounds like DTC starts to improve pretty quickly here. ","So maybe that changes and finally, how much the pivot to lower off-price on a global basis year-over-year after being higher year-over-year in first quarter start to add to the gross margin as we get into 2Q and through the rest of the year? Any way to quantify that?","Dave Bergman","There is lot to that question. But when you look at the \u2013 when you look at Q1, the channel mix impacts, there was one of the two that was that much more overindexing there. Obviously, as we move further into Q2 and beyond, the higher off-price starts to flip the other way and becomes actually a nice tailwind for us and pretty substantial as we finish out the year as we are planning to run off-price or to the off-price channel as a lower mix of our business in total for the year. And then, when you look at the DTC side, that will flip to start to be accretive to gross margin as well as we get out of Q1 and as we go through the rest of the year. And the licensing impact is not very significant on the full year at all. And so we really haven\u2019t called that out on the full year. ","Michael Binetti ","Okay. Kevin, if I could sneak one more and just bigger picture. At the Analyst Day you were guiding for several hundred basis points of SG&A leverage from 2018 to 2023. It sounds like you found some investments that you find pretty attractive today. But there is a lot of SG&A improvement over the long range. You didn\u2019t change your outlook for revenues whatsoever obviously today. ","So there should be a lot of natural leverage in your model here. But is the target change or the timing of the ramp back to that SG&A level that you laid out at the Analyst Day change at all in your mind?","Kevin Plank","You didn\u2019t really mean to ask me that question. Go ahead, Dave.","Dave Bergman","Michael, this is Dave. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a full year play here and we did deliver a little bit better than we expected in Q1. Again, some of that is timing. So we are trying not to get overexcited about that. ","And obviously as Kevin mentioned in his script that, as we work through the rest of the year, if we overdrive in some areas, we may choose to reinvest to continue to fuel the brand for the rest of \u2013 later this year or mainly into next year and longer-term. So, again, we feel good about where we are. ","We are running the play and the SG&A leverage that we expect in 2020 and beyond is noted in the Investor Day back in December that\u2019s what we are still holding to and we feel good about it. ","Michael Binetti ","Okay. Thanks a lot for all the help guys. ","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ","Matt Boss","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter guys. ","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Dave Bergman","Thank you.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Matt. ","Matt Boss","I guess, first on inventory management, where did you see the primary delta versus the down mid-teens forecast? And maybe, Kevin, what\u2019s your view on the global athletic inventory position today? And then, on that same note, how best to think about the spread between inventory and sales in the back half of the year?","Dave Bergman","Okay, Matt. This is Dave. Relative to inventory, we did finish a little bit better than we expected. That was all driven by some timing of receipts for the international regions. But also coupled with slightly better than expected Q1 sales. We are definitely proud of our progress there. If you think about our inventory dollars, having been this low since 2016 and back then, we had $1 billion less in revenue. ","So, definitely going in the right direction. The other good thing to note is that, within that year-over-year inventory balance, the mix of excess within that versus current product has also gone down significantly. So not only is the inventory down 24%, but the health of the mix of that inventory and the underlying numbers is significantly better as well. ","So, the actions we are taking are really working and paying off for us. And if you, I kind of want to give a quick shot out, in the supply team our regional commercial teams supported by finance, they are all driving through the GTM revisions and inventory management initiatives and it\u2019s really great to see that coming together and we are excited about what that\u2019s going to mean as we go forward. ","Matt Boss","Great. And then just a \u2013 maybe just a follow-up on the expense front. How best to think about SG&A dollar growth versus revenues in the back half of the year? And then, just maybe any update on the progress of your restructuring cost efficiencies and when we would see a potential impact from that? ","Dave Bergman","Yes, as I mentioned, in the first half of the year, we are spending the tiny bit ahead of revenue as I mentioned. And you can see if you kind of back into our guidance that, on a full year perspective, we are looking at maybe slight SG&A leverage. ","Again, we\u2019ve got a lot of investments we want to continue to make even though we are driving savings and efficiencies in other areas. So, by default, that means that the back half of the year SG&A should grow slightly below revenue to be able to pull that off and that\u2019s what we are planning through and driving that at this point in time. ","When you think about longer term, the SG&A leveraging will come through a lot stronger in 2020 and beyond. Some of the restructuring efforts that we drove through in 2017 and 2018 have a delayed impact as far as some of those actual excess. So some things we negotiated in 2017 or 2018. You actually are not exiting some of those agreements until at some point in 2019 or later in 2019. ","And so, you don\u2019t see the real benefit of that full year until 2020 and beyond. So there is a lot of different initiatives at play there. But we are excited about the leverage we can drive in 2020 and beyond. ","Matt Boss","That\u2019s great color. Congrats again. ","Dave Bergman","Thank you. ","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Matt. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock with Barclays. Your line is now open. ","Matt McClintock ","Hi. Yes. Good morning everyone and congrats on the progress. I was wondering if \u2013 talk about that from a high level perspective, you\u2019ve consistently outperformed the expectations that you\u2019ve put out there, the plan that you put out there today is a great example of that. Where are you finding the most resistance today to your turnaround play and your turnaround efforts? That would be my first question. ","Patrik Frisk","Hi Matt. This is Patrik. Thanks for that question. I don\u2019t really see a lot of resistance. I think it\u2019s more of a continued planned rollout. Because the reality of course is that we are working inside of a calendar that we\u2019ve shortened down. It used to be 22 months, it\u2019s now 17 months. So it is a steady progressive march towards a better future. ","And what you are seeing now here as we turn the corner into 2019, is a lot of the work really starting to pay-off. We have stabilized in our largest region. We have started to really go into a healthier marketplace for the Under Armour brand where inventories, to Dave\u2019s earlier point, are now actually much, much, much healthier and actually from a position of strength, if you compare it even back to as far as 2016. ","So, it is a long play. We are very confident, simply because we are doing it through this go to market process where we are now orchestrating the play further out and then driving it home and learning from every time we actually go to market with a new season or a new launch and then we are effecting future seasons from the learnings. ","So, we are not meeting a lot of resistance anywhere. It\u2019s just that it takes a little bit of time to drive this through. And we are feeling more and more confident that a lot of the things that we are doing are really working. But it will be a continued work like we said at Investor Day in December, 2019 is still the last phase of our Protect This House chapter. ","And we feel really good about the plan that we currently have in place for 2019 and we will continue to drive into 2020. ","Matt McClintock ","Thanks for that. And then, as a follow-up, just on Europe. You talked about putting the global mark on the global operational plan in place or infrastructure in place, et cetera. You are empowering the local regions. ","But just, in Europe, there is a lot of brands that have had a hard time cracking Europe as a whole and I was wondering from a local \u2013 from more of a local level, what needs to be different about the approach there? ","Patrik, please chime into that, given your experience. But what do you see different about the local approach to Europe to make it successful? Thanks. ","Patrik Frisk","Yes, you know, Europe is a little bit of a harder market to crack overall. Right, you got to really win it country-by-country. In the U.S. of course, you can scale quickly and when it goes the other way, it goes the other way quickly. And Europe, it is really a country-by-country approach. ","So, for us, what we\u2019ve done with this global operating model that we put in place is we have ensured that, with the new leadership in place in Europe and the structure that we have in Europe, we are now empowering the regional team to really prioritize how to win in Europe, right? ","And you are doing that through a geographic play, country-by-country, but also through a category play and that\u2019s why we are so encouraged about some of the things that we talked about earlier around Hover and Rush for example, it\u2019s because we are also seeing the effectiveness of this approach for our teams in Europe. ","Now we are structured in this new, let\u2019s say more empowered way for the region. So it is a country-by-country, channel-by-channel, category-by-category approach you need to have in Europe. And you actually need to think about it that way, because you cannot try to win in Europe all at once, right. It\u2019s really a longer term plan and a very strategic plan in terms of how you do that? ","So it\u2019s feeding off-global, driving regional and we feel that we have a plan in place now with great leadership over there. And we are seeing some very exciting early response and results based on this new approach and we are very, very diligent and deliberate about making that a premium approach. ","So, we are not getting on top our skis and we are making sure that we are thinking through this strategy and playing the play in a very orchestrated fashion. And the go to market is enabling our teams to do that. ","Matt McClintock ","Thanks for the color. Best of luck. ","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","Omar Saad ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. ","Kevin Plank","Hi, Omar.","Omar Saad ","One kind of follow-up topic guys. Nice job in the quarter. And I really love to hear the premiumization strategy and really trying to reduce the reliance on discounting, especially in the DTC and online channels and maybe you could kind of elaborate on how \u2013 where we could expect to see that growth from a consumer standpoint? ","Are you going to take the outlet side off the website? How do you really kind of keep that website and the ecommerce piece that most premium products? And then, how do we think about that premiumization strategy in the physical channels, whether it\u2019s your own stores or different wholesales channels, especially as it relates to the U.S. market which really know tend to be the more competitive market and more discount-driven market versus others obviously? Thanks. ","Patrik Frisk","Yes, thanks, Omar. This is Patrik. Yes, so we have a plan in place for all the channels, right and all the categories in terms of how we think about this. But it starts with understanding what goes where, right. So, it begins with a category, channel, segmentation strategy and then an ability to execute against that. ","So, the go to market is allowing us to do that. And that\u2019s why we come back to this conversation around Hover and Rush. That\u2019s pinnacle product being positioned in the marketplace and that\u2019s also what the brand is talking about right now, which is important to us to really show up in a premium way. I mean, who would have thought that we were going to be on the cover of Runner\u2019s Magazine two years ago. ","I wouldn\u2019t have thought so, suddenly \u2013 certainly, but we are. And we are now starting to really connect with that more premium consumer and looking for the best possible product in that category for example. And we are taking and applying that same methodology across everything that we do. You\u2019ve seen t he efficiency that we are getting through our SKU reductions. ","You\u2019ve seen the benefit that we have gained from better allocation as we launch some of these more premium programs. We\u2019ve taken discounting down on our \u2013 in our digital space. And also having less promotional days in our outlet channel over the last two years. All of those things are contributing to this march towards a better, more healthy brand. ","And it\u2019s enabled by the fact that we have \u2013 we are doing it with less products. So, fewer SKUs, more focus, and more strategic and process that enables us to play the play. That\u2019s really how we are thinking about it. ","Omar Saad ","That\u2019s really helpful. That\u2019s really helpful, Patrik. Thanks a lots of information guys.","Patrik Frisk","Yes. ","Lance Allega","Kevin, do you want to Wrap?","Kevin Plank","Yes, I\u2019d love to actually just finish up on that comment, just what we are doing with driving premium brands. The interesting thing about looking at the journey that our brand has been on, 23 years in, 13 or 14 as a public company, and just seeing each one of these chapters they\u2019ve unfolded. ","And when you talk about things like the premium positioning, I think it\u2019s a perfect place of what and how we want to talk about our business. But understanding that what we need to do in order to become a great operationally excellent company in order to deliver on that premium position, particularly at the size and scale that we are now, there is a lot of things that you can physically lift from your smaller business. ","But we just out growing that. And so, I think we are going to really look back and appreciate the years of 2017, 2018, 2019, especially we can look at a year like 2018 where all the restructuring and growth that we had in getting healthy that we had while so growing the business over $200 million. ","So, the one thing we know is a great product is going to win and that\u2019s one thing that continues to happen no matter what. And the proof positive of that is just the athletes continuing to win in our brand. Again, whether it\u2019s Brady winning Super Bowls, the NCAA finals for men\u2019s and women\u2019s in basketball, whether it\u2019s Steph and Joel Embiid in the finals of the NBA Championship, whether it\u2019s Bryce Harper in baseball, the list just goes on and on. ","But one thing I want people to know is that we're also going to continue to get louder as a brand. We\u2019ve been pretty quiet. We\u2019ve been talking about product stories and telling people about Hover and Rush and that\u2019s what you see in our marketing. But as we continue to get free and flexible we get to move things around, you'll continue to see us get louder about telling people what and why this brand is so special. ","And the fact is that, everything we build, everything we make does something. It makes our brand unique and it gives us an advantage and edge, especially to our consumer that allows them to give them super power. So we look forward to continuing to drive on that and really proud of the progress that this team has made. ","I think the operational excellence is being put in is something that will continue to come out and driving that premium brand position that we are all looking for. So, we have work to be done. We're going to continue to win for our consumers, for our customers, for our shareholders and we look forward to that challenge. So, we are in the fight. ","Thank you all very much. Operator?

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Lance Allega","Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today to discuss Under Armour\u2019s second quarter 2018 results. Participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC, all which can be found on our website at uabiz.com.","During our call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which are defined in this morning\u2019s press release. We use non-GAAP amounts as the lead in some of our discussions because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management\u2019s view on why this information is useful to investors.","Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Under Armour Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; President and COO, Patrik Frisk; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Bergman. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today\u2019s results demonstrate that we are tracking well against a multi-year transformation to build a stronger, leaner and more operationally excellent company, a company that is capable of supporting the incredibly strong global athletic performance brand that our team works tirelessly to cultivate, a brand that loves athletes, a brand that stays true, creates fearlessly and stands for quality, one that fights together, thinks beyond the obvious and is driven by a global team committed to the advancement of human performance.","As a human performance company, Under Armour\u2019s mission is to make you better. Over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve been working to make ourselves better, better as a company by methodically and aggressively driving through a substantial evolution of our operating model. And while this work is not yet completed, the strategies and tactics we\u2019re executing are producing greater agility, sharper decisions, and a tenacious view towards generating more consistent result through repeatable processes.","As we proactively address some of the underperforming areas of our business, including SG&A and infrastructure investments that were beyond our growth, improving our distribution and right-sizing our inventory, we are simultaneously continuing to invest smartly in innovation, in our digital, DTC and international businesses. To ensure the most optimal navigation through this terrain, balance is critical. As is making sure that we are thrilled and holistic in this endeavor.","Through expanded actions within our structuring plan, which Dave will discuss later, we are demonstrating this balance and discipline. And as we continue to dig aggressively into all areas of our business, operationally, creatively and financially, we are one 100% cognizant of keeping our consumer, customer and shareholder commitments in equilibrium.","More than halfway through 2018, let\u2019s take a moment to update the progress we have made against some of the larger transformational actions we\u2019re executing against in terms of product, story, service and team.","Starting with product and story. When we build great product that delivers on UA\u2019s SPF, style, performance and fit, and then connect that deeply with consumer through inspirational and relevant storytelling, we win. Starting with deep insights, we\u2019re delivering industry-leading innovation that empowers athletes to perform longer, faster and stronger.","If you highlight so far this year includes the launch of UA HOVR Phantom and Sonic running shoes, our Project Rock and Misty Copeland training collections and the Curry 5 basketball shoe, all of which have experienced strong sell-through and are driving meaningful brand awareness, consideration and demand, supported by three comprehensive digital global campaigns were successfully rewriting our playbook with return-driven strategies.","These examples are also demonstrable of our commitment to performance and the largest category growth opportunities that we are focused on, especially running, training and basketball. And speaking of basketball, congratulations to Stephen Curry, who added his third NBA Championship Title in the past four seasons. Coupled with his two MVPs, Stephen is a powerful Under Armour ambassador, who continually raises our game as much as his own. With an insatiable quest for improvement, speed and advantage, his work ethic and partnership push us to be our very best every time we show up.","Looking into the second-half of 2018, we\u2019re also focused on improvement, speed and advantage. As we shift from a 21-month to a 16-month go-to-market calendar, the productivity gains we expect to see from SKU rationalization, supply chain initiatives, and overall process efficiency, our confidence inspiring as we look to the future.","Knowing the product innovation pipeline ahead of us, along the changes we have made to drive better assortments, tightened our inventory position and improved product flow, each subsequent season gets sharper and markedly more capable of meeting the highly discerning expectations of Under Armour consumers.","With our product and storytelling engine beginning to fire on all cylinders, we must also deliver impeccable service in seamless consumer experiences, blending data and analytics from our global segmentation study with an intimate understanding of our consumers\u2019 decision journey.","Our refined go-to-market strategy is taking hold and should prove to be a key catalyst in establishing our next chapter as a great company. Supporting that evolution is how we serve our consumers, whether directly or through a wholesale partnerships around the world, whatever and wherever they engage our brand, the significant ERP system upgrade with SAP that we did last summer, along with our ongoing supply chain initiatives give us improved decision making and a better ability to manage our inventory. This increased stability, improved planning acumen and enhanced capability enabled us to fine tune and hone all aspects of our product cycle.","And finally, over the past year-and-a-half, this team has embraced significant changes, both external and internal with a goal of becoming a great company capable of supporting our great Under Armour brand. Our team has been running, pushing and digging in deep to ensure that we fully capitalize on this chapter to transform our company for future growth. Part of this change was recognizing the need for a seasoned veteran and partner to spearhead this transformation.","Patrik Frisk, our President and COO, hit his first-year mark a couple of weeks ago. Along with Dave Bergman and our executive leadership team, Patrik has been instrumental in helping us transform our operations and strategic playbook.","From category management to our go-to-market strategy and regional alignment, we\u2019ve been changing the way we operate to become better. In the context of our transformation and where we are, we see the second and third quarter bottom line being the most negatively impacted by our planned restructuring charges. We are proactively making these difficult decisions on behalf of the long-term best interest of the brand.","And while transformation is never easy, our strategies are set and we are driving forward against our plan with our heads down producing and executing, and all the while keeping the strength of the Under Armour brand paramount in this ambition. We are resolute in our goal to architect the long-term operating and financial model, capable of driving sustainable, profitable growth and returns for our shareholders.","And in that respect, we look forward to holding an Investor meeting here at our global headquarters in Baltimore on December 12. At that meeting, we\u2019ll provide an in-depth overview of our long-term strategy and the key initiatives designed to drive growth and profitability through 2021 and beyond.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Patrik.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Kevin. Over the last year, we\u2019ve learned a tremendous amount about ourselves as a team and organization and ultimately, as an evolving, integrated ecosystem. Now on the other side of standing up our category management structure, implementing new systems and reengineering our go-to-market process, we\u2019re on the path to becoming a more efficient and effective company.","Our playbook is working, incremental progress is being made and we are putting ourselves in the best position to serve our consumers, customers and shareholders. Building on Kevin\u2019s earlier point, key to executing this transformation has been our culture. Our scrappy entrepreneurial DNA has been an absolute asset to striking the right balance between aggressive near-term actions to correct inefficiencies and long-term structural moves to produce repeatable, scalable outcomes.","With these in alignment, we\u2019re on the right path to reaching our true potential in the upcoming years. To highlight one successful near-term strategy, on our fourth quarter call in February, we identified higher inventory levels that were built to support the second-half of 2017, which didn\u2019t materialize the way we had originally anticipated and we planned to work down the first-half of 2018, and we expected meaningfully elevated inventories on the midyear growth rate that was consistent with our 2017 year and the increase of 26%.","Now on the first quarter call, we adjusted our mid-year expectations to be up less than 20%. This morning, we announced an 11% increase in inventory result that should demonstrate to you our commitment to setting ourselves up for a healthier marketplace in the second-half of 2018 and beyond. And that\u2019s just it getting healthier, leaner, and stronger. With our customers who want the most current assortment, improved service levels and turns and with our consumers who demand newness, innovation and availability or in some cases scarcity.","The additional inventory management actions we choose to employ don\u2019t, of course, come with other cost, which you can see flowing through gross margin in our second quarter results and full-year expectations. Short-term pain for long-term gain.","We\u2019re managing the marketplace with more prudence and discipline. This improvement in trend is not done as we expect high single-digit inventory increase at the end of the third quarter right on track for our goal of being up in the low single-digit rate by the end of the year.","All in, this proactive inventory strategy combined with the supply chain initiatives that we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls around tighter inventory buys, SKU materials optimization and vendor consolidation gets us closer to a full model and line of sight toward longer-term margin improvement opportunities.","With respect to longer-term transformational strategies, following the adoption of our category management structure, new systems and our reengineered go-to-market process, the next logical step was to better align our regional operating model, specifically to three international regions.","With the appointments of Jason Archer as Managing Director of Asia Pacific, Manuel Ovalle as Managing Director of Latin America, and Massimo Baratto, as Managing Director of EMEA, along with the continued leadership of Jason LaRose, who leads North America, our regional structure is set.","Uniformity and coordination across our full regions and architecture that reports directly to me ensure strategic operational and financial discipline to play the long game with respect to driving optimal business results and leveraging scale, while protecting our brand.","With that, let\u2019s touch on how each of our regions perform for us in the quarter. Revenue in North America was up 2%, or 1% currency neutral. This result was slightly better than our regional expectation due to additional inventory management actions and better than planned service levels.","In EMEA, revenue was up 25% on a currency neutral basis with strong growth across the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels and particular strength in the UK, Germany, and Spain. Currency neutral revenue in Asia Pacific was up 28% with strong balanced wholesale and direct-to-consumer growth and continued strength in China, Korea and Australia.","And finally, revenue for Latin America was up 12% currency neutral. And in this region, we remained focused on optimizing our mix of the right partners and business models across the portfolio.","So to wrap it up after my first year at Under Armour, I\u2019m extremely proud of the work we\u2019ve done and appreciative of the partnership between Kevin, Dave and myself. We\u2019re making the tough decisions to transform this company from a great brand with good operations to a great brand with great operations.","And I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave to review our financials.","David Bergman","Thanks, Patrik. To start, I\u2019d like to provide an update to our 2018 restructuring plan and the one-time items that impacted our second quarter and will impact our full-year. In February, we announced the restructuring plan of approximately $110 million to $130 million in pre-tax restructuring related charges for 2018. In the second quarter, we recognized $85 million of these charges, including $64 million in cash and $21 million in non-cash related items.","During the quarter, we identified approximately $80 million in additional opportunities to better align our cost structure with our long-term goals. Inclusive of these opportunities, we now expect our 2018 restructuring plan to be approximately $190 million to $210 million. It\u2019s important to note that the majority of these new items are related to additional long-term contract, facility, and lease terminations, of which the larger benefits impact 2020 and beyond.","We continue to analyze our evolving cost structure refine our plan. Accordingly, we anticipate completing our diligence and recording all related one-time charges by the end of this year with respect to the approximate $75 million in annual savings that we previously cited for 2019 and beyond. While we do anticipate this amount to increase, we are not prepared to get more specific at this time as we assess the right balance of reinvestment into areas, including marketing, innovation and our DTC and international businesses.","Moving on to our second quarter results. I\u2019ll start with revenue, which was up 8% to $1.2 billion, or up 7% if you exclude the impacts of foreign currency. By channel, our wholesale business was up 9% to $710 million, driven primarily by inventory management initiatives, including increased sales through the off-price channel, as well as continued strength in our international business.","Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 7% to $414 million, driven by continued strong results in our international and e-commerce businesses. DTC was 35% of total global revenue in the quarter. Licensing was down 16% to $21 million due to softer North American demand.","By product and segment type, apparel revenue increased 10% to $747 million, driven by training and running. Revenue for our footwear business increased 15% to $271 million, driven by running and team sports. Revenue for accessories decreased 14% to $106 million due to softer demand and actions to optimize our distribution. And finally, our Connected Fitness business was up 12% to $29 million, driven primarily by increases in subscription revenue.","Turning to gross margin. On a GAAP basis, we saw 110 basis points decline to 44.8% in the second quarter, as inventory management initiatives flow through the P&L. Excluding the restructuring, which contained about $6 million of inventory impact, adjusted gross margin was 45.3%. To walk through the components, adjusted gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 240 basis points of channel mix due to a higher composition of off-price sales related to inventory management initiatives. This was partially offset by about 170 basis points of benefit from product cost improvements and changes in foreign currency.","SG&A expense increased 10% to $553 million, driven by continued investments in our DTC, footwear and international businesses, along with a reserve related to a commercial dispute. Additionally, there was a meaningful shift to marketing expenses associated with our new training campaign into the second-half of the year. Inclusive of $85 million of planned restructuring charges recorded during the quarter, our operating loss was $105 million. Excluding the charges, adjusted operating loss was $20 million.","Interest and other expense was $17 million, which was impacted by changes in foreign currency. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22%. Excluding restructuring charges and a refinement to our 2017 one-time U.S. tax reform impact, the adjusted effective tax rate was 8%.","And a reminder, the weight of discrete international items recorded in certain foreign markets are particularly impactful to our effective tax rate in periods like the second quarter, which has smaller consolidated pre-tax income or loss levels. Taking this to the bottom line, net loss was $96 million and diluted loss per share was $0.21. Excluding restructuring impact, adjusted net loss was $34 million and adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.08.","On our balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were up 19% to $197 million, total debt was down 18% to $779 million, capital expenditures were down 59% to $34 million, and inventory was up 11% to $1.3 billion, a significantly lower growth rate versus last quarter.","Turning to our 2018 outlook. We now expect full-year revenue to be up approximately 3% to 4%, with international growth of greater than 25%, being offset by a low to mid single-digit decline in North America. From a product perspective, footwear is still expected to grow at a low single-digit rate. Apparel is now expected to be up at a mid single-digit rate, reflecting additional inventory management actions. And within accessories given softer demand and work we\u2019re doing to optimize our distribution, we now expect a low single-digit rate decline for the year.","Given the strategic decision we made to accelerate our inventory management actions, coupled with changes in foreign currency headwinds that we\u2019re facing in the second-half due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we\u2019re expecting our gross margin to be in line or down slightly against last year\u2019s 45%. Excluding the restructuring charges, adjusted gross margin is now expected to be up slightly, as benefits from product cost and lower planned promotional activity are offset by inventory management actions.","SG&A is still expected to grow at a mid single-digit rate. Given the expansion of our 2018 restructuring plan, we now expect an operating loss in the range of $50 million to $60 million. Excluding the restructuring, there\u2019s no change to the expectation that adjusted operating income will reach approximately $130 million to $160 million.","And finally, with no change to our expected 25% to 27% full-year adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share stays in the range of $0.14 to $0.19 for 2018. With respect to the balance of the year, we expect third quarter revenue to be in line to slightly down versus last year.","Third quarter adjusted gross margin is expected to be down approximately 50 basis points due to continued inventory management action. This should be followed by an expected fourth quarter improvement due to anticipated lower composition of off-price sales and higher DTC mix, coupled with continued product costing improvements, primarily due to supply chain initiatives.","SG&A is expected to be up at a mid-teen rate in the third quarter, driven by the marketing shift I mentioned earlier and continued efforts to support our global UA HOVR and training campaigns, as well as stores expenses associated with the expansion of our international DTC. Third quarter adjusted operating income is expected to be approximately $75 million to $80 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $0.11 to $0.12.","Finally, Patrik will walk you through inventory, but to revisit, we\u2019re up \u2013 we were up 27% at the end of Q1, up 11% as of June 30, and Q3 should be up at a high single-digit rate on our way to a low single-digit increase by the end of 2018. That concludes our prepared remarks.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Randy Konik","Yes, thanks a lot. Question for Kevin and Patrik. Can you give us your \u2013 both of you give us your thoughts on how you see the overall state of the business and the health of the Under Armour brand? And then you continue to tell this nice story of \u2013 being a better run company, and as that continues to unfold here, maybe give us some color on what kind of KPIs you\u2019re looking at to measure yourself against to continue to get better and better each quarter here? Thanks, guys.","Patrik Frisk","Yes, I think \u2013 hi, this is Patrik. Yes, I think, in terms of the state of the business, I think, what you\u2019re seeing now is definitely a stabilization, right? And especially as we look at our North America business, we feel very good of where we are right now in North America and really confident as we look ahead. And as it relates to the brand, since I got here a year ago, we\u2019ve invested heavily into consumer insights.","We have given you guys some information around the work that we\u2019ve done around global segmentation, understanding where the consumer is in relation to the brand and we\u2019re measuring ourselves and holding ourselves accountable to the measurements that relates to that work that we\u2019ve done.","So we\u2019re looking very deeply at things like brand awareness, consideration across the world. And I think one of the great things that we\u2019re seeing right now in North America, for example, the brand is stable. And in our international regions, both brand awareness and consideration is growing very fast.","So this get big fast strategy that we\u2019ve had in North America and also are \u2013 having now in international and the way that we\u2019re rolling out, for example, in China, the premium expression through our brand houses is certainly paying off in combination with the increased marketing spend around being truly 360 degree digital, and then \u2013 and we believe that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really starting to move the needle for us.","So we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable to the KPIs and we\u2019ll talk a lot more about this at the Investor Day towards the end the year. But we\u2019re very, very confident of where we are right now and with the operational work that we\u2019re doing around making sure that we have the right amount of SKUs and that we\u2019re able to drive higher efficiencies in the back and in terms of how we think about the number of vendors we have. And in our cost base, we\u2019re feeling really, really confident. So I don\u2019t know, Kevin, if you want to add on a little bit to that perhaps.","Kevin Plank","Yes, thank you, Patrik, and Randy, thank you for the question. And I\u2019d like to start by just saying that, we\u2019re incredibly sober as we think about you asking that question to us. What I\u2019ll tell you this, is that, number one, I believe as well as I do many others believe that Under Armour is a great brand. I think, we\u2019ve proven that. And one thing is certain is that great brand and door and they see many chapters in our lives, and we certainly live several of those to our first 13 or nearly 14 years as a public company.","First and foremost, I want to reiterate the fact that we are playing the long game. And what we\u2019re relying on is the strength of the innovation pipeline, A, that we\u2019re putting out to market and you\u2019ll see it more and more and continue to accelerate and watch that momentum drive. And one thing that is certain that we\u2019ve learned over our 20-some-year history as a company is that great product wins. That is it at the end of the day and that\u2019s what established and built this brand.","But in addition to a great product, we\u2019re now also driving operational discipline. We\u2019re looking to make it a true core competency for the business that I believe and we believe will really truly unlock the clear potential that this company has, and the good news that we\u2019re making great progress against it. And so hopefully, you see that through things like our inventory and issues that we\u2019re attacking.","What we believe in \u2013 and the proof point for that is, when we do make great products, the consumer comes and HOVR is probably a great example and we\u2019ve used that a lot. But the fact is, we put product in the market in the first-half of this year at $110 or $140 price point, and we sell great sell-through and product at the consumers and high demand for.","We call that the trifecta, I mentioned in my script. The style, performance and fit. When we get those things \u2013 three things right, we\u2019re going to win. The brand position for Under Armour is really simple. We have a reason for being, when you think about brands, because when we say great brands will endure, the reason for Under Armour is that, every product does something.","We lean on this performance mentality as a company and as a business, because when you put up Under Armour product on, your natural question should be, well, what does it do. And the fact is, it should make you better. We\u2019re also an authentic story founded on the field of sports, and that\u2019s something we think that grounds us for a very, very long time.","Our ambition that we have as a company is to be the world\u2019s greatest performance brand. And we believe that, that mindset, as we said before, is going to prove to be our most important strategy. And we\u2019re looking forward to expanding on that as well at our Investor Day in December.","Randy Konik","Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Edward Yruma","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, first, you kind of touched on this in your last answer. But obviously some good storytelling on footwear. Outside of Curry, Project Rock and HOVR, how broad-based is the strength, or are those three franchises driving the growth?","And then second, I noticed in the cash flow statement, there was a purchase of equity method investment. Just wanted to understand what that was? Thanks so much.","Patrik Frisk","So I\u2019ll take the first part of that then you can tap in on the equity part, Dave. Yes, there is a broader success for us in footwear. We talked a lot, of course, about our marquee initiatives that are driving the top end. But the reality is, as we have talked to you guys about before, our segmentation wasn\u2019t done as well as it could have been done, I guess. If you look back into the end of 2016 and early 2017, as we did increase our distribution into more channels.","We believe that as we turn the corner into 2018, the distribution segmentation has been more optimized. And we\u2019re seeing great success at other price points, too. Kevin mentioned HOVR at $110 and $140, and Curry is, of course, up there too as well as Rock. But when you look below $100, we also have seen great success and great traction also at the $80, $90 price point.","So there is more foundational success there in footwear than we usually talk about. And we\u2019re looking forward to giving you a little bit more color on that as we work towards Investor Day. And as we think about the future, we\u2019re working, of course, to make sure that we\u2019re optimizing that segmentation globally, which is also starting to show us that we can be competitive across the range as it relates to whole channel and price when we segment correctly. But it has to be the right SPF solid performance and fit, like Kevin said. We make the great product with the right design, we win.","Kevin Plank","And I\u2019ll just pile on that which is, I think, some of the learnings that we\u2019ve had as building this brand is one thing that is certain is driving franchises. And so you hear us talk about our marquee franchises upfront. And so driving Rock product at $130 and $140-plus price points, Curry to $130, HOVR Phantom at $140, those are things that have certainly worked for us, but we continue to drive price points we \u2013 as well in things like cleated.","It\u2019s important that we win there. It\u2019s important that we continue to drive and bring innovation. And beyond it are some of the things that you don\u2019t hear about a lot, and it\u2019s our Fortis and Slingflex and Shift and Road that we\u2019re getting price points. But we\u2019re not down, where we want to focus in some of those marquee price points particularly as it relates to the appropriate distribution and hitting that sweet spot of $90 price points in sporting goods. And some of the other things that we can push in with the mall guys.","So we\u2019ve also, I think, driven a bit of innovation through places like our UA icon project. So being relevant and this is a product that you can go online you can order product and you can custom make footwear for yourself and it\u2019ll deliver within four weeks. And so we\u2019re quickly looking to drive that timeframe down and getting it into something where consumers can order it within just a few weeks.","So we\u2019re pushing that, and I think also we\u2019ve seen a lot of light and bright spots from places like our sports style collections, 24\/7, Drift, Real fit, Remix and some of these other franchises we\u2019ve been building.","David Bergman","And this is Dave. To the second part of your question on the equity investment that\u2019s in the cash flow. What that relates to is, if you recall, we have a license partner that runs our business for us in Japan, they\u2019ve been a phenomenal partner for many years. And we had a small interest in them. We increased that interest to 29.5%.","As their license agreement was coming up for renewal, we thought it was a great time to take advantage of that renew, increase our ownership and with that also bolster our shareholder agreement to make sure we even had more protective provisions involved as we continue to work with them and expand in that region. So we just took advantage of that opportunity and that\u2019s the increase there you see in the equity method.","Edward Yruma","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Robert Drbul","Hi, good morning. Just wondered\u2026","Kevin Plank","Good morning.","Robert Drbul","\u2026good morning \u2013on \u2013 can you talk a little bit about the women\u2019s business and the progress you\u2019re making there? And I guess, the second question, as you mentioned, getting some of the product cleaned up through off-price, what is the level of off-price and where do you see that if you look out 12 months from now as well? Thanks.","Patrik Frisk","So \u2013 hi, Bob, this is Patrik. I think, as it relates to women specifically, we\u2019ve done a similar work in women\u2019s that we\u2019ve done in our other product categories as it relates to making sure that we move forward, we\u2019re segmenting that product better. We\u2019re being more diligent about how we think about SKUs, how we think about innovation, and we\u2019re seeing a rejuvenation in our women\u2019s business, especially as we look into our international business. And we\u2019re very bullish about where we see that business moving in the future. It\u2019s still a great opportunity for us.","And I believe that as we think about, especially the work that we\u2019re doing with our international teams in China and in Europe, that is a an enormous opportunity for the brand across many different silhouettes and also across our footwear. One of the great things about the HOVR that Kevin talked about before, that\u2019s both just men\u2019s and women\u2019s silhouettes and they\u2019re working well for both gender.","So it\u2019s not just an apparel initiative for us anymore. It\u2019s truly a head-to-toe approach. And we\u2019re feeling that we\u2019re getting the traction when we have the right product with right segmentation, right marketing in the right channel. So feeling really good about that. I don\u2019t know if you want to add something about inventory, Dave.","David Bergman","Yes, Bob, relative to the inventory, I think, sales for the off-price channel are probably more of a peak in Q1 through Q3 and then tapering off a little bit in Q4 as we\u2019re getting ahead of it. So we\u2019re \u2013 I would say, full-year is slightly higher than prior year relative to that channel, but it\u2019s really helping us drive down the overhang of inventory that we spoke to relative to 2017 and setting ourselves up to be clean going into 2019. And the off channel partners that we\u2019ve used have been fantastic partners and how we work through that.","Patrik Frisk","I think, if I just add some color to that, Dave, I think, the other thing that you \u2013 that we\u2019re also doing is, we\u2019re making sure that our future buys are getting tighter as well. So we\u2019re really working to make sure that operationally we\u2019re tightening up our operating mall to ensure that we\u2019re buying the right amount of inventory going forward to make sure we\u2019re not getting into the same situation again.","Robert Drbul","Great. Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Thanks very much, Bob. We just want to make sure that we understand the opportunity we have in women\u2019s is obviously one of the largest white space as we look at as a company. We\u2019ve also been able to establish $1 billion business there, but we recognize that we\u2019ve been somewhat inconsistent. What we do have there is, we own the base layer for that female athlete and it\u2019s her bras and her bottoms. And so we want to double down there.","We\u2019ll make sure that we own that position, and then we\u2019ll continue to find things like in the footwear space like we did with HOVR, so just as well as we did on the men side of the business and also some new franchises we\u2019ve been building and things like our product called Breathe Lace. So we\u2019re seeing some success and we\u2019re not where we need to be yet, but we see great opportunity and women\u2019s is a massive, massive opportunity in this year for this brand.","Robert Drbul","Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. Hi, thank you. Dave, I wanted to follow-up on some of your comments around the guidance and maybe looking big picture on the year. I know you over delivered the profit targets for Q2 maintained the full-year outlook. And I wanted to ask about your overall confidence in the outlook, if that\u2019s changed at all, especially given some of the remarks about Q3 and kind of the implied margin improvement that you\u2019ll need in the fourth quarter. If you could talk about the confidence there and maybe a little more color on the drivers of that and permit later in the year?","David Bergman","Sure, Jonathan. When you look at the full-year, I think, the message that we\u2019re trying to get across is that, we\u2019re basically executing on the plan we laid out six months ago with a few minor changes. One is, we wanted to more aggressively get after the inventory overhang we\u2019ve been using the off-price channel more so to do that. And that\u2019s one of the pieces of the lift in Q2 and full-year.","We also have had a little bit better than expected service levels, as we continue to or supply chain continues to optimize how we work within our new ERP system. We were a little cautious in those forecasts, and so we\u2019re doing a little bit better against that. So it\u2019s those two pieces that really overdrove Q2 a little bit and is also part of the race or the larger part of the race for the the full-year. So high level.","We\u2019re still driving through the same plan we laid out six months ago, which we\u2019re excited about, because we\u2019ve been a little more aggressive with working down the inventory through the off-price channel, you see that pressure in our gross margin rate, which we\u2019ve guided a little bit lower than what we\u2019ve guided to over the last two calls. But then at the end of the day between the revenue lift offset by a little bit lower gross margin, your bottom line is pretty much the same.","So we\u2019re still executing on the same plan as we go through the year, and we think about some of the quarterly flow in looking at Q3 and Q4, for the gross margin, for example, we\u2019re guiding to it down 50 basis points in Q3, which implies a pretty big raise in gross margin in Q4.","And when you really look at that, Q4, from day one, we planned that Q4 was going to be our largest gross margin rate improvement, the largest factor being significant supply chain initiatives that we initiated last year that really take hold within our later fall winter 2018 product assortments and also our spring\/summer 2019 product assortments.","So those positively impact Q4 selling margins for us. Also, we\u2019ve had three quarters of \u2013 in a row higher off-price channel sales that are going to start to tail off in Q4, as we\u2019re getting ahead of that inventory situation. So that obviously helps year-over-year margin in Q4 as well.","And then lastly, we\u2019re planning Q4 North America to be a little less promotional than what we did last year and really trying to stay brand right in premium. So all those things are really helping Q4 gross margin. We think about that Q3 and Q4 flow that I mentioned.","Kevin Plank","I would just add, Dave. We\u2019re also \u2013 we\u2019re actually planning in promotions down also in Q3, the whole second-half actually.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if I could, just a broader question for Patrik or Kevin. I\u2019m curious if they have any more insights on the degree to which the product pipeline is filling maybe more beyond 2018, given the lead times there. But any more color at a high level kind of state of the multi-year pipeline and maybe what to expect as we look out in the future years?","Patrik Frisk","Yes, we\u2019re really excited about when we think about the future. And part of that is, because we\u2019ve also been as we\u2019ve been building our commercial go-to-market and making that more robust, we\u2019ve also made sure that we\u2019ve actually moved part of that up into our innovation funnel.","So we\u2019ve been working simultaneously on both the go-to-market for our commercial engine and for our innovation engine, making sure that those two engines are tied at the hip. So in other words, driving innovation calibrated to the work we\u2019re doing with consumer insights and our commercial engine making sure that we\u2019re stacking up innovations and platforms, future franchise building, if you like, for years to come.","And when we look at it today and we think out in 2019, 2020, 2021 into the next three years, we will have a steady drift or launch, if you like, of great innovations and platforms that we\u2019re now going to be able to actually commercialize as they drop into the commercial calendar.","So we\u2019re getting much more diligent about that process and how we do that. We invested heavily into our footwear innovation engine, for example. We opened up our Portland office in August of last year, that\u2019s now getting up to speed. It\u2019s almost a year in. We have great people, great staff, great innovation going on out there. We have our lighthouse facility here in Baltimore, where we\u2019re doing a lot of our apparel innovation, that\u2019s now also fully up to speed under Clay Dean\u2019s leadership. He\u2019s been here now over a year.","So the combination of great people, great structure, great process marrying the innovation pipeline with the commercial pipeline putting those two things together and really planning our business and tying it into our supply chain makes us very confident that product is going to come out of Under Armour in years to come. It\u2019s going to make you better and it\u2019s going to be product that you never knew you needed, but once you have it, you can\u2019t live without it.","Jonathan Komp","Yes, I appreciate the insights. Thank you.","Patrik Frisk","Thank you.","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Jon.","David Bergman","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jim Duffy","Good morning.","Kevin Plank","Good morning.","Jim Duffy","I\u2019m hoping for some perspective on the composition of the inventory as we see the month into the second-half of the year. How much 2017 inventory remains to work through? And how are your levels of spring\/summer 2018 access as you exit the season?","David Bergman","Yes, Jim, this is Dave. We normally don\u2019t really break down the break between the seasonal inventory. But what I would tell you is that, the off-price channel that we\u2019ve been driving through to help with the inventory overhang has mainly been relative to 2017 products. So we\u2019re really getting pretty clean on that as we move through the year. And some of the more current 2018 product, we\u2019re continuing to move that through our normal channel.","So overall, health of the inventory is fairly good. It\u2019s still more than what we want and we\u2019re going to continue to actively manage that down and continue to work through the operational discipline to not create as much excess inventory going forward. But there\u2019s not a lot of older inventory remaining. It\u2019s pretty healthy what is left on the balance sheet and then we\u2019re going to move through it.","Jim Duffy","Okay, very good. And can you guys speak in more detail about some of the additional restructuring opportunities identified? What\u2019s the nature of some of the lease and contract terminations? Why did you feel it made sense to exit those agreements? And what was the kind of a financial analysis associated with that?","Kevin Plank","Sure, Jim. A couple of things there. As we continue to kind of dig through the year to really make sure we\u2019re right-sizing the cost structure and kind of optimizing our SG&A to be able to invest more in the areas of higher return and pullback or cut back on areas with lower return. There are a few stores in North America that we\u2019re going to be addressing that we weren\u2019t originally looking at. But the bigger we dig in, the more we\u2019re kind of uncovering some things that we think can really help the long-term and those have some longer tails for them.","Also relative to distribution facilities, those plans take a few years in the making. And so some of those plans we laid out when we were at a higher revenue trajectory versus where we are right now. In addition, the supply chain initiatives are driving a significant reduction in our SKUs going forward.","So the combination of those two things as far as right-size revenue in our plan and right-size our SKU rationalization are two of the big driving forces that are allowing us to optimize our distribution facility space and therefore, exit a few spaces that are less efficient for us and make sure that we\u2019re focusing only on the bigger more efficient boxes that we really need for the future.","We also continue to dig deep on marketing and making sure with our ROMI work, our return on marketing investment that our dollars are in the right spot to align with our long-term strategies. And so we\u2019re addressing a few of those areas as well. And then also we\u2019ve got a business model change that we\u2019re in the process of working through in Brazil. Brazil has been a little challenging for us with the economy as it has been for others.","But also as far as having local for local supply chain capabilities within the country, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re not completely up on yet as well. And so finding a great partner to help us build the brand there and flipping that to a license model to do so to be able to reduce the volatility, increased profit margin is something we\u2019re working through right now as well. There\u2019 charges related to that change. So a lot of great news relative to the long-term, but we\u2019re not really going to disclose specific locations or leases or assets out of respect for the negotiation of those parties.","Jim Duffy","Very good. Thanks for that perspective.","Kevin Plank","No problem.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad","Okay, thank you for all the information. Good morning.","Kevin Plank","Hi, Omar.","Omar Saad","Wanted to ask you a little bit about Amazon. We noticed you guys are pretty active \u2013 the brand was pretty active during prime day in that period. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re using it as a clearance channel or you have to build the brand there and build that relationship, any color there? I also wanted to ask about your partnership with the Rock, it\u2019s kind of a unique interesting asset for an athletic brand. If you bring in new access to new customer groups or segmentations, how you see your relationship with them evolving and over time and how you think it kind of contributes to the brand messaging globally? Thanks.","Patrik Frisk","Hi, Omar, this is Patrik. Thanks for your questions. To begin with Amazon, where we \u2013 Amazon is a great partner to us. We\u2019re not using Amazon at all as any sort of a clearing house. We\u2019re dealing with Amazon like we deal with our other wholesale customers and we have a global relationship with them in a sense that we\u2019re also doing business with them in Europe and in India.","So our business with Amazon is very healthy. We have a strong relationship and the business continues to grow, and we will continue to work closely with Amazon into the future. We believe it\u2019s a channel distribution that\u2019s important for the brand and we have a very strong relationship.","As it relates to Rock, we\u2019re very, very happy with the relationship with that athlete, actor, person and his team, and we\u2019ve had great success with launching collections, both in apparel and in footwear and now also in headphones. We released headphones together with JBL about a month ago or three weeks ago, I believe it was. Those are blowing out as well. And it\u2019s a little bit of a different asset for us in terms of how to think about his enormous social media reach across the world.","So we believe that he fits the perfect build, if you like, in terms of training, the training category for us, and he has global appeal. So we believe that we have a lot of legs in terms of our relationship there going forward into more and more categories. And I\u2019m sure that Kevin wants to add a little bit of color on the product side here and the relationship that\u2019s been a long one.","Kevin Plank","Yes. Thanks, Omar, for the question is that, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s very unique and some one like the Rock is, he\u2019s bigger than life in so many ways. He was just named the highest paid actor of all time. So he\u2019s unique and he\u2019s got a very sort of special thing that he brings to Under Armour.","One thing to remember with any of the partnerships that we have, what\u2019s critical is that, we\u2019re always driving brand. Everything we do has to be accretive to the brand is that as big as some of these partnerships are, building a Curry business that\u2019s in the nine-figure range. These are still things that are \u2013 they\u2019re not the underlying strength that we need for the overall brand. They certainly accent it.","And so what we want to do is we want to take bold visions with each of our unique assets like Stephen and like Rock. And the \u2013 these guys don\u2019t think small. They\u2019re asking how do we build $300 billion, $500 billion dollar businesses. And so we want to make sure that we\u2019re right-sizing and understanding what that means in the go-to-market, in the calendar, the new 16-month calendar as well that we can stay close and current to market with the demand of the consumer.","So like the Stephen Curry, it\u2019s \u2013 the success that we saw with the Curry 4, what we\u2019re seeing with the Curry 5 and then the excitement we have in the Curry 6 dropping at the end of this year. We want to build the ability to capture the market, but you also see us also capturing scarcity. And I think it\u2019s important that we balance those two things, as we\u2019re not looking for a novelty business that\u2019s here today and gone tomorrow, but how do we build businesses that could be sustainable and long-term.","So like the Rock headphones and there\u2019s nothing like getting a phone call for doing the right job and saying, my headphones sold out in three hours, my shoe sold out in 30 minutes, and we recognize that and capture, but we also see a great opportunity there. So we want to be smart and prudent.","We also want to make sure that everything we\u2019re doing is brand accretive. And the great thing about, I think, the partners that we brought on Board is the ones that are looking and interested in the overall promotion and growth of the overall health and strength of the Under Armour brand. So that connection together is something that makes something really unique and we\u2019ll continue to capitalize on wherever we can.","Omar Saad","Thanks, guys.","Kevin Plank","Thanks very much, Omar.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Can I just ask you a quick one on the model. You were talking about the $75 million of charges for lease termination. I know you don\u2019t want to get into a lot of details, Patrik, but could you just help us think about how many of the revenue-generating assets have already happened or already maybe impacting the direct-to-consumer number in the second quarter?","And how much of that is still to come? And for full transparency, I\u2019m asking, because I know third quarter is usually when you give us an initial look at 2019 revenues? And I want to make sure we\u2019re thinking alongside you as we try to run rate our trends, if there are some incremental headwinds to come?","Kevin Plank","Why don\u2019t you give some more details?","David Bergman","Yes, and Michael, this is Dave. A couple of things, I guess, we are addressing some doors in North America, but keep in mind the starting base of doors there was around 20. So there\u2019s not a lot of doors in question. So even though that we are closing down some that are less profitable, it does not have a dramatic impact on our revenue for the year. Obviously, it has a little bit more impact back-half versus front-half, but it\u2019s really not dramatic and it\u2019s already built into our guidance.","So no real big surprise there. And then relative to the other restructuring activities, they\u2019re not \u2013 there aren\u2019t really any that are tied to revenue other than maybe the change from Brazil from a full sub to a license. So obviously, that\u2019s a lower revenue stream, but it\u2019s a more profitable revenue stream. So there is a change there and that will have a little bit of a back-half versus front-half impact as well.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then I wanted to really talk to you about the gross margin. The guidance were down 50 in the third quarter, I think, since last time. I think, since last year we started talking about 2018, it was framed at a pretty hard line between first-half and second-half related to off-price inventory clearing can see a lot of the progress you made in the second quarter.","It sounds like there\u2019s a little more of the component in the third quarter than you embedded in the guidance initially. So conversely, is there anything you guys need to think about to navigate higher level of inventory that might be off your books, but I don\u2019t see off-price channel in the third quarter?","David Bergman","I mean, I think, it\u2019s probably a fair statement that we\u2019re doing a little bit more of the off-price in the third quarter than we originally anticipated as we want to be more aggressive in cleaning up the balance sheet before we end the year, so that\u2019s definitely fair.","I also \u2013 relative to Q3, it\u2019s a little bit of a lower growth rate for us internationally versus the other growth rates other quarters within the year for different reasons relative to shipment timing, distributor sales, and things like that and store opening dates. And so our largest driver within international is the Asia Pacific region, which is also our highest gross profit region.","So if international is going to be a little bit of a slow rate in Q3 versus the rest of the quarters, that also has a little bit of an impact on the gross margins as well. So there\u2019s a couple of different things coming into play as we wrap up the more aggressive inventory management actions as we get towards the end of Q3 and then move into a different place in Q4.","Michael Binetti","All right. So I guess, if I can sneak one more and I hate to have asked you so many near-term questions. As you think a little bit longer-term about the gross margin strategy, I think, it\u2019s more interesting to think \u2013 I assume some of this will come at the Analyst Day. But I think it will be great to understand your goal of moving the company towards higher levels of profitability.","And I think we\u2019ll be coming off this call here thinking sales are generally moving in the right direction for you, you\u2019re managing costs. And if you\u2019re driving sales, you\u2019ll get some of your earnings back. But a really big component of driving earnings out longer-term is the gross margin. Can you just help us think bigger picture about where we\u2019re headed on the big components of the gross margin as you look out over the next few years?","David Bergman","Yes, Michael, obviously, we\u2019re focusing on 2018 for this call. We absolutely appreciate the interest in 2019 and beyond and quite frankly, we are focusing on that incredibly throughout this year. And a lot of the things we\u2019re doing whether it be on the supply chain initiatives to help gross margin, whether it be getting cleaner on our inventory before we get into 2019, whether it be adjusting our \u2013 and really dealing with our cost structure, better product and better product, et cetera. A lot of these things are going to add up to where we want to drive for 2019 and beyond. But until we get to the December Investor Day, we\u2019re going to hold back on any details there.","Michael Binetti","Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Kevin Plank","Thanks, Michael.","David Bergman","Thanks, Michael.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole","Great. Thanks so much. My question is on the order book for the U.S. wholesale business pushing into 4Q, as some of the off-price selling kind of rolls off a little bit and maybe you build up sort of more of that regular price business. Can you just talk about what percentage of yours you expect for 4Q or in hand today and specifically within that core sporting goods channel?","Patrik Frisk","Well, I \u2013 this is Patrik here. We don\u2019t normally comment on that. But I can say that just building on what Dave talked about earlier, we\u2019re rolling off heavier inventory levels into 2019 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now is making sure that we\u2019re doing what\u2019s right for the business, which is making sure that we\u2019re getting out of inventory and then making sure we\u2019re not buying as much going forward, and making sure that we\u2019re really being prudent with how we think about that.","David Bergman","And then, Jay, relative to Q4, based on a timing and lead time perspective, we\u2019re looking at a quarter that\u2019s primarily based on booked orders. So there is a fair amount of confidence obviously when you have booked orders in hand. DTC is a different animal, but we feel good about the KPIs driving there.","Patrik Frisk","Yes, and we think through everything whether it\u2019s our SKUs in terms of how we spend our money. I mean, there is about \u2013 there\u2019s a constraint element and a focus element to everything we do at this point in time going forward. And as it relates to inventory, we want to make sure that we\u2019re making the right decisions for the long-term. And that in combination with better segmentation and stronger marketing and a better supply chain, we believe is going to set us up for success going forward.","Jay Sole","Got it.","Kevin Plank","Jay probably one other thing \u2013 I\u2019ll point out real quick that might help you a little bit relative to the model in the Q3, Q4 revenue flow. We are seeing some customer demand shifts to more closely aligned with seasonal changes. And with that, we had some movement of shipments and orders that were in the Q3 timeframe last year that are now shifted a little bit into early Q4.","So our year-over-year revenue flow Q3 to Q4 is a little bit different. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving a little bit of a lower rate in Q3 and then a little bit of a higher rate in Q4 in our implied guidance on revenue.","Jay Sole","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe if I can ask one more on just marketing as a percentage of sales. If you look forward for the rest of the year, where do you expect the right amount to be and what type? And to \u2013 how much do you feel like you need to spend to remind consumers that you are an on field \u2013 authentic on field brand and that sort of relates to sports marketing, whether it\u2019s teams or leagues or players? How are you feeling about that right now in terms of your overall focus on cost control?","Patrik Frisk","Yes, I\u2019ll just add a little bit of color on that. We were, as you know, fairly quiet last year in the back-half. We\u2019re being smarter about how we spend our money. We\u2019ve invested a lot as we\u2019ve talked about in terms of consumer insights. But the one thing we haven\u2019t talked as much about yet and we\u2019ll talk a lot about at the Investor Day is, we\u2019ve also invested into a lot of ROMI work return on marketing investment as it relates to understanding how our marketing dollars have worked for us in the past, and how we should think about spending our money smarter as we go into the back-half of this year and beyond.","We\u2019re also doing a lot of work around digital acceleration. What we mean by that is, we\u2019re working through an understanding where we learn very fast on our digital investments, which is also helping us direct the marketing spend to the right way. And we\u2019ve learned a lot from what we did this year earlier in our digital campaigns around HOVR and the training campaign that we launched in May that was 100% digital.","So we believe that as we look at the back-half of this year, we\u2019re doing more marketing in terms of making our dollars work better for us in the back-half of this year, which gives us a lot of confidence, too, that we\u2019re going to be more successful in the back-half of the year. I don\u2019t know if you want to add some color.","Kevin Plank","And Jay, let me add to that Patrik. I think, if you ask us a year ago, we\u2019re not pleased with how loud we\u2019ve been as a brand. And that\u2019s something in getting into 2017 when we watched our model sort of shift and change. We had to make significant reductions to our SG&A in the current year of 2017, lowering that into 2018 and right-sizing our business. And a lot of the things that we\u2019ve done this year to put our business in the best position to be strong and healthy moving forward. It\u2019s come at a cost, I think, to the amount of amplification or velocity of our storytelling.","That\u2019s something that\u2019s still at the heart and the soul of this brand. I use the word brand very carefully is, because brand is everything. And that it starts with a great product, and it starts with the amplification of the story that we put out about that product. And so we feel very good especially about the processes we\u2019re putting in place to go-to-market, the ability to deliver on time, where we\u2019re not disappointing our consumers first and foremost, but also our customers and making sure that was there and showing up with all the engines firing.","And so I believe a lot of the work that we\u2019ve done, you\u2019re starting to see some of that. It will roll into 2019, no one is at anyway declaring victory. But we know the messaging that we\u2019re capable of and that the consumer is expecting from us. And I think you\u2019re going to start hearing a much louder and a much more deliberate and a strategic thoughtfulness that goes into every dollar that we spend on the marketing side.","And so my job is pressing, Dave, and working with the \u2013 Patrik uses the word constraint, but working within that, but there\u2019s enough money for us. And there\u2019s enough story and perspective of this brand that will cut through for the consumer to really deliver something that will be unique to the market and very special that makes it Under Armour. Dave you want to add anything, okay.","David Bergman","No, I think we\u2019re good.","Jay Sole","Okay. Thank you so much.","David Bergman","Thanks, Jay.","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open.","John Kernan","Hi, guys, thanks for squeezing me in.","Kevin Plank","Hey, John.","John Kernan","Just can you give us an update on the SKU reduction plan and where you expect to be by the end of this year and heading into early 2019. I think, you said 25% reduction by the 2018, 2019 time period and a lot more than that going beyond that. So just any update on where you\u2019ll actually be for a SKU reduction standpoint by the end of this year as we head into early 2019?","Patrik Frisk","The two-year stack from 2019 to 2019 and the back-half of the 2019, we will be closer to 50%. So in the same way that we\u2019re working diligently with our inventory. We are also making real strides and working diligently to make sure that every SKU works harder for us. That also implies that we\u2019ve done other things in terms of our materials dramatically driving down the amount of different types of materials that we use and also driving down trends that we use to make things like zippers, pullovers and all those different things as well beyond the 50% actually.","And when you then go beyond the SKUs, the materials and all of the trims and you go all the way into the back-end, the other thing that we\u2019re also working hard on and Colin Browne is working on in terms of the vendor base. We\u2019re also consolidating the vendor base, right? So larger, better relationships with stronger partners to be able to make sure that we\u2019re ensuring a stronger supply chain to deliver those products. All of that is happening and all of that is starting to take hold in a big way for spring 2019 and accelerating through 2019 into 2020.","John Kernan","It is helpful. And then just one more philosophical question, I guess, towards DTC. Has there been any change in how you\u2019re thinking about that channel? Obviously, you spent some near-term term lease expirations and there\u2019s been some cancel \u2013 cancellations and terminations. Just wondering how you\u2019re viewing the direct channel, both in the physical and digital space?","Patrik Frisk","Yes, I think \u2013 thanks for that question. It\u2019s a really important one that comes back into how we think through the consumer experience for the global brand of Under Armour. We\u2019ll build over 200 stores in the world today this year and we will continue to do that kind of amount going forward and maybe even accelerating it, because we do believe that in every part of the world, there is a retail component that\u2019s needed to actually meet the consumer as the consumer expects that 360 degree or always on experience with the brand.","And we\u2019re looking at actually and we\u2019ll be talking a lot about this at our Investor Day in terms of how we think about our different channels come together in the future for the brand to give that holistic expression and the experience for the consumer. So we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s going on in our direct-to-consumer business, whether it\u2019s our e-com business around the world or our store roll out and we\u2019ll continue to invest into that pure retail format going forward. And we\u2019re doing a lot of updates on it right now and, of course, here in this area, as well as in our other areas we\u2019re also investing into consumer insights.","So we\u2019re getting smarter about what\u2019s actually going on in our stores in terms of how the consumer is shopping and then what the consumer expectation is. So again, there\u2019s an ability and opportunity, we believe for us to also understand that better and combining the information and insights in the store environment together with our online environment together with all of the work we\u2019re doing around our apps, as well as our wholesale business really enables us and gives us an opportunity as a brand to differentiate and build a much, much stronger relationship we believe with the end consumer than most other brands.","John Kernan","Fantastic. Thank you. Looking forward to coming down to Baltimore on December.","Patrik Frisk","Thanks, John.","Kevin Plank","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Plank for some closing remarks.","Kevin Plank","Thank you, operator. One thing I want to be clear is that, I\u2019ve done a lot of these. This is actually my 51st call, and I want to be clear that on this call is that, no way I think are we declaring victory. We\u2019re in the meatiest part of this transformation that we\u2019re going through, and I think that\u2019s coming through right now. But we\u2019re incredibly optimistic of what\u2019s being built. We\u2019re incredibly optimistic about the strength of this brand.","And if there\u2019s a message to come is, number one is that, we\u2019re delivering what we said we would do. But we\u2019re also \u2013 we\u2019re playing a long game, and that this is a multi-year transformation, where as Patrik has alluded to, we will always put the consumer first. And by doing that, we\u2019re going to simplify our operations. It\u2019s \u2013 the hardest thing in business is keeping your business simple, and it\u2019s one thing that we\u2019re working incredibly diligently with our teams across the Board.","And it is a full on effort and it is our internal team. It is our Board of Directors. It is our external team. It\u2019s our partners, our customers that have been so important for us. But we\u2019re increasing our speed to deliver. We\u2019re prioritizing our best and it\u2019s based on return, but that always put the brand first, the brand, the brand, the brand. And I think if there\u2019s a message to come through today is that we are stabilizing this business and that we\u2019re doing it by right-sizing our inventory and our SG&A.","We\u2019re also improving things within the operating model like our systems, our structure, the new go-to-market process and within that creating repeatable processes for us, our product pipeline, our storytelling, again the way that we deliver. But in all these things, the brand remains paramount. Every product does something and that is what makes us specially unique to Under Armour.","Some of these short-term actions that we\u2019re taking to correct some of the inefficiencies we\u2019ve had, we believe will be the long-term structural moves that will actually ensure the fact that brand has the opportunity to become the world\u2019s next great athletic brand. We\u2019re incredibly excited about it. I\u2019m passionate about the team that we have here. I\u2019m appreciative for Patrik joining us and celebrating his one year anniversary, but we have the pieces in place. It\u2019s a matter of us executing at this time. But we\u2019ve got a great opportunity and you can count on this teamwork and everything and given everything they have to make that happen.","Thank you all for your time today. We appreciate and look forward to updating you again in another 90 days.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."]}}
