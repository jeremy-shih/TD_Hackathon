On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Paul Lundstrom [ph], Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.","Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, as they usually do. ","The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay. Thank you and good evening everyone. I appreciate everyone\u2019s flexibility in accommodating our changed schedule tonight for the snow storm which is quickly coming upon us.","Let me start out and talk just briefly about 2014. Then I am going to hand it to Akhil but as you can see from the press release that went out earlier this evening 2014 is largely in line with the expectations we laid out last month at our investor event in New York. Before we get to the results so I would like to take a minute and introduce or reintroduce Akhil Johri, our new CFO. Akhil has been on the job for a few weeks now but you will recall he is a 26 year veteran of United Technologies, recently out of sabbatical as CFO of our Pall Corporation. He knows the business as well, he is highly respected, both within UTC and externally. Needless to say we are excited to have him back on the team. ","Akhil and Paul will take you through the results and I will come back with some thoughts on the year and 2015 before we get into the Q&A.","Akhil, you have the floor.","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Greg. It\u2019s a pleasure to be back. UTC reported 2014 earnings per share of $6.82, up 10% versus the past year and up 12% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. Sales of $65 billion included 4% organic growth with all five segments growing organically for the year. Segment operating margins expanded by 90 basis points to 16.6%, reflecting the benefit of volume leverage and cost control at CCS, along with lower pension expense, synergies and restructuring benefits at Pratt and UTC Aerospace Systems.","Free cash flow to net income was 90% for the year as we had indicated in December and we completed $1.5 billion of share repurchase. ","Moving on to slide two, top line growth continues. Organic sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Recall that Q4 of 2013 was our most difficult compare, so we feel really good about 4% organic as we exit 2014. In the commercial businesses we saw 8% growth in the Americas as the U.S. economic recovery continues. While Europe was up slightly Asia grew 7% but continued growth in China, their sales were up 10%. Growth in commercial Aero OE was offset by lower commercial aftermarket sales at Pratt and Sikorsky. ","Military Aerospace was up 7% led by the timing of OEM deliveries at both Sikorsky and Pratt, partially offset by a weaker aftermarket across the segments. ","Taking closer look at our end markets on slide three, and just as a reminder, we will talk to the commercial business orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So overall trends remain consistent with our expectations throughout the portfolio. In our commercial businesses we continue to see good traction in North America. U.S. consumer sentiment reached its highest level in nearly eight years in December on lower gas prices and better wage and job prospects. ADI trends remain positive and the outlook for commercial construction continues to be encouraging. And this is evident at Otis where North America new equipment orders were up 20% and 40% for the year. ","At CCS, orders for U.S. fire and security and U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was strong, up 18% and 12% respectively. U.S. residential HVAC orders were down slightly year-over-year following a very strong Q3 while sales were up 9%. Europe was soft again in the quarter, with commercial HVAC orders down 9% and Otis new equipment orders down 3%. As you saw on Thursday the ECB announced a significant new quantitative easing program aimed stimulating economic activity in the region. ","In China, Otis new equipment orders were up 2% in the fourth quarter and finished up 6% for the full year. New equipment backlog remains strong, up 13% versus the prior year. While we expect overall economic output in China to moderate it should still outpace global GDP and our building and industrial systems businesses continue to be well positioned in the region. As a reminder however China domestic sales represent just about 6% of total UTC sales. ","Moving to Aerospace, revenue passenger miles continue to grow at slightly above the long-term trend rate. And airline profitability remains strong. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, driven by continuing strength in spares. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were down 6% in the quarter on a tough prior year compare and in-line with our expectations. ","Taking a look at fourth quarter earnings on slide four, total reported sales increased 1% as 4% organic growth was partially offset by three points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Segment operating profit was up 10% and operating margins increased by 120 basis points, including the benefits from pension. And we saw profit growth and margin expansion in all segments during the quarter. Earnings per share of $1.62 were up 3% and included a $0.26 net charge from restructuring and other one-time items. That\u2019s about $0.24 related to the German tax matter that Greg discussed last month and $0.09 of restructuring that was partially offset by $0.07 of one-time gains in the quarter. ","Recall that the fourth quarter of 2013 had $0.09 of net restructuring charges. Absent the impact of these items in both years earnings per share were up 13%. Free cash flow in the quarter was 119% of net income. Capital expenditures were $557 million, as we continued to invest for the ramp up in the commercial aerospace. We acquired $405 million of stock under our share repurchase program and we made nearly $300 million in voluntary pension plan contributions in the quarter. ","One other item to note in Q4, the impact from sudden significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies created a translation FX-related EPS headwind of about $0.04, entirely wiping out the small benefit we had seen in the first three quarters. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has an even larger impact as we look at 2015. As you can see on slide five, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, not just against the euro but against most of the currencies as well. In fact, at a $1, 10 euro which is a little less than today\u2019s rates we have almost $0.25 of headwind that wasn\u2019t contemplated in the initial EPS guidance that we discussed back in December. ","The incremental negative sales impact from translation FX is expected to be around $1.5 billion. We also saw a further dip in the global discount rates for pension expense. On our measurement date of December 31, the U.S. discount rate was 3.9%, about 30 basis points lower than expected adding to another $0.06 of EPS headwind, net of slightly better asset returns and $200 million of cash contribution to the U.S. pension plan. So all together $0.30 or so of new non-operational headwind. Based on this we are updating our 2015 sales and earnings expectations as you can see on slide six. ","As always we remain focused on what we can control. We are now targeting $3 billion of share repurchase at the high end of our prior range. We will take additional cost actions, and at the midpoint of the new range we now have no contingency. Together these actions should offset half of the $0.30 headwind. So we now expect EPS of $6.85 to $7.05 on sales of about $65 billion to $66 billion, down from our previous expectation of $7 to $7.20 EPS on sales of $66 billion to $67 billion. However to make it clear nothing has fundamentally changed in the health of the underlying businesses. ","Just as we told you in December, strong operating leverage across the business should still allow us to deliver segment earnings growth of $0.57 at the mid-point excluding the impact of foreign exchange and pension head winds in 2015 and with no growth at Pratt. That's 8% growth operationally and we will work to rebuild some contingency as we move throughout the year. With that let me turn it over to Paul to take you through the segment results.","Paul Adams","Okay, thanks Akhil. We are now on page seven. Otis sales improved 5% in the quarter at constant currency led by double-digit new equipment growth, noticed most notably in China and the Americas. Service sales were up slightly. Overall foreign exchange translation was a five point headwind to the top line in the quarter. Foreign exchange was also a profit headwind, a full six points. Operationally Otis performance in Q4 was solid with operating profit up 7% at constant currency. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contributions from higher volume and productivity initiatives, most notably from strong performance in the Americas and in Asia.","We did see continued pricing pressure in the quarter, both in Europe service and in China. New equipment orders were up 12% in the quarter at constant FX. Asia was up 16% driven by a large order in Singapore, the Thomson Line transit project and we saw low single digit growth in China. New equipment orders continued to be strong in the Americas where orders were again up double-digit and for the second year in a row we closed the year with double-digit increases in new equipment backlog. For the full year operating profit was up 4% or about $100 million at constant currency on 6% higher organic sales. FX translation for the year had a two point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit.","Turning to page eight, Climate, Controls and Security had good traction in the fourth quarter with 5% organic sales growth. We saw strength in the Americas with residential HVAC and foreign security product businesses both reporting high single-digit growth and commercial HVAC up mid-single digit. Outside of the U.S. EMEA grew low single-digit and Asia was up slightly. Commercial refrigeration was up mid-single-digit, while Transicold was up high single-digit driven by solid growth in container and North America Truck trailer.","At constant currency profit was up 6% in the quarter, driven by contribution from organic volume growth. FX translation represented three points of headwind in the quarter. Margin was up 50 basis points from prior year to 15.7% continuing the CCS margin expansion momentum. CCS global equipment orders were strong, up 11% in the quarter driven largely by Transicold which saw more than 50% growth. ","Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up mid-single-digit driven by the Americas. Orders for global fire and security products finished the year strong and were again up high single-digit based on strength in the Americas and global fire and security field orders were up 5% with growth in all geographies, including Europe.","For the full year operating profit was up 10% at constant currency on 3% organic sales growth achieving record margins of 17% up 130 basis points from prior year. As Akhil mentioned we do see significant headwind from foreign exchange, both at CCS and at Otis. Geraud [ph] will come back in March to talk about specific guidance for those two units.","Moving to Pratt & Whitney on slide nine, Pratt delivered solid results in Q4 with 12% operating profit growth despite continued investment in E&D and a 2% sales decline. In the quarter 4% in military engines was more than offset by a 6% lower commercial aftermarket. Recall that in Q4, 2013 the commercial aftermarket business was particularly strong, up 24%. Operating profit growth was driven by favorable pension and restructuring benefits. The quarter also benefited from better aftermarket contract performance, which helped offset lower aftermarket volume in the quarter. ","Margins were up 170 basis points to 13.8%. For the year Pratt delivered organic sales growth up 2% driven by mid-single-digit growth in the commercial aftermarket. Incremental investments in E&D were more than offset by a tailwind from pension restructuring savings and a stronger aftermarket, both from higher volume and better contract performance. These led to operating profit growth of $200 million for Pratt with the 140 basis points of margin expansion. This is at the high end of the original guide. ","Turning to slide 10, UTC Aerospace Systems continued its strong momentum growing profit 17% on 5% higher organic sales in the quarter. Commercial OEM sales were up 7% and commercial aftermarket sales increased 5% with strong growth in spares even on a difficult compare. Similar to Pratt the commercial aftermarket had a very strong finish to 2013 which led to difficult Q4 comparison. Military sales continued to be soft with the military OEM essentially flat and a low-single digit decline in the aftermarket. Profit growth was driven by strong conversion on the incremental volume, integration synergies and the benefit of lower pension expense. ","Operating margins increased 180 basis points to 17.6%. For the full year sales were up 7% and operating profit was up $327 million or 15% resulting in 130 basis points of margin expansion in-line with our original expectations. The strong full year organic growth of 6% reflects the UTC Aerospace Systems' position in a large and growing commercial aerospace segment. The earnings growth and margin expansion followed the continued successful integration of Goodrich which is now yielding run rate savings of $400 million with line-of-sight visibility to $500 million. ","Turning to Sikorsky on page 11, operating profit increased 38% on 10% higher sales. Sikorsky shipped a total of 72 aircraft in the quarter, including 57 military platforms and 15 commercial. Overall aircraft shipments were down five compared to the prior year but aircraft completion volume, that's the aircraft customization that occurs following base line aircraft delivery, those completions were up significantly driven primarily by international military programs. We also saw growth in our development programs as a number of recently awarded programs, including the U.S. Presidential helicopter have begun their development ramp. ","The operating profit increase was driven by the impact of higher international military volume, better mix on commercial OE volumes and favorable contract adjustments partially offset by the drop through from lower commercial aftermarket volume and unfavorable mix in the military aftermarket. For the year, strong international military and commercial OEM sales coupled with the ramp of funded development programs drove sales 6% higher at Sikorsky. Adjusted for restructuring and special items operating profit of $699 million was up 9%. ","With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap up. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thanks Paul. So all-in-all pretty good year for UTC. As you think about the business it has delivered solid margin expansion to 16.6% and we grew EPS 10%, despite a slower than expected global economic environment. Beyond the financial results we also continue to achieve significant milestones on development programs and to secure key wins for the future. With the Goodrich integration now largely complete we recently announced the elimination of the propulsion and aerospace systems' organization. Pratt and Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems will continue as standalone business units but now reporting directly to me. ","This new streamlined structure better positions us to serve customers and to focus on ensuring a successful entry into service and production ramp up of our Geared Turbofan engine and the numerous aircraft systems designed and developed by the UTAS team. At Pratt and Whitney the GTF engine completed FAA certification for the Airbus A-320 Neo platform on December 19th. The certification marks a key milestone for the engine and the A-320 Neo program, which remains on schedule to enter into service in the fourth quarter of this year. And we continue to make good progress on the more than 35 new system programs underway at UTC aerospace systems. In 2014 we achieved major milestones, including the entry into service on the Boeing 787-9 and the certification of the A-350. ","At Sikorsky, another major win in the quarter. India's Navy selected Sikorsky to fulfill the services maritime helicopter requirement and negotiations are currently underway with the Indian Navy to procure 16 S-70B Sea Hawk helicopters with an option for eight additional aircraft along with the complete logistics support and training program. This represents a major step forward for Sikorsky in an important growth market and positions the business well for future opportunities there. ","The Building and Industrial Systems businesses had another solid quarter with both OTIS and CCS delivering 5% organic sales growth. We feel really good about the progress we've seen in both segments. CCS organic growth has accelerated while delivering 290 basis points of margin expansion since 2012 and OTIS profits are growing again after a couple of very difficult years. ","So good momentum across the board, that's going to allow us to deliver solid organic growth in 2015. The growth rate exiting the year gives us confidence in our sales assumption of 3% to 5% organic growth in 2015 and we expect continued recovery in our North American markets, slight growth in Europe and moderated but still solid growth in China and Asia. ","As Akhil mentioned we do have two headwinds this year that worsened since we spoke in December. And as much as I like to I can't control the FX or the discount rates Akhil hasn't figured out how to help me with that yet. As usual we'll do as much as we can to mitigate these headwinds and that includes leaning out the corporate structure and additional share buyback. ","Lastly we continue to make progress with our portfolio review and as I promised we'll discuss this in more detail over the coming two months. With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Doug Harned","Good afternoon.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hey, Doug. ","Doug Harned","When you described the changes in guidance for the year, can you walk through how that rolls out across the four different businesses compared to what you talked about in December?","Akhil Johri","Sure, Doug. I think for a more precise discussion we'll wait for the President to stand up and talk to you in March, but conceptually you know where this falls, right. The FX headwind is largely going to be in the BIS, space more heavily towards OTIS, which has 80% of its sales internationally and the pension headwind is going to be more in the aerospace space where it will be 40% or so at Pratt and the rest around UTAS and a little bit on the commercial side. ","The good news $0.15 which offsets half of that $0.30 headwind is going to be spread across on the cost reduction side, across all the businesses a little bit and at the corporate office as well. While the share count reduction benefit will be more at the corporate office as you\u2019ll see a lower share count number. ","Doug Harned","And if you look at the operational improvement part of this, so you're looking for -- and I am not sure how much of that $0.15 is operational improvements, but could you describe the kinds of actions you're taking that perhaps you hadn't thought about back in December. You might have thought about but weren't signing up for yet?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think obviously some of the announcements that have gone out over the last couple weeks were all part and parcel to this trend to lean the corporate organizations as well as lean out some of the structures that we have on the aerospace side, specifically at the aerospace systems group. You'll recall Doug at aerospace systems we had two guys running the business, Dave Gitlin and Mike Dumais. We've consolidated all of that under Mike. He\u2019ll be consolidating all the functional responsibilities over the coming weeks as well. So we'll be taking out a significant amount of cost as we go through that. And obviously eliminating Alain\u2019s organization takes a lot across out at the corporate level, some of which got allocated down to Pratt and UTAS. ","So all of this really focused on leaning out the corporate and the overhead organization.","Doug Harned","But does that mean that most of this benefit is occurring on the aerospace side, as opposed to the BIS side?","Akhil Johri","BIS has already been working on that, as you know over the last two sort of integrations that you will, first fire and security into carrier and then now OTIS with CCS. There has been a significant reduction in the overhead and the management structures at those companies. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, if you think about it Doug, Geraud has done the commercial side what we're just doing now on the aero side, like we've taken out over 100 executives first when we put fire and security in to Carrier, put that together under CCS and then as we put the OTIS business under the BIS banner again, more and more executives. And so Geraud has already leaned out the overhead structure in those businesses and that's why you see the margins where you do for BIS, why you see that very, very strong margins, a lot of that is just cost reduction.","Doug Harned","Okay great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joseph Nadol","Thanks, good afternoon. Welcome back Akhil.","Akhil Johri","Thanks Joe.","Joseph Nadol ","Actually just want to continue down that line there, on the PAS elimination, I guess of that structure. Greg a couple of years ago when this was -- this organization was -- stood [ph] up, I thought it was advertised as a cost saving measure and now it\u2019s being advertised again as a cost saving measure when it goes away. I am just wondering if you could explain a little more philosophically which is it? And then you mentioned BIS as well. I am wondering if there is any larger scale changes that we might -- that might be possible on these lines in that organization as well?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well, let\u2019s talk about PAS. I mean origin is, this is only about a couple of years when we put Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand together. This is July of 2012, the idea was we put PAS in to oversee the integration of those businesses and to drive the $500 million of synergy benefit that we were expecting on the acquisition. And I would tell you for the most part that is complete. We have got about $400 million of the $500 million done, we have got line of sight to the next $500 million and more beyond that. So I think Alain and that whole team did exactly what we asked them to do in terms of driving cost reduction across. Not -- and it wasn\u2019t really just the aerospace system, we also did significant cost reduction at Pratt, again leaning out the structure of Pratt to taking about a 20% reduction in the overheads at Pratt and Whitney over the last couple of years. ","So they did exactly what we asked them to do, but again time changes things and today with that mission largely complete I thought it was best to have Paul from Pratt and to have Mr. Gitlin report directly to me. It also gave me the opportunity to take a guy like Mike Dumais who did a wonderful job running his half of the aerospace systems and bring him into the corporate strategy group and let him help me with this portfolio analysis. So this is a win-win ","I think again leaner organization, more focused, I get more line to sight to what\u2019s going on in the business and the businesses get less overhead cost to worry about. As far as BIS book again I would just go back to what I just said. I think Geraud has been doing what we are doing on the aerospace side for the last three years there, they started in 2011 where he put F&S into Carrier again significant overhead reductions. ","The whole idea here is again not to have a lot of overhead. We don\u2019t need that. We want to decentralize the organization, we want decision making close to the customer and not at the corporate center. And my job is not to tell these guys how to run the business. These guys know the customer. Each one of the guys at OTIS, at Carrier, at Fire and Security they are out there on the front line still. They just don\u2019t have that same overhead structure above them and I think Geraud would tell he has got line of sight to lot more clearly as to what\u2019s going on in the business as a result of what he has already done.","Joseph Nadol ","Okay. And second question, a major event this year is the ramp up of more work on GTF and you mentioned you got certified on Airbus. Can you, I guess speak about the industrial part of the ramp up that\u2019s happening this year and maybe give some context as to when you really feel like you can say we\u2019re heading where we should be on the learning curve from a manufacturing standpoint? And then secondly from a cash flow standpoint if there is anything we should know about the profile as you ramp up throughout the year. Will that impact the company cash flow?","Gregory J. Hayes","So Joe let me just put it very simply. We are not going to be done until we are done. But this year we\u2019ll build about 85 engines for the Airbus Neo platform. Next year will be about 220. We will double again in 2017. And so again every time we double the engine production we are coming down a learning curve. I think by the time we get to about the 250th engine which is towards the middle of next year we\u2019ll be pretty close -- we will be closing in on target cost not quite there. By the time we exit \u201817 I think we\u2019ll be at or should be at target cost or somewhere close to that. ","So lot of work to do between here and there. As I said we\u2019re going to get additional negative engine margin this year next year and the following year and then the run rate actually levels out because the number of engine levels out and we continue to come down the cost curve. So we just did a whole review of the production readiness level at Pratt over the last week, had some of the best folks around the business to take a look, to make sure we are on track and well it\u2019s not without risk. And there is a lot to do. We got high confidence that the Pratt guys will get around this and we\u2019re going to be able to meet the production needs at Airbus as well as Bombardier as well as at Mitsubishi as well as with Embraer in 2018. I mean a lot of work to do but a good process in place to make sure that we are going to get there at the right cost. ","Akhil Johri","Just one minor correction Joe, I think Greg said about 80 plus Neo engines, it\u2019s actually more like 40 something and -- for this year. And then the other point on your cash flow I think there is clearly going to be some stress, as you have seen in our numbers for the last year or two. The Aero ramp-up does add to the CapEx number which has been above depreciation by a significant amount and that the number we watch very carefully. Obviously you know our gold standard is to be 100% of net income as free cash flow and last year \u201914 was not there. We still have some pressure in \u201915 as a result of that but we are going to work very hard to take out some other things like focusing on inventory and working capital to try and manage some of the CapEx requirements, that exist in the business from the Aero ramp up.","Joseph Nadol","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hi. Just on the cost side, Greg or Akhil but thinking about raw materials cost, you didn\u2019t address that at all and I was thinking in parts of your business, you could getting some substantial relief. So maybe any color there and you know either hedges or something that are kind of delaying potential positive impacts?","Akhil Johri","Yes, sure Jeff. Probably the biggest item is copper, where you would expect a significant saving there. We do hedge -- we are hedged about 75% of our 2015 requirements at over $3, $3.05, if you will. So there is really limited impact that we will see in the later part with the significant reduction in the copper that has come about lately. But there is definitely going to be benefit on the oil side, the lower fuel cost both for jet fuels that are used by our aerospace companies as well as in the large number of trucks and service vehicles that we had, we should see some benefits there. We estimate maybe $50 million to $75 million of benefit which probably towards the later part in the year help us build a little bit of our contingency back. ","On the other hand you know customers see the same papers that we do and the same reports that we do and there is likely to be probably a little more pressure on the pricing side because they will expect some of this to be passed through to them. So we have got to balance both those things which is why we have not reflected that potential savings in our roadmap that you saw on page six.","Jeff Sprague","On the other key notes steel and aluminum you are maybe not hedged per se but are you kind of indexed some contractual lock in there that you don\u2019t get any significant immediate benefit also?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, there is actually a little bit of headwind aluminum right now. Iron ores and steel prices have come down but we don\u2019t really have a lot of hedges out there. So we will see a little bit of benefit on steel, a little bit of headwind at aluminum which should pretty well offset each other I would think for the year.","Jeff Sprague","No, I was just wondering, just back to where the prior question ended, kind of on cash flow and CapEx. Now looks like you actually throttled the CapEx back pretty hard relative to the annual expectation here. Can we go down from this 1.7 level in 2015 and how do we think about working capital in 2015?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think that we have been looking at about $2 billion number for CapEx going into the last year. I think the folks on the businesses to do a pretty good job of reducing that and trying to move some of that out, obviously puts a little bit of pressure on the 1.7 number that we have got this year but we are not done. I think again the CapEx investments will be what it needs to be. I think the bigger opportunity as I think about cash well it goes back to working capital and it goes back to inventory. We have got almost $10 billion of inventory out there. The churns are not spectacular and the focus has to be on improving churns and it\u2019s batten [ph] our factories. I would tell you our factories are world class. When they get the inventory they can move it very quickly through the assembly and test process. ","The issue is in the supply base where we don\u2019t have suppliers that all deliver 100% on time with a 100% perfect quality. As a result we have a lot of buffer inventory at every level of the production process. So as -- one of the other benefits of eliminating the past structure, the operations is now going to report directly to me and we have got a team under Beno\u00eet Brossoit who has very been focused on supplier process improvement and we are going to go after this inventory reduction, at its root cause which I would tell you is supplier performance. If we get our suppliers at the same level of delivery and quality as our own factories we can reduce inventory by a significant amount. And it\u2019s not at this year and next year, the next several years. But we're going to work at it. And I think that will help us get back to that 100% of free cash flow net income despite where there is a little bit of elevated CapEx investment this year. ","Jeff Sprague","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Sam Pearlstein","Good afternoon. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Hey Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Some of the additional cost reductions that you have talked about, does it change the plan in terms of the $300 million worth of restructuring, offset by $300 million in gains. Does that dynamic change at all during the year?","Akhil Johri","No, Sam. We don't think so. We still think restructuring will be about $300 million for the year and probably ratably across the quarters, $75 million each quarter if you will. ","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, and then in total what is your assumption about Europe right now? I know Greg said slight growth, but is it different than it was in December and it's just -- is it same and it's just a translation issue, or have you assumed a slower growth at this point?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well, despite the Greek elections on Sunday I think generally we think Europe will be probably a little bit better, with the quantitative easing that Mr. Dragi has initiated on top of the much lower fuel prices, gas and oil. There is a natural stimulus that we ought to see in Europe this year that we didn't really see six weeks ago, when we talked about it, so. We say up slightly. It could be better. I mean we have pockets of bursts [ph] that was very good last year and the fire product side in Europe was very good. The service side, not as good. I think overall I think we'll get better -- Europe will get better this year than what we had expected. So that maybe a little bit of upside. ","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, and then last question. The CR-13 and you just talked about inventory. Was there any sort of build in terms of the last of the manufacturing what you could do this year and does that all go back out in 2015. Can you size that at all? ","Akhil Johri","Yeah no, I think Greg mentioned this at the last call or the last meeting, about a $150 million worth of inventory build-up associated with CR-13. As you know the regulations would say that we cannot produce anymore CR-13 in 2015. So all that inventory was in our balance -- was on our balance sheet at the end of December and will be sold through the early part of this year we expect. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah I think that's just for the -- those parts of the country that can\u2019t -- we can't sell CR-13. ","Akhil Johri","Right, exactly.","Gregory J. Hayes","So, but yeah it\u2019s not significant. I think again we'll put a play out here in the first four or five months of the year and we'll go back to normal. ","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Sam. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Carter Copeland","Hey good evening guys. And welcome back Akhil. ","Akhil Johri","Thanks Carter. ","Carter Copeland","Just a couple of end market kind of color questions for you. The first on the military softness, you called out at UTAS, any color you can give us on where you saw that and I know the expectations around military have been kind of -- we've been kind of little short in both last year and some of the recent quarters. Can you give us some color on where that came from?","Akhil Johri","Not a huge deal of impact frankly. I think both OEM and the aftermarket and military side for UTAS was down low-single digit. So it's really not -- nothing dramatic, nothing out of the ordinary. As we look ahead at next year Carter, I think the feeling is that the aftermarket might be actually slightly better, maybe up low-single digit for UTAS, while the OEM side will probably be down low-single digit. So I think in balance we still feel it's kind of at treading water, if you will, nothing either positive or negative to talk about it. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, in Q4 OEM was essentially flat, military aftermarket was down a little bit. ","Carter Copeland","Okay, and with respect to Sikorsky if you were to give us a kind of real-time assessment on how things look there on the commercial Hi-Lo side, given obviously the anticipated weakness in oil and gas. And what the expectation is there for spares and what are you seeing and any color there would be helpful? ","Gregory J. Hayes","And maybe just I\u2019ll give you a high level, Akhil can tell you the right numbers. But essentially we're seeing some softness on the S-92 deliveries, as you would expect, like we got about 40 this year, we had expected to deliver. There is a little bit of pressure there, some of the exploration companies are scaling back. I just mentioned though, the 80, more than 80% of the use of the helicopters for offshore oil is for current production, It's not for exploration. So you're talking on the margin, yeah, there maybe a few aircraft that will be little bit more difficult to sell. But Mick and team I think are on top of it down there. ","Aftermarket\u2019s been little slower on the commercial side than we expected. Part of that's because the reliability of the S-92 has been so good. And the other part I think is just cash conservation by some of the operators. ","Akhil Johri","Yeah, no, there are some, as you would imagine a little bit of concern about the oil and gas related Hi-Lo market, as you said. But I know Mick and team are committed to delivering on their plan and they are not going to let small things like this come in the way. ","Carter Copeland","Great, thanks guys. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Carter. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. Just a question on the balance sheet. I guess one of the advantages of having a very large balance sheet is that you can use it to offset surprise headwinds. And I guess, if I just pro forma that $0.15 of tailwind or offset in to the three buckets, buyback is $0.05 of that. So I just wanted to check what the urgency to use the balance sheet this year to drive earnings is?","Gregory J. Hayes","I don\u2019t think there is any urgency other than the fact that we\u2019re not going to sit still and just take and let these cost headwinds tank the year. I think again we\u2019re doing what we can to offset those. And the $3 billion we talked about that back in December we said $2 billion to $3 billion, I would tell you was range [ph] remaining low, without, I would say a very robust M&A pipeline, I guess is pretty easy to commit to the $3 billion today. And again I wouldn\u2019t suggest that there is a big use of our balance sheet. We got a $92 billion balance sheet. Obviously we have a room to do a lot more than an additional $1 billion if we wanted to. ","We\u2019re not going to commit to anything more than the $3 billion today but it remains an option, if again share price remains low and the acquisition pipeline doesn\u2019t show up. ","Akhil Johri","The key thing that, Julian just to keep in mind as Greg laid out very clearly we are interested in M&A. We would like to do some transactions. The valuations sort of prevent us from going too far out on that today. Greg very clearly laid out the criteria that we look at M&A transactions with IRR or double-digit accretive in year two and neutral to ROIC for UTC overall by year four. Those are tough criteria in today\u2019s market but at the same time we want to keep our flexibility and keep our balance sheet optionality available and not go much higher on share buyback till we completely conclude on the M&A environment. ","Julian Mitchell","Understood, thanks and then just on commercial aero aftermarket, as you said the trends in Pratt and UTAS on sales were both sort of lower than the high single-digit growth guidance for 2015. So how quickly do you think you\u2019ll snap back to that high single-digit trend? Is it something you could see at the beginning of the year and any impact you\u2019re seeing on airline behavior on aftermarket from oil?","Akhil Johri","Yes, at this point I don\u2019t think the trends were any different than what we expected. Remember Q4 last year was extremely strong. Pratt spares, if I remember correctly, were up 24% and the UTAS spares were up significantly as well. So on that -- on 17% Paul tells me. So on top of those strong numbers UTAS grew 5% and Pratt was down 6% or 5%. So given that it\u2019s really not a change in our expectations. We still expect mid-single digit type of growth at Pratt and high single-digit growth in the aftermarket at UTAS. So I wouldn\u2019t call it a changing trend. ","With regard to customer behavior, obviously the expectation is that certainly on the Pratt side with the airline profitability being what it is, we would hope for a little more content per visit when the engines actually come back and perhaps a little bit more provisioning and inventory build-up at the airlines and that should help us a little bit but it\u2019s too early to call that. ","Julian Mitchell","Right, thank you. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Julian. ","Operator","Next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. ","Cai Von Rumohr ","Yes, thank you and let me join in welcoming you coming you back, Akhil. So commercial aftermarket, could you give us what the orders were in the fourth quarter for Pratt and UTAS? How much you think that might have been impacted by price hike and are you seeing anything in terms of impact from lower fuel prices yet?","Akhil Johri","The answer to your last question, not much yet on the Pratt side. The spares orders were down about 8% or so for the quarter and that is again no surprises there. Within that however I\u2019d remind you that V2500s were actually up mid-single digit and decline was in what has been a secular issue for us which is the legacy engines, the PW2000 and PW4000 where retirements are hurting and the surplus parts market is hurting our space business a little bit. So no change there. The trends continued to be where they are. As I said earlier we do expect some benefit from the oil price reduction. But it's not yet showing in our number and maybe at some point we'll get some benefit there. ","On the UTAS side again the spares were -- orders were up year-over-year, probably a little lower than what the sales were up. So I think we are still on track there for the high single-digit growth.","Cai Von Rumohr ","Thank you and you mentioned that OTIS\u2019 orders in China were up 2%. As you are probably aware of the decline, the monthly decline in residential home prices has kind of been accelerating through December. What are you seeing in terms of tone? You talked, I think in December of looking for 10% growth in constant currency in new elevator sales at OTIS in China. Is that still realistic?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, Cai. It's certainly within the realm of possibility. If you think about it, backlog at OTIS will end the year up about 13% year-over-year and we will convert probably 60% or 70% of that into sales. So as we start the year in a flat market you would expect kind of 7% or 8% kind of growth in OTIS China. We'll see. Again there is obviously pressure on home prices. We continue to see that, which is really held orders down for the years, especially the back half of the year.","But again I think there is a pathway towards double-digit, if we see any recovery. We're seeing some stimulus measures take hold, seeing some bank lending regulations ease a little bit to try and again reinvigorate the property markets. So I wouldn't give up on this. I think there is still opportunity there but again just given the strong backlog when we end the year, I feel pretty optimistic we're going to continue see growth in China.","Cai Von Rumohr ","Thanks, so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Greg, I want to kind of be a little bit high level. There is sort of two things. One is restructuring and the second is capital spending. How do you think about the two of those as you put them together to improve the profitability of the various business units?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well the margin expansion, cost reduction is part of the DNA of UTC and that's not going to change, I don\u2019t care who is sitting in my chair. That\u2019s just the way we do business and the businesses are always focused on down taking cost out. And so I think as we go into the year with this $300 million placeholder we've got plenty of opportunities to do cost reduction and probably more opportunities then there is funding as we start the year. But again we always find ways to fund the really good ideas. ","So we are going to continue on this path of cost reduction. That\u2019s just the way we do business here. As far as CapEx we have been, I would say overconsuming here, but again it's all part of this, I call the reseeding of the commercial engine business with new GTF engines and as a result we're going to have to catch up a little bit of the spending and that's not just Pratt. It's also across the aerospace, we have 50 new aircraft systems going into production here in the next few years, requires a lot of capital. So we're in a secular site [indiscernible]. CapEx is just naturally going to be high, it will come down. But frankly we're not capital constrained. ","We were going to fund what we need to from a CapEx standpoint, we were going to fund what we need to from a restructuring standpoint because they all have very, very solid returns and we've got a good process internally where all of these capital appropriations as well as restructuring programs they come through Akhil finance organization, they are reviewed, they are validated and I think we're making solid investment decisions whether it's restructuring or CapEx.","Howard Rubel","I get it. I mean it's really to drive the returns and improve the performance for competitive position. The follow up, I'm going to talk about maybe CCS for a moment. I mean usually we find fire and security is the one that's more of the challenged business unit and this time I think there are some maybe elements of Carrier, rather a pleasant surprise. Could you talk about, I mean could you talk a little bit about whether it's additional new product, whether it's the market who have become more competitive or what's the other change there? I mean is it all or is it something else I've missed?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think you probably hit on it and then some. I think again part of it is Geraud has invested a lot in new products in Carrier on the commercial HVAC side. We're seeing that start to pay off. We are spending more money on the security side, both fire products and electronic security getting new products, driving return of growth. I also think the way we have organized the business again while we think about BIS as the central organization it\u2019s really decentralized decision making out of the field where you have got people that are focused on individual markets, individual countries that are driving decisions, that are helping to drive growth. ","And again as I think about 2015 while cost reduction will be important the real key to 2015 earnings growth is going to be top line growth and Geraud has a very aggressive plan out there but I think he has got the products and the people and the markets are going in his favor. He can actually see 5% or 6% organic revenue growth this year. And we\u2019ll see where we are at the end of the year, even with tough conditions in Europe and slow in China, still feel very confident we are going to hit those numbers.","Akhil Johri","And if you were to ask Geraud, Howard I am sure he will tell you that with the portfolio transformation pretty much behind in the fire and security space there is a lot more focus on looking at the growth opportunities and the growth markets and devoting the time and resources to make that we are capitalizing on those opportunities. So we would fully expect that the growth profile for both fire and security and for the CCS business overall will be better than what you have seen in the past.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Howard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Gursky","Great, thank you and good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to the guidance for a moment, in the prepared remarks you suggested that the FX headwind was going to be a $1.5 billion for the year and yet guidance has come down by about $1 billion at the midpoint? Just wondering if you can just provide a little bit more color on that and connect some thoughts?","Akhil Johri","Sure, Jason this is Akhil. Yes, the exact math is $1.5 billion on the top line from the change in currencies. We typically don\u2019t like to give guidance in decimal points this early in the year. So whether it\u2019s 64.5% to 65.5% or it\u2019s 65% to 66%, I would say probably in our new range of 65% to 66% it wants to be at the lower end of that range. On the other hand to what Greg said earlier we are hopeful that the organic growth might come in little bit on the higher side of the range that we had before, the 3% to 4%. It maybe towards the higher end as opposed to the lower end of that. So does it end being 65.5 or 65.3, too early to call but it\u2019s -- we left a range in round numbers.","Jason Gursky","Okay, great. And then just a quick question on efforts to reduce the buffer inventory, the $10 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the reaction that you have seen thus far from your supply base and whether this will lead to consolidations amongst your supply base, just how they are reacting to it? And then I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in one business or another but maybe where the biggest opportunities might lie?","Gregory J. Hayes","Enthusiastic support, Jason. We have many really, really good suppliers, large suppliers. So we can\u2019t lump them all together. I think the bigger suppliers tend to be the better suppliers and one of the things that we have been pushing in the supply base is consolidation of some of the second and third tier, because quite frankly they can\u2019t afford to invest in the technologies and the systems the way the larger suppliers are. ","In terms of where the opportunities are I would tell it\u2019s primarily on the aerospace side. I think again as I go to BIS and think about supply chain at OTIS or supply chain at Carrier or Fire and Security pretty well developed and again a little bit different in terms of technologies but again their suppliers, I think generally have performed better than the suppliers on the aerospace side. I mean part of that is because of all the changes on the aero side but really most of work is going to have to be done in that supply chain on the aero side.","Akhil Johri","And if I may, having grown up through some of those businesses, it\u2019s what happens is typically, it\u2019s not so much the issue is inventory driven by the suppliers, it\u2019s because internally nobody wants to hold up the line. So when material planning people are concerned about a supplier performance they end up safety stock and that just builds upon itself. So even if one part is going to be up you end having a lot more inventory in the chain. So as Greg said once we can get all suppliers supplying on time with perfect quality that\u2019s when you will see all that buffer inventory in our system start to disappear and we will get there.","Jason Gursky","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Good afternoon.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hey David.","David Strauss","OTIS, North America new equipment orders have been really strong for about two years now. Greg can you just talk on, maybe give some color exactly what's going on there, what do you guys see as kind of market rate of growth and how much share you might be picking up there and what do you really think is driving this outsized kind of growth that we're seeing?","Gregory J. Hayes","It's a couple of factors David. Obviously OTIS is the ubiquitous brand here in the U.S. and we have been gaining share back. But it is also a market that's recovering although some very low numbers and we're still not even back to the 2007 level. So while the recovery feels really good we still have ways to go on it. I think OTIS has done a great job on the products side and as well as the cost side to deliver much better value to the customers and the customers value that. The ABI has been improving, as you see it's been over 50 now for the most of the past year and quite frankly we've also gotten our house in order. You remember the -- some of the message we have in terms of the move from Nogales to Florence, South Carolina, that's behind us. ","Again we're delivering product on time. It's really good quality. All those things coming together helping OTIS regain the share here in the US and again I think the party is not over. All of the orders that we have been taking it for the last few years are going to come out and sales over the next two years and again I think OTIS North America is going to have a very good couple of years coming up.","David Strauss","Greg, can you talk about how far you're still below prior peak levels in North America?","Gregory J. Hayes","As I recall 2007 we are about $1.2 billion in new equipment I think we are about $800 million, $900 million maybe this year. So you still got another 25% to go. ","David Strauss","Okay, great. Business jet market I think Pratt Canada sales were [indiscernible] were a little bit lower in '14. What are you seeing in that market, we\u2019ve got some players talking about things improving, are you actually seeing any sort of underlying market improvement or is it just new product that shipping grew?","Gregory J. Hayes","It's more a weakness on the helicopter side of the business of the Pratt Canada engine market if you will, right? And some of the things that we talked about before, the operators have been a little gun shy in terms of taking new deliveries of engines. There is some concern we hear about inventory at the operator\u2019s levels. People who are making those aircraft for the helicopter market. So that's the space. ","On the business jet side, I think there is no significant change in trends. We still -- the engine shipments were in line with our expectations probably just slightly ahead of the last year but it's primarily the turboprop and the helicopter market where we saw some weakness. ","David Strauss","And Greg you mentioned the German tax case I think, at the Investor day, you talked about $400 million of potential cash tax, cash payment, is that still the right number and is that explicitly in the 90% to 100% free cash flow in that end?","Gregory J. Hayes","It's in the 90, it's not in 100. So if you want to think about it, 10% of free cash will be about $600 million. So if we have to pay the German tax authorities before we have the case fully adjudicated you're going to see a lot of pressure on that 100 getting closer to 90. So we're thinking about it, we're still working it out, the attorneys still tells us that we're going to win eventually. But we may have to put up the money in the interim. So we'll let you guys know. ","Akhil Johri","See that's one place where the Euro weakening is actually good news, right?","David Strauss","Right, got it. Thanks guys. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Dave. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Nigel Coe","Yeah, thanks and good evening guys. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Hi, Nigel. ","Nigel Coe","It\u2019s getting kind of late here So I'll keep this [indiscernible]? ","Gregory J. Hayes","Got us snowing here. ","Nigel Coe","It is kind of snowing. So you obviously you have taken the maximum costs [ph] out which I think it's commendable but did he mention you're going to a 1.10 euro. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, that's correct.","Nigel Coe","1.10 euro, okay that's been considered. And then just obviously you mentioned in the second bridge that that\u2019s gets taken within OTIS which makes $0.30 but how does the strong euro, sorry the weak euro, how does that impacts OTIS margins this year?","Akhil Johri","The impact that we are talking about is more just from translation. So I don't think that changes anything on an organic basis for the margins there. Within Europe we still have the same operating fundamentals that existed. There is still some pressure on the pricing side in the service business, but there continuous to be improvement as we continue to help improve the total number of units under contract in Europe. That was declining for a while and it's starting to stabilize and move in the right direction. He was very focused on that. But I think there is nothing changing as a result of the currency it's more just the\u2026 ","Gregory J. Hayes","As you think about currency it\u2019s simply a translation issue. The fact is we manufacture in most of these locations where we sell. So in terms of real economic impact it\u2019s really muted by the fact that you manufacture be it in China or you manufacture in Europe. So this is just a translation and going against right now. We think 1.10 is the bottom but we'll keep look it.","Nigel Coe","Sure and just one more, obviously Europe is mainly a service market. So I was wondering if the translation of that high margin service in Europe this will see overall segment margin?","Akhil Johri","Yeah, there is a slight impact Nigel, you're right. but it's not that material. There is some impact absolutely. ","Nigel Coe","Okay, that is on the -- I just want to talk to that. And then just switching to, obviously you [indiscernible] structure. Does that imply that you haven't look at the BIS structure Greg and you're comfortable that, that\u2019s the currency [ph] that you focus. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, look we've talked about this already a little bit on the call. But I think Geraud has already done on the BIS side what we're doing on the Aero side in terms of reducing structure. He's done it over the course of the last couple of years from 2011 through this past year end where we've been taking out executives and taking out structure as we've been consolidated the back office functions as well as the overhead structures of these businesses. So I don't think there is the opportunity exists on the BIS side the same way it did on the PAS side. ","Nigel Coe","Okay, thanks guys. ","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay. Well thanks to everyone for the [indiscernible] tonight to change the timing of this. I hope everybody has a safe couple of days here with the coming snowstorm and we look forward to seeing you guys all in March. The IR team will be available for a few minutes tonight and then all day of course tomorrow. So please give us call if you have any questions. Thanks a lot.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Director Investor Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note the Company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.","The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectation and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions we ask that your limit your first-round to 2 questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay, thank you, and good morning, everyone. As you guys saw in the press release today, UTC reported Q1 earnings per share of $1.58, that is up 20% versus prior year and up 7% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. Foreign-exchange had an unfavorable impact of $0.07 in the quarter which equates to about 5% on year-over-year earnings. So a good start to the year.","We also benefited from a few timing items that Akhil and Paul will walk you through in a second. Sales of $14.5 billion were up 3% organically led by solid growth at Climate, Controls & Security and UTC Aerospace Systems, which were up 6% and 7% respectively on an organic basis. Segment operating margins expanded by 20 basis points to 15.6% despite a 40 basis point headwind from pension.","For the full year, we continue to expect earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.05. With that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the results in detail, and I will be back and give you some thoughts on the quarter and the remainder of the year before we get into the Q&A. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Greg. Turning to slide 2, organic sales grew 3% in the quarter and that is on top of the 5% organic growth we saw in the same quarter last year. In the commercial businesses, we saw 6% growth in the Americas helped by the ongoing US economic recovery. Asia also grew by 6%, and Europe was up slightly in the quarter.","On the aerospace side, defense sales were flattish and commercial grew by 3%, with aftermarket growth of 2% at Pratt and 4% at UTC Aerospace Systems. Sikorsky's commercial business was down 26% as lower oil prices negatively impacted demand for helicopters and aftermarket in the oil and gas segment.","Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide 3 \u2013 and just a reminder, we will talk to the commercial business orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Although there are some puts and takes, overall macro trends continue to support our expectation of 3% to 5% organic sales growth for the year.","In our commercial businesses, we continue to see growth in the US. Despite a harsh winter in many parts of the country, the outlook for commercial construction markets remains encouraging and ABI trends have been positive 10 out of the last 12 months. We continue to see that in our orders at Otis where US new equipment was up 14%.","At CCS, America\u2019s commercial HVAC equipment orders were up mid-single digit. Residential equipment sales were up 3% in the quarter, and that is on a tough compare. Recall that resi sales were up over 20% in Q1 2014.","As many of you know, Carrier's US resi business is primarily a book and ship business and starting with this quarter we will include resi equipment sales on this chart with orders for other long lead CCS equipment businesses. This gives a better representation of market demand and removes noise from things like last year's SEER 14 change-related pre-order. We have adjusted the historic data for comparison as well.","Moving on to Europe, we see the economic environment trending positively as quantitative easing measures take hold and a weaker euro supports export growth. Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded in March to its fastest pace in 10 months driven by Germany, Italy, and Spain in particular.","At UTC, Otis new equipment orders were up 37% reflecting broad based strength. Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were also up 10%. In Asia, economic output in China is moderating. As we all know, this is not new news. Real estate investment, new construction starts, floor space sold are all slowing.","Otis equipment orders were down 12% in the quarter. Now Q1 is our most difficult compare there, but construction activity in China has clearly been slowing.","Shifting to commercial aerospace, as Dave Gitlin said in March, UTC Aerospace Systems had a soft start to the year in the commercial aftermarket where sales were up 4%. This was driven mainly by a tough prior year compare on provisioning, but parts sales were strong, up 12% in the quarter.","At Pratt & Whitney, commercial aftermarket sales were up 2% with growth in transactional spares partially offset by lower engine service revenues. In spite of this slow start, we continue to be encouraged by the strong fundamentals of sustained 5% to 6% air-traffic growth and healthy airline profitability projections.","Taking a closer look at the first-quarter results on slide 4, total reported sales decreased by 1% as 3% organic growth was more than offset by 4 points of headwind from the stronger US dollar. Segment operating profit was flat in the quarter with 5 points of headwind from foreign-exchange.","Operating margins of 15.6% increased by 20 basis points led by CCS where we saw solid drop through once again leading to margin expansion of 120 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.58 was up 20% in the quarter, driven largely by the timing of restructuring and gains.","Recall that the first quarter of 2014 included $0.09 of net restructuring charges, while we saw $0.07 of net gains in the first quarter of 2015. Absent the impact of gains and restructuring, earnings per share were up 7%, about $0.10 higher than we anticipated based on earlier than expected finalization of some discrete items at CCS, Pratt, UTAS, and Corporate.","Free cash flow in the quarter was 67% of net income, driven largely by seasonal inventory build and higher receivables. Free cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant net outflow in the quarter at Sikorsky.","Share repurchase was $3 billion, including the benefit from the accelerated stock repurchase that we announced last month, so we are pretty much done with the share buybacks placeholder for this year. We are maintaining our placeholder of $1 million for M&A and continue to expect free cash flow to net income of 90% to 100% in 2015.","We also continue to anticipate $300 million in restructuring this year, all offset by one-time gains. The recorded pretax equivalent gains of $0.14 in Q1 and expect the remaining $0.09 in the second half. We spent $93 million on restructuring in the first quarter and expect gains to equal restructuring for the first half.","As we think about first half earnings, we expect organic revenue growth to be in line with the full-year guidance of 3% to 5% and reported EPS growth to be slightly above the high end of the full-year expectation of zero to 3%.","Let me stop there for now and turn it over to Paul to take you through the business unit results in more detail.","Paul Lundstrom","Okay, thanks, Akhil. So turning to page 5, Otis profit improved 1% at constant currency on 2% organic sales growth. Overall foreign-exchange translation was an 11 point earnings headwind and a 9 point sales headwind.","Profit growth in quarter was driven by contributions from higher volume and productivity initiatives in the Americas and in Asia. This was offset by a decline in profit in Europe due to lower volume and continued pricing pressure in the service business.","Sales in EMEA were down mid-single-digit with declines in both service and equipment sales. Both the Americas and Asia regions were up 7%. The Americas had nearly 20% new equipment sales growth and low-single-digit service growth while Asia had high single-digit growth in new equipment and mid-single-digit growth in service.","Sales in China were up 7% driven by the conversion of new equipment backlog and strong service. But that plus 7% was softer than the 10% growth we expected this year.","New equipment orders were up 8% in the quarter at constant FX and continued to be strong in the Americas where orders were up high-single-digit. Orders in EMEA were very strong, up 37% with broad based growth across the region. Asia orders, however, were down mid-single-digit driven by weaker demand in China which saw a 12% decline on some large projects. On a unit basis orders were essentially flat.","Q1 was a tough compare for China. Recall that last year orders were up 25% in the first quarter. But as Akhil said, activity clearly has softened. We continue to watch China and Europe service. And for the year, guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $100 million to $150 million of profit growth for Otis.","On slide 6 Climate, Controls & Security had good traction in the first quarter with 6% organic sales growth led by Transicold, which grew high teens following the strong order intake we saw in Q4 at both container and North America truck trailer. We saw mid-single-digit growth in the Americas led by commercial HVAC and the Fire & Security product businesses.","EMEA grew low-single-digits while Asia was down low-single-digit with declines in commercial HVAC, most notably in China and in Southeast Asia, partially offset by growth in Fire & Security field.","Operating profit was up 14% at constant currency driven by drop through on the organic volume growth along with benefits related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a joint venture and a property sale. FX translation was a 6 point profit headwind. Overall operating margins were up 120 basis points from prior year to 16.3%.","Order growth at CCS was led by double-digit growth in refrigeration on a very strong Transicold, up nearly 25% along with better commercial refrigeration where orders were up mid-single-digit. Global Commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single-digit with strength in the Americas offsetting weakness in Asia. Fire & Security product orders were flattish while field orders declined by the mid-single-digits.","As Akhil mentioned, CCS equipment orders were up 6%, in line with our full-year mid-single-digit organic sales growth expectation. With solid results in the first quarter for CCS we continue to expect profit growth of $200 million to $250 million on a constant currency basis on mid-single-digit organic sales growth.","Turning to aerospace on slide 7, Pratt & Whitney sales were flattish organically with military engine sales and commercial aftermarket both up 2%. Just a comment on that 2% up commercial aftermarket, it is a bit misleading as the large commercial engine transactional aftermarket business was up 6% with spares up nearly 10%. This signals healthy airline activity.","Aftermarket shop visits were down in the quarter which, with our fleet management programs, means engines are on wing longer. That is good for the airlines and good for Pratt over the long-term. Commercial OE was down mid-single-digit driven by the timing of engine shipments. Pratt operating profit was flat. Headwinds from higher negative engine margin and pension expense were more than offset by favorable aftermarket mix and performance along with lower engineering and development spending.","The quarter also benefited by $0.03 from a favorable contract termination. Margins were up 10 basis points to 13%. For the full year we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney's operating profit to be down $50 million to $125 million.","Turning to slide 8, UTC Aerospace Systems profits grew 4% on 7% organic sales growth. Sales were driven by double-digit growth in commercial OE and a 4% increase in commercial aftermarket, which were partially offset by a softer military business which was down mid-single-digits.","Commercial OE sales benefited from a change in arrangement that added around $50 million of pass-through sales with no margins. As Akhil noted earlier, we signaled a slow start to our commercial aftermarket business and we saw that with lower provisioning and maintenance volume in our repair shops. But we continue to be encouraged by strong parts sales which were up 12% in the quarter.","Year-over-year profit growth was driven by benefits from contract settlements, continued cost reduction efforts and additional licensing income. These were partially offset by higher pension expense and FX. Operating margins were up 10 basis points at actual FX to 17.4%.","For the year, based on anticipated improvements in the commercial aftermarket, we continue to expect profit growth of $225 million to $275 million on mid-single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.","Turning to Sikorsky on slide 9, sales were down 7% organically and operating profit decreased by 11%. The year-over-year sales decline was driven by lower commercial volume as well as continued softness in both military and commercial aftermarket.","We are seeing pressure from the oil and gas segment. Not only has new capacity been put on hold, the number of offshore working rigs has also come down, which puts pressure on fleet expansion and the existing fleet's aftermarket business.","In the quarter Sikorsky shipped 7 fewer S-92 and S-76D aircraft. Although Q2 should be better, we will likely see continued pressure in the back half of the year. Softer shipments were partially offset by growth in development programs, which were up significantly as we ramp up on both the presidential and the combat rescue helicopter programs.","The operating profit decline was driven by the impact of lower commercial aircraft volumes and the Canadian maritime helicopter program. Although margin from the higher development sales did provide some offset, development sales come at a lower margin rate than commercial where we saw the largest declines.","This was a slow start for Sikorsky. It's too early in the year to point to a guidance change, but we are clearly seeing pressure in commercial from steep spending declines in the oil and gas industry.","During the quarter Sikorsky started ground testing on the first 53K flight aircraft, as well as on the first S-97 RAIDER prototype aircraft and expects first flight of the RAIDER in the second quarter. These are major milestones for 2 key programs. With that let me turn it back to Greg for wrap up.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Paul. Let me wrap up with just a few thoughts. So a good start to the year with 3% organic revenue growth, solid earnings growth and continued margin expansion. Order trends and end markets are broadly in line with expectations with a few exceptions.","China is clearly softer for our commercial businesses. However, the stimulus programs which were announced yesterday should help. On the other hand the US slightly better. HVAC is up in the US, Fire & Security products are up, and Otis new equipment orders are up again and have been strong now for quite some time. So the US feels pretty good.","Although in the past we've been disappointed by a lack of growth in Europe, I'm encouraged by the signs of growth we are now seeing. 6 months ago we wouldn't have thought that Otis new equipment orders would ever be up almost 40% in the region. So, great traction there this quarter.","On the aero side, a little slower than expected start in the commercial aftermarket, but we continue to expect growth to improve as we move through the year as the benefits of lower oil prices makes its way into the airline purchasing activity and compares get a little easier. And while lower oil prices are putting some near-term pressure on Sikorsky, the benefits from lower oil costs in other segments will provide some offset.","So as I said, a good start to the year. We continue to achieve significant milestones on our programs, continue to secure key wins and position the portfolio to drive long-term shareowner value.","At Pratt & Whitney, Geared Turbofan has now completed more than 16,000 hours and 31,000 cycle of full engine testing, including 3,500 hours of flight time. In addition to the A320neo flight testing we are also powering flights on 6 CSeries test aircraft.","Our new engines are meeting or exceeding technical expectations and customer commitments providing a glimpse of the significant value these engines are expected to deliver to customers following entry into service later this year.","You recall back in January we consolidated our Aerospace Systems business from a 2 P&L structure into a single P&L. Dave Gitlin and the team have done a good job over the past 3 months of bringing these 2 structures together, while staying focused on supporting our customers and delivering best-in-class margins.","As you saw a few weeks ago, we welcomed Bob Leduc back to UTC as the President of Sikorsky Aircraft. He started earlier this month and has hit the ground running. Across the aerospace industry Bob is recognized as a proven leader and he has the vision and experience necessary to lead Sikorsky today and into the future.","The building and industrial systems business had another solid quarter delivering mid-single-digit combined organic sales growth for Otis and CCS. Integration activities continue to progress well with the team finding ways to serve our customers more efficiently.","BIS continues to also strengthen its presence in emerging markets with several new and expanded joint venture relationships, including the commercial HVAC in China, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The latter 2 were recently expanded to include the broader BIS product portfolio.","We also completed the acquisition of CIAT, which is a European commercial HVAC manufacturer, and we begin consolidating its results in Q1. BIS also expanded its relationship with Toshiba including the launch of a new variable refrigerant flow, or VRF line of HVAC products in the US market.","So good momentum. As you heard from the president's in March, each of our businesses is well-positioned in our core markets. This along with continued product innovation will allow us to drive long-term sustainable organic growth. And we're making progress on our corporate led initiatives as well.","Akhil and the team are making headway towards a simplified corporate cost structure and we're on track to deliver about $100 million in run rate savings by the middle of next year. As Akhil mentioned earlier, we launched an accelerated share repurchase program in March which accounts for most of this year's $3 billion of share repurchase. A lot of value in UTX at these price levels.","And lastly, we continue to make progress on the evaluation of strategic options for Sikorsky including the potential for a spin. We have nothing new to share today on the topic, but we will let you know when the evaluation process is complete, which I now expect to be roughly midyear.","So again, for the rest of 2015 at the UTC level, no real changes from what we told you last month. With that let's open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Thank you. You mentioned on Sikorsky that the guidance may look a little bit shaky. But just on Otis, the EBIT was down over $50 million year on year in Q1. The guide for the year is I think down $100 million to $150 million, and the currency effect is pretty stable through the year. So maybe give some color as to why that should rebound in the second half. Is it to do with European aftermarket or cost savings coming through?","Akhil Johri","Yes, so, Julian, I think what we are looking at is the improving signs in Europe to some extent which will help buffer the back half. The 2 watch items for us, as Paul said in his comments, was Europe pricing in the service side and also the China equipment. I think because of the backlog that is coming into the year, the China business will still grow this year. Service business continues to grow very nicely, grew almost 20% again this quarter.","So, yes, a little shy of the expectations on new equipment in China, but the strength in the Otis Europe new equipment orders would hopefully offset a little bit of that. And America continues to be strong. So we are watching those 2 items, the pricing pressure in Europe and the China new equipment market, but broadly we still feel we can get to the low end of the range at least.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then my second question is just on Pratt & Whitney, the commercial aftermarket business. You gave some helpful color around sort of the underlying trends versus what was reported at the plus 2%. But maybe just how quickly do you think the underlying versus the kind of headline number will come together? Do you still think in Q2 you could see low-single-digit commercial aftermarket sales growth?","Greg Hayes","Yes, Julian, I think again, we expect an improving aftermarket as we go through the year. And again, as we talked about, at least lower oil prices \u2013 that phenomenon should play out even more strongly I think in the back half of the year as it takes 6 months or so to get people to change purchasing behavior.","But again, I think it's all kind of out there within the guidance. It started out slow \u2013 Dave Gitlin I think talked about that for the Aerospace Systems group back in March, kind of a slow start. But again, all the signs are there. The RPMs continue to be very strong, especially in the emerging markets, and we expect we will see the engines come back and we will see the parts go out the door.","Akhil Johri","Right, the important thing to focus on Julian, there is the transactional spares number that I think Paul talked about, right? Once you strip out the spares used in our own fleet management programs, the spares we sell to airlines or the spares we use in time and material jobs collectively are up about 10%, right. And that is the number which essentially we watch carefully.","If the FMPs are lower, actually it is good news in the long-term. So I think we're focusing on the right thing here which is the transactional space.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Greg Hayes","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Carter. ","Carter Copeland","Just first quick one on China and the order number. Just kind of digging into that with a little more granularity. If you were to take a look at that either by residential versus commercial infrastructure, or maybe by brand if it were OCL versus Xizi or any way you would like to cut it, is there a difference in the trends that you are seeing there on the order front that you could highlight for us?","Akhil Johri","So, residential is a little slower than we expected, that is a big headline first. So in terms of the brand, I think the Otis brand is doing well, obviously, on the Xizi side, which is more in the residential side, we see a bigger impact, as you would expect, because that is the part of the market which is a little slower than we had anticipated. That is probably the broad comment I can offer on that.","The units \u2013 just as a reminder, the units were flattish for Otis, right. So even the dollar numbers feel like down 12%, but in unit terms, the orders were flattish.","Carter Copeland","And are they seeing any change in the backlog conversion? I know you guys have talked about that, carrying that backlog into this year.","Akhil Johri","No, that still feels okay. And I think as Geraud said in March, just the conversion of the backlog into sales this year should give you about 5% to 8% \u2013 5% to 6% of sales growth. And then it will all be a function of how many orders we get this year and how much of that gets converted. And that is the math which will give the ultimate new equipment sales in China.","Carter Copeland","Great. And then on the Sikorsky front, I wondered if you might give us some color around the commercial spares orders and how much the oil and gas impact may have influenced what you saw there in the quarter.","Akhil Johri","The commercial aftermarket for Sikorsky was down double-digit in the quarter. So some of that is just a function of the fact that even the rigs which are operational, actually some of the working rigs have been coming down as well.","So it is not only the impact associated with the expansion which impacts the OE side more, we have seen some impact on the aftermarket. Now we do believe that aftermarket will actually do better as the year goes through, because production is still continuing in these oil rigs. It is -- the watch item is more the S-92s or the OE deliveries that we need to make for the year.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks, Akhil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning. ","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Could you just elaborate or provide detail on kind of the size of the discrete items in the other segments? So I assume the one in Pratt at $0.03 is the largest as you articulated that. But can you give us a little bit more color there?","Akhil Johri","Sure, Jeff. So I think it was at CCS we talked about the property sale and the fair value accounting associated with the transaction there. The collective impact of that was a little over $0.02 there, and then the third item was also about $0.02 in the UTAS business, the licensing arrangement that Paul referred to.","On top of that, there was probably $0.02 you will see in the [elims] line, in the corporate elims line which had to do with some adjustments for a disposed business that shows up in those lines. So net-net it is essentially timing, Jeff. It is just stuff that we had always assumed would happen in the plan.","We just assumed it would happen actually later in the year and it got pulled \u2013 by chance it all ended up happening in Q1. Which is why I think when I spoke in March we were expecting slightly lowered numbers, but I think it came in stronger just as a result of timing of some of these discrete items.","Jeff Sprague","Okay. And then just shifting gears, could you just come back to Otis Europe? You mentioned pricing is a watch item and we all know that's been tough for a while. But are you seeing some change? Is it declining at a decelerating rate or has there been some trend change there? Just what do you see going on there?","Akhil Johri","Jeff, it is still the same I would say. I mean, in Q1 what we saw, the pricing decline was consistent with what we saw in Q4 and Q3. But there is no either increase or decrease in the deceleration rate, as you said. What is encouraging though is \u2013 I think Philippe talked about that in March a little bit and he showed a chart that the first sign of change comes from strength in the new equipment market.","And in fact, if you go back and look at that chart, there were countries where new equipment had done better either in terms of less decline or started to recover, pricing on service was doing better in those markets as well.","So with the strength we are seeing broad-based in the new equipment order rates this quarter, our expectation is that that starts to get better on the service side in terms of pricing as the year progresses. Now whether it happens quickly enough is something we have to watch. But definitely that is the first sign which would then release a little bit of pressure on the pricing.","Jeff Sprague","Okay, thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Akhil Johri","Hello, hello.","Ron Epstein","Yeah, hey. Good morning, guys. There are \u2013 so a quick question back on the engines again. There's been a fair amount of discussion in the trade press that your competitor's engine, the LEAP-1B, is having some issues getting to its performance targets. So there has been some talk that it is missing its targets by maybe 4% or 5%.","Just curious, have you heard anything from your customers yet that are maybe looking more seriously at the PurePower family of engines if the LEAP engine doesn't seem to be getting where it needs to go?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think we have all read that same speculation in the press. But I'll tell you, Ron, it really hasn't impacted any of the competitions that are going on today for engine orders. I think the competitors, GE or CFM is going to commit to the same kind of performance improvements that we are seeing on the GTF family. And I would expect that they will eventually get to the same performance targets that they have committed to.","So there might be some short-term pain on those engines, but again, I think long-term we like where we are with our architecture. We think the architecture is fundamentally better; we're going to operate at a lower temperature. That gives us some improvement in terms of not just part count but also the maintenance cost long-term.","So we will see what happens. Those engines are going to go into service at the end of the year on the neo and that will be the ultimate test of performance is how we do in the field. And we feel very good about where we are.","Ron Epstein","Sure, sure. And then maybe one last one here. You have already executed on some buyback for the year. And given where the share price is and it looks like it is pretty good darn good value, are you open to buying back a lot more stock?","Greg Hayes","A lot more? No. Look, I think at the current price it is a good value. We did the $3 billion or $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase last month and I think that was well executed. And it gives us about a $0.05 benefit for the year by having all those shares retire early.","But right now I still think there is things out on the M&A side that we want to do and we're going to keep our powder dry. We spent $250 million in the first quarter on M&A; we've got a good business in CIAT in France, which Geraud and team are working on.","I think that is indicative of the kind of things we will probably see throughout the year, some smaller deals. But we are going to continue to look for bigger things too. And I just don't want to commit to a bunch of share repurchase when there is opportunities out there to do some bigger M&A.","Ron Epstein","But could we expect to see some more than what you have already done? Are you done for the year I guess is the question?","Greg Hayes","Well, we guided to $3 billion for the year. I think as we go through the quarters here if we don't see additional M&A or if we see some significant weakness in the stock I think we are always open to that where we see value. And we are going to keep that in mind.","But again, we are going to return more than 70% of free cash flow back to investors this year, probably more than almost 80% with the $3 billion on top of the dividend. So, we feel pretty good about the capital allocation decisions we have made so far.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Akhil Johri","Yeah.","Greg Hayes","True.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. ","Greg Hayes","Good morning. ","Nigel Coe","Just wanted to come back \u2013 yeah. Hi. Hi there. Just want to come back to the good news on the European Otis orders on the OE side. And when you've been coming off sort of a trough type of number you can get some pretty big numbers. I just wondered, can you maybe just characterize the breadth of the strength that you saw in the OE orders and perhaps comment on the activity you are seeing and whether the strength that we have seen in Otis is also being seen elsewhere such as within Carrier and also Fire & Security?","Akhil Johri","Yes, sure. So I think the Otis trend was clearly right based. You are exactly right, Nigel. The numbers have gone down, so it is off a smaller base. But still even on that smaller base we saw a decline last year. So the fact that it is up and up nicely, and it is up broad-based \u2013 almost every major country saw up orders in Otis' new equipment, that is an encouraging sign for us.","So clearly that portends well for all the stuff that is going on in Europe, in terms of the stimulus that is being put in place there, in terms of the euro weakness that is encouraging, the range of growth there. So all those things are hopefully resulting in some better economic activity.","Commercial refrigeration in Europe, as I said earlier, was up double-digit as well, that was nice to see. And HVAC is up, although at a smaller scale, but it was up as well. So overall we see some improving trends in Europe, that is definitely certainly true in this quarter.","Nigel Coe","That's great news. And then maybe just perhaps a bit more color on the CCS margins, up 120 bps. There's obviously a lot going on here with the Transicold mix and the BIS integration and perhaps some price benefits. But maybe just add a bit of color in terms of those drivers.","Akhil Johri","Sure. So I think the mix definitely as you point out is good. Transicold grew very strongly and that is one of our high margin businesses. There is broad-based cost-related conversion that we see very nicely at CCS, that has been a story which has been there for a period of time.","We were obviously also helped a little bit by those discrete items that I talked about and that came from the 2 items that we had \u2013 that I highlighted earlier. But overall it is great conversion on the organic growth.","I mean organic growth is up 6%. And if you hold gross margin and you control the cost that is a recipe for good conversion. And Geraud and team have been doing that for several years now.","Nigel Coe","And then very quickly on the raw materials, are you seeing the benefit right now, is that coming through in the second half of the year?","Akhil Johri","Not as much in the first quarter, Nigel. I think there was a little bit of benefit from copper. But as you know, we kind of tend to have longer-term agreements with our suppliers. So we'll see some benefit a little more in the second half, but probably even more than that in the next year. If the prices stay at this level.","Nigel Coe","That's great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Oh.","Robert Stallard","Greg, you were fairly open at the investor conference about your desire to do more M&A. And I was wondering if that prompted any further response in the market and how you would characterize the quality and availability of the assets that are out there?","Greg Hayes","My phone has not been ringing off the hook if that is what you are asking. But I think we said we are \u2013 obviously we are open to M&A, we have got the balance sheet to do bigger M&A and we see opportunities in our core markets to do some things. But at the same time we're trying to be disciplined here in terms of the criteria that we have laid out.","And we say we need to have an IRR north of 10%, it is got to be accretive in year two, it's got to have an ROIC north of 10% by year four. Those are some pretty high hurdles with the valuations that we see out there today.","So there are some fixer uppers out there that might be attractive to us. But we are not going to overpay either because that is the best way to make a good deal a bad deal is to overpay.","You can never recover for that. So we are continuing to look, we've got Mike Dumais and the whole team focused on looking at various properties. And we're just going to be opportunistic.","Robert Stallard","Okay, and then as a quick follow-up on foreign-exchange. I'm just wondering why you didn't use this opportunity to maybe bring your forecast for the foreign exchange hit down a bit. And whether foreign exchange has had any impact in terms of market share or other issues overseas?","Greg Hayes","No, I think when we guided back in March we talked about euro at 1.10 today it is at 1.07, if it stays here for the rest of the year I think it will average about 1.09. So it is not just a very big impact versus what we talked about a month ago. Obviously if we see euro go towards parity with the dollar that will put pressure on the guidance and probably take us towards the lower end.","But I think it is important, while we don't hedge transactional FX \u2013 translation FX we do hedge transactional FX. So to the extent we've got a sales contract in one currency and cost in another, we are hedging that on a regular basis.","And I think the other important thing from a market share perspective, we are not really disadvantaged by currency. We manufacture in Europe, we manufacture in China for those markets. So in that really impacted very dramatically by \u2013 or disadvantaged. And then keep in mind too, more than half of the business is aero and that is all US dollar denominated. So we are neither advantaged or disadvantaged in that market by the currency.","Robert Stallard","That's great, thanks so much.","Greg Hayes","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Akhil Johri","Good morning. ","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","Greg, just one follow-up to the M&A question there. Are you comfortable doing acquisitions while you are still evaluating the overall portfolio or do you need to get through everything you are contemplating with the portfolio before you know which acquisitions make the most sense?","Greg Hayes","We know which markets we like, we know which product lines we like. As you think about this portfolio review that we are doing, as I mentioned last month, we have already divested $8 billion of business in the last 5 years. If we spin Sikorsky up that will be another $7 billion, so we will have done $15 billion in portfolio shedding by the end of this year.","And there's just not a lot of other big pieces left that we don't think are in attractive markets and there might be some smaller things on the margin. But I think for the most part we like the hand that we've got now in terms of the ability to grow the business long-term organically.","And so, we are going to look to find pieces that will fit into that puzzle that we have got today and really not try and stretch to find other things outside of the core.","Noah Poponak","Okay, great. And then just going back to the aerospace aftermarket, just I guess as a clarification, the comments that that year was off to a slow start in headline numbers I guess made it seem like the actual underlying ongoing business was a little weak.","But it sounds like actually \u2013 given the numbers you have given us excluding provisioning, that it's actually maybe quite strong and the slow start was entirely the provisioning comparison. Is that a fair comparison or a fair assumption or is there something else?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think that is exactly \u2013 as you think about the Aerospace Systems business, the provisioning was down but parts were up nicely almost double digits for the transactional site. The same at Pratt on the transactional side, we saw almost double-digit increases in spare parts sales. So that piece of the aftermarket is actually doing nicely.","What we have not seen of course is provisioning; that will come in the back half of the year as some of the new aircraft like the A350 in the A320neo enter into service we will see provisioning pick up in the back half of the year.","So a little slower than what we expected overall. Shop visits were down, but again to Akhil's point that is actually good news as most of these are on FMP, and the longer those things stay on wing the more profitable those contracts are.","Noah Poponak","And GE said they are seeing some restocking of inventory from the airlines. Are you seeing that specifically?","Akhil Johri","I think you know the issue we have, which is some of our legacy engines, the PW2000 and PW4000 are \u2013 have this issue of legacy spare parts availability and surplus parts available in the marketplace and retirement. So we see declines there.","In the engine, which is doing well for us, the V2500, actually on a transactional basis we even saw sales up over 30% on the transactional spares. So that was consistent with what you probably heard from the others, so we saw the same phenomenon. We just had to deal with this declining issue on the PW2000 and PW4000.","Noah Poponak","Right. Okay, thanks a lot.","Akhil Johri","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Peter Arment","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Greg, just I guess a follow-on to Noah's question on the aftermarket. Are you seeing any differences from a geographical standpoint? You mentioned a lot that China has been slowing, but are you seeing any trend over onto the airspace side out of Asia?","Greg Hayes","No. In fact, Asia is probably the strongest if we think about where the aftermarket \u2013 I mean the RPMs there are up more than 30%, I think, year over year in China. So we continue to see very, very strong growth out of that market. And truly to Akhil's point, I mean it is these legacy 2000, 4000 engines where we are really seeing the slowdown.","Peter Arment","Okay, and just my follow-up also is on [indiscernible] and aerospace on Pratt & Whitney. You mentioned the kind of timing of engine shipments. Pratt & Whitney Canada engine volume was down 10% year over year. Is that all timing, or is there something else going on there?","Akhil Johri","Pratt Canada engine shipments, Peter, were nicely driven by the helicopter end market. That is where we have seen the big decline. The business jet engines were actually up, largely attributed to the helicopter segment.","On the other large Pratt side, it is more to do with the military engines where we saw a little bit of delays in a few of the engines there, which hopefully will pick up back in Q2.","Peter Arment","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to pursue first cash flow, the conversion at 67%. I know you mentioned Sikorsky, and maybe that is some of the helicopters from the oil and gas business. But last year's first quarter we were at 80%, and we wound up the year at 90% free cash conversion. And this year we are starting off at 67%, and I think we are hoping to get higher than 90%, at least 90% to 100% from what you say.","So what goes on here? I mean this quarter we saw sizable increase in inventories, maybe 5% or so. So can you kind of just walk through from where we are to how we get maybe to the 90% to 100% you are talking about for the year?","Greg Hayes","First-quarter cash flow is not ever going to probably be close to 100%. Last year we got a benefit of a $200 million advance at Sikorsky, which certainly helped. This year if you take Sikorsky out of the equation, cash flow was almost 100% of net income. So again, really I would point primarily to the Sikorsky cash outflow.","But at the same time, inventories were up; working capital was up, specifically receivables. And again, though, some of that is just timing as we work through. You know, Geraud's business, it is a seasonal business on the residential side, so there is some natural inventory build in the CCS business. But overall, we are also seeing some inventory on the ramp on the GTF, so Pratt's inventories were up.","UTAS inventories were up for the same reasons. They see these new aircraft going into production. So again, I think this will get better during the course of year, but we clearly need to focus more on inventory turns because I think overall inventory turns for us were about 4.5, and this really is just not very good. So there is work to do.","Akhil Johri","And just one point to add, George, to clarify your comment on the inventory side. We always see build up in inventory Q1. In fact, if you pass the numbers for last year Q1, inventory had actually gone up by $660 million in Q1. This year it was only $470 million.","Only $470 million is still a big number, and certainly not we are happy with, but that is part of the seasonality that we have in this. And as Greg said, we have a lot of work to do on inventory, but still the Q1 67% does not give us any concern about the ability to meet the 90% to 100% for the year.","George Shapiro","Okay. And, Akhil, my follow up is if you \u2013 you commented about transactional spares being down should be good news. At what point \u2013 I assume a lot of that is related to your power by the hour contract. So at what point do you conclude that you can make a higher margin on that power by the hour stuff because the reliability is running somewhat better than you might have been projecting?","","Akhil Johri","George, just one clarification first. Transactional spares, which I define as spares sold to the airlines and used in our time and material jobs, are actually up double-digit. What is down was more the spares used in the FMP program.","So there, to your point, we evaluate the programs on a quarterly basis, at least on an annual basis for every FMP, quarterly for the large ones and look at the estimates based on our actual experience and then update the EACs which result in some kind of adjustments periodically that we see.","So I think over the long-term this will definitely be good news on the margins at Pratt. How it comes into the P&L exactly is a function of the length of the FMPs, the period which is left and the experience that we have achieved so far.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Doug Harned","Thank you. Good morning. ","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Doug Harned","I wanted to talk about UTAS and in particular just where you stand now on savings from the Goodrich integration. You are in presumably the more challenging time here with supply chain and facilities opportunities.","Akhil Johri","Yes, so I think we are tracking very, well, Doug, on that on the synergy side. As you know from the original estimates of $375 million we have taken it up over to $500 million. For this year our expectation was about $100 million and we think we are very much on track for that. In fact, if anything, we may have a little upside there given the work that Dave and team have done on eliminating the costs associated with the dual structure that Greg referred to in his comments.","So the synergies are moving very, very well. I think what is left still in front of the team there is not so much the supply chain related \u2013 the supply negotiation related stuff, but it is more about moves to low-cost sourcing.","We still have many, many factories in UTAS, nearly 100 manufacturing locations. That is what the team is doing in creating the centers of excellence in lower cost locations such as Poland and Mexico, India, etc. And as work transitions to those lower cost centers of excellence we will see further improvement in the cost structure at UTAS.","Now obviously at some point we have to stop and get off this synergy word, it becomes a matter of course cost reduction like any other UTC Company does and that is where we are heading now. So I think we can certainly declare we have done the synergies that we expected to achieve and now we need to continue to get regular cost reductions.","Doug Harned","Well, and so that is really where I wanted to go. So as you head beyond the synergy word and look at the opportunities here, I know there has been a focus on reducing R&D, reducing costs in general in UTAS. Can you give a sense of how much margin opportunity you see going forward? If we go over the next few years, I mean is this a business where we should expect some pretty good margin expansion?","Greg Hayes","Doug, there is always opportunity for margin expansion. I think what we have to keep in mind is as all these new aircraft come into production there is headwind from negative margin not just at Pratt but also a little bit on our Aerospace Systems business.","And so, I think Mr. Gitlin and crew are going to deal with a little bit of that which will keep some of the margin improvement at bay for a time yet. But clearly there is opportunities out there. I think we talked a couple years ago about this being a potentially 20% margin business, that is still the target I would say for 5 years out.","So there might be 50 basis points a year of margin upside here, but we need to keep in mind, at least in the short-term, as all of these new products come to market where the margins that are going out are not positive on most of this new OE equipment. So that is going to hold margins down a little bit.","Doug Harned","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So Otis, you had 2% organic growth with high-single-digit new equipment growth. Did service \u2013 I mean it looked like service was down some 3% to 4% result which is the weakest number I think I can ever recall.","Could you give us a little bit more color on what is happening in the service market and how quickly you might see an improvement in pricing in Europe as a result of the very strong new elevator orders this quarter? Thanks.","Akhil Johri","Sure, Cai. Just for clarification, service was flat overall, it was not down. And in fact, where we saw the pressure was more on the modernization side, particularly in Europe where service \u2013 the modernization revenues were down in sort of mid-teens level. And that is a function of our regulation driven modernization effort that was going on in France particularly and a couple of other markets.","Again, I think maintenance contracts, the number of contracts under maintenance for the quarter were up sequentially when you exclude Russia which was an exceptional situation. But everywhere else I think our maintenance contracts were up.","Pricing pressure, as I said earlier in response to Jeff's question, is stable. It is still down but it is not getting down any further. And as the new equipment market starts to improve in Europe we expect certainly to see the pricing pressure a little bit relieved on the service side as well.","So service was good in [Asia], grew mid-single-digit there, particularly in China which was up nearly 20%. And it is growing in America's as well. So just the continuing trends that we have seen in Europe which hopefully get mitigated as new equipment improves.","Cai von Rumohr","Great answer. And maybe a little bit more color into Jeff's question. It looks like there is $0.09 of kind of discrete operation \u2013 non-operating or whatever they are items within the operation. You mentioned you have got some favorable timing. Were all those $0.09 pull forwards from succeeding quarters? And maybe give us some color as a result of the kind of quarterly pattern we should expect for the year.","Akhil Johri","I think as I said, Cai, the \u2013 those items were in our plan for \u2013 most of them for Q2, so there is a little bit of timing thing. You never can call exactly whether something which is a function of negotiation discussions in some events with other parties can happen exactly in March or April or June. So I think a little bit of that pattern is there.","I did say that our first half we expect the earnings to be at the higher end or up slightly ahead of the 3% mark that we have for the full year, the zero to 3% on a reported EPS basis. So that would suggest that probably Q2 by itself would be down on a reported basis and that is understandable given the pressure we have on FX and pension and the restructuring which will be in excess of gains in Q2, right.","In Q2 we will have $0.07 of restructuring and no gains. So that is one reason why the reported numbers start to look a little bit different in Q2. But in reality when you exclude pension, FX and restructuring we should still see mid-single-digit type of growth in Q2 EPS which is slightly below our full-year expectations given the strength we saw in Q1.","Cai von Rumohr","Great answer. Thank you very much.","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Greg, it looks like you started out CapEx below trend. Have you been able to get a handle on that to the degree you are satisfied or is there still more work to be done?","Greg Hayes","There is still more work to be done, Howard. I think again we saw CapEx for the quarter a little bit \u2013 a little bit up from last are, about $15 million actually year over year. So we spent like $348 million. It is below a full-year run rate, I'll give you that, but there is still work to do. And I think all the guys understand, the people understand we need to be focused on constraining CapEx just like we are in every other dollar that we spent. So there is work to do.","Howard Rubel","And then the second item, research and development also was down a little bit. And sometimes that is timing. Could you provide a little more color and granularity on a couple of the development programs, specifically GTF, both for the variety of items you have whether it is neo or the other customers?","Greg Hayes","Yes, E&D is starting kind of a natural decline at Pratt as we complete some of the testing on the neo and some of the other engines out there. CSeries is completing its flight testing this year, neo will be done hopefully this summer or early fall. So just, E&D just naturally wants to come down.","If you remember, Paul said he was going to take E&D down about $100 million, was down $17 million here in the first quarter. So naturally you are just going to see a reduction. And not much change across the rest of the business.","I think Geraud is up a tiny bit, he continues to invest in some new products. And Aerospace Systems are still on track to probably spend about $800 million for the year. So not much change there.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sam Pearlstein","Can I just go back to Transicold which you haven't really talked a lot about? I thought this was probably the toughest compare of the year and yet you did pretty well. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that was container versus truck and trailer and maybe price now versus where it was last year?","Akhil Johri","Sam, so, container \u2013 as you know, Transicold is a little bit of a lumpy business. So you get some large swings and large numbers there, but it was great to see the 18% or so growth in the quarter there. A lot of it was driven by container which was up over 30%. North America truck trailer was up nicely as well.","And in fact the orders in North America truck trailer are very, very strong. And so that is a precursor sometimes to the US economy and how things are doing there. So that is certainly very encouraging and we see good strength there. So both I think container and North America truck trailer were the big drivers. Europe was also up and nicely up as well.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the Geared Turbofan, is there any way you can kind of help us in terms of planned shipments or anything of that sort, how it looks this year and kind of the ramp into next year? Just in any way you can help quantify the volume and that OE headwind that we are going to see as that ramps up?","Akhil Johri","I think for this year we have got somewhere in the range of 40 to 50 GTF engines which will be shipped between the neo and the C Series to some extent. And I think that number wants to go up to about 200 for next year. So that is the kind of magnitude of shipments. And that is the ramp we talk about which has been putting a little bit of pressure on our CapEx, keeping CapEx above 100% of depreciation. So that is the ramp we have ahead of us.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Sam.","Greg Hayes","Okay, so I think we will stop there. I want to thank everybody for listening today. The IR team will obviously be available all day, Mr. Lundstrom and crew. And so thanks for listening. Have a great day. We will see you guys soon. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great rest of your day."],"21055":["United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call January 27, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory J.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs and significant other items of non-recurring and\/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as significant other items. The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other Forward-Looking Statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.","UTC's SEC filings include its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Kailey and good morning everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we reported full-year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30 that's at the high end of the guidance range that you gave for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion and segment operating margins were solid 16.7% for the year. I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident at our full-year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 a share that's on sales with $56 billion to $58 billion.","As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions, and I'm encouraged by the progress that team has made on our strategic priorities. First of all we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we returned $12 billion to shareowners and most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones.","As you know, we announced this and closed the sale on Sikorsky for very good price $9 billion and that generated a $3.4 billion after tax again in the fourth quarter, and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November.","As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses that\u2019s creating and supplying innovative and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a better organic growth profile, we will have higher operating margins and we will have stronger cash flows.","We've also simplified the organization, we eliminated the proportion in aerospace systems layer and the building and industrial systems layer. That creates a flatter more efficient structure with greater visibility and importantly greater accountability and we now have four focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth.","On the cost front, we announced a $5 billion multiyear restructuring plan and that includes $400 million of restructuring we initiated in 2015. And that restructuring is focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million in run rate savings by 2019.","We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividend and share repurchases that includes the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR, this year we continue to expect to return at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase plus more than $2 billion of dividends through the year.","Clearly the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock, we'll continue our share repurchase program as long as we feel there is a significant discount between the intrinsic value of the UTC and the share price.","While this program execution continues to be a top priority and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt Powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the marines back in July. The A320neo Aircraft was certified, a CSeries Aircraft was certified both with Pratt\u2019s Geared Turbofan engines and a number of UTAS systems.","The Mitsubishi Regional Jet also had its first flight and the Embraer Air Engine began testing on our flying test bed. These are programs that will drive growth for decades to come, not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business as well. I'm glad to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality.","The first Pratt & Whitney powered A320neo was delivered last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday And we\u2019re meeting our commitments on day-one for fuel burn, emissions and noise and the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it was supposed to do on day one. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus and let me crystal clear we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan.","On the commercial side, we continue to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and the world's largest hotel the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. The climate controls and security, we secured the new Atlanta Braves Stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre in Kuwait to name just a few.","So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015 and as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that we laid out a year ago. First of all flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost reduction and most importantly perhaps, disciplined to capital allocation. We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling cost while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long-term.","So despite this mixed macro environment that we are all facing UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value.","Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full-year results and I'll be back with a few closing comments in Q&A. Akhil.","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Greg. So I'm on slide two. Adjusted EPS was $6.30 that\u2019s down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly excluding a $0.19 impacts from adverse foreign exchange. Full-year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included a restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items.","As we did told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter, so let me walk through a few of the larger pieces that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press release tables have a more detailed reconciliation.","The largest item is of $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 million settlement of the Canadian royalty obligation at Pratt Canada. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax related items, roughly 75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will happen over the next couple of years.","Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters, $0.21 of that was at aerospace systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations, including the enhancement of our contractual position on our key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination.","At corporate, we recognized a liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim data and most importantly recent agreements reached with insurers.","On the other side of the ledger, you will recall in Q1 we had a gain on our value adjustment related to the acquisition of our controlling interest in a CCS joint venture that was a $0.14 benefit. Now net income for the year was reduced by these charges, resulting in fee cash flow to net income of 126%. In that number the benefit from net non-cash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25 points.","Moving to slide three, organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2% primarily from continued pressure in the Otis service business and Asia was down 1% due to China where sales were down 4%.","Growth in Commercial Aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS. Military Aerospace sales were down 11% mainly due to tough prior year compared on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS. I'm pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain and delays experience in Q3 as the New England Logistics Center of NELC. They are back to their pre NELC engine delivery cadence and we're on scheduled with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of year-end.","Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide four and just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CSS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Overall trends remain broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, the North America new equipment orders were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging trend here.","At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market and tough compares in unitary. For the full-year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the quarter and up 5% for the full-year. EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter, Otis new equipment orders was strong up 20%.","At CCS commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 4%, while fire and security product orders were down 7%. In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full-year. On the other hand, CCS Fire and Security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat an improvement compared to trends earlier in the year.","Moving to aerospace, revenue passenger miles continues to grow slightly above the long-term trend rate and airline profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter, including a three points benefit from sale of Legacy Engine Hardware. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activity.","Now before, I let Paul to take you through the additional details for our 2015, let's talk briefly about the first quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economies as the year progresses and easier comparison to second half, we expect 2016 to be backend loaded. Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings.","Also, recall the first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis and lower negative engine margins at Pratt.","Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of a $1.44 in Q1 2015 and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of 2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in pension [pay rate] (ph). As Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full-year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60.","With that let me hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul.","Paul Lundstrom","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So turning to Otis on slide five, in the quarter sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure, principally from China and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in China. Foreign exchange translation was an eight point headwind to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from foreign currency related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter.","New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26% growth in North America and mid single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up 1%, while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall, as a mid single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was offset by 5% decline in EMEA.","New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued, with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA, new equipment orders were up 20% with strong growth in most major markets, excluding Russia. New equipment orders in China were down 14% that's 8% on a unit basis, while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up 15% excluding the impact of the Thomson Line Metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year.","For the full-year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange translation for the year had a nine point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up 4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA partially offset by 10% decline in Asia driven by that 13% decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.","Moving to slide six, climate controls and security grew sales 3% at constant currency with three points of tailwind from net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a five point headwind to both sales and earnings.","During the quarter, we saw a continued sales growth in HVAC in North America where commercial HVAC was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well up 4% organically and Asia was down 7% driven by a lower China. Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the fire and security product and fuel businesses globally. The fire and security business in China was up 9%.","Our global refrigeration business was flat in the quarter with mid-single digit growth in Transicold offset by mid single-digit declines in commercial refrigeration. CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter primarily driven by last year's tough compare Transicold. If you recall last year, Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter.","In the fire and security business, we were down mid single-digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector. For the full-year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency driven by drop through from the 3% organic sales growth and productivity including lower commodity cost.","Shifting to aerospace on slide seven, Pratt & Whitney's sales of $4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter supported by low-teens growth in the commercial engines business, primarily from the V2500 up 26% in the quarter and approximately $60 million from a sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine deliveries and large commercial OE sales were also down 15% primarily on engine mix as Pratt shift more V2500 engines and fewer PW4000 than in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume along with higher negative engine margin and pension headwind were largely offset by drop through from the stronger commercial aftermarket, continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience.","For the full-year Pratt sales were down 1% organically driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down a $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension, negative engine margin and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial aftermarket and lower E&D spending.","Turning to slide eight. Aerospace systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter, consistent with the last three quarters sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass through sales the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter with growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy.","Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares finished the year with a book-to-bill of [1.0] (Ph). Military OE were down high single-digit in the quarter driven by declines in the C17 and other programs and the military aftermarket was down as well about 1%.","Aerospace systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These headwinds were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering spending was essentially flat in the quarter.","For the full-year, aerospace systems sales grew 3% organically with about two points of benefit from the pass through sales mention before. Profits for aerospace systems were down 3% for the year driven by adverse OE mix, lower military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by a continued benefits from productivity, lower engineering expense, income from licensing agreements and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable aftermarket contract adjustments.","So with that let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks, Paul. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call. I am encouraged by the progress that team is making. With the actions we've taken we\u2019re much better positioned for the future. There is off course some uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. You can think about the three biggest markets for UTX starting with the U.S. I think is a relatively solid outlook for U.S. GDP growth, despite what we've seen in the equity markets in January.","China as you know is working through some structural challenges and in Europe we\u2019re starting to see signs of the recovery continues apace. Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American markets and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit the year.","China will be down for 2016 but let\u2019s keep China in perspective, while certainly experiencing some challenges as it grapples with reform and rebounds its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer consumption economy, its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see a 100 million people urbanize in the next five years or so in China. And by 2025 they are forecast to be 221 million cities in China with more than 1 million inhabitants.","Just to put that in perspective, today, in Europe there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants, so urbanization will continue to be a powerful force and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses going forward. On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow, we saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth and the airlines are making - and the backlogs are there. Right now for UTC it's about program execution and program cost.","Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance as $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion. Given the portfolio of the team we have today, I have never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth of the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle-class have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future and all of this will create long-term shareowner value.","It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people rely on every single day. Our products enable modern and are installed and service for decades regardless of the economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial, our balance between new equipment and service and our balance geographically will help us weather these uncertain times.","Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition with Pratt. I would like to first of all take a minute to welcome Bob Leduc back to UTC. You will recall Bob is the new President of Pratt & Whitney following the announcement of Paul Adams retirement earlier in this month. And you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky and Bob's leadership was instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year. I would also like to thank Paul Adams for his many contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last six years in bringing all of these engines to the marketplace. We wish Paul really nothing but success in the future.","With that let\u2019s go ahead and open up the call for questions. Kailey.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good Morning Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Just a question first on the organic sales trends, so should we expect organic sales overall to be down a few points in Q1 and then sort of stabling Q2 and then kind of low mid single-digit in the back half to get to that one to three guides for the year.","Akhil Johri","Yes, I think it's probably going to be more in the 0% to 1% range in the first quarter, it's not back here to be negative. I think there were some tough compares, but close to 0% to 1% I would say, and then slowly improving as the year progresses.","Gregory J. Hayes","You got to keep in mind Julian, we still see despite when we saw in China for Otis, new equipment orders continue to be up globally and I would think that backlog will continue to play out, so we have a very solid year outside of China and Europe is recovering. So again, it's not all doom and gloom here.","Julian Mitchell","Sure. And then on Otis secondly, a tough margin performance in Q4. You guided in December, I think for about a $215 million price mix headwind this year. Just wanted to check how confident you feel in that guidance now and maybe explain a little bit when you think we should start to see some of those market share improvement to show up in orders or revenues","Akhil Johri","So I think the pricing pressure is continuing to be there, to the point you made. We did see increased pricing pressure in China this quarter and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its pricing environment as of now. On the other hand, there is additional cost improvement that Otis is continuing to push for a part of the commodity tailwind that we are seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side.","Remember they have 40,000 service vehicles, so the lower GAAP lean prices are the better it is from our service cost point of view. So we continue to look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure, but net-net pricing is probably slightly higher than what we're thinking in December.","Now, with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian keep in mind, we took this a significant mark-to-market FX hit in the quarter, which impacted margins by nearly a 100 basis point which is not normal for Otis. So if you adjust for that Q4 margins were not that far out of line versus our 2016 guidance.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Just to talk about GTF, I realize it's quite an accomplishment Greg, but there is a enormous industrialization challenge and we've clearly gotten some indications from Airbus that it's going to be go slow before you go fast. So could you articulate how you are going to move forward with the engine so that the customer acceptance is flawless.","Gregory J. Hayes","Howard it's a great question. And as I mentioned many times over the past year, the single biggest challenge that UTC has is the ramp on the GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can actually improve overall performance at Pratt. You are exactly right, there is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year, no change to the full-year.","However, we still express to deliver about 200 GTF engines, most of those off course will go to Airbus, there will be some going to Bombardier for the CSeries aircraft, but I think again we are following the lead of the Airbus on this. But we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping up production relatively slowly entering into service and we want to have flawless entry into service across all of the airline customers and this gives us the opportunity to ensure. I think that's what exactly happens.","So far it's been wonderful with Lufthansa this week, since we've put the engine into service and we expect that trend to continue. The engine is in great shape technically and we will focus to get on supply chain execution throughout the year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there, he has spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on this and this is going to be the gain for Pratt this year.","Howard Rubel","But just a follow-up, you wouldn\u2019t have made this management change if execution weren\u2019t part of the issue and so how do we think about the P&L impact and also the ramp in 2017 is stunningly high and probably not achievable the way you have laid it out. So I mean are we going to see a restructuring of some from, because you are not going to get there, I think under the old plan?","Gregory J. Hayes","Howard did you get cranky this morning, forgot your coffee, I think you are supposed to.","Howard Rubel","No but in all seriousness Greg I mean you have a remarkable optimism, but I want you to plan for the downside so that we can see something that's a little bit better, but that hill is huge.","Gregory J. Hayes","Howard I couldn\u2019t agree with you more, it is a huge hill to climb. Let me first of all just go back to your first comment. Paul's retirement was sudden, it wasn\u2019t expected, but you got to give Paul credit. He is the guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification and working nonstop for the last six years, you understand why Paul wanted to take a pause.","We are really fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of course to hit the ground running over there and Bob knows the business, he was at Pratt for more than 30 years, he has been at UTC for more than 35 years. He knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operation side and the team is focused on it.","I think again, this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us the chance to make sure the supply chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. Let's say Howard with all of the money that we have spent on capital and infrastructure within the UTC operations, I'm confident we can hit this run rate going forward. These engines don\u2019t take long to assemble, it's the question of just making sure all parts are there on time and that's what the focus is going to be at Pratt as well as driving the cost down.","So just because Bob is coming in there is no change to Pratt's guidance, let me be clear on that. There is no change to the ramp schedule. 2017 is 12 months away I'm not going to give guidance on 2017, but we remain confident along with Airbus that we will be able to meet their requirements going into the next couple of years.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Howard.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning guys.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hey Carter.","Carter Copeland","Question for Akhil actually. Akhil I wondered if you could give us a little bit more granularity on Q1 at the segment level, it's sounded like you were highlighting more of the revenue growth challenge against tough comparison CCS and UTAS. Obviously we know about the margin pressure at Pratt, presumably those early deliveries have a very negative engine margin, not just the sort of averages that you guys talk about, but you also called out negative mix impacts on UTAS on the OEM front. I was just wondering if you could just help us a little bit more at the segment level and understanding those trends and how we work through the year. I know you talked about E&D tailwind as well, where will we see those primarily Pratt any extra color would be helpful?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So I think trends unfortunately as you know at the segment levels 2016 is a year where only CCS is talking about a growth in earnings. So challenge that first quarter is a little more pronounced in the case of UTAS in the case of Pratt and in the case of Otis where they will recover as the year progresses, but the first quarter is going to be more than disproportionately down in earnings as those segments ready to bear full-year guidance right. It's the mix at UTAS that you talked about Carter, it\u2019s the continuing pricing challenge at Otis and the lack of service recovery yet in Europe. CCS continues to do well, although that has a tough compare in the first quarter based on just the strong organic growth they had, 5% organic growth last year.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, 6%.","Akhil Johri","6%, so I think as a result CCS will have a little bit of a challenge. The good news will come as I said on the pension side which will flow through all of the segments and then the share count reductions which is the effective capital deployment that we have been doing. So, again no surprises here Carter, I don't want to let anybody feel that this is new news, this is something we knew all along when we put the plan and our guidance together, it is just a way the structure of the year is.","Carter Copeland","Yes. So, just trying to get the cadence right. So, effectively Q1 will mark the low point for all four segments","Akhil Johri","Yes.","Carter Copeland","Okay, thanks guys.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Carter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning David.","David Strauss","Greg on the GTF, there was the comment and the release today about hitting our key performance requirements, but can you just update us on the cooling issue where that stands getting a fix there?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, David. We continue to make progress there. I think we talked about this in detail in December. I would tell you that Pratt team has identified the fixes is a software fix and a minor hardware fix. Just to be clear, every next generation commercial engine out there has to cool down to a uniform thermal before they start the engine. So this is not something endemic just to the GTF, the starting time of the cooling is a little longer than what's the customer would have liked.","These changes that we're talking about on software and the hardware, again relatively simple to do not a big cost and I think importantly doesn't change any of the fuel burn or noise or emissions on the engine, these are really pretty minor changes. If you guys are looking for something to worry about, we worry about thing we don't control like FX. I wouldn't worry about the technical aspects of this GTF, it is rock solid.","David Strauss","Greg, when would you expect the fix to be in the market?","Gregory J. Hayes","We expect - the hardware comes in for the changes in our February build, we'll get those out by towards the end of the second quarter, you will actually see those out there in deliveries.","David Strauss","Okay, great.","Gregory J. Hayes","Just given the slow ramp, it's actually beneficial, there is not going to be a lot of engines out there with the old hardware or we will retrofit those over the course of the next year. So again, we expect the impact to customers to be very minimal.","David Strauss","Okay and a follow-up on the aftermarket, pretty good numbers this quarter both at Pratt and UTAS. How are you feeling relative to the forecast you have given for 2016, I think pretty much flat the low single-digit growth, do you think maybe there could be upside or how do you feel overall? Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes","Look we're very encouraged by what we saw at the fourth quarter, we've been talking about aftermarket growth, RPMs were up as I said 7%, we expect them to be up at least 5%, 5.5% this year. Airline profitability remains very, very strong. So we expect the guidance that we gave, clearly we have a very good shot at that and if there is up side, we will talk about that at the end of the year as appose to the beginning of the year.","David Strauss","Okay. That works, thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ronald Epstein","Hey good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hey Ron.","Akhil Johri","Good Morning Ron.","Ronald Epstein","So a big picture question for you. I think, I have been covering you guys almost 15 years and you have been doing restructuring for 15 years. When do we finally see a return on all these restructuring, it's like billions a year, like when does that happen?","Gregory J. Hayes","So Ron, we've been doing restructuring - I have been here 26 years and I think every year we have done restructuring amongst those 26 years. The fact is we seem to pay off all the time. As I think about the latest big trench of restructuring is 2009 to 2014, we did about $3 billion of restructuring, you saw a big pay off from that restructuring. In fact almost $3 billion of run rate savings.","We'll continue to see savings on this next trench of restructuring, it\u2019s about $1.5 billion over four years in 2015 through 2018. By 2019 you should see about $900 million of run rate savings. The fact of the matter is you got to keep doing this. The DNA of UTC is to take cost out to do more with less, it's about productivity every day, because the world just get more competitive, had we not done restructuring in the past, we wouldn't be where we are today in terms of product cost and global scale. So it's real, it's necessary and it's things that we know how to do.","Akhil Johri","It\u2019s also Ron, since you are talking big picture as step back, so on a big picture basis and remind you of the operating margin that UTC had in mid \u201890s, when we started doing restructuring, it was 6% and it is 16.7% now. And lot of that margin expansion has been fueled by this continuous restructuring that we do taking cost out.","I would also put our SG&A rate against any industrial company and you will see that our aerospace companies are best-in-class in terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, as are our commercial companies. So all that has been fueled where we need to continue to work on, its reducing our manufacturing footprint, as Greg talked about in December, where we have 42 million square feet of which 22 million are certain high cost locations and we need to continue to work on that. So productivity is a way of life at UTC, as Greg said, it is part of the DNA and we just need to keep building that.","Ronald Epstein","Okay and then just one quick detail. That $900 million to the Canadian government, is that the Bombardier tax, I mean can you give us more color, what is that?","Gregory J. Hayes","Go ahead.","Akhil Johri","Look, we over the last several years, we've had these agreements, multiple agreements with the Canadian government on to which they would provide reimbursement for portion of our E&D. we had intern promised certain jobs in Canada and certain supply chain related investments and in return we had to pay royalties for several years. So where we stood at the end of last year was we had 20 years plus off variable high royalty payments looking ahead for us and all we did was crystallize that liability into a certain payment at this point of time, which we will pay off in four years. Net-net it's good news for both the Canadian government and for us, we essentially given back the E&D funding that they had given to us we've also taken advantage of a good exchange rate in the process. Canadian dollar is at a pretty decent rate right now and so I think net-net it's a pretty good thing to do.","Ronald Epstein","Okay that make sense right. Thanks guys.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So I joined a little bit late, but maybe tell us how many GTFs you delivered in the fourth quarter and you have mentioned that supplier issues kind of our potential bottleneck. Where are you on that and are there any other kind of potential kind of restraints beyond the cooling issue? Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, Cai. I think the total deliveries on GTF in the fourth quarter were only five and keep in mind that goes to 200 this year. As I think about the technical aspect of the engine as I said before, this cooling issue has really prove to be a non-issue, we've got that issue behind us I believe. And as far as the rest of the engine goes, so far it's been rock solid.","Its 15% better on fuel burn, it's 15% better on emissions, it's 75% better on noise when the engine is replacing. And it's been proven in both the development program and the flight test to meet all of those criteria and I think you are going to see airlines lining up to get this, we've got orders for more than 7,000 of these engines keep in mind.","As far as the supply chain, I think it's all of the normal challenges that you have in any ramp up. Again, we are ramping down to V2500, we are ramping up to GTF. There are 500 suppliers on this engine, the fact is there is probably five or 10 that cause us concern on a daily basis. Leduc and the team at Pratt are working all of those issues on a daily basis, we did put a lot of resources in the supply chain.","So there is no one supplier I would call out here other to say that we are on top of all of those suppliers making sure that they meet their commits. Keep in mind that 80% of this engine comes from the supply chain, so supply chain has to be perfectly synchronized with the build plan and that's what we are working to ensure.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Cai.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, gents.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning Mr. Sprague.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the commercial companies. Just couldn\u2019t keep up with all the color on CCS, you then clear had made a comment about commercial orders down, does that include Transicold in that commentary. Could you just speak to the actual commercial HVAC end market and what you are seeing there in the quarter and sales and orders?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes. Sure, Jeff. So we talked about CCS equipment orders in the quarter being down 5% that was largely driven by declines in Transicold, which if you recall last year we talked about Transicold orders being up more than 50%. So some of that\u2019s compare, if you look at sort of across some of the other product lines, global commercial HVAC was down about 2% driven by a softer North America and both the fire and security products business and the fuel businesses were down a little bit as well. I guess one bright spot on the fire and security side was that China was actually up in the quarter about 8% and that was driven by our fire detection and alarm business in Qinhuangdao that's the GST business which saw better order rates coming out of their the commercial vertical.","Jeffrey Sprague","And the comment about weakness in U.S. export related was that also a Transicold comment or is this something else?","Akhil Johri","It was commercial, it has largely to do but some of the projects in the Middle East if you will on the export side where we are seeing some weakness commercial.","Gregory J. Hayes","Commercial HVAC.","Akhil Johri","Commercial HVAC.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right and then maybe just shifting gears. So you decided to take a charge and bite the board on repatriation. Do you see more of that as we move forward or you just kind of - is that's got a one time opportunity you are taking given the given the gain on Sikorsky and other dynamics in the quarter.","Gregory J. Hayes","We were trying to be opportunistic, I think it will bring back about a $1.4 billion for as a result of net charge. I think the effective tax rate on that's about 17% so we thought it made sense to do that given what we're trying to do here in terms of another $3 billion of share buyback and $2 billion cost of dividends. It just seem to be the most advantageous way to get at that cash. There are no further plans to take charges like that. We bring back $500 million to $1 billion a year anyways when we receive that typically relatively low text cost, but this is just kind of a one-time item and it probably won't be repeating in the future or the near future at least.","Jeffrey Sprague","And if I could just sneak one more in, can you give a little bit more color, though the end markets overall seem to be getting a little bit better, do you still think that traditional lag effect will kick in, that better turnaround equipment will see that into service or is there some other dynamic there?","Akhil Johri","Yes you are exactly right Jeff. I think if you look at what mix the service revenue go up, it's essentially conversion of new equipment coming out of warrantee into service contract and that has been anemic in Europe as you know. The fact that new equipment orders are starting to be up, new equipments sales in EMEA was up in the fourth quarter as well, those will translate into service contracts for the down the line.","The other aspect is also that the modernization side of the service business had been hurt significantly as some of these regulations have worked itself out primarily in France. And I think we've hit bottom their modernization backlog is actually up so that should start to turnaround as well. So the combination of new equipment sales turning into service contracts and modernization improving should start to turn that but it is going to be a slow process as you said Jeff, it's not going to turn right away.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes Jeff, just to put a couple of data points around that. We talked about Europe, new equipment orders or EMEA new equipment orders being up 20%. They are also up better than 20% for the year including Western Europe which was also up double-digit. so that's encouraging and then to Akhil's point on the mod side, if you look at the end of 2014, we've finished the year with mod backlog down in the teens. It was essentially flat in 2015, we would rather see up, but it certainly a better starting point, going into 2016 than what we saw last year","Jeffrey Sprague","Alright. Thank you for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Gursky","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the call here. Just going back to China on the commercial businesses and the comment that you made that there was a bit of disconnect between HVAC and fire and security orders relative to Otis. Can you just provide a little bit more color on why that disconnect is developed and let us know why we think one is a leading indicator over the other. Meaning HVAC in fire and security begin to follow Otis or are we going to begin to see a reversal of Otis and see some better things to come more in line with what we've got at HVAC and fire and security?","Gregory J. Hayes","Jason, as you think about Otis in China, 60% plus of the Otis business relates to residential construction and that of course is the mark that has been the most hurt by I would say the over building and there maybe some of the over leverage that we've seen in the Chinese economy in the last five or six years. So it\u2019s not surprising to see the Otis orders now a lot more than the rest of the business.","On the commercial and industrial side you see again orders were flattish on our commercial HVAC business. Actually what we see in the overall economy industrial economy, there is not much growth, it is not declining the same way the residential space is. I mean if you look at the fire products that is really more of a consumer driven purchase as appose to residential construction or even industrial and that was up 8%.","So as China make this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more of the trends continue, but urbanization is not done as I said, you still got a huge population of people move into the cities. We are not giving up on the residential elevator market. We still see growth there, we see a lot more growth I think on the service side, Otis is a service business, I think we were servicing a 165,000 elevators at the end of the year that\u2019s about 20%, we expect another 20% kind of growth as we go into 2016. So the dynamics are not unexplained, well I think you just need to peel it back away or understand individual dynamics of the businesses.","Jason Gursky","That's helpful. Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning Nigel.","Nigel Coe","We covered lot of ground. So just wanted a couple of quick questions here. So going back to the $1.5 billion charges in the quarter, is that all cash and then I guess on the Canadian R&D reimbursements, does that help future indications for margin, it feels like there is a royalty payment that goes away in the future years.","Akhil Johri","Sure, the second question is first Nigel. The Canadian royalty trade off would probably be at $30 million benefit in 2016 but it will result in about a $100 million EBIT benefit for five years out, when the E&D reimbursements was expected to be there, which are going away now and the royalty payments go away as well. So definitely benefit to Pratt four, five years out of about $100 million or so a years.","With regard to overall, the cash charges and lot of these payments - the Canadian payment which is the largest one of the $1.5 billion charge that you referred to is cash. In 2016 we would probably have $500 million cash outflow as a result of these charges that we have taken in Q4 of this year, roughly $250 million or so from Canada and another $250 or so for the tax related cash reparation if you will, right. So that's the impact, the rest of it will follow over the course of the next few years.","Nigel Coe","Okay that's very helpful and then just quickly on CCS and I know this question have been answered a few times but the downsides in orders, do you have the backlog number in hand, how does the backlog look year-to-year?","Akhil Johri","The backlog, we can get you the exact number later on, but I do believe that backlog was - because of full-year was up for commercial HVAC and the sales were up slightly more. So backlog maybe slightly down is what I'm guessing, but we'll get you the exact number.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I don't have the number handy but I would just remind you that on CSS it's a relatively quick turn - not relatively, very quick turn. So on the HVAC side you know you are going to turn orders in a few weeks up to as high and maybe three months and on the fire and security side it's essentially a book and ship business. So I would say backlog is a lot more important than Otis side than CCS.","Nigel Coe","Okay, thanks a lot.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Nigel.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey I was hoping you could comment on whether you see any changes in how UTC is competitively positioned with this announced JCI and Tyco merger and commercial building services. We talked about potential consolidation, so this is a big one is here. Does that change the equation for you guys at all?","Gregory J. Hayes","Not very much Deane, as I think Tyco\u2019s fire business if you think about it is primarily a fuel business, it's about 75% fuel, 25% product, we obviously compete against them in both for fuels and the product. We are actually more heavily weighed into the product side than the fuel side and as far as JCI goes on their building efficiency side obviously we compete with them against with carrier.","But again, they will take some cost out as I think you saw in their press release just similar to what is [Indiscernible] when we put fire and security and carrier together about three years ago. So it\u2019s nice to do the run in our playbook there, but I don\u2019t really see that there is a big competitive impact as a result of that.","Deane Dray","Thanks. And then just a question for Akhil on the asbestos charge. How far out have you reserved the asbestos liability and have there been any changes or material changes in your insurance coverage?","Akhil Johri","As I said earlier, I think we've had looked at the potential from all the knowledge we have today of the pending and future expected claims and adjusted that downward for the insurance agreements that we entered into in Q4. So net of those two is what you are seeing here, hopefully we won't see any greater charges beyond this, but you never know right, but at this point based on the best knowledge we had Deane we took that into account.","Deane Dray","So just to clarify on the time horizon, we've seen companies take different approaches here. Did you take what's called an end of life charge which is as far as you can foresee, it sounds like that's in your answer or did you do a 10 year reserve.","Akhil Johri","No. It's end of life is what the approach we took at.","Deane Dray","That's great to hear. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Samuel Pearlstein","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning Sam.","Samuel Pearlstein","Can you talk a little bit about Pratt & Whitney, it looks like when you talked I guess before you talked about I think it was $15 billion in revenues, it looks like it came in a little bit less even on an adjusted basis just with that military weakness. Why is it a little bit light in the fourth quarter?","Gregory J. Hayes","Sam, you are exactly right. If you think about the revenues in Q4, Pratt was a little short of our expectations even from December while we hit on the earnings side, we were a little short. We were 100% on contract at Pratt as we exited the year both on the commercial and the military side, but we had expected to get the more engines out of the door on the military side than what actually shipped. So there was a little bit of I'll say backlog there that we had expected to get out.","Akhil Johri","The other one Sam there is the Pratt Canada business, as you know the helicopter related engine shipments have been weak throughout the year, there has been also some weakness in the general aviation market particularly related to engines for the agricultural segment et cetera. So I think Pratt Canada and military engines those were the two short falls versus say a few months ago.","Samuel Pearlstein","And then just on Otis, can you just talk a bit about sequentially from the third quarter to fourth quarter, there is over a 200 basis points shrink in the margin on an adjusted basis. Is that foreign exchange that the R&D step up you have talked about, I mean what is the type.","Akhil Johri","Yes Sam, it's largely due to the foreign exchange, because as you recall Q3 actually had a positive roughly $30 million benefit from mark-to-market adjustments and that almost entirely reserved in Q4. So if you adjust for those things I think the adjusted margins are not that far off quarter-to-quarter.","Samuel Pearlstein","Okay. Great, thank you.","Akhil Johri","Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Hayes for closing remarks.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thank you Kailey. First of all, thanks for listening in today, I appreciate, I know there is a lot of data here and Paul and the team will be available throughout the day and the week to take all of your questions. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Meeting, we will be doing that in New York on March 10th. Again, if you have any questions give us a call.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Maria Lee [ph], Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and onetime items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectation and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thank you, Stephanie, and good morning to everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, first quarter earnings per share were up 24% year-over-year to $1.31. That includes $0.21 of gain in excess of restructuring. Excluding these items for both years, earnings per share grew 2% to $1.10, which is a little better than we expected back in March. Keep in mind, these results include $0.13 per share of headwind from higher pension costs, higher E&D and negative FX. ","Stronger sales in our U.S. Residential HVAC business towards the end of the quarter drove better-than-expected operating profit at UTC Climate, Controls & Security. On the other hand, while we know the urbanization trend will drive continued long-term growth, as we said in March, our business in China is off to a slow start. Otis new equipment sales in China were down 9% in constant currency in the first quarter.","The ongoing government effort to bring housing prices down has negatively impacted the higher end of the residential sector, which represents about half of Otis' China sales. We've also seen some pricing pressure in China and a temporary impact as a result of the Beijing Metro incident last year. We've addressed the root cause of the incident, and we're confident it's been corrected. ","As we all know, the global economy remains uneven. We have seen some encouraging signs in the U.S. over the past few months with an increase in residential construction and an improvement in consumer confidence. However, with continued weakness in Europe and the short-term slowdown in construction activity in China, we'll continue to focus on what we control, as we usually do. ","In the quarter, we invested $111 million in restructuring, and the businesses continue to find ways to reduce structural costs. As a result, we're taking up our estimate for restructuring for the year to $450 million including the Goodrich-related restructuring actions. That's up $100 million from our expectations in March. ","We also continue the process of evaluating and reshaping the UTC portfolio to position the company for long-term sustainable growth. And just as we did through the 2008, 2009 recession, we continue to invest in E&D, spending an incremental $77 million or $0.06 a share in the first quarter over the prior years, as we continue to develop innovative technologies like the GTF and S-97 RAIDER that will give us a sustainable competitive advantage and deliver real value to the customers. ","So despite the uneven economic outlook, we remain confident in the full year expectations for earnings per share of $5.30 to $5.50. That's 0% to 4% growth on sales of $61 billion to $62 billion, and that guidance includes the sales impact in net $0.25 EPS dilution from the proposed Goodrich acquisition, which we still expect to close at mid-year. ","As you heard from the business unit presidents in March, much of the operating profit growth will come in the back half of the year. As the year progresses, we'll see more normal year-on-year comparisons across our businesses, and we believe that the Chinese government will continue to pull back on some of the tightening measures, which should lead to improvement in the high-end residential construction market in China. ","Okay, turning to first quarter results on Slide 2. Total sales were down 2%. Organic sales growth was 1% and in line with our expectations after a strong 9% organic growth in the first quarter of last year. Hamilton Sundstrand led the way this quarter with 10% organic revenue growth on strength in both commercial and military aerospace. Sikorsky sales, on the other hand, were down 15% organically following 15% growth on the first quarter of last year due to the absence of international development aircraft, as well as lower-than-expected shipments at the end of the quarter. Total segment operating profit was down 2% driven by the commercial businesses. The slow start in China and ongoing weakness in the European markets drove Otis' operating profit down 6% on flat sales. ","UTC Climate, Controls & Security's operating profit was down 5%. In March you'll recall, we had expected CCS to be down around 10% after 70% growth in the first quarter of last year, but a strong rebound in residential cooling orders at the end of the quarter provided some unexpected upside. Hamilton Sundstrand had another strong quarter with 15% operating profit growth from solid conversion on organic sales growth. ","Segment operating margins were down 10 basis points. A continued focus on cost reduction and productivity nearly offset the $0.13 of headwind we talked about from E&D, pension and FX, and about half of that headwind is actually in Pratt's results for the quarter. ","As I mentioned, earnings per share were $1.31. That's up 24%. A $0.23 gain from the 2006 through 2008 tax settlements and a $0.16 gain from the sale of a controlling interest in a CCS joint venture was partially offset by $0.09 of restructuring, $0.08 of impairment on assets held for sale at CCS and an additional $0.01 for the legal reserve for the previously disclosed export licensing compliance matters. ","Excluding restructuring in all these onetime items in both years, earnings per share grew 2%. As I said, FX had a negative impact of $0.02 in the quarter. On top of that, deal cost from the Goodrich acquisition was an additional $0.02 of headwind. ","Free cash flow in the quarter was 95% of net income. As you saw in the press release, net income also had the benefit of noncash items, so once again, very strong free cash flow generation as you've come to expect. We spent $72 million on acquisitions in the quarter and there is no share repurchase. You'll recall, we decided to suspend share buyback last September as a result of the Goodrich transaction. With our domestic pension plan 90% funded at a discount rate of 4.6%, there will be no additional contributions to the domestic pension plans in 2012. ","Slide 3 now on orders briefly. You see selected order trends. Pratt & Whitney large commercial engines spare orders were actually down 3% following the 33% growth in last year's first quarter. Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spares were up 1% with strength in 787 initial provisioning, and this follows 23% growth in the first quarter of 2011. Obviously tough compares, but still confident in our outlook for the year. We're keeping a close eye on oil prices due to the impact on airline profitability. Of course on the flip side of these higher oil prices, this just enhances the value of the GTF offering, which will provide a 16% better fuel efficiency than current engine design. ","On CCS, North American Residential HVAC orders were up 10%. It's obviously better than we expected with a robust activity late in the quarter. At Otis, new equipment orders were down 10% at constant currency. Otis' new equipment orders in China contracted 21% at constant currency after growing 7% in the fourth quarter. And we continue to believe in our emerging market strategies, which allow us to leverage our worldwide scale to deliver innovative products in a cost-efficient way and deliver real value to our customers from Mumbai to Chengdu to S\u00e3o Paulo. We continue to see strong but moderating growth in these emerging markets, consistent with our expectations and, of course, well ahead of the growth rates in the developed markets. Although China orders were down 15% in the quarter across UTC, we saw a good traction in the other BRIC markets with Brazil, Russia and India each up over 20% in the quarter. ","So the first quarter results, a little better than we expected from what we told you just a few weeks ago. I'll come back and talk about the year a little bit more detail but first, let me turn it over to Maria [ph] to take you through the business unit results.","Unknown Executive","Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. At Otis, operating profit was down 6% in the quarter on flat sales. Operating margin was 21.4%, 140 basis points lower than prior year. Foreign currency translation reduced both sales and profit growth by about 1 point. At constant currency, new equipment sales were flat, as a 9% decline in China was offset by continued growth in other emerging markets. On the same basis, service sales were up led by growth in modernization and contractual maintenance. Pricing pressure in Europe, higher commodity costs and a slow start in China more than offset the benefits of cost reduction action in the quarter. At constant currency, new equipment orders were down 10% with China down 21%. Consistent with guidance from the March Analyst Meeting, we expect the new equipment market in China to be up low- to mid-single digits for the year. ","Otis will aggressively pursue restructuring actions this year. Otis' full year guidance of $50 million to $75 million of profit growth on mid-single-digit sales growth assumes savings from further cost reductions, as well as improvement in the top line especially in China for the balance of the year. ","On Slide 5, UTC Climate, Controls & Security profit contracted 5% in the quarter on 6% lower sales resulting in margin of 11.4%, up 20 basis points from prior year. Organic sales were up 1% following 12% growth in the first quarter of last year. Mid-single-digit organic growth in Europe and automation and controls businesses was partially offset by modest contraction in Asia and Transicold as well as the impact of our Thailand factory, which resumed operations in March. ","As Greg mentioned, better-than-expected profit performance was driven by strong U.S. Residential HVAC orders in the second half of March. This drove low-single-digit growth in split systems unit shipments for the quarter as CCS benefited from warmer-than-normal temperatures across much of the U.S. ","About half of the $25 million year-over-year profit decline is driven by the absence of a gain on the sale of the U.K. guarding business last year. The balance is largely in the Americas business primarily lower furnace volume. For the full year, CCS continues to expect operating profit growth of about $225 million on 4% organic sales growth, but given the recently announced portfolio transactions, reported sales will be down low single digits. ","Turning to aerospace on Slide 6. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 6% in the first quarter including 1 point of unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Sales growth was driven by higher Military and Pratt Canada engine sales and higher industrial volume at Power Systems and was partially offset by lower commercial aftermarket and engine deliveries. Large commercial spares were down 4% year-over-year. ","Operating profit in the quarter was down 1%. Higher E&D, pension costs and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada were partially offset by the benefit of net higher sales and restructuring savings, as well as the benefit from a contract termination of about $0.02. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit to be down $25 million to $50 million on high single-digit sales growth. ","Hamilton Sundstrand posted a strong quarter with profit growth of 15% on 9% higher sales. Sales growth came from both OEM and aftermarket, each up high single digits. 787 provisioning sales drove the aftermarket growth. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by the benefits of increased aftermarket volume and lower E&D. This was partially offset by higher pension costs. Operating margin was up 90 basis points year-over-year to 16.2%. For the full year, we continue to expect Hamilton Sundstrand's operating profit to be up $75 million to $100 million and sales up high single digits. ","Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 8. Operating profit declined by 2% on 15% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 39 aircraft. 34 aircraft were based on military platforms and 5 commercial. Sales were lower driven by 19 fewer aircraft deliveries, including the absence of international development aircraft and lower U.S. government deliveries. On profit, benefit from strong aftermarket performance and the absence of one Canadian Maritime Helicopter was offset by lower military aircraft deliveries and higher E&D spend. Of note during the quarter, Sikorsky signed a contract with Bond Aviation Group for 16 firm S-92 helicopters, marking the largest onetime order of S-92 aircraft ever received. For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of approximately $50 million to $75 million on mid-single-digit sales decline. ","With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thank you, Maria [ph]. But before we get into the full year, let me just give you an update on some of the other activities going on at UTC, and there is a lot of things going on. And so the good news is they're all on track. Our 2 new organizations, CCS and PAS, are both in place, and we're encouraged by the results so far. First, at CCS, Climate, Controls & Security, Geraud and the team are progressing well with the integration of our new organization, and they've begun the portfolio transformation of the legacy Fire & Security business, with the divestiture of the U.S. branch operations announced earlier this month. CCS has also formed a joint venture with Watsco for distribution in Canada, building on our successful partnership in the United States. All of this comes while CCS continues to innovate and produce the most efficient solutions for both our residential and commercial customers. ","On the aerospace side, Alain and the team at Propulsion and Aerospace systems continue to make great progress on the Goodrich integration planning. We've also fine-tuned our financing plan, reducing the need for an equity issuance from $4 billion to only $1.5 billion. And we've made good progress on the divestitures that we announced last month, and we're on track to complete these divestitures before year end. Whereas proceeds from these divestitures will help finance the Goodrich acquisition and more importantly allow us to focus on our core business of aerospace and commercial buildings. We expect to sign a contract shortly for Rocketdyne, and initial bids show a very strong interest for the industrial businesses. As you saw on the press release this morning, we recorded charges in the first quarter in discontinued operations, but we expect net gains for the full year as the sale of these businesses is completed. ","Okay. At Pratt & Whitney in the quarter, we secured an additional 156 firm orders for the A320 engine. The GTF engine continues to validate performance characteristics in testing with now over 2,100 hours complete and the first flight of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet engine scheduled for later this month. ","So a good progress in our new organization, and we continue to execute on the transformational changes to the UTC portfolio. ","As for the outlook for 2012, we remain confident in our guidance of $5.30 to $5.50. That's 0% to 4% growth, as I said, on sales of $61 billion to $62 billion including Goodrich. Q1 was a little better than expected but as we told you, most of the operating profit growth will still be in the back half. Sikorsky shipments are weighted towards the back half with about 1\/3 in the first half and 2\/3 in the back half. CCS faces easier compares and will realize more benefit from the integration and portfolio transformation. At Otis, still expects improvement in the new equipment market as the year progresses. ","As for other elements of our guidance, we have visibility of an additional $100 million of gains, so we now expect $600 million for the full year. And we expect the excess of $0.21 gain from the first quarter will be offset in the back half of the year with restructuring in both Goodrich and the core business. ","We expect engineering development to increase by about $150 million primarily at Pratt & Whitney. And our first quarter operational tax rate came in right where we expected at 32%, and we continue to expect an operational tax rate for full year of 29.5% although, of course, there's volatility across the quarters. On cash flow, we continue to expect free cash flow to equal or exceed net income for the full year. ","With our transformational deals, the new organization, industry-leading franchises and a sustained focus on structural cost reduction, we are well-positioned for long-term earnings growth. ","With that, let me stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Greg, can you give us a little more color on where you're actually going after the additional restructuring with the gains that you're finding and some color on kind of resulting benefits from restructuring in 2012 and 2013?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think, we did about $111 million of restructuring I think in the first quarter. That really was spread out. With Otis, there was about $28 million; CCS, about $35 million; Pratt, $37 million; and a little bit of Sikorsky and Hamilton. I think you're going to continue to see spending in those 3 businesses primarily. Certainly as Geraud continues with the CCS portfolio transformation, you're going to see additional restructuring actions there. Otis, again, continues to look for ways to reduce some structural costs, so I think you'll see additional restructuring at Otis and the same at Pratt & Whitney. So I think the 3 big businesses will probably get the bulk of it. And also keep in mind, there'll probably $150 million of restructuring associated with the Goodrich acquisition. So again, that's all back half.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Should we expect those restructuring costs to pay back in similar dollars into 2013, or what's the payback look like?","Gregory J. Hayes","The payback on the programs that we're looking at today are between 1 and 2 years. I think some of the -- the Goodrich payback will be very quick and will be SG&A overhead as we eliminate some duplicative functions. Some of the bigger restructuring as we're looking at capacity will take a little bit longer. But I'll tell you, usually 1 and 2 years is the average payback we're seeing. Some of it -- some of the quicker SG&A stuff like we did at CCS earlier this year, again, we're seeing that benefit this year. And you recall, as Geraud's roadmap to $225 million had savings in there from restructuring in it.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And can you elaborate a little bit more on the magnitude of price pressure at Otis, and is there any way to kind of measure how significant kind of the fallout on the Metro accident actually has been? And are you confident that, that cloud is fully lifted at this point?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well, let's talk about pricing first, then we can touch on the Beijing Metro. I think last year in July, we saw the spike in rare earth metals in China, and Otis, I think, reacted very quickly to try and raise prices. In fact, I think we raised prices about 5% last July. Unfortunately, that price increase did not get much traction in the market and in fact, resulted in some of the declines that we've seen in orders even into the first quarter of this year. One of the things that Pedro and team are doing right now is going back and relooking at pricing. Obviously, the headwind from the rare earths has abated. So I think there is a good case to be made there to adjust pricing, but it certainly hurt in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. The Beijing Metro incident, again, I think that's behind us. Again, it was a tragic accident. I think everybody is aware of an escalator incident in Beijing. Again, we've been working with the Beijing government. Again, I hope that's behind us. It's one of these difficult things, obviously, when you have an accident, it gets that kind of visibility. But we're doing the right things in terms of working with the customers and working to make sure that the brand has not been damaged in any way. The other thing you keep in mind, I think, in terms of the Otis China situation in the quarter and even into last year is the mix issue. Again, we are strongest in the residential construction market. And obviously, where the growth is coming is primarily in the social side, where we're not as strong, so been hurt by mix, we've been hurt by pricing and hurt a little bit by this Beijing Metro. So, again, all of its correctable. I think as the year progresses, we expect to have better results in China, plus you're going to see some of the tightening measures loosen there to, again, hopefully improve the outlook to get back to kind of a more normal growth rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol from the JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is on drilling down to Otis. Just I want to drill down a little bit more into these margins, which were a bit below our number and certainly, I think, below where they've been for a few years on a quarterly basis. And sales were flat overall for the business and the mix, from a service and OE standpoint, even improved a little bit. I understand China is good margin on the OE side. But Greg, is there any way of -- maybe, I don't know, explain a little bit more clearly what's happening there? And if you think maybe this is a blip this quarter, or we should maybe expect margins to come off a little bit from what we've used to expect -- used to expecting here?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, margins are still pretty good. I'll give you that, but they were down 140 basis points. I think, yes, there are really 2 big pieces here to the margin decline. First of all, we saw commodities, and this is as we continue to bleed off the inventory, some of these rare metals, you saw about, what, 60 basis points, I think, of margin deterioration just from commodity at the quarter, so that's a big number. The other -- another 40 basis points of contraction came from the pricing that we talked about, so that's really the biggest piece of this. And we're also -- we're continuing to make investments around the world. We're continuing to build out the CLC in Shanghai and as well as consolidated the factory down in South Carolina. So just some unusual expenses. So I'd expect, again, margin should get better, but certainly, we're not really surprised that we're contracted in the quarter.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so the margin erosion was exclusively on the OE side, and service margins were flat or up a little bit?","Gregory J. Hayes","No. In fact, a little bit of that pricing that we talked about actually came on the service side, and most of that came in Europe, where we continue to see a little bit of pricing pressure on service, I think Pedro mentioned that back in March.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then switching over to CCS. So I guess, the reduction in the sales expectation is due to the divestiture you announced. What exactly is in there now for incremental divestitures over the remainder of the year? And then additionally within the same segment, there was a nice surprise in -- I guess, in the second half of March. You got a nice surge of orders in U.S. residential. How much can we read through for the season and for Q2 specifically, and how much might this continue?","Gregory J. Hayes","Let me take the second part of that question first, which is the res market improvement. Obviously, we stood up in March and we talked about CCS being down about 10% in earnings after being up 70% last year. Actually came in only down about 5%, and that was really on the back of this surge in orders that we saw in the residential side and really on the cooling side. Yes, I think orders were down in the first 2 months of the quarter, and then really came back, so I think overall res orders were about -- up about 10% and we think cooling was up almost 19% in the quarter. So again, all of that strength really came in the back half. Obviously, there is no heating season, so there's not much to talk about on the heating side. So again, I think we picked up a little bit of share maybe in the quarter on really a strong rebound. I guess it's not surprising. Again, we did see a pickup in the residential construction markets in the first quarter with the warm weather. It was a pleasant surprise. As far as the year in terms of what's in, I don't know, Maria [ph], do have the...","Unknown Executive","So yes, we have -- the organic growth for CCS remains about 4%. So the -- yes, 4% growth. FX probably account for about a 2% headwind and then acquisitions net is probably about 5% to 6% on sales.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what do you have done right now in terms of the deals you've already announced, how much would that reduce sales at this point?","Unknown Executive","So the AFSS announcement was about $200 million for the rest of the year divestiture impact, and the Canadian distribution was about $100 million. So that's about $300 million incrementally from what we would have had in the prior guidance, and that's included in the sort of 4%, 5% acquisition divestiture net.","Gregory J. Hayes","So yes, we talked about $750 million of divestitures around this portfolio transformation. We're getting towards that number, but we still have a little ways to go. So there's probably another $250 million or so that might get divested. We just won't see a full year impact of that. We'll be out in front of that with you, Joe, as we get those deals done.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Question back on -- clarification, I guess, on the CCS business. The divestiture lowered sales expectation for the year. You left EBIT intact. Is that having the resi upper in there, or were the divestitures not really contributing?","Gregory J. Hayes","Divestitures weren't really contributing. Yes, we're still on track, I think, for res in terms of sales, up about 3% to 5%, and the guidance is still up $225 million. And I would tell you the res although was good for the end of March into early April here, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves with the cooling season here. We saw this play out last year. We had a very strong first quarter and then a slowdown throughout the year. So right now, the $225 million is still the guidance, and there is still a task out there to hit even that number, and Geraud has got line of sight to do that through additional restructuring. If there is some upside related to the res business, we'll certainly see that in the next quarter here. But for right now, I think we're not anticipating any big upsurge beyond that 3% to 5% that we talked about.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, the other one was on Otis in terms of the full year outlook for sales. Can you talk about what you're expecting for Otis versus the market, and if there's any share gain built into your expectation and kind of how were you in the first quarter? And if you didn't have a share gain, what would that mean to kind of the EBIT outlook?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think in the quarter, obviously, sales were flattish with earnings down 6% and we probably lost a little bit of share in China, probably held share around the rest of the world. Clearly, we're expecting to get a little bit of traction. I think we have new equipment up in the mid-single digits from a guidance standpoint. And that assumes, again, a little bit of improvement here in North America, flat in Europe and normal kind of growth rates around the rest of the world. So a little bit of share loss in the first quarter, but yes, we're expecting we'll get that back as the year progresses.","Unknown Executive","And one more thing just specifically on that China market. I think, we talked about the pressure that we're seeing on the high-end residential side. And we think that was sort of down double digits in the quarter. And we do think that, that will likely, with the pullback on some of the tightening measures with the China government, that will likely not be down as much for the year. So that would help the overall market in China improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So could you give us some more color on the spares orders at Pratt and Hamilton Sundstrand? How -- were they at all impacted by kind of prebuying in the fourth quarter? And maybe some color on what you're seeing here in the early days of April.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, spares, Cai, as I said, we were down 3% at Pratt after being up 33% last year in the first quarter. So in my own view it's just a tough compare. We seem to -- we're on track, we think, at Pratt for kind of mid-single-digit growth in spares for the year. I think we've got line of sight to that based upon the shop visits that are scheduled and our talks, dealings with the airlines. So, again, first quarter was tough. Again, part of this, again, you never know how much prebuy goes on at the end of the year with price increases, so first quarter sometimes light. But yes, I think we're pretty much on track at Pratt. At Hamilton again, up 1% versus 23% last year in the first quarter, so again, a very tough compare. Repair inputs were actually down a little bit in the quarter more than expected, so that's just a timing issue. We still know that flight hours are way up. The RPMs are up, ASMs are up and capacity is up. So the airlines are still making money despite the oil prices where they are. So we're going to see the repairs come in at Hamilton. And yes, I think we've got up nearly 10% in the expectation for spares, and part of that will be the benefit from additional 787 provisioning, which continues to be robust, as well as a recovery, I think, in this repair activity.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so some of that really looks like it was just largely timing then.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I believe it is.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","R&D was up year-over-year. I guess, you're going kind of at your annualized run rate. Is there anything in terms of the timing there? Is that going to be flat throughout the year, or how should we think about that?","Gregory J. Hayes","So if you think about it, we were up $77 million in the quarter and a little more than $50 million of that was at Pratt, and really Pratt is now on the run rate that we expect for the rest of the year. You recall we had a slow start to last year but eventually, they were up more than $225 million in E&D. So this is really just getting Pratt on the run rate, so you'll see the increases slow down. Obviously, the $150 million expectation of increase, half of it was in the first quarter. So, again, you'll see a little bit more increase in the second and then flat now towards the back half of the year. And keep in mind, the CSeries engine should be certified by the fourth quarter, so there'll be a step-down in spending there, making good progress on the other engines as well. So again, this is the peak year for engineering spending at Pratt & Whitney. I know Mr. Bellemare, Mr. Hess are keenly aware of the commitment to you all to make sure that this is the peak year, and that still should be the case.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Last quick one, Goodrich, you said you still expect to close at mid-year. And yet given that the EC is gone into Phase 2, I mean, is it maybe more likely that mid-year would be late July or early August, which is still near mid-year? Maybe you can update us there.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes. I really can't comment, Cai, on where we are with the regulators. We're obviously working with the DOJ. We're working with the EU, and we believe we're still on track, and I said mid-year. Whether that's plus or minus a couple of weeks, I couldn't handicap at that closely. But I would tell you, we're still highly confident that we're on track for -- to close the deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Couple quick ones. One, a sort of point of clarification on Joe's question relating to the Otis margins. I guess, so you called out 40 bps of headwind from pricing and 60 bps from the rare earth impact. But given that they were down a little bit more, it sort of implies a profit differential in China versus the other emerging markets that you called out that were growing that would be pretty substantial. Is that right? How big should we be thinking the margin differential is between China and the rest of the BRIC countries?","Gregory J. Hayes","The margins in China are probably -- they're comparable to overall Otis margins. Again, it's mostly a new equipment business there. If you think about it, earnings in China were obviously adversely affected and hurt margin as we lost some sales. Again, sales were down 9% in the quarter. So that obviously had an impact, but I wouldn't diminish the impact of what's going on in Europe either with a very slow start there on the service side. So yes, there's really -- it's Europe and China, I would say, are the 2 pieces of the puzzle here in terms of where we saw the earnings decline and the margin decline.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on Pratt, you called out a favorable contract termination. I presume that helped the margins in the quarter. Can you quantify how big that may have been in Q1?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, it's about $0.01.","Unknown Executive","$0.02","Gregory J. Hayes","I'm sorry, it's about $0.02.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and one last quick one on the 787 initial provisioning for Hamilton. Do you have a sense of how much that's contributing to your full year growth guidance for spares at Hamilton?","Gregory J. Hayes","The 787 provisioning?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think it's -- last year, we contributed about, I don't know, let's say, $70 million of provisioning benefit last year from 787. We probably expect a similar amount this year, so it's a meaningful piece of the growth year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Greg, can you go through, in terms of Otis for the rest of the year, when you think about getting to your numbers, can you break it out a little bit kind of between this high-end resi piece, the public housing piece and commercial, and just give kind of a sense of what you expect for the different components?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think what we would expect, as again we said, the social housing piece, we continue to see decent growth in that market in the first quarter. We would expect to see the residential pick up in the second quarter from what we saw in the first quarter. And the commercial side is really -- it's slowing growth but still growing. Really, this is really a story about the residential, kind of the high-end residential. And as the government there has started to ease, and we have seen prices come down in the market, we continue to expect, again, the growth will come during the back half of the year, probably not going to see a lot of growth here in the second quarter. But again as the year progresses, we should see good growth. And again, China, it's a huge market for us. Obviously, most of the growth is starting to come now in the western part of the countries in places like Chengdu and Chongqing and all of those, and we've got good positions there. We've got the new Gen2 low-cost elevator in our factory in Chongqing that's going to be opening later this year, which should, again, provide some emphasis for growth and to help us attack even more of the low-end social housing.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And I mean, in terms of the higher-end resi piece, I mean, are you seeing any evidence of this loosening starting to feed through yet? And I guess, if it doesn't -- if not, I mean, is there sort of a Plan B?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I would tell you, right now, we have not seen much of an impact. Again, we still see prices, I think, last month were down about 1%. We think we saw the loosening start in the first quarter. We expect that's going to continue, but we really don't expect to see any significant movement in the market really until the second half. If that doesn't happen, obviously, there is a risk to Otis' guidance for the full year. I think about first quarter, we're down 6%. For the full year, we're talking about $50 million to $75 million. So there's obviously some need for improvement as we go throughout the year. Overall though, again, all of the risk out there in Otis, I think, is more than covered by what we have in terms of the contingency at UTC level. So we're still highly confident in the guidance. Even if Otis China doesn't recover as fast as we expect, it's still should not be an issue at the UTC level.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And just I maybe have missed it, did you go through the -- what commercial equipment and container actually did in the quarter, truck\/trailer and some of the subcomponents of carrier?","Gregory J. Hayes","We did not.","Unknown Executive","No. We did not. So it's from -- let's see, if you look at commercial HVAC orders, let's see, for new equipment, overall, they were up high single digits at constant currency with North America up about 20%. That continues to be strong. EMEA, up low single digits and Asia down mid single digits, so that's commercial HVAC. Did you also ask about the other pieces, Transicold?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, so Transicold. Yes, Transicold transport refrigeration as expected, that was down about 15%, kind of mid-teens range as we had expected. Again, weakness there was primarily in Europe truck\/trailer as the European economy continues to sputter. I think one of the good news pieces, on commercial refrigeration we actually saw some decent kind of sales growth, so up high teens organically, which was good news. Also on the ACS business, the automated controls business, that was up revenues kind of high single digit. So a little bit of weakness at Transicold as we had expected, but pretty good on the commercial HVAC and strength in ACS and refrigeration.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Greg, CCS obviously outperformed the bid in the first quarter down on the operating profit side, down about 5%, and I think you had said down 10% to 15%. You had said you guys had talked about a flat first half. Is that what you're still looking at, or is the second quarter a little bit better?","Gregory J. Hayes","So, I think the second -- yes, we have said a flat first half with first quarter down 10%. Now with first quarter only down about 5%, I think second quarter will continue as we had expected, which means it will actually start growing earnings in the second quarter, so a little bit better first half than what we had expected.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, sorry to go back to Otis China, but I guess a couple of questions. First of all, the down 9 on new equipment, how did that compare to your expectations for the first quarter? And then looking at comps, it looks like the comps are very difficult for China in new equipment in the second and third quarter and the even in the fourth quarter. Is that correct?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, that's right. I think we saw in the second and third quarter last year was like 20%, 30% growth, then it slowed down to about 7% growth in orders in the fourth quarter of last year. As far as our expectation, obviously, we came in a little light to expectations in the first quarter, down 9% on orders that were down 21%. We went into the year with a strong backlog, up about 20% year-over-year. But again with these slowing measures out there, what are seeing is that just deferral and delay in some of the shipments from the factories to the job sites. So a little disappointing there from what we had originally expected. But again, it's only one quarter, so I'm not going to get too excited about it.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So based on the tough Q2 comps, is it fair to assume that China new equipment would be down and your expectation is down again in the second quarter?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well, I think just based on the order rates that we saw in the first quarter and the comps that you have to last year, you're probably going to see a pretty tough compare. I don't know that we have a really solid estimate for second quarter in terms of the shipments. But I would think just from 50,000 feet, it's going to be tough with the order rates where they were in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, maybe just a couple of clarifications. When you're talking about commercial HVAC up high single digits, was that revenues or was that orders?","Unknown Executive","That was actually both.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For both.","Unknown Executive","Yes.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- back in the Pratt spares, are you expecting that to turn around in 2Q? I guess we're picking up a little bit of some European OEMs destocking. Maybe that has to do with the cadence of other OEMs we're thinking of in that context in terms of their pricing and you're not seeing the same thing. But sounded like you hadn't changed your full year forecast, and just wondering what the confidence is behind that.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think the order rates, we look at them every week. Pratt, probably looks at them every day, continue -- it's lumpy. First quarter, we started out strong in January, then it slowed down a little bit. But overall, again, I think what you're going to see, as the year progresses, the compares get a lot easier. I think we are up about 22% in the second quarter last year, 33% in the first and then it slowed down in the back half. So I think what you're going to naturally see is as the year progresses, the comps get easier. We ought to be able to pretty easily hit that kind of 5% growth rate in spares at Pratt.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And sorry to jump back to CCS here, I forgot one there. And that's just do you have an organic all-in on the old carrier and old Fire & Security basis as we used to know it?","Gregory J. Hayes","I don't. I think we've given you most of the elements there. I'll tell you, the one piece we probably didn't talk about was fire products. That was up globally about 5% in orders. Now the fire service in Europe, that was actually down a little bit, down mostly in Northern Europe and offset by a little bit of strength in Southern Europe surprisingly. I think the business in the U.K. continues to stabilize, still not fixed, but at least it's not continuing down. So again, I think pretty much on track with where we expect it to be.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Greg, anything else you'd want to highlight on 2Q either from the standpoint of Sikorsky shipments or tax rate? Anything else you want to call out there?","Gregory J. Hayes","We're going to -- I think gains will equal restructuring here in the second quarter. We've got a line of sight and some additional gains. I think the tax rate will be about what we had forecast for the full year. You're not going to see, like the first quarter, we had a higher rate. Other than that, I think it's going to be a solid second quarter. Again, the trends that we saw in the first quarter at Sikorsky should get a little bit better. Keep in mind, though, at Sikorsky, I think we had shipped 90 helicopters in the first half and so almost twice that in the second half of the year. So still a little bumpy down at Sikorsky in the second quarter. In Otis, again, we should see a recovery again. I talked about the CCS before you're getting good traction. In Pratt and Hamilton, again, pretty much on track with what we saw in the first quarter.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And sorry one more in the weeds here. On the North America Resi HVAC order strength, are you confident that pricing on that unit acceleration is at a level that is tracking in line with your profit expectations? I guess, we're picking up a little in the channel some price discounting going on by a number of OEMs on that volume lift in March.","Gregory J. Hayes","Actually we did not see that. In fact, we raised prices last October in the res market, and that price is pretty well stuck. Again, we raised on the back of commodity prices. We're actually seeing good pricing trend. And the inventory in the channel was really well going into the year, so some of this is restocking. But we're also seeing some good sell-through from distribution out to the field, so we have not seen much pricing pressure this year at Carrier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Greg, could you talk about cash a little bit and where you're going? Could you kind of touch base on your line of sight to funding Goodrich? How do you feel today versus earlier in the year?","Gregory J. Hayes","We feel really good, Howard. I think we've got line of sight to -- on the financing. We're looking at rates today and the 10-year treasury less than 2 looks pretty attractive. And I think the financing plan that we've laid out, we're not going to have any trouble in the marketplace, absent some big macro event. But that's why you have the bridge in place just in case. But I think we feel really good about the ability to place the debt and the rating, which we're going to be able to place that debt, so I feel very good. Cash in the quarter was strong. If you think about -- we have these couple of noncash gains. You need take those out, we're over 120% of free cash flow of net income. So the business continues to generate solid cash. Without share buyback, of course, the business' funding is really pretty robust. So I don't see any issue at all going to market here in the second quarter ahead of the deal to replace all this debt.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So have you brought the cash back from Europe yet or wherever to fund part of transaction, or is that TBD?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think all the cash movement will happen this part of the deal or towards the end of the years we'll use some of the international cash obviously from the IAE transactions as well, which is also scheduled to close mid-year. But a lot of moving pieces and you'll see us in the debt markets here shortly, well, at least, probably a few 3, 4 weeks ahead of whenever we think Goodrich is going to close. So I think that's all good news, and international cash flow, we'll access what we need to throughout the back half of the year.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then the other item, as I recall on the March 13 Analyst Day, Mr. Pino addressed the Canadian helicopter item as just a small software glitch and yet, we're still not seeing deliveries of that helicopter. Could you bring us up to date on where you are with that program, please?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, so the CMH, I think we're going to deliver 5 helicopters this year. We've got a couple of the interim configuration to deliver yet and then we'll actually have final configuration helicopters towards the end of the year. Of course, we'll deliver the bulk of those helicopters next year. The plan was always to deliver these things in the second half of the year. I think one may have slipped from June to July, but I think we're still on track on the interim version. And then the final version, the final software configuration version, we're still working that to get those out before the end of the year to meet the contractual commitment to the customers. So again we're on track. We're working with the customer all the time. The helicopter continues to perform well. It's a great helicopter. We have flight testing. No issues with the air frame. This really is just about the mission equipment, as Jeff talked about.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just following on that, I mean, as you talked about readjusting the portfolio, in some cases you'll sell things like Rocketdyne, but then you're investing money in Eclipse. Can you sort of explain how you're making some of these portfolio decisions?","Gregory J. Hayes","Can I make it very clear, we're not investing any more money in Eclipse. We bought -- we did make a small investment, less than $25 million in Eclipse really to service the aftermarket of the aircraft. I think there's about 300 of those airplanes that have been delivered. But we are not in the light jet business if you will. We're in the aftermarket business supporting the planes that are out there. But we're not in the manufacturing business for light jets. So again I think if that's -- we haven't made that clear before?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You made it crystal. It's crystal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You talked about the additional restructuring and onetime items. You mentioned Q2 that they're going to line up. Can you just talk about how those progressed through the year, if there's any other mismatches?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, what's really happened, that $0.21 of net good news that we saw in the first quarter, that will play out in the third and fourth quarter. A big chunk of that actually is going to be third quarter as we start to accrue some of the restructuring related to the Goodrich acquisition and the remainder will be in the fourth quarter. I can't give you an exact number today quarter-to-quarter -- third quarter versus fourth quarter, but as we get towards the end of the second quarter and we get to the close of Goodrich and we know exactly what the restructuring dollars are, we'll lay all that out for everybody.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then on CCS you talked about the container move in the Europe. Has there been any improvement from this point forward just because I think that was the number for the year was about down 10% for container. Should we see growth in future quarters now?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think, again, the compares will get easier as we go throughout the year on containers, so we should see a little bit of improvement. I think, what, we were down low single digits, I guess, in terms of actual shipments in the quarter but down mid-teens in terms of the orders. So, again, we should see a little bit of an improvement as we go throughout the year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, and then just on the Pratt aftermarket, how much of that 5% growth is from the IAE joint venture versus the organic side of the business?","Unknown Executive","That's actually -- that's all organic. That does not include the IAE transaction.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","I wanted to ask Coney had orders up 27% in the quarter versus you're down 10%. Greg, do you think that's all due to the mix issue you talked about in China, or is something else going on or haven't you looked at the numbers yet?","Gregory J. Hayes","I just -- as we were coming down this morning I saw the Coney report come across the board. I haven't really had a chance to study or talk to the folks about it at Otis, but I think it's really -- it's to all those issues that we talked about with China in terms of the pricing, the mix that we saw over there. So I think again, we obviously lost a little bit of share. I think Coney had a pretty good quarter it looks like from an order perspective in China.","George Shapiro","Okay, and then just the book-to-bill at Hamilton and Pratt, I know you gave the spares in orders, but without knowing the exact numbers how were the book-to-bill numbers in the quarter?","Unknown Executive","Yes, at Pratt it was about 1.","George Shapiro","And Hamilton?","Unknown Executive","And Hamilton was slightly below 1.","Gregory J. Hayes","It was a little over 1 -- less than 1.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On Pratt and Hamilton, can you say what the spares did if you go sequentially from Q4?","Gregory J. Hayes","I don't know if -- give us just a second. I think we can probably figure that out. So sequentially, spares sales were down mid-single-digits at Pratt, down about 5% sequentially. And sequentially I don't know that I have the -- I don't have the Hamilton numbers, so we can get back to you on that.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. Then if you just pull up, you said at the beginning that the results for the quarter were better than a little better than you had expected but there's a lot going on here. If you were to pull out the 2 or 3 things that you thought were clearly better for the quarter when you look at the whole year and the 2 or 3 that you would say did not come out as well, how -- what would you highlight?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think the things that you'd highlight naturally, of course, CCS. I think the res business there was better than what we had expected. I think the Hamilton business also, again, a little better than what we had expected, really a strong start to the year, so really solid organic revenue growth and good conversion with 15% profit growth. So I think those were both pleasant surprises. I'd also tell you even in CCS, the traction that we're getting on the restructuring there in the consolidation of the F&S business continue to pay dividends. So margins were strong, in CCS, I think you're going to continue to see that throughout the year. Yes, on the downside, there's just a lot of stuff going on. Obviously, China was a bit of a surprise although it was really -- we've talked about it back in March we knew it's going to be soft in China. Sikorsky, a little bit weaker than we expected, but again that's just timing. I think they missed 5 helicopters at the very end of the quarter due to a small supplier quality issue. Those helicopters have all shipped, so not really any bad news at Sikorsky and I think at Pratt, things continue on track. We're -- development engineering is up but it's up in line with expectations. We continue to make good progress there so, this is very atypical for UTC given all of the moving pieces here. We've got acquisitions. We've got divestitures. We've got markets that are a little bit choppy. But I think long-term, we're doing the right things from a portfolio standpoint, aligning the portfolio with where we want to be with the growth markets, and it's going to be a tough year this year but I think it will be a solid year. We're going to be able to deliver on the commitments.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then lastly, when you look at China in both from an Otis standpoint and from a Carrier standpoint, and you see shifts in expectations for commercial construction growth there, how do you approach that? In other words, what changes do you make to those businesses operationally when you're looking at different types of outlooks?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, that's a great question. In fact one of the things that we've done in China is actually realign the geographies from a leadership standpoint. China, as part of Otis, used to be part of the North Asian operation under Charles Vaux [ph]. Charles is retired, and then we've brought in Thomas Vining to take over China as a stand-alone region. And the recent we've done that is because the aftermarket opportunity remains the single biggest opportunity across the Otis business for future profit growth. It's only 7% of the business in China today. We think within a few years, it's going to get back up towards a more normal 50%-50% kind of business. A few years might be 10 years, but really the focus is going to be on growing the aftermarket when you see moderating growth as we see today on the commercial construction side. So long-term focus there is to grow the aftermarket. I think Pedro talked about that in March, and you're going to hear us continue to talk about that in the coming months in orders as the real focus of the business is to grow the aftermarket. Quite frankly, that's where the beauty of Otis is, is in that 1.8 million elevators and service around the world every day. It's that annuity. It's a wonderful thing, and we need to grow it in China.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But it sounds like what you're saying is that when you see quarterly or 6-month changes in outlooks for China, that doesn't cause you to react very much in terms of your China strategy and your operational approach.","Gregory J. Hayes","No I think, again, the focus is still going to continue to be on China. And we continue to do the right things for the long term. As I said, we're opening up this new factory in Chongqing with a low-cost Gen2 elevator, and we continue to make investments in China, and China's going to be a growth market for years to come. The urbanization trends that -- they aren't in a onetime thing and again, we've seen this thing play out before where you see quarter-to-quarter you'll see ups and downs in China. But a couple of quarters of China being down doesn't dissuade us from the opportunity that's there.","Operator","Our final question comes from Deane Dray from Citigroup.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know we touched on this on Carrier residential, but the idea here is that you've got this big surge of orders the last 2 weeks of March and a number of OEs have reported seeing the exact same thing. So it's really important if we could some color regarding how that transitioned into April, because that way we get a better sanction about is this real demand coming back, or these dealer incentives? But any color regarding the demand you've seen so far in April would be helpful.","Gregory J. Hayes","I can't -- I'm not going to give you weekly order trends. I know you look at this every week, but I would tell you the season is up to very good start and the strength that we saw at the end of March has continued into April a little bit slower rate than, March but still pretty strong as we move into April here.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you run any risk of components shortages, because if you do get that perfect storm and you do get a resurgence in demand, supplies inventories are really lean here, including compressors. Is there an issue where you might get some inventory stockouts or is that -- you don't expect that is a scenario?","Gregory J. Hayes","In fact, I asked Geraud that same question a week ago as we saw this surge in orders. It's a short cycle business, and we see this all the time. But I know that Geraud and the Carrier folks have been working with all the suppliers. I know that they've been working with Emerson to make sure there's adequate supplier compressors, and we have not seen any shortages so far, although, again, we're -- something to keep an eye on as these trends continue. Again, we've got the capacity in our factories to do -- to ramp up pretty quickly and I believe also the supply base does as well.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then the last one is within the resi orders that you received, has it been skewed towards the lower price point entry level, 13s here, or has there been any step up in terms of the higher price points?","Gregory J. Hayes","I haven't really seen any skew. I think, again, last year, we saw a big -- last couple of years, we've seen kind of down and dirty where everything is entry level, SEER 13. Orders look to be pretty good in the quarters. We got a little bit better news there, including some of the, I think, the R228s, the shipments were kind of in line with the market still. So yes, that don't see any big macro change there in terms of the buying patterns. ","Thank you so much. All right, everyone, thanks. So to start the year is a little bit better than we expected. We're confident of our full year outlook. Of course, we're positioning the company for earnings growth both this year and beyond as we continue our focus on cost reduction and the transformational changes to the portfolio, as well as the continued investments in these game-changing technologies. Thanks for listening today. We look forward to seeing you throughout the remainder of the year. Maria [ph] and team will be available for calls throughout the day, so thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue if time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","All right, thanks Kevin, and good morning everyone. As you guys all saw on the press release, we had a really good start to the year. Our reported EPS adjusted was $1.91 and that\u2019s up 8% versus the prior year, and even above our expectations for the quarter. And that was driven primarily by better-than-expected segment operating profit results. As you saw on the press release, sales were up 20% with organic growth of 8%, and that was driven by double-digit growth at the aerospace businesses. Free cash flow, a really good start to the year at $1.1 billion.","Let me quote a couple of notable highlights. At Pratt &Whitney, the GTF Engine reached 2 million revenue flight hours with 36 operators now benefiting from lower fuel burn emissions and noise. At Otis, the Otis team completed the largest modernization project to date in China for one of the country\u2019s most iconic landmarks. You guys will all recognize, of course, the Shanghai Pearl Tower. Additionally, United Technologies launched a hybrid electric propulsion technology demonstrator program. This demonstrator program is expected to yield an average fuel savings for regional sized aircraft of 30%, and we\u2019re targeting first flight within three years. Importantly, this project combines the engineering expertise and experience of the Collins Aerospace team, Pratt &Whitney, and our own research center.","We, of course, also remain laser focused on the integration of Rockwell Collins . In the first quarter, we saw $0.20 of accretion from the Rockwell Collins acquisition, really solid performance across each of their legacy businesses. This, of course, exceeded even our expectations. Having worked as a combined team for a full quarter, I'm even more confident in the long-term value the acquisition is going to bring to our share owners and our employees. From avionics to interiors to the mission systems business, we\u2019ve a great future ahead of us at Collins Aerospace.","Maybe just to step aside for a second and talk about the Mission Systems business. We talked about commercial aerospace as the growth vehicle. But I think it\u2019s also important, the aerospace business, 25% of our revenues has actually come from defense. And our Missions Systems business, which is focused on our global military markets, we\u2019re bringing together our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance business and space capabilities with the communication and navigation expertise of Rockwell. We see the opportunity to enable faster tactical decision making and greater mission assurance while at the same time, reducing risk to personnel and high value platforms. This is a capability that is unique to United Technologies and to Collins, and I think it's something again as we go forward, and we'll be talking more about.","On the Synergies front, Collins Aerospace team is on track to deliver approximately $150 million of cost synergies this year, and we still see at least $500 million of total cost synergy potential. We\u2019re also excited about the revenue synergies that the combination is going to enable. In short, we\u2019re happy with the execution at Collins thus far and expect continued strong performance as we progress through the year.","So based on the very solid first quarter, we\u2019re going to raise the mid-point of our full-year adjusted EPS outlook by $0.05. We\u2019re going to raise the lower end of the guidance from $7.70 to $7.80 to $8. We also remain confident in our ability to deliver on 3% to 5% organic sales growth and free cash flow of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. And that $4.5 billion to $5 billion includes about $1.5 billion estimate for the one-time portfolio separation costs this year.","With that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you through the results, and then I\u2019ll come back at the end to wrap up and take your questions. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thank you, Greg. So I'm on Slide 2. Reported sales for the quarter of $18.4 billion were up 20% with 8% organic growth and 15 points from the Rockwell Collins acquisition. Foreign exchange was 3-point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.91, up $0.14 or 8% versus prior year. This was clearly better than our expectations for the quarter, primarily from performance at Collins Aerospace and Otis.","At Collins Aerospace, we saw higher commercial aftermarket and synergies. Given the solid start, as you would be, we are very confident that this segment will be able to deliver on its full-year operating profit commitment and that is even with the potential for up to $0.10 of headwind related to the Boeing 737 Max program. At Otis, we saw slightly better global service performance, particularly higher repair sales and better productivity. The Europe maintenance business that we have all been very focused on and keep talking about saw its first quarter of margin dollar growth since 2012.","Below the segment line, the quarter benefited by $0.04 versus our expectations, primarily from a lower than anticipated effective tax rate, and that was largely due to the completion of a tax audit at legacy BE Aerospace. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%.","On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.56, down 4% versus prior year and included $0.25 of non-recurring charges. These charges included $0.16 for the final quarter of amortization of Rockwell Collins inventory step up, as well as $0.06 for costs related to the UTC portfolio separation activities. Restructuring was an additional $0.10 charge in the quarter. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion in Q1, significantly higher than last year and a solid start as Greg noted. This improvement was largely from better working capital performance, especially receivables management.","Turning to Slide 3, you see the drivers of our strong organic growth in Q1. Overall, we continue to see good performance across our two end markets. At our commercial businesses, in the Americas, sales were up 9% with solid growth at both Otis and Carrier. New residential construction indicators continue to be positive and construction spending remains strong. Residential and housing starts, however, are now forecast to be down slightly in 2019 versus Carrier's assumption of low-single-digit growth at the beginning of the year. While we still believe mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC sales is likely for the full year, we will continue to monitor the market and adjust our cost base as needed as we move through the year.","Within EMEA, sales were flat in the quarter. Europe was up low single-digit at Otis and flat at Carrier. Economic outlook across Europe remains mixed and slightly weaker than the expectations from a few months ago. Orders at Carrier were up low-single digits and flat at Otis. The Middle East remains a pressure point at both businesses. In Asia, sales were up 4% with 11% growth at Otis, partially offset by mid-single-digit declines at Carrier. Outlook for China feels incrementally better, particularly for Otis where we continue to see price stabilization in new equipment orders.","On the Aerospace side, Pratt's commercial OEM sales were up 35%, driven by GTF shipments, which more than doubled versus the first quarter of 2018, granted somewhat of an easy compare. At Collins Aerospace, commercial OEM sales were up 13% organically, also driven by ramping new programs.","Looking at commercial aftermarket, we continue to see high traffic demand and strong utilization of in-service products at both businesses. Sales were up 4% organically, driven by 9% growth at Collins Aerospace. Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales were up 1%. This lower than expected aftermarket sales at Pratt was partially driven by engine re-inspection requirements at two V2500 MRO providers. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect available capacity in the overall MRO network to mitigate the impact from these temporary delays. For the full year, Pratt continues to expect commercial aftermarket sales to be up mid-single-digits. Organically, military sales were up 16% at Pratt & Whitney, driven by higher F135 production. At Collins Aerospace, military sales were up 8%, driven by ramping programs and strong aftermarket demand.","With that, let me turn it over to Carroll to take us through the business unit details. Carroll?","Carroll Lane","Okay. Thanks Akhil. I'm on Slide 4, and I'll be speaking of the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there\u2019s an Appendix on Slide 12 with additional segment data you can use as a reference. Okay starting with Otis, Otis sales were $3.1 billion in the quarter, up 7% organically. On a constant currency basis, new equipment sales grew 10%, driven by high-teens growth in China and double-digit growth in the Americas. Otis also saw mid-single-digit growth in Europe and the rest of Asia combined.","Service sales were up 4% with solid growth in maintenance, including repair and modernization. New equipment orders were down slightly in the quarter. Orders in North America were down mid-teens. On a 12 month rolling basis, North America orders are up 8%. The activity level in North America remains healthy, though we have seen some increasing margin pressure in recent order activity. Orders grew low double-digits and Asia, excluding China and were flat in Europe. In China, orders were up 8% in value, benefiting from pricing and mix with unit orders up slightly. And this continues the trend of stabilization and pricing on new equipment orders in China.","Operating profit in the quarter was flat at constant currency, excluding headwind from transactional mark-to-market currency adjustments, which benefited Q1 of 2018. Operating profit grew 6%, driven primarily by strong volume growth. Foreign exchange translation was a 5 point headwind to sales and earnings. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Otis operating profit growth of $25 million to $75 million at constant currency.","Turning to Slide 5, Carrier sales were up 3% organically, led by refrigeration and global HVAC. Refrigeration was up 9% with North America truck trailer up more than 30%. Global HVAC was up 3% with North America residential HVAC up 5%, including the benefit of accelerated gas furnace sales driven by upcoming changes and fan efficiency ratings. The commercial HVAC business was up low single-digits with growth in North America and Asia, offsetting declines in Europe and the Middle East. Fire and Security was flat.","Carrier equipment orders contracted 2% organically in the quarter. Transport refrigeration orders were down 26% after growing 37% in Q1 of 2018. The combined backlog for the container in North America truck trailer businesses has grown more than 90% in the past year. Approximately offsetting transport refrigeration declines, global HVAC equipment orders were up 3% with North America residential orders up high single-digits, including demand stimulated by the upcoming efficiency rating changes. Fire and Security product orders were up 5%, driven by EMEA and Asia demand.","At constant currency, operating profit contracted 5%, including a 2 point impact from the divestiture of Taylor. Organic volume growth and pricing contributions were more than offset by input costs, including commodities, tariffs and logistics expenses. Looking ahead, we expect the decline in first half carrier earnings to be more than offset by growth in the second half of the year. That will be driven by continued organic growth, aggressive cost reduction and easier year-over-year compares on commodity, tariff, logistics expenses and foreign exchange. So as a result, we continue to expect Carrier full year organic sales to be up low to mid-single-digits with earnings growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX.","Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 6, sales of $4.8 billion were up 12% organically. Commercial OEM sales were up 35%, driven by GTF and Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments, which more than offset anticipated declines in V2500 production. Total Geared Turbofan shipments, including those at the spare engine pool more than doubled over the prior year first quarter. Commercial aftermarket was up 1% in the quarter. Growth in the GTF aftermarket was more than offset by the V2500 MRO impact that Akhil mentioned earlier. Pratt & Whitney Canada aftermarket saw growth, resulting from higher volume and favorable mix.","The ramping Joint Strike Fighter program continues to drive growth across military business. Military sales were up 16% on higher F135 production. During the quarter, the U.S. Navy and United Kingdom achieved initial operational capability with the F-35C and the F-35B respectively, marking the latest milestones in this rapidly growing program.","Adjusted operating profit of $447 million was up 8%. Drop through from higher military sales and continued GTF cost reduction more than offset the negative margin impact of higher GTF shipments and higher E&D. Commercial aftermarket operating profit was up, largely due to better mix and higher content. Results also reflect a gain from the divestiture and a licensing agreement and those items benefited results by approximately $30 million. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney to grow full year operating profit by $200 million to $250 million.","Okay, turning to Slide 7. Collins Aerospace results include Legacy Aerospace Systems and a full quarter of legacy Rockwell Collins. The sales in the quarter were $6.5 billion, that's up $2.7 billion. Operating profit of $1.1 billion was up $486 million from the prior year. On a pro forma basis, including results for Rockwell Collins in the first quarter of 2018, Collins aerospace delivered operating profit growth of 13% on 10% higher sales.","Organic sales for the Legacy Aerospace Systems business were up 10% with growth in all three channels. Commercial OEM sales were up 13%, commercial aftermarket sales grew 9% and military sales were up 8%. When viewed in a pro forma basis, you see the strength across the combined businesses. Commercial OEM sales were up low double-digits, driven by new production programs. Commercial aftermarket sales were also up low double-digits, fueled by strong demand for modifications and upgrades, as well as continued passenger traffic growth.","Military sales were up high single digits, driven by higher at F35 volume and an overall strong order book. And we saw solid performance in the legacy Rockwell Collins mission systems business, which was up low teens in sales. Operating profit growth was driven by solid contribution from the Rockwell Collins business drop through on higher organic sales and synergy benefits. Rockwell Collins acquisition contributed better-than-expected profit in the quarter. And as a result of strong sales volume and the cost synergy capture that Akhil referenced earlier, accretion to UTC earnings in the quarter was $0.20. So given the strong start in Q1 and with potential 737 Max impact in mind, we continue to expect Collins' operating profit to be up $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion for the full year.","And with that, I will hand it back over to Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks Carroll. So, I guess we don\u2019t need to say it again, but I will. Good quarter and a really solid start to the year. I'd also say that we are really confident in this revised EPS guidance. And the reason we're confident is because each of the businesses we still expect to grow, both the top and bottom line in 2019. And more importantly, I think each business is supported by solid long-term fundamentals. Also important to note is we remain focused on the four main priorities of UTC, that\u2019s around execution, innovation, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation.","So I know many of you are interested in where we stand with portfolio separation activities. No real change to report except that today we have more than 500 people across the full range functions, focused on preparing Otis and Carrier to operate as standalone companies. We continue to expect both businesses to be operationally ready for separation by the end of 2019. And there\u2019s no change to our expectations that the spin should be completed in the first half of the next year, and we\u2019re excited about the future of each of those businesses.","We\u2019ll stop there and we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Kevin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. ","Carter Copeland","Just a couple of quick ones, one the $0.10 that you called out Akhil, it just seems like a big number for just an OEM impact, so I'm assuming you got some aftermarket assumption buried in there. Can you give us a little more color on what you assumed in that $0.10 sensitivity around 737 Max?","Akhil Johri","Sure Careter. So that\u2019s kind of an outer limit at this point that we are putting, up to $0.10 is what I said, and that\u2019s a combination of three things. One is obviously the profit that we make on the OEM side. We also feel that we will lose some provisioning, which is higher profit on the 737 Max as some of the operators get pushed out a little bit. And then on the other side, we\u2019ve also taken into offsetting that to some extent the benefit we might see on higher aftermarket in some of the legacy programs. So, it\u2019s a combination of those three things. You\u2019d imagine for competitive reasons I don\u2019t think we want to go into the specifics of each of those line items, but it\u2019s those three things. And that\u2019s sort of an assumption that the rate stays at 42 through the end of the year, that would be the up to $0.10. Hopefully, it can be less than that, but that\u2019s what the $0.10 is made up of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just following up on the free cash flow. Working capital headwinds halved year-on-year. Just wondered if there was anything sort of particularly timing related, or whether you thought that type of improvement is something that we could see over the balance of the year? And also may be tied to that any updated expectations around the free cash flow guide for Collins, in particular for the year, and what was the EBIT from Collins in Q1?","Akhil Johri","Very solid Collins performance, both across EBIT and across the cash flow side, Julian. I would say a lot of the improvement you saw in the first quarter, working capital outflow was a lot less than what we saw last year in the first quarter, was driven by improvement on the Aerospace side of the businesses, both Collins and Pratt and that\u2019s largely to do with the receivables management. So, I think I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything hugely abnormal, some of that does get impacted by timing of aircraft deliveries, factoring associated with some of the receivables, et cetera. But I think we still remain very confident that the full year feels very doable. I mean, some of you guys like to do conversion math, which we are trying to stay away from, because the numbers keep changing depending on who we\u2019ve talked to. But based on some calculations, it'd be about 84% conversion, which is one of the strongest first quarters we have had. And if you traditionally -- if you think about the incentive payments that get made in first quarter, actually the conversion in first quarter would be over 100% adjusting for the large outflow in cash from all the incentive payments that happened. So, we feel very good where things are and Rockwell Collins certainly a huge contributor.","Greg Hayes","Julian, the only other thing I would add to that is I think if you look at inventory turnover, for the last few years, we have seen Pratt adding a lot of inventory as it prepared for the ramp up. The fact is we actually saw the inventory turns at Pratt improve almost 100 basis points or over 4 points today, and Collins has also seen some improvement. So the big ramp in aerospace, while it's not over, I think the inventory build is over. So that gives us a lot of confidence, not just in this year's cash flow growth, but in the next couple of years that we've got our arms around this and in turn it should continue to improve.","Julian Mitchell","And just tied to that may be, apologies if I missed it, but did you point out the Collins' profit contribution year-on-year?","Akhil Johri","It's effectively you think about it as -- because the businesses are getting integrated, the numbers that Carroll quoted are probably the better way to think about it. You have had profit growth at both Collins and UTAS, but Collins growth was stronger than the growth in the UTAS numbers. I don't think -- we're trying to integrate the businesses, so Mission Systems that Greg referred to earlier includes the traditional ISR business from -- the Goodrich business, the UTAS business, similarly the avionics business that Rockwell Collins has also included some businesses that were traditionally the sensors business from UTAS. So I think it's becoming difficult to pry open the numbers, we make-up numbers for the sake of making up numbers in terms of the difference between Collins versus heritage UTAS. The bottom line is that the heritage Rockwell Collins businesses did extremely well and lot better actually than the heritage UTAS business in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ron Epstein","Maybe two questions, one on the commercial side of the business, we saw Otis margins kind of at a level we really haven't seen in a long term if ever. Is that the bottom of Otis margins? I mean, how should we think about that?","Greg Hayes","Just think about it this way. The margins are down 110 basis points, 90 of that was the FX that Carroll called out that one-time benefit that we had last year didn't repeat this year. So, yes, I would say that that should be the bottom of the margins. And as you think about Otis growing earnings throughout the course of the year margins should be improving as well.","Akhil Johri","One other thing, Ron, I think this is the second quarter not in a row we're adjusting for some of this FX noise, et cetera actually Otis grew profits operationally when we adjust out for the one timers, FX and other things. So I think it's a good sign. We feel really good Otis as we said pleasantly surprised us in the quarter. It was better than what we were expecting coming into the quarter. And the productivity improvements on the service side and the high repair sales growth were truly things, which are encouraging as we look forward on top of the improvement in the price mix that Carroll talked about in the China and equipment orders, so things getting better for Otis.","Ron Epstein","And then one aerospace question, if I may. If A220 Neo, specifically the A221 were to get a little more share. What would be the bottlenecks for you guys to increase production even more on the GTF? I mean the competitor engine, as we know there's some controversy going on right now with their blade, 737 itself actually grounded. So if the A320 were to pick up a little share may or may not happen. How much of a challenge would there be for you guys to get production even higher?","Greg Hayes","There\u2019s two big bottlenecks I would say in terms of ramping up production, and this is the problem that is not new. One is on the casting side. And just trying to get additional capacity into supply chain on the casting front is the very, very difficult. The second place is our own forging capacity down in Georgia. We just added a fifth line down there, it\u2019s coming online. This quarter, it\u2019s starting to meet production ramp. But frankly as we look forward that line is -- or that fifth press is almost fully utilized in terms of the volume we see today. So there are a couple of constraints out there that require I would say a lot of CapEx and probably a couple of years. In the meantime, I think we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to meet the customer requirements this year and next year with the capacity that we've added. Additional capacity, it\u2019s just tough.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","The change in guidance from a profit perspective, I didn\u2019t hear much of a change for any of the segments. Is it just bumping some of them to the high end of the range? Just wanted to understand better why you\u2019re clipping off a little and it seems all the segments are basically like we asked?","Akhil Johri","So as we think about it, we would probably have been looking at and we debated this at taking up the Collins guidance given the solid start that they\u2019ve had, Collins Aerospace, in total. But the uncertainty associated with Max 737 keeps us a little tempered at this point. We\u2019ll have to see how things progress, the next quarter maybe another opportunity to look at that again. So I would say if I was to be a gambling person, which I'm not, I would -- probably Collins would be towards the higher end of the range even with some constraints that they have.","On the other hand, you have a little bit of challenge on the carrier side. I think they've had, again, not a surprise to us, internally very consistent with what we were expecting in the quarter. And we know there are several benefits that Carrier will see in the second half compared to the first half. Taylor FX being two of those, Taylor and FX were like $50 million headwind in the first half year-over-year, which goes away in the second half, compares get better and commodities and things like that also in the second half.","So we think Carrier has a great shot. But obviously, when a business starts off the year with down $44 million in the quarter and we have a guidance of $100 million to $150 million for the full year, there\u2019s a little stretch in there. So based on that, I think we feel overall okay about our segments. I think the benefit that you saw at the bottom end was clearly the strong growth we saw in the first quarter, as well as the tax benefit that I referred to earlier is what gave us confidence that we should be able to do better than the bottom end we had before.","Steve Tusa","And then just to get back to the aerospace free cash flow discussion. It sounds to me like you guys have a pretty, I'll call it, heavily burdened currently free cash flow generating profile, sounds like you\u2019re coming off the bottom of that. There\u2019s not much positive that\u2019s currently influencing aviation free cash flow. There has been a pretty good cycle in aftermarket though. Are there any unusual positives flowing through on the aftermarket from a cash perspective? Is there any way that you can pull forward cash by giving things like discounts for spares purchases when demand is high? Is that common practice and is any of that embedded currently in your free cash flow?","Greg Hayes","No Steve. I think with the market is strong as it is today we\u2019re not in the mode of need to discount to bring in these orders. I think if anything cash was a little constrained as you saw Pratt's aftermarket only grew 1% in the first quarter. And that gives us confidence obviously in the back half of the year as we recover those V2500 MRO visits. But there is nothing out there that I would say is usual other than just execution, collecting receivables but more importantly, driving inventory down and driving churns up. And again I think that's just natural as we drive our cost down on the GTF, increasing the velocity through the shops here, increasing the velocity of the inventory turns, all of that is very positive. But there's nothing in the background in terms of discounting or anything else that's going on that would have given us a better than expected first quarter or even full year.","Steve Tusa","So no prepayments from spares helping your cash flow, it doesn\u2019t look that way to me\u2026","Akhil Johri","No. And the reality, Steve, is we've talked about this several times. I think we had been in an investment space. We're coming to a point where GTF is now delivering in terms of what the expected requirements are from the customer base. So the inventory that Greg talked about earlier starts to become more and more manageable. We see improvements on the receivables side as well. So overall, while CapEx still remains high and will remain high for this year, I think as we look forward, not just this year but for next several years, the story on cash particularly on the aviation side should be really good. And that's what our internal focus is to grow profits higher than sales and cash greater than profits.","Steve Tusa","So your cash flow there is soft, is what you're saying?","Akhil Johri","I believe that, absolutely. I mean, of course you have to exclude the one-time costs associated with the project -- with the separation of the portfolio. But other than that base business is really strong and should continue to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on the Collins better accretion, can you may be talk about how much of that was cost synergies and\/or better sales outlook. And if you could give some color on the different businesses, commercial OE for Collins, defense and interiors, just the moving pieces there. Thank you.","Akhil Johri","So roughly, I would say, $0.12 better than what we were expecting in accretion in the quarter. And that's broken up $0.04 of that was that tax benefit that I have been talking about couple of times now that\u2019s the BE Aerospace related stuff. So that was a one-time thing if you could think about. The rest of it was strong performance. Operationally, commercial aftermarket and the heritage Rockwell Collins business was really strong, some of it was driven probably by timing on margin upgrades, which are a little lumpy at times. The synergy benefits were about $50 million in the quarter so clearly, ahead of the run rate that we have been expecting. And then the operational performance across all businesses, whether it's the interior business, whether it's the mission systems business or the avionics business, all of the three businesses did a little bit better than we were expecting at the beginning.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just to the separation process, now there's a tremendous amount of hard work going on in the background. But it feels like you're on autopilot now to your timeline. And just wondering if there was a hurdle that you're looking at? And as part and parcel to that question, we passed the expiration date, so to speak, to consider some of the strategic action around your plans given your desire not to disrupt your timeline?","Greg Hayes","First of all, Jeff, if there is an auto-pilot switch on this thing, I have yet to find it. I would tell you that the team is working pretty hard. I would tell you two big milestones that we\u2019ve talked about there. Out there that drive the whole timeline are the tax filings in Canada and the tax filing here in the U.S. And both of those have been completed now and we\u2019re just waiting for the Canadian revenue authorities and the IRS to come back and give us rulings, that\u2019s a six to nine month process. The good news is that should all happen now given the fact we got them filed should all happen this year, which should allow us to then finish the final restructuring to complete the separation activities.","There is a tremendous amount of work going on to get these two businesses set up. And I would tell you the digital, the IT organization here are trying to create two new standalone IT system architectures that\u2019s a ton of work. Treasury and the tax folks and the controls folks trying to get to forms translate. There\u2019s just a lot of work going on. But I think again it\u2019s all on track. We meet every couple of weeks if not more often to go through the progress. No show-stoppers. So again I think operationally end of the year, we will be in a position to do the spins. The tax, again, tax will drive the ultimate timing, whether that happens in the first quarter or shortly thereafter, I don\u2019t know. But again, it\u2019s all on track to what we expect.","As far as potential transactions, to your point, we laid it out. There were three issues. We needed to get full value, needed to be tax free that needed not to impact the timing of the spin transactions. There remain opportunities, I would say, out there that we think are attractive for the businesses in the long term from an M&A standpoint. I just think it\u2019s unlikely to your point probably, because of timing that will happen now. But those opportunities that exist today will also exist today the day that the businesses get spun off. And I would except that they will pursue those activities just as we have before the spin.","Jeffrey Sprague","And just on separation and the like, so the little or nothing in the first quarter from a cash standpoint?","Akhil Johri","Very small gap, so the $0.06 that I talked about as the accounting cost were a little less than that was on a cash front, so very small in the first quarter.","Jeffrey Sprague","And just could you put a final point on Carrier of your view in the back half. What you\u2019re expecting for price cost to maybe other key variance items that lifted to that OP guide for the year?","Greg Hayes","There\u2019s a couple of things that give us confidence is, as Akhil mentioned, some of the compares obviously get easier, whether it\u2019s FX and some of the input costs that we saw, like logistics costs that were up, they were up big in the first quarter. Those compares get easier in the back half of the year. But I think more importantly, organic growth it will continue a pace, we saw 3%, we continue to expect pretty good growth on the top line. I would also say Bob MacDonald and team have done a pretty good job of identifying cost to take out. And so there\u2019s a program today in place to have a major cost reduction that will probably yield\u2026","Akhil Johri","Yes, $75 million in the next three quarters of restructuring savings, Jeff, compared to say $13 million in the first quarter. So the restructuring benefits go up significantly in the back half.","Greg Hayes","If you think about the guidance with that $75 million, that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident because of the cost action and the cost take out actions. As far as cost price\u2026","Akhil Johri","Yes, price has been actually pretty good in the first quarter as well. We do expect that to improve a little bit as the year goes by. But in the first quarter, Jeff, we saw over $50 million similar to the -- volume adjusted to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So I don't think price is that much of an issue. The point was exactly what the Greg said, which is first quarter this year we had the toughest year-over-year compare on the logistics costs, so price was not enough to offset that year-over-year increase. Those compares start to get a little easier Q2 onwards, specifically in the second half. Second, as Carroll said, we probably don't expect Carrier to grow earnings in the first half for variety of reasons. But the growth in the second half based on the things that we just talked about feels doable.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Doug Harned","I wanted to continue on in how the transition takes place. So as you look at the next 12 months and with Otis and Carrier moving out, how do you envision the process to establish the management teams and the boards for those companies? And in that transition period, ensure that no one takes their eye off the ball to get the performance you want?","Greg Hayes","I think the operational targets here for this year is absolutely critical to the stories of both Otis and Carrier, going forward. And I think I have mentioned this before, we have changed our compensation system here so that all the Otis folks are going to get their compensation based upon Otis performance and the Carrier folks based upon Carrier performance. SO we think we've incentivized the folks to be focused on this. In terms of process timing, we expect we'll name the management teams here sometime in the second quarter before the end of the second quarter, I would say. The Board of Directors, that process is ongoing and we'll probably have those done by the third quarter. Such as by the beginning of the fourth quarter, we'll have fully constituted Board of Directors and management teams for both companies that will allow us to prepare for the actual separation.","Obviously, there's Form 10s to fill out and all that, and there will be road shows that have to be done. But I think that\u2019s all -- there is a timeline established for all of those activities and we feel confident we'll hit all of these targets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","It was also nice to hear Akhil say he is not a gambling person, so that's very reassuring.","Akhil Johri","Thank you, Deane. My wife appreciate that as well.","Deane Dray","Can we get some more color on the resi assumption at Carrier, lowering from modest growth to modest decline? And then part of your answer, can you give us a sense of where the inventory is in the channel as you build for the cooling season?","Akhil Johri","So first to clarify, the modest decline part was only with one of the assumptions being which was the housing starts assumption, that's not what we believe our business will do. We still believe our business will be up mid-single digit. As you know for the residential business, while housing starts and new construction is significant part, it's about 30% of the total volume, 70% of the volume still comes replacement cycle. And we think that cycle is still pretty robust and solid. Consumer still remains strong. We did see some weakness, as Greg mentioned earlier in the quarter at a conference.","We saw a slow start in January and that had to do with inventory in the channels from some high shipments that we saw last year in fourth quarter. Residential was up 14% fourth quarter. And so there was more inventory in the channel. There which took a little time to correct itself, the orders through the quarter have been improving. The first couple of weeks this quarter had also been decent. So we do believe, just to make clear that our full year outlook is still mid-single digit growth in the residential HVAC business. No change to that. It\u2019s the housing starts dynamic, which we believe is now a little weaker than it was coming in.","Deane Dray","But just any specifics regarding how much inventories in the channel versus a year ago on the setup for the cooling season?","Akhil Johri","So I think we should break it up into two, the reference that Carroll made about the pre-buy associated with the fan appreciation regulations, that impacts the furnace part of the equation. And there we do see inventory in the channel significantly higher than what it was last year, and partly to do with this pre-buy. But on the splits, which is what is the more relevant segment as the cooling season comes through, the inventory in the channel is not out of line with what we saw last year. So we feel good about the split side of the business. On the furnaces driven by this pre-buy, there\u2019s some extra inventory right now, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. ","Jon Raviv","Greg, what are you seeing -- I'm curious about your military comments. What are you seeing in the military market driving you to talk more about mission systems going forward? There's some of you out there that military growth has to slow at some point, but that\u2019s not really apparent in the results or in the way that folks like yourselves are talking about these markets. So if you could just add a little color there that would be much appreciated.","Greg Hayes","As we look at all of the military platforms that we\u2019re on, JSF obviously we see production ramping there. But we also continue to see very strong growth in the ISR business the space business, and some of the other businesses that we don\u2019t often talk about. And again, this is what Rockwell Collins brought to UTC that gave us real heft in the military communication side, some of the optics and satellites that work very well with our ISR business. And so if you look at those businesses, both Pratt because of the JSF in the aftermarket and at Collins, really, really strong quarters, and this is 25% of our business going forward on the aerospace side.","So we just thought it was important as you think about we\u2019re not just a commercial aerospace company, we\u2019re an A&D company. And I think we shouldn\u2019t forget as we have a very, very solid position on the defense systems side. Again, defense spending goes up and down. We know that as it peaked I'm not sure. But we can certainly see the programs that we\u2019re have a lot of runway, both on the ISR side, on the communication side, as well as the ramp on the JSF.","Akhil Johri","Jon, as you know, the defense is a broad based moniker to you that people use often. The secret is being on the right platform. So if you\u2019re in the high growth areas of the defense spend then you tend to do well. And fortunately, we have a platform which seems to be positioned well in those high growth areas of the defense budgets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. ","Rajeev Lalwani","I have a question on the GTF side. As the program starts to mature, do you think there is an opportunity to may be improve on the billion-dollar or so OE loss that you've talked about? Your partner in MTU has highlighted breakeven OE economics at some point next decade from less discounts and automation benefits. Is that something you can do? And then a clarification for Akhil. You've talked about the opportunities on Pratt around working capital and CapEx. Have you quantified that or can you quantify what that could be?","Greg Hayes","Let me start on the GTF, and I'll let Akhil answer the harder question. As far as the GTF cost profile, we continue on this learning curve, which is about 87%. Production this year is going to be probably overall cost per engine down around 15% after being down roughly 15% in each of the last couple of years. So, we continue to take cost out. To you point, it's all about the discount level that around the engines. And obviously we're still working through the backlog of initial orders for these engines, which have higher discount.","When we get to breakeven, I don't see that even the V2500, which we've built for 30 years was still a negative margin business going out the door at the end of its production run. So we'll get better costs continue to come down. And we're on the right trajectory but getting to breakeven is hard. What I would say in terms of negative engine margin, in total, that's a peak last year. It won't go up any higher than that again just because we're continuing to drive cost down even as production goes up.","Akhil Johri","And Rajiv on the working capital side the cash flow opportunity on the aviation businesses, I think even if we don't have a specific target that we have laid out, but here is we why I feel good about things. Previous investment cycle or pre the GTF, Pratt and Collins, or UTAS at that time, inventory turns were in the five to six turns range. We went down to as low as three points some inventory turns for both businesses. That number is now above four as Greg said and we think there is opportunity to get another point to two points of improvement on the inventory turns. That\u2019s clearly the biggest opportunity we have over the long-term.","The second aspect is CapEx. We are continuing to invest significantly on the aero side for the last few years. It was to do with putting up additional capacity on the OE production levels. And now it's transitioning more to make sure we have adequate MRO capacity. So the CapEx continue to be high. But it will come down, because over the long-term, no business operates at a 170% of depreciation for too long and that's what where we are. And I fully expect that to go down to 120%, 130% level overtime that would free up $200 million to $300 million of additional cash. So we think good opportunity on cash. And our simple message inside the business is to make sure profits grow higher than sales and cash goes higher than profit. If you keep doing that, that's good for us and for the shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Moving to North American commercial markets, Carroll I think you mentioned some price pressure in Otis new equipment orders. And one of your competitor talked about some weakness or pause to be more accurate on light commercial side during 1Q. So maybe just -- if you could just maybe unpack what you saw in 1Q in a bit more detail and how you see that playing out over the remainder of the year?","Carroll Lane","Overall, we feel really good about North America, Nigel. And you look at the orders on a rolling 12 months basis, they\u2019re obviously up. It is very healthy environment. We are seeing a little bit more pressure on the margins, so just to think about the revenue per unit coming into the backlog that\u2019s coming in today. But when we look ahead, we think we've got a very good year ahead of us in North America and feel confident about the industry overall.","Akhil Johri","And on the Carrier side, the light commercial market still continues to be pretty robust. We have not seen any reduction in demand there. The award activity at Otis as well, I think as Carroll mentioned earlier, still seems to be pretty good. I worry a little bit about it's been a strong market for five years almost, and you tend to think about it at what point does it start to slow down a little bit. But thus far touchwood, it\u2019s been a great story. And even though quarterly you see orders compare up and down, the activity level, the bidding activity in the market is still pretty strong. The issue that Carroll referred to, to some extent is driven by product mix as well where we have seen demand for a slightly lower featured less -- lower price products, which creates a little pressure in the margin from Otis perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Walton","I know it\u2019s early in the GTF aftermarket lifecycle here, but I'm curious on your power by the hour contracts and your FMP programs. How volatile the EACs are, are they settling into a range that\u2019s in line with your business plan? And are you still on a pathway that 2022 is total breakeven for the program?","Akhil Johri","So the only FMPs on this, Myles, as you\u2019d imagine are not as profitable as some of the later FMPs on the GTFR, its part of the whole equation of how you win certain campaigns early on. So clearly, you\u2019d see some of that flow through our numbers early on. The good news is that we have a very profitable, very strong aftermarket content coming through from the V2500s and a little longer than expected utility out of our PW4000 and 2000 legacy engines as well. So overall, aftermarket feels very good. GTF aftermarket specifically will continue to improve as time goes by, as years goes by. No concerns about EACs on the GTF beyond what we\u2019re expecting already.","Most of the good part about all the negativity that you guys have heard about with some of the teasing issues is that we\u2019ve been able to catch a lot of that early in the cycle. And as a result, we\u2019ve been able to fix things before too many of the engines have been out in the market place. And that\u2019s helped us manage to some extent on the aftermarket profitability going forward. Anything to add, Greg?","Greg Hayes","Miles, I think what you\u2019re referencing is when does the aftermarket cash flows on GTF offset the negative engine losses. And I think that\u2019s the general timeframe plus or minus a year or two. Obviously, the engine gets a vote in terms of its interval, but that\u2019s about right. I\u2019d say as we look at the V2500 aftermarket today and the legacy engine aftermarket today feeling very good about it; the content that we\u2019re seeing on V2500 today very strong; the content on the 4000s very strong. And that\u2019s how even with an aftermarket that only grew by 1% in this quarter, you still saw profit growth coming out of that aftermarket. So we feel very good about the outlook for this year.","There's well north of a thousand -- demand for more than a thousand V2500 visits this year even with the issues on the capacity constraints with those shots that Akhil referenced we\u2019re going to try to get to at least a thousand of those from moving engines around. So no signals on the demand side that anything to be concerned about.","Myles Walton","And then, Akhil, are you at 52 a month across your production system or are you at 42 or is it a real blend there?","Akhil Johri","You're talking about on the 737, right because on the Airbus side, we are at a rate higher than that on the 320. We are still operating at somewhere I would say in between 52 and 42 depending on what the individual components being supplied to Boeing need. So there are certain places where we want to make sure that we continue to produce at a rate, which can help with the restart of the lines, which is going to inevitably happen. And I think -- so it's somewhere between that depending on the specific components you talk about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","Just wanted to cycle back to the Otis margin, just because it sounds like you feel more confident in the medium-term outlook there than you have in quite some time when it's been uncertain and choppy. And Akhil, you mentioned that the Europe service margin dollars grew for the first time in several years. I was wondering if you could give us the numbers on what that did in the order book and also what China new equipment pricing did in the order book since those have been the two hurdles there. And then last quarter you mentioned the potential for that business to be high teens again. Is that something you're starting to be able to see in a specific timeframe in your plan? Or does it remain more of a theoretical just where that business naturally should be over time?","Akhil Johri","So couple of different things here, let's talk about the Europe service business first. The good news there was again we saw dollar growth in service margins at Europe this quarter after several years, as you pointed out. And a lot of that was driven by productivity. So we have talked about this often. Revenue per unit was still flattish on a year-over-year basis in the European service business in the maintenance business. But we saw good news where hours per unit were actually better by 4% in the quarter in Europe, 3% overall for Otis globally but 4% better in Europe. And that was more than the increase in the cost per unit on the rate side. So as a result, they were able to grow the margin dollars in the European business. So that's an encouraging sign. Again, one quarter does not make a trend we would need to watch this for a period of time to make sure that that sustains itself, but very encouraging sign after several years.","In the China side, Carroll mentioned this. The value growth in orders was 8% and the units were up slightly. So as a result, you can see that the mix -- the difference between the value and the units was largely driven this time by price and mix. Pricing was consistent with what we have seen now for five or six quarters where it's up a few points. And again, it's not a very precise calculation but it's directionally correct. The good news we saw this quarter and again, one quarter doesn't make a trend, is that we had greater demand for mid-range and high range products, which come with more features and with slightly high dollars per unit. So that combination helped us to get to the gap of the seven points that you saw in the dollars and -- value of the orders, as well as the unit orders. So overall, things in Otis seem to be trending in the right direction, whether we can get to the mid teens, I'll let the boss answer, or high teens.","Greg Hayes","I think you need to think about the last three years or so in Otis, we have been reinvesting in technology, in automation and in productivity. And I think Judy and team -- we\u2019ve been very clear about that. And we knew that that was going to drag down margins as we made all of these investments. We\u2019ve taken R&D up, we\u2019ve taken increase in spending on service portfolio, all of those things we\u2019re starting to see some tractions, as Akhil said. We're starting to get productivity in the service. I think there\u2019s more productivity to come. We still haven\u2019t rolled out the global service platform yet and that will happen in the next year or so, which again should help on the productivity front.","The Otis strategy is pretty straight forward. We\u2019re trying to sell as many elevators as we can, while at the same time servicing the more efficiently every single year. And it\u2019s that drive to efficiency on the service that\u2019s going to continue to drive margins north, and that\u2019s why we've got confidence. There\u2019s a lot of cost we can still take out on Otis, and Judy and the team are laser focused on how to take those costs out. And I think as you think about next year especially Otis got a lot of runway. We\u2019re starting to see profit growth this year and we\u2019re confident in that. And I think it\u2019s only going to continue higher over the next two or three years as we look at taking structural cost out from the back office, from the factories and from the service side. So I think that high teens. Is it next year? Absolutely not. Is it three year, four years? Probably. And again, that is the Otis story, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited about the prospects of Otis as a standalone business.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that conclude today\u2019s Q&A portion.

We recently received regulatory approvals from United States, the EU, Japan and South Korea. A couple more to go, but we expect the other necessary approvals to follow in the coming weeks, which gives us confidence the transaction will close shortly.","As previously discussed, we plan to use the roughly $6 million of net cash proceeds for additional share buyback and we'll do that in the form of an accelerated share repurchase program. And this will bring our total share repurchases initiated this year to about $10 billion.","As you may have heard us say at a conference back in September, we're going to keep driving the share repurchase agenda as long as we feel that there's a significant discount between the intrinsic value of UTC and the share price. We continue to see that today, of course, that's why our board recently authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program. That includes the $6 billion ASR that we just discussed.","All told, we now expect to make at least $16 billion in share repurchases from 2015 through 2017. When we couple that with our dividend of more than $2 billion a year, our plan will return more than $22 billion to shareowners over the three-year period. And, of course, we continue to work restructuring opportunities with projects focused on long-term cost competitiveness. These actions would allow us to further leverage our global scale and drive long-term value.","To put it simply, we remain focused on what we can control, which means an aggressive cost control and continuing to invest in differentiated products and services that deliver real value for our customers over the long term. So despite the mix of macroeconomic environment that will likely continue into 2016 and perhaps beyond, we're executing on the necessary changes to bring about long-term sustainable earnings growth.","When the Sikorsky sale is complete, the UTC portfolio will be focused on its core businesses, and that is supplying innovative game-changing technologies for the buildings and aerospace systems industries. Going forward, UTC will have a better organic growth profile, along with higher operating margins and a stronger, more predictable cash flow. And defense exposure for UTC goes from 19% to 13% on Sikorsky.","All of this gives us clear line of sight to mid single-digit organic sales growth over the long term and we're confident on this outlook based on the investments we've made, which resulted in an order book roughly 7,000 Geared Turbofan engines at Pratt & Whitney, increased shipset content of a new platform at Aerospace Systems business, and a more focused innovative product portfolio in our Commercial businesses.","Thinking about Buildings and Aerospace portfolios, we're very well positioned. Otis is the best elevator business in the world. And I say that because we've got 1,800 branch offices, we've got 3 million unit installed base and we service over 1.9 million elevators on a daily basis. Climate, Control & Securities is a leading global building systems and services provider and that, of course, combines the world-class brands like Carrier, Kidde, and Chubb, and many others.","And of course, we've doubled down on innovation at CCS over the last five years and it's paying dividends today in a form of a resurgent commercial HVAC business in a more cost-competitive products across the CCS portfolio. And strategically, our Aerospace businesses have never been better positioned. Our Aero backlogs are at their highest levels ever, giving us confidence that Pratt and UTAS can deliver the strong revenue growth goals that they've laid out.","Personally, I've never been more confident in the future of UTC. The long-term outlook remains solid, innovative products, industry-leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth and the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle class. All these things have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future and all of it will create long-term shareowner value.","Please stop there and turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the Q3 results. I'll come back with a few closing comments before we get into Q&A. Akhil, the floor is yours.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Greg.","Moving to slide two, organic sales contracted by a point in the third quarter, driven by Pratt, which was down 8%, as the recent transition to a new material logistics center disrupted Q3 engine deliveries. These turbine issues are now largely behind us, and Pratt expects to recover the majority of this impact in the fourth quarter.","In the Commercial businesses, Asia was down 2%, reflecting the slowing environment in China, which was down high single-digit. Europe sales were flattish in the quarter. On a brighter note, we continue to see growth in the Americas, which was up 7%.","On the Aerospace side, Commercial contracted by 2% and defense sales were down 12%, both mainly driven by the timing of engine deliveries at Pratt & Whitney.","Taking a closer look at our end market trends on slide three and just a reminder, as we always do, we'll talk to the Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. For our Commercial businesses, construction markets in the U.S. remain strong. We continue to see that at Otis where North America new equipment orders in the quarter were up 47%, including a large order for the Hudson Yards project in New York City. North America new equipment orders are up over 20% year to date, and that's on top of 40% growth in 2014. At CCS, America's commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 8% consistent with the first half growth rates. Residential HVAC equipment sales grew 7% in the quarter.","Shifting to EMEA, the overall environment remains mixed and our Commercial business order activity reflects that. While Otis new equipment orders in EMEA were down 9% in the quarter, they were up low single-digit in Western Europe. Orders for the CCS business in EMEA were down slightly.","In Asia, we continue to see the China market weakening. Growth in fixed investments has slowed considerably. Otis new equipment orders in China were down 19% in the quarter after being down 11% in the first half of 2015. At CCS, China orders were down 8% in the third quarter and down 12% year to date, so slightly better in the third quarter. Asia, excluding China, which represents about half of our overall Commercial business in the region, continues to perform well with Otis new equipment orders up over 20% and commercial HVAC orders up low double-digit.","Commercial Aerospace aftermarket remains mixed. Aerospace Systems commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% organically in the quarter with weakness in provisioning, which was down over 20%, offset by higher parts and repair. At Pratt & Whitney, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8%. Both the Aerospace Systems and Pratt businesses benefited from a favorable contract adjustment in the third quarter.","Now, since most of you have 2016 on your mind, let's see what these trends means for us. We will be giving formal 2016 guidance at our Annual Outlook Meeting on December 10, as we typically, so things can change. But this is what we are seeing today.","And I am now on slide four. I'll start with a few things that we know will be headwinds next year. Commercial Aero OE margins, both at Pratt and at Aerospace Systems. The negative engine margins story at Pratt is well known at this point. We have also talked about the mix impact at Aerospace Systems as production decreases on higher margin fully learned-out current platforms and increases on new platforms where the margins on early units are pressured by the learning curve.","OE mix pressure, along with the absence of a few favorable items in 2015 that do not repeat next year, will make it difficult for UTAS to grow earnings. While we do not like the earnings pressure in the near term, these are great strategic programs at both Pratt and UTAS that will generate increasing profits and cash flows for decades to come.","There is also some pressure in military Aerospace. Biggest item here is the C-17. Their production is ending this year. That's primarily at Pratt. And UTAS will face headwinds from declining military spending and completion of a few retrofit programs.","On the Commercial side, consistent with what you're seeing in the general macro environment, we will likely see our business in China down 10% to 15% next year. That will probably come with a profit decline of over $100 million.","Now moving to the middle column, Europe has been below expectations in 2015. Order rates have been mixed with some pockets of growth and recent GDP forecast suggests 2016 should be up just 1% to 2%.","Currencies have been moving around a lot and could move some more depending on what the Fed does with interest rates. If I had to call it today, I'd say over $100 million of FX headwind largely due to Chinese yuan and other emerging market currencies and assuming the euro at $1.10 and I'm talking about profit impact, not sales.","On the positive side, the U.S. markets continue to be good. We expect stronger-than-growth GDP across our end markets. We continue to see the benefits of restructuring, and we'll do more next year.","Commercial aftermarket at both UTAS and Pratt, while pressured in the areas of provisioning and legacy fleets, should grow low single digit next year, as airline profits remain strong and revenue passenger miles continue to increase. This year, we have had significant headwind from pension. And while year-to-date returns on plan assets are trending lower than the expected returns, we still expect a tailwind of over $200 million next year.","Also, share buybacks that Greg talked about will be a benefit of approximately $0.40 in 2016 net of interest expense, as the average share count comes down significantly. Net-net, as Greg said last month, 2016 will likely be another challenging year. Earnings in three of the four segments, Otis, Pratt, and UTAS, will be flat to down even with the pension benefit.","Shifting back to the current quarter on slide five, total reported sales decreased by 6%, driven by five points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar and one point of organic contraction. Segment operating margins were 17.6%, down 50 basis points, largely driven by headwinds at Pratt. Excluding Pratt, margins were up slightly. Absent the impact of gains and restructuring, earnings per share were down 2%. And at constant currency, earnings per share were up 1%.","Free cash flow was 44% of net income, largely due to significantly higher working capital from the engine delivery delays at Pratt, a timing issue. We have also seen some inventory build at Aerospace Systems as we prepare to support the growth in new programs. Year to date, free cash flow to net income is 71%. The fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter for cash. And we still expect full-year free cash flow to net income of 90% to 100% in 2015, although it's likely towards the lower end of the range. And for M&A, we are maintaining our placeholder of $1 billion.","As Greg mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are confident in our guidance for earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.30 on sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. Year-to-date EPS for continuing operations is $4.76, so we expect Q4 EPS of $1.39 to $1.54.","Let me stop there and turn it over to Paul to take you through the business unit results for the quarter in more detail.","Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. Thanks, Akhil.","Turning to Otis on slide six, in the quarter sales were $3 billion, which was up 2% organically. Otis profit was $660 million and also up 2% at constant currency. Foreign exchange translation was an 11 point headwind to both sales and earnings. Otis profit growth was driven by drop-through from higher organic growth, lower costs from productivity and commodities, and tailwind from foreign exchange related mark-to-market adjustments. Pricing and mix were a headwind in the quarter.","New equipment sales increased 4%, led by strong growth in both North America and Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were down about a point, and China was down 9%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall, as a 3% decline in EMEA was offset by mid-single-digit growth in Asia and low single-digit growth in the Americas. We saw a decline in modernization sales from continuing contractions in France and Russia, offset by low single-digit growth in repair and maintenance sales up slightly. Our portfolio of units under maintenance continues to grow and is now north of 1.9 million units.","New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued, with orders up 47%. Excluding the Hudson Yards order that Akhil mentioned earlier, North America was up nearly 20%. New equipment orders in the EMEA were down 9%, with declines in Russia, the Middle East, and Germany mitigated somewhat by growth in Spain and Italy. China orders were down 19%, but Asia overall was down 10%, with strong growth in South Korea, India, and Southeast Asia. We continue to expect Otis profit to be down $300 million to $350 million, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange.","Moving to slide seven, Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 5% at constant currency, with three points of organic growth and two points of benefit from M&A. Profits were up 4% at constant currency. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a seven point sales headwind and a four point earnings headwind. CCS organic growth was led by a 19% increase in our transport refrigeration business, Carrier Transicold, and continued strength in the Americas where U.S. residential HVAC grew 7% and commercial HVAC was up 5%. Both EMEA and Asia were down mid-single digit organically, with declines in China more than offsetting growth in other parts of the Asia region.","Operating profit growth of 4% was primarily driven by drop-through on the organic volume growth and cost benefits, including favorable commodity prices offset somewhat by adverse sales mix in the quarter.","Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 3% in the quarter, driven by 8% growth in North America and an 8% decline in EMEA. Asia commercial HVAC was down mid-single digit, driven by a weaker China. Transicold saw orders down 2% in the quarter, while fire and security product orders were down mid-single digits and F&S field was flat. CCS continues to expect profit growth of $75 million to $125 million for the full year.","Shifting to aerospace on slide eight, Pratt & Whitney sales were down 8% organically. As Akhil mentioned we had some start up challenges at a logistics center that delayed some large engine shipments in the quarter. Pratt's military aftermarket was down double digits with declines in the F117 program, and Pratt Canada, volume was down on lower helicopter and general aviation shipments. These declines were offset by growth in the commercial aftermarket at Pratt, which was up 8%. Within that, large commercial engines aftermarket was up 6% driven by a favorable contract adjustment. Excluding this adjustment, engine services, that's our FMP or Fleet Management Program business, was up about 20%, the transactional business was down 13% on a difficult compare. On a year-to-date basis, the commercial aftermarket is now up 4% and as we move through Q4, we expect the commercial aftermarket to be in line with our prior guidance of up low single digit for the year.","Moving to profits, in the quarter Pratt operating profit was down 21%. The impact from lower military sales, higher negative engine margin, lower Pratt Canada engine deliveries and higher pension expense were partially offset with lower E&D spending and margins from the commercial aftermarket including approximately $0.04 of favorable contract adjustments. With the expected volume recovery in Q4, Pratt is on track to deliver on their prior earnings expectations of down $50 million to down $125 million.","Turning to slide nine, aerospace systems profits were down 2% on flat organic sales in the quarter. Similar to what we mentioned the past two quarters, sales included the benefit of a change in arrangement that added around 60 million of pass-through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass-through sales the commercial OE business was down 3% in the quarter from timing of deliveries on various platforms in a tough compare. Military OE sales were down 7% in the quarter driven by declines on the C-17 and other programs.","Commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% organically in the quarter and included a favorable impact from a customer contract closeout. Provisioning sales continue to be down significantly driven by lower 787 activity as well as the impact of higher surplus equipment availability for legacy fleets. Piece parts volume was up low single digit. Even excluding the impact of the contract adjustment, repair sales were still up mid-single digit, reflecting an improvement in maintenance volumes.","On profit, the year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE and aftermarket sales mix and higher pension expense. This was partially offset by continued cost reduction and around $60 million of nonrecurring income driven by favorable contract \u2013 excuse me, favorable aftermarket contract adjustments and the benefit from asset and license agreements in the quarter. We continue to expect operating profit for UTC aerospace systems to be down $25 million to $75 million for the year.","With that, let me turn it back to Greg for a wrap up.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Paul. Just let me highlight a couple milestones that took place in the quarter that really better position the business to drive long-term shareowner value.","As you know, we recently eliminated the Building & Industrial Systems Management layer, thus following the elimination of the Propulsion & Aerospace Systems layer earlier this year. As a result, we simplified the organization. We have a flatter, more efficient structure with four strong businesses and four solid leaders that all report directly to me. This focused organization will drive greater accountability and, in turn, help drive value creation for all shareowners.","As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the Sikorsky transaction is on track to close shortly. This will leave us a more focused, more growth-oriented, and a higher-margin portfolio business.","The long-term growth outlook remains exceptionally strong. UTC has world-class industry-leading franchises and we play in attractive end markets with our differentiated technologies and, importantly, we continue to invest in innovation. Also we have a significant base of recurring revenues, which today account for about 45% of UTC sales.","And we generate reliable cash flows through all the business cycles. As I mentioned earlier, we'll return more than $12 billion to shareowners this year and that includes $2 billion in dividends, $4 billion in buybacks year to date and a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase that will implement upon the close of Sikorsky. And we're not done yet. All in, as I said earlier, we'll do at least $16 billion of buyback in more than $6 billion of dividends from 2015 through 2017.","As a leading provider of high-tech products and services to the aero and building industries, we continue to believe UTX shares are a great investment opportunity. The UTC team is executing in building momentum by focusing on the things we control all while being laser focused on delivering maximum value to our shareowners.","With that, let me open the call for questions. Amanda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So the 2016 roadmap is obviously helpful; and quantifying some of the headwinds, $250 million from Pratt, about $100 million from China, $100 million from FX, and then I'm seeing about $150 million from military. So that adds about $600 million of headwinds. You mentioned some offset from pensions but maybe could you just fill in how, I guess, given the $40 million deficit ex-pension \u2013 with pension, do you think that growth in the commercial aftermarket cost reduction commodities, et cetera, can offset that GAAP you have from some of the headwinds?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You are already in the December mode, Nigel. This is all that detail we will go through with you in December. I think right now, it's appropriate to say that the benefits of the capital deployment, the benefits of pension, the benefits from aftermarket growth, commercial aftermarket growth, U.S. markets remaining strong will allow us to the headwinds that you talked about so well. I think net-net, we can give you confidence that we will grow earnings next year. Exactly how much that will be is something that we'll talk more about in December.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's fair enough. And then just on the cost reduction, you typically do in the range of about $3 million of restructuring a year. What is the scope for 2016 to be a bigger year of cost reduction over and above what we normally see from UTC?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nigel, I think what you're going to see is here, in the fourth quarter, we're going to announce some significant additional restructuring actions. We've got this big gain coming from Sikorsky and we've seen some opportunities to do some longer-term structural cost reduction. After we announce them today, we'll give you all that detail in December. We'll take some overheads out, we'll take some SG&A out, but primarily the focus is on long-term structural cost reduction. That means factory rationalization and those paybacks are a little bit longer, typically two to four years, but all that gives us runway as we think about \u2013 as we emerge from the cycle of investment on the aerospace side even more earnings runway going forward.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, Greg and Akhil.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just a real big picture question for you, Greg. When you took over the reins, you mentioned that everything was on the table. In some conversations post that, we've had you've talked about you guys are doing more regular portfolio reviews, that kind of thing. And when you stand and look back at the UTX portfolio, it really seems like there's a lot of value in the company that's just not being realized yet by the market. When you think about that, are there other ways to start unlocking value in the portfolio? Can you talk about that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a really good question, Ron. It's interesting. I took over just about a year ago. And when I stood up in last December and talked about going forward what we were focus on, we talked about a couple of things. We talked about how we're going to examine the portfolio and we were going to make sure that we had the right portfolio to drive long-term sustainable earnings growth. We said we were going to look for ways to increase shareowner value. As I think about it, this is not a one-year game. In fact, if you think about it, we're probably in the first inning of a nine-inning game.","And we're building momentum. We've done a lot of things. The first thing is from the structure of the business, we've got the right team together out. We've also, I think, identified the fact that, look, sometimes the market doesn't recognize the real value. And as a result, you see this morning, we've talked about this $16 billion share buyback program. It's simply a recognition, Ron, that while we have to make investments in the short run, this is really a 30-year time horizon. We're investing in engines today, we're investing in elevators today that we're going to service for 30 and 40 years.","So the focus of the business, yeah, we're looking at the portfolio, I think we've got a great portfolio that can drive long-term sustainable growth, but I also think we recognize the reality of the short term is that the market is discounting that long-term growth and so we've got a big disconnect between intrinsic value of the company and what the share price is. So I'm going to take advantage of that and we're going to do this share buyback. I think it's the right thing to do. And I don't think it's any surprise. We've been talking about the fact that we see this disconnect and so we're going to continue to buy back shares aggressively. $16 billion may not be done but again, we're looking at how do you drive sustainable long-term value while delivering short-term results. It is that balance that we're after here.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I wanted to talk a little bit about Otis because you've talked about the loss of market share in China. If you look at growth in China, KONE has been growing faster than you have. So what I'm trying to understand is when you go forward, are you satisfied with the current market share and the margins you're getting in China or is this something where you see a different strategy where you would push for an increase in market share and possibly at the expense of margins?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Doug, that's an interesting question. Am I satisfied with market share? Of course not. I think we have sacrificed market share for margins for a number of years and it's not just in China. We've really done that globally. But we've got this great business, Otis, which has 20% kind of margins, $12 billion business but we have to grow and I think that's been the Achilles' heel of Otis and we have not seen bottom line growth in about five years. So we have to think about it differently.","Philippe Delpech is the new president of Otis. He's got a great team in place and we're going to focus on the \u2013 kind of the basics, if you will, of how do we get back to long-term sustainable earnings growth. Part of it is going to be by gaining share because, again, it is that market share that ultimately provides the elevators that we're going to service, and it's also by improving service productivity, making service more sticky to the customers, showing the value of Otis versus the others. So I think there's a lot to do.","Will margins suffer in the short run? Perhaps a little bit, but let's just be clear, this is not a pricing war I'm talking about. I'm talking about targeted market share gains where, before, perhaps we were not always being an aggressive as we could in pursuing some of these opportunities. And so to your point, KONE has gained share on us in China. We're not happy, we're going to go after that and not just China, really it's globally. And you see that in the U.S. especially. Last year, we grew Otis orders about 40% in the U.S. This year we're up about 20%. We know how to do this. It's about having great product and a great service team and great leadership and we've got that across-the-board in Otis today and I'm confident we're going to be able to regain share without sacrificing a lot of margin.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Doug, if I might add to that a little bit, the loss in China market share to some extent was driven by a conscious decision on our part not to play in certain segments. So the low cost social housing segment we had underrepresented or underplayed that market. Gaining share in that market doesn't necessarily have to come with price. It also comes with the right, innovative, highly cost-efficient product, and we are working on that. Greg and Philippe have been talking about increasing some R&D investment in Otis to get the right products for the right market segments. And I think by attacking market segmentation, we've seen the strategy play out in Korea. We'll do that in China as well. It's not just about dropping prices to gain market share. It's about putting the right products in the right segments at the right value.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, I was wondering, Greg, if you could just circle back to the share repurchase, a nice pop here for sure, more than a pop. Just maybe a little color on how you arrived at that number; why that is the right number. You've said obviously it could go higher. But just how are you thinking about that relative to where your cash is actually geographically located and how you're trying to balance the balance sheet and the rating agencies and the like?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think you hit on exactly the right part, Jeff, which is we're trying to balance the cash in terms of keeping the rating where it is today as well as where the cash is generated into the future. Clearly, we've been out with the rating agencies. We've talked to them about the fact that we want to continue to do share buyback, we want to take share buyback up, and we still want to keep our powder dry to do M&A over the next couple of years. So this was a number that we felt in working with the agencies gave us enough coverage to do aggressive share buyback while at the same time preserving a little bit of powder to go out and do M&A. If the M&A doesn't happen, we can do more share buyback, and it really will depend upon how much of a disconnect we continue to see between the intrinsic value as we believe it to be versus where the market sees us today.","So there wasn't a magic number here, I would say the $6 billion, that's the net proceeds from Sikorsky. We've talked all along about how we're going to reinvest that. But it's really the confidence going forward that we see in the long-range forecast that gives us the ability to go out, talk to the rating agencies and say here's what the cash flows are going to look like, not just for the next two or three years, but out beyond that because of these investments as they start to tail off, cash becomes very, very strong in the out years, and we can afford to take out a little bit more leverage. We don't want to be down in BBB from a rating perspective, but we did take a downgrade by a notch, and I think that's appropriate today. The capital markets are pretty well recovered from 2009, and we felt like we didn't need to keep the A1P1, but we still want to maintain some flexibility.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Jeff, the decision to buy back shares was pretty straightforward. I'm sure like you have and many of the investors have, we have a 10-year cash flow model as well. And when you look at that and the virtual assurance that some of our investments are going to deliver in form of great cash flows when the engines come back for aftermarket and when the UTAS systems come back for repair and overhaul, et cetera, the cash flow spin of this business is phenomenal. The Otis business generates over 100% of net income every year as cash flow. So given the strength of our cash flows over the long-term, clearly our discounted cash flows give us a much higher value of UTX today than the share prices. And in that situation, it's very easy to make that call.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Can I sneak one more quick one in on Otis, Akhil, since you bring it up? There's a lot of concern out there as you crank up the new product and try to recover share and the like that the margins need to go down materially in Otis. You disavowed that with some of the earlier comments both you and Greg made. But can you give us some thought about what is a normal margin rate for Otis or where things might settle out as you work through this process?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. As you think about \u2013 the good thing, Jeff, is that unlike the Aerospace business, we don't need to spend $1 billion to create innovative products in Otis. The beauty of the Otis model is targeted investments in R&D of $10 million \u2013 $20 million can give niche product which can attractively easily attack market segments. And that's what we are talking about, increasing Otis R&D investment by $20 million \u2013 $30 million can allow us to capture share in segments that we had vacated earlier. So I think it's not about increasing huge amount of investments. It's about the right pricing decisions, as Greg said. It's about the targeted R&D investments.","And the other thing to keep in mind is, Otis has the largest scale of any elevator company in the world. So our ability to reduce costs, day in and day out at Otis is bar none. And we have to be able to take advantage of that to keep our margins at levels where they are. Will they come down temporarily short term? Sure, and that's the right tradeoff to make, but it's not going to be a 500 basis point margin reduction. It may be 100 basis points or so.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much, good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Greg, maybe to follow up on Ron's earlier question about strategy and the big picture, your commentary earlier in the year was much more optimistic as I think about your ability to make acquisitions. Obviously, the share price has changed since then. But does maybe your lack of enthusiasm for acquisitions here reflect the prices you're seeing out there or the quality of the assets you're seeing out there or maybe some other factors?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You pretty well hit on it there, Rob. Look, we still want to do acquisitions. And this year we'll do about $1 billion of acquisitions, some smaller things that are mostly on the commercial side of the portfolio. But there remains an opportunity both on the Aerospace Systems side as well as on the building side of the business. We have not seen or found an asset of the quality that we like quite yet, but we continue to look. And it ultimately comes down to, can we buy a business and create real value for the shareowners without having to give all of that value to their shareowners in the form of a very high takeover premium.","So we're going to be disciplined, we're going to keep looking. And quite frankly, I think the slowdown that we've seen in the stock market over the last six months gives us the opportunity going forward to be selective and to find targets that are out there. I think what's off the table today is the bigger deal. We'll do deals in that $1 billion to $5 billion range, things that we can finance with existing cash or cash flows or what we have on the balance sheet. But any type of deal that will require us to use UTC stock, in my mind, is off the table simply because of the disconnect. I don't want to use a devalued currency to do a deal.","So over time, as the UTC share price recovers back to towards where intrinsic value is, we may think of a bigger deal. But right now, we're thinking about that $1 billion to $5 billion range, and we'll continue to look. And I give the team credit. We've been close on a couple of deals and we've walked away because the value wasn't there at the end of the day after we did due diligence and we did the right thing. And we'll continue to have that kind of discipline going forward.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Thanks, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Carter, how are you?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good. Good. Just a quick clarification, and then a question. I noticed the disc ops was a loss figure in the quarter and I know you're close to closing this deal, but I wondered if you might tell us what actually happened with Sikorsky in the quarter. And then just a question on the planning process, I know there was a lot of attention last quarter to the plans around provisioning and service in Europe, and obviously, it's the time of year where you guys have gone through that or are going through that strategic planning process for next year. I wondered what sort of changes you may have implemented on the planning front. I mean obviously you've changed the organizational structure. Can you give us some insight into just how that's coming together this year versus prior years? And what we should think that means for risk and anything else?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So let me take that and I'm sure Greg will add to it. But on the disc ops, it's the fairly straightforward situation. There was about $0.16 of nonrecurring items in the quarter related to pension curtailment for the Sikorsky employees and an income tax adjustment for taking away of the APB 23 assertion that we had for Sikorsky. Those will be offset by the gains when we have that in Q4. Operationally, Sikorsky did what we expected. It is on track to hit the full year numbers, but the quarter was weak, particularly on the oil and gas side. And the shipments were down significantly on the S-92 and the S-71 platforms, as you would imagine. But nothing inconsistent with what Bob Leduc said at the \u2013 in the June Paris Air Show. We are on track with the roughly $0.40 of operating income from Sikorsky and about $0.10 of separation cost excluding the restructuring type of items.","On the planning process, Carter, I think, again, we've been spending a lot of time this year working in details with the business units, trying to make sure we fully understand and agree to the assumptions that are being baked into the plan. We will make sure we lay those out for you all to understand clearly as we stand up in December. And at the same time, we will be back in the mode of potential contingency at the UTC level to make sure that we do not surprise. That is number one priority for us to make sure we live up to our commitments and deliver what we say. If anything, we want to get back in the mode of under-promise and over-deliver.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just, go on top of, Akhil here, I think the new structure gives us the ability to dive deep into these individual businesses. We've got four guys. They're running these businesses, and we're in lock step with them in terms of the planning process and the key assumptions that they're making. So I don't expect any surprises going into next year because we didn't understand what the assumptions were or it wasn't clear what the assumptions were underlying the plan. And obviously, when we get to December, we're going to have those four business leaders there with me. We're going to go through each of their plans. We're going to go through each of the key assumptions that make up the plan and there will be no surprise with investors next year.","Obviously, we were too aggressive this year on commercial aftermarket. Again, there was a reason for that. It proved to be not correct, but we're going to make sure we don't have that mistake again. So we'll be a little more conservative. We're going to have adequate contingency at the UTC level and we're going to make sure that everybody understands all of the key assumptions that go into our plan. Now the things we can't control like what happens to currency and what happens to the individual markets, but we're going to get cost structure right and we're going to make sure we've got the right organization in place to deliver on the commitments that we're going to make.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, just a question around CC&S. I think it's the one segment where an EBIT increase is reasonably likely for next year. But I just wondered how you thought about the risks that this sort of replicates, maybe some of the issues that Otis has had in recent past? The margins have had a huge increase 500 or 600 points in recent years, well above most industry peers now at about 18%. So I just wondered what gave you the confidence that you'll see further margin expansion in the future and whether that expansion is reliant on divestments or you think you can do it operationally. And then just a very quick one word one for Akhil, should we expect free cash flow conversation to improve next year?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start with CCS now, and I'll let Akhil or Paul pile in after me, but I'm very confident in the CCS outlook for the next few years. If you think about it, Julian, we've made big investments in R&D. In fact, I think we doubled the R&D budget at CCS over the last five years. We've got this great new commercial product line. We've been seeing very solid growth at the quarters \u2013 in the quarter we're up 8% on the commercial HVAC in the U.S. Continue to see good positive momentum on the residential side, sales were up about 7%. So we're seeing good momentum. The other beautiful thing about CCS, is it's not just a U.S. HVAC business, it's a global business but it's got fire products, it's got field, about 30% of their business is service.","It's a global Building Systems portfolio and there's going to be growth in a lot of markets and we think clearly China will be down next year, we've seen that in the order rates this year. But the rest of Asia still looks very promising.","Europe, though we would expect some recovery there next year not where I'm talking 5% or 6% growth, but just modest recovery in Europe. And I think what Bob McDonough has focused on is continued cost reduction and cost takeout to ensure that he can grow earnings next year. So, make no mistake. When we talk about three of the businesses will be challenged to grow earnings, Bob will be challenged but we're going to challenge him too to grow earnings as much as he can.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","On the cash flow side, Julian, we certainly expect cash flow for next year to be better than this year. Keep in mind, we have a 5-point impact from the German tax payment this year, right, which hopefully won't be there next year.","In terms of the makings of cash flow, we will still have a couple more years of pressure on the CapEx side because the Aero ramp is not fully done yet. We still have capital investments, which are continuing to be made in both Pratt and UTC Aerospace Systems. Obviously, we'll try and control that to the best we can. And then we should start to see some improvement.","We've also had buildup of inventory as we get ready for the ramp, right? So I think some of those factors will over time start to dissipate, but definitely just the fact we won't have the German tax payment disconnect should suggest a better cash flow to net income next year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the working capital you just mentioned. Just can you quantify the impact of this Pratt Logistics Center transition? What exactly happened? What was the sales earnings cash flow impact? And is that the sole reason we saw working capital up the $966 million in the quarter?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sam, let me start and just talk a little bit about the New England logistics center. First of all, Pratt this year \u2013 I think third quarter this year versus last year was about 55 fewer engine shipments, about six of those were on the military side; the other 49 were commercial. If you do the math, that's little over $500 million in sales that we missed year-over-year.","The New England logistics center Logistics Center, you guys have heard all about it, we had some startup issues. The good news is today, we're about 94% on time with the kits coming out of there, the kit fill rate. We should be at 97%, which is the contractual target by the end of this month and we should be able to make up almost all of that production by the end of the fourth quarter. So again, one-time thing, expect a very big fourth quarter.","And I think the learnings out of the NELC, like everything else, we treat these as an opportunity to make sure we don't do things wrong in the future, but also it's good learning in terms of process. So the Pratt team is focused on right now delivering to customers and getting back on track. The rest of the working capital, Akhil?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So I think in addition to the fact that Greg just talked about, if you think we missed effectively the August shipments, right, and timing of shipments is absolutely critical, as you know, because if we ship early in the quarter, we can have the receivables collected within the quarter that converts into cash right away. In the absence of not being able to do that in Q3, it left us with a much higher level of inventory and we weren't able to collect the receivables that got shipped for late in the quarter.","Same holds for Q4. We expect to recover most of it. The Pratt team is working very hard to make sure that they can recover most of the shipment misses of August early in the quarter so that we can collect it within the quarter, but that's the thing that we are continuing to work on.","The second point I mentioned earlier was, again as the title work with new programs is starting to happen at both UTAS and Pratt, there is some additional inventory which is being built. It's almost like what CCS went through with the CS 13 transition last year, right, that you base some inventory, some safety stock to make sure that you can meet customer requirements. So that's again a temporary short-term investment which hopefully goes away as the next year comes around.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Yes. Morning, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Hey, Greg. Just following up on. Could you give an update now on where things stand on the GTF, how that's performing and also how you kind of quantify all the fluidness that's going on with the CSeries? I think back in March, you kind of indicated that 2017 was going to be the year where we still have \u2013 probably more than 50% of deliveries would be GTF coming out of Pratt. Maybe if you could just give us a little view \u2013 update on the program right now. Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. So GTF, yes, Geared Turbofans really the five different programs. I think the biggest program is obviously the A320neo program. We were going to continue in the flight test program with Airbus and we expect to have that aircraft certified later this year. The good news, of course, is that we're hitting the targets that we set out to initially. About 16% better fuel burn, about 50% reduction in emissions and a 75% noise reduction. So we're right on top of what we told customers we would be six years ago when we started the program.","You've also, of course, got the GTF going on a Mitsubishi Regional Jet. We expect first flight probably in the next week or so over in Japan on the MRJ. That will probably go into service in 2018. Again, core is performing great and we're on track with the performance.","Bombardier, I think we've got six airplanes in flight test today. We continue to see very, very positive results out of that. It's a great little airplane; I think you've heard that. And it's targeted to that 110 to 130-passenger market. And we continue to support Bombardier. I think we'll do what we can to help Bombardier. We all read about some of the challenges that they've had, but it is a great program, it's a great product, and the engines are performing really well.","We also, of course, got that GTF engine on the Embraer, the E2 platforms. Those are a little bit further behind in the development schedule. Those go into service 2018 \u2013 2019, but again, same core as the rest of GTFs. So from a performance standpoint, from reliability, it's all going really well.","The gear architecture works. We haven't seen any failures related to that in any of the flight test programs, so we're very confident. Of course, the challenge is, as you know, Peter, as you go through this is you've got not just the R&D investment, but the negative engine margin. So that will be a stress over the next three years as Pratt ramps up. And I think I saw the latest schedule, about 1,500 engines we'll be delivering in 2018 or 2019.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","2019, yes.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","2019, so $1 billion of negative engine margin. So the investment continues, but it's an investment that we know is going to pay off because we're going to have a very, very solid aftermarket revenue stream for the next 30 years. So GTF is doing pretty well.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","That's great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Steve.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Pretty strong margin at Otis this quarter. I guess you talked about the profit decline is in line for the year. But maybe where are you going to be there in the fourth quarter? Do you got a range there, just maybe a little bit more of a point estimate on the fourth quarter because it would imply that I think margins are down year over year in the fourth quarter if I'm doing math correctly?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I think if you're talking about total UTC guidance, Steve, it's...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","For Otis.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...maybe it's around...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","For Otis.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Otis will probably at the midpoint of the range overall, so I think consistent with what we have said all along. I wouldn't want to give a point estimate for Otis, but I think overall, I think everything is on track with exactly what was said and communicated in July.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. You imply something in kind of the high teens, like 19% for the fourth quarter, I think, something like that.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So when you say that the margin is going to go \u2013 it's not going to collapse, it will go down 100 basis points or whatever, you're talking about \u2013 what base are we using? Are we using the exit rate for the year? Is it 20% that you're still looking at for this year, so can you hold above 19%? Is that the guidance here that you're talking about when you say Otis margins will only be down, I think you said earlier in the call, about 100 basis points as you go through this transition period?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's a starting point of 20% because for a long time, we talked about Otis margins at 20% or so on a sustainable basis. And I think what I mentioned was 100 basis points or so reduction in a transition period as we reinvest into the business through either lower market share gain or through higher R&D.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve, just to add a little flavor on that, Otis spends about 1% of sales on E&D, about $140 million a year. So we talk about the additional product investment and we'll link a couple of these things, you're talking $20 million to $30 million; you're not talking about more than probably 50 basis points of headwind from E&D over the next couple of years.","It's not like we're going to see, to Akhil's earlier point, 500 basis points of margin deterioration. I think the 20% level is something that's our long-term goal to maintain. It will fluctuate over the next couple of years, maybe come down as we make some investments. But long term, we still see that 20% as a target that's achievable even with what we see from a competitive standpoint today.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Steve, I would just encourage you and others to \u2013 one of the things we have been obsessively focused on has been the margin at Otis, which probably has forced us into some bad decisions. I think what is more relevant is operating profit growth, and I think that's what our focus at Otis is going to be, to try and generate profit growth. And if that means that the margins are going to be a little different than what I said or what you expect, that's okay as long as they're gaining organic growth with appropriate margins to get better operating profit growth at Otis.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure, absolutely, and then just one quick one just on U.S. non-res construction. There are a lot of things going on in the industrial economy. Obviously, there's probably going to be some regional pressure here as oil and gas is getting worse and hitting pretty hard. Are you guys seeing anything in the more oil-and-gas-centric parts of the country that would make you worried about this? It looks like pretty stable, still stable non-res recovery. Anything in Texas that stands out on the commercial building front, anything like that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, the good news is there are not a lot of skyscrapers in Wyoming and South Dakota. So the commercial construction market, as you know, Steve, it's on the coast and it's in the Southeast, and we continue to see very, very solid growth in commercial construction. As I said earlier, I think we're up \u2013 Otis up 20% year to date in orders in North America, 40% last year. So it all looks pretty good.","And I know people talk about an industrial recession. In the markets that we play in, in the U.S., we don't see that. I think again, the non-res piece and the residential piece is all very good and Commercial Aerospace remains strong. So I like the hand we've got here.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. No elevators at a rig site, I get it. Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's in oil, not ours anyways. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you, guys. Akhil, I just wanted to go back to Otis in China. Last quarter, you mentioned that there had been some sort of degradation backlog conversion. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on how things trended here in the third quarter. And combining that thought with the orders being down 19% in the current quarter, what gives you confidence that we're only going to be down 10% to 15% next year?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So typically, Jason, what happens is you've got about 60% of current year sales come from backlog conversion, and we have seen a couple of point reductions in that. At the same time, we've also seen order rates decline. So the year-to-date orders are down about 13% for Otis. We expect fourth quarter probably to be something similarly in line with that.","The expectation is that the Chinese government has been investing in infrastructure even though the property market has been weak. Housing starts, housing completions have been down. But there has been investments in metros, in airports, and Otis benefits a little bit from that as well. So I think the overall view at this point \u2013 again, this is early in the process. We will give you more specific guidance in December when we are updated and maybe our view might change a little bit between now and then.","But based on what we see today, maybe orders down between 10% to 15%, some improvement through infrastructure investments that the Chinese government is making, opportunity to gain a little share, and the continuing growth in the service business, which still continues to grow on the maintenance side in the mid-teens. We do expect China at this point to be down between 10% and 15%. What exactly it will be, we'll tell you more in December.","Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations","The rate of change...","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. But just looking further, there's no further degradation in backlog conversion particularly...","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. No.","Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations","Just to add one comment, Jason, on China and that would be although the rate of change for orders got worse for Otis, it actually improved for CCS. CCS orders in the second quarter were down in the mid-teens. They were down 8% in the third quarter.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jason.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. And we're mindful of the time. Our hour here is up. Paul and the team will be available, of course, all day to take additional questions. And we look forward to seeing everybody in December in New York, and December 10, I think, is the actual date for our 2016 Outlook Meeting.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC's website at www.utc.com.","Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and\/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.","The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K Reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","In addition, in connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement that includes a preliminary prospectus of UTC and a preliminary proxy statement of Rockwell Collins which is not yet effective which contain important information about UTC, Rockwell Collins, this transaction and related matters.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay, thank you, Latoya, and good morning everyone. You saw from our press release this morning Q3 was another strong quarter for UTC. We saw adjusted EPS of $1.73 and adjusted sales of $15.4 billion. That included organic sales growth of 6%. Our performance through three quarters and a clear line of sight to Q4 gives us confidence to raise our 2017 EPS expectations to a range of $6.58 to $6.63, and that's up of course from $6.45 to $6.60.","Clearly, the investments we've been making in the business are translating now into sustained sales growth. The third quarter was UTC's best quarter for organic growth since 2011. And our year-to-date organic sales growth stands at 4%.","Pratt & Whitney's organic growth in the quarter was 15%. Pratt shipped 120 Geared Turbofan engines which includes some of those that were allocated to our spares pool, but that 120 shipments nearly matches the output for the entire first half. So with 254 engines shipped year-to-date, Pratt remains well on track to the 350 to 400 engine target that we laid out earlier this year.","Maybe just a quick update on the on the GTF durability issues. Pratt remains on track to certify a combustor upgrade to incorporate into new engines here in the fourth quarter. With regard to the number three seal issue, you'll recall that production engines began receiving upgraded hardware back in the second quarter of this year and then ongoing retrofits were completed out in the field.","While we're still seeing some success with the actions we've taken to date, we're also looking at design alternatives that are expected to further improve durability in the engine. We'll continue to work closely with our customers to support their operations as future retrofits are completed.","At CCS, we have introduced more than 200 new products over the last two years. And these investments in innovation are paying off with sales growth. In the quarter, we saw 4% organic sales growth with all the major businesses in CCS contributing. Year-to-date, CCS new equipment orders are up 7%.","At Otis, as you know, we've increased our R&D investment over the last several years to accelerate the development of some innovative new products for our customers and to address some underserved segments. In 2017, Otis will launch twice as many product variances in 2015 and these innovations are helping to drive organic growth.","In the quarter, Otis saw 2% organic growth. This is Otis' third quarter straight with organic sales growth in spite of the continuing pressure we see in China, which of course is the largest new equipment market for Otis.","As you saw of course in the \u2013 we announced the appointment of Judy Marks as the new President of Otis recently. I'm confident that as you interact with her over the coming months, you'll be impressed with the leadership skills and the strong focus on the customer as she drives both strategic growth, innovation and earnings growth at Otis in the coming years. We're excited to have Judy on the team.","So a good quarter for UTC, and we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and we're confident in the improved outlook for 2017.","With that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you guys through the results. Thanks. Akhil?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Thank you, Greg. So I'm on slide 2. The reported sales were $15.1 billion, up 5%. That included 6 points organic growth and 1 point of favorable foreign exchange. This was partially offset by 2 points from a non-recurring charge at Pratt & Whitney related to customer contract matters. This charge was driven by our decision to allocate more of the GTF engines produced towards spares to support the airline operators in the field who are dealing with the two durability issues that Greg mentioned and we have discussed throughout this year.","Adjusted EPS of $1.73 was down 2% from the prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.67, down 4% and included $0.06 of restructuring. Non-recurring items included $196 million charge at Pratt. This was entirely offset by gains on sales of securities and a tax adjustment.","Operating cash net of CapEx was an outflow of $472 million, driven by the $1.9 billion discretionary contribution we made to our domestic pension fund which we had announced last month. So, no surprises here. The quarterly cash when you adjust for this pension contribution was 88% of net income, in line with our expectations, and we remain confident in our full year free cash flow guidance of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.","Turning to slide 3. You will see the drivers of our strong organic growth. The macroeconomic environment continues to improve and we feel particularly good about the end markets we serve. Commercial construction in Americas and Europe remains strong and global aviation traffic continues to grow at rates above long-term trends.","So looking at our commercial businesses. In the Americas, sales were up 6% with solid growth in Otis new equipment and service businesses. CCS was up 6% with strong growth across all product lines. Within EMEA, sales were up 3% with low double digit growth in the Otis new equipment business and 2% growth at CCS. Also for the first time in over two years, we saw orders grow in the Middle East for both Otis and CCS in the same quarter. In Asia, sales were up 2%. Otis channel overall was down 7%, a slight improvement from Q2. The rest of Asia was up mid single digit for Otis and was flat at CCS.","On the Aerospace side, commercial aerospace sales were up 7% in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% at both Pratt and Aerospace Systems. OEM sales at Pratt were also strong, with higher GTF volumes and higher spare engine sales on legacy programs. Consistent with the first half, commercial OEM sales at Aerospace Systems were down. Military sales were up 14% at Pratt & Whitney and down slightly at Aerospace Systems.","Now before I hand it over to Carroll, a note on 2018. We are still in the planning process for the next year, but at this point, no change to the framework we provided last month. For the existing portfolio, we continue to expect EPS growth in 2018 with each of our four business units being flat to up in earnings next year. The areas we continue to watch carefully before finalizing the plan are of course FX and commodities, where we've seen some inflation coming through.","Bottom line, we feel good about our increased EPS outlook of $6.58 to $6.63 for the year and our ability to grow EPS in 2018. Organic growth is happening now, and will continue, helping us to grow earnings and cash flow over the years to come.","With that, I'll turn it over to Carroll for business unit details.","Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on slide 4. I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there's an appendix on slide 12 with additional segment data you can use as a reference.","Otis sales were $3.2 billion in the quarter, and that was up 2% organically. Operating profit was down 7% at constant currency. Contribution from higher volume and productivity was more than offset by continued pricing and mix pressure, predominantly in China as well as strategic investments in service and E&D. Foreign exchange translation was a 1 point tailwind to sales and earnings.","New equipment sales were up 2%. Low-double digit growth in Europe and high-single digit growth in North America were largely offset by a 10% decline in China, where the market and environment remains challenging. Service sales were up 5%, including the benefit of acquisitions. Otis saw solid growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up low-single digits.","New equipment orders were down 4% in the quarter. 25% growth in Europe was more than offset by a decline of 24% in North America, which had a tough compare, as well as declines in Asia excluding China. In China, orders were flat in dollar terms, with unit orders up 8%. Full-year expectations for Otis remain unchanged. We continue to expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $175 million at actual FX.","Climate, Controls & Security grew sales 6% in the quarter. Operating profit grew 5%. FX translation was a 2 point tailwind to sales and a 1 point tailwind to earnings. CCS grew 4% organically in Q3, with growth in every major product segment. Commercial refrigeration was up 11% and transport refrigeration grew 8%. Residential HVAC was up mid-single digits, despite lower cooling degree days in the quarter. Global commercial HVAC was up 4%, with strength in the Americas and Europe more than offsetting weakness in Asia and the Middle East.","Total equipment orders at CCS were up 2% in the quarter, primarily driven by 7% growth in global commercial HVAC. This is the first quarter of orders growth in the Middle East since Q3 of 2015. Commercial refrigeration orders grew high-single digits, offsetting a 10% decline in transport refrigeration. Residential HVAC orders were down 3% after seeing double-digit growth in the first half of the year. Global fire and security orders were up 2%.","Organic volume contribution in the quarter was mostly offset by price and mix headwind. Productivity gains from restructuring and product cost reduction delivered 4% profit growth at constant currency. For the full year, we remain confident that CCS will deliver low to mid-single digit organic sales growth and that operating profit growth will be at the low end of the $100 million to $150 million range at actual FX.","Turning to Aerospace on slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales were strong, up 15% organically in the quarter. Total commercial OEM sales were up 31% and that was primarily due to higher Geared Turbofan deliveries and favorable mix on legacy programs.","Pratt & Whitney Canada OEM shipments were down. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% on continuing V2500 strength. Sales at the military engines business were up 14%, benefiting from higher F135 and tanker deliveries, aftermarket strength and development revenues.","Pratt & Whitney operating profit of $423 million was up 2%. Drop-through from the commercial aftermarket and higher military sales, as well as favorable FX and pension, was mostly offset by higher negative engine margin and ramp-related costs as well as the impact of lower Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments and a customer insolvency reserve.","As Akhil mentioned, Pratt has increased the allocation of GTF production to the spare engine pool, which reduces total negative engine margin. This, along with the higher commercial aftermarket volume, leads us to expect full-year operating profit to be down $125 million to $175 million, but likely closer to the $125 million end of the range. And that's an improvement over prior expectations.","So, before I move onto Aerospace Systems, just a note; the shift toward spare engines will also negatively impact corporate eliminations as UTAS inter-company profit on GTF completions is eliminated at the corporate level.","Turning to slide 7. Aerospace Systems delivered 4% profit growth on flat organic sales. Commercial OEM sales were down 6%, driven by declines in legacy program volume that more than offset growth on new programs in the quarter. Of note, the end of the Boeing 777 landing gear production at Aerospace Systems impacted commercial OEM sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% and was driven by nearly 30% growth in provisioning. Parts were up 2% while repair was up 8%.","Military sales were down slightly in the quarter. Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction and pension tailwind. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable OEM volume and mix. A favorable customer settlement in the quarter offset the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non-core asset.","With solid year-to-date results at Aerospace Systems, we continue to expect operating profit to be up $50 million to $100 million for the full year and likely toward the high end of the range on low single digit organic sales growth.","And with that, I will hand it back to Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Okay thanks, Carroll. So again, good performance so far this year, and we feel good about our revised outlook for 2017. But more importantly, we remain confident in the business units' 2020 targets.","We're also of course very excited about the Rockwell Collins deal and what it will bring to our Aerospace portfolio. Collins is the ideal complement to our Aerospace Systems business. We've been very impressed with the team at Collins and we look forward to bringing together two world class organizations. We're also confident the combination of Aerospace Systems and Collins will create significant value for our customers as we develop aircraft systems that are more electric, more intelligent, more integrated and more connected.","We're also confident that the deal will be accretive to earnings at UTC in 2019, assuming we close by the middle of next year. This will create value for the shareowners in both the near term and for decades to come. As always, we remain focused on delivering our commitments to our customers and our strategic priorities which include focused execution and innovation for growth.","And with that, let me open it up, the call for questions. Latoya?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question is from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","I wondered if you could help me understand the Pratt performance a little bit better. Maybe bridge that 30% growth on, clearly you got 14% growth in large commercial engine deliveries. Presumably that's related to the spares deliveries year-over-year. Maybe help us bridge that. And with respect to the charge on the spare engine deliveries, how many engines did that relate to?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","I'm not going to tell you the exact number of engines, Carter. You're very good at math and that's something which is contractual, so I don't think we should try and talk about that. But it's safe to say that that charge takes care of an uncertain cloud that was hanging over our head to some extent and some of you had been commenting about some larger numbers that might be out there. So I think this takes care of that. It puts an uncertainty behind us.","With regard to the sales, I think you hit it exactly right for Pratt. The 31% growth in commercial, large commercial engine business, OE side, was driven to a large extent by the mix of spare engines on the legacy side which had higher dollar per unit composition as always. And so that's what drove a 13% increase while the shipment increase was only 14%.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","So is there a way to characterize how many fewer spares you delivered year-over-year in percentage terms?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Carter, let's think about it like this. So we had a commitment to Airbus and we had a commitment to Bombardier to deliver a certain number of engines this year to support their aircraft production plans. We made the decision early October or late September, I guess it was, that we were going to redirect a number of spares to our airline customers to make sure that they had enough assets to be able to fly their plane every day. And while the GTF has a dispatch reliability of like 99.8%, because of these two durability issues that we've been talking about, there were a number of aircraft that were on the ground for unacceptably long time periods. And so working with Airbus, working with Bombardier, we agreed to take production engines and divert it into the spares fleet.","Now there was a charge associated, and that's what Akhil was talking about. It's both Airbus and it's Bombardier. But the fact is we had to do what was right for the customer here. And it gets us behind us. I think the important thing is to look at the number of actual engines that we built in the quarter, which is 120, and we're well on our way to hit that 350 to 400 next year and probably almost doubling that again next year.","So I think Bob and the team have done yeoman's work over at Pratt to get the production issues behind us, to get the durability issues behind us, and the airlines love the engine. And so look, it was unfortunate that we couldn't meet our commitments to Airbus and Boeing, or Airbus and Bombardier, but they understood the need to keep the airline customers up flying and we've done I think the right thing for the business in the long term.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Greg, enjoyed reading the S4.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Me too.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And it's so many questions to ask, but I'll just make it one. It sounds like the overture started with the idea of some type of partnership arrangement. And I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit kind of what that might have looked like and what it would have actually implied for the UTC portfolio. It sounds like it was a quasi breakup of the portfolio is where I'm going.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","I wouldn't go quite that far, Jeff. But I think when I first started these conversations with Kelly earlier this year, it was really around a way to try to unlock the value of a combination of Rockwell and our Aerospace Systems business in the most, I'll say, shareowner-friendly basis that we could come up with.","And so the original proposal that I went to Kelly with and our folks had come up with a structure where we would contribute our Aerospace Systems business, they would contribute their business into a joint venture. We would own about two thirds of it. Rockwell Collins shareowners would own about a third of it, and there's a very tax efficient way to do this and you get all the benefits of the synergies.","After a lot of discussion with Kelly, I know Kelly and his board spent some time going through this, they really had some concerns about how the governance might work with Rockwell Collins only owning a third of the joint venture. And so they came back to us as it says in the S-4 and they suggested that we make an offer for the whole company, which we ultimately did.","This wasn't an idea to break up the portfolio though. I think this was how do you maximize the value of the Aerospace Systems business, how do you get the synergies that you have with Rockwell in a manner that is as shareowner-friendly as you can do, so there's no tax leakage. There was no big fees to pay to anything. It was just a pretty simple transaction. But again, we were still going to control two thirds of the combined partnership and still have all the benefits that would have accrued back to UTC shareowners as a result.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Would this thing have traded, Greg, like the Baker Hughes\/GE thing? Or would it just have been a private partnership between the two?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","No, it would have been a \u2013 well, so it would have been a private partnership, one third owned by, and again, the percentages are maybe a little off, may have been 35% or 38% or even 40% Rockwell Collins and then 66% to 60% UTC. But we would have owned it. The Rockwell Collins shares would have continued to trade publicly which would have been the proxy for at least a third of the value was of the joint venture.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you. Interesting stuff.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, yeah, good morning guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple questions for you. Specifically on Pratt, the $196 million charge I guess you took, you also took about $100 million last year. So why is that justifiably you take it out of the results? I mean isn't that just sort of an operating expense? I mean, I don't know. I mean, seems unfair to me to take it out.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Well, I'm not sure how fairness comes into the equation. The thought was we want to be able to show what the Pratt business is doing on a run rate basis. The fact is the non-recurring gain that we talked about, Akhil, the sale of some assets was also an investment that Pratt had made years ago. So the thought was pull everything out of the segment and keep it at the UTC level so as you can see what the underlying performance is of the business. However you guys want to model it have at it. We're going to be transparent about this thing. That's why we laid it out there, but we're not trying to hide anything. We're simply just trying to say, here's what the run rate business looks like at Pratt & Whitney.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yes, and just for that reason, Ron, just to be clear, consistently what we do is we take larger charges out of any segment. It happened to be Pratt this time. But if it is something at CCS or something else which is non-operational in nature and doesn't happen frequently, I mean this one unfortunately has happened twice now in two years, but we hope this is the end of it and we won't see it again. So we wanted to give a sense of proper operational performance at Pratt. And as Greg said, gains also related to Pratt to some extent and those were pulled out of the segment as well.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, Great. And then maybe just changing gears real quick. Looks like Bombardier might have hit a lottery ticket here with Airbus taking over the C Series. A, question one, if you can say in aggregate, what is your content on the C Series, right? Because if you think about it from the engines and all the Goodrich stuff, the air monitoring equipment and the cells and then all the stuff Collins has on an airplane, you guys are all over that airplane. So just curious, if you can say what is your content in aggregate, because I know you probably can't break it out piece by piece.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yes.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then the second question is, if Airbus does sell 2,000 of these things, which they're talking about, what do you guys have to do to deliver on that? Because all of a sudden, this program might end up being a heck of a lot larger than anybody ever thought it would be.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. I'd say that would be really good news. Look, the combined UTAS, Pratt and Rockwell Collins content on the C Series is a little over, I think it's 34%, 35%. So we have a big chunk of the bill-of-material and therefore a big investment in this aircraft and a lot at stake in seeing that it's successful. I think talking to both Alain and to Tom Enders last week, I said it's a great deal for them. And I think long term it would be a good deal for UTC as well given the content that we have on the aircraft.","Look, in my mind, it was a validation of the Geared Turbofan because the GTF, as you guys know, is the sole-source engine on the C Series. And despite all that's been written about the durability issues, blah, blah, blah, the fact is the engine works and Airbus has high confidence in it or they wouldn't have done this deal. And so to me it was really just validation of GTF works.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay, Ron.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. So maybe switching to the commercial side of the house. In Otis, the adjusted profits were down more year-on-year in Q3 than they were in Q2 and your OE orders turned negative for the first time in a year. So maybe give a little bit of context around how quickly you think that slide can be reversed, particularly as the China pricing doesn't seem to be getting any better. So, I just wondered when you're looking ahead what you think can get that profit or that adjusted profit ex-currency back to a flattish trajectory?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yes, Julian, great question. So first of all, on the price\/mix side in China, this is now the second quarter where we have actually seen some improvement from the trends that we were seeing prior to that. Remember the disconnects used to be a lot higher between units and the order dollar value.","This quarter, while the number is a 8 point disconnect, units grew 8% while dollar orders were flat. Half of that was just due to the function of absence of major projects. As you know, major projects will have higher dollars per unit. And fewer major projects orders booked in the third quarter this year resulted in about half of the disconnect. So, the price\/mix was about 4 points, which is similar to what we saw in the second quarter, which was a lot less, less than half of what we saw in the first quarter. So I think there is some improvement happening there.","There is also this pressure on the commodity side, what the Otis China team is feeling and the rest of the players are feeling as well, which is pushing a little bit better pricing discipline in China, and we are hopeful that we will see some of that result into better price\/mix going forward. There's still a long way to go in China. I'm not saying that we are out of the woods there or the industry is. But certainly, there's gain in share that we're seeing in China and the detailed market segmentation our team has done is proving good in terms of at least the unit order volume growth.","As regards to the overall earnings for Otis, the team is still working hard to make sure that we can be flattish to up in 2018. We're not done with the plans for next year. But clearly, some sign of stabilization in Europe. New equipment orders were up significantly. Our portfolio growth in service was up in a more normal manner in the current quarter. And I think the rate of decline in the service pricing in Europe has been lower in third quarter than it has been for the last several quarters, years. So, we've seen some sign of improvement, but still ways to go.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC","It's Lucy on for Cai. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hi, Lucy.","Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC","A follow-up on the GTF. Can you help us quantify how much the spare engines have helped in alleviating the negative engine margins, and how do you think the mix of spares versus customer deliveries will look going forward?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So the first thing, Lucy, is that the big change you see is in terms of improvement in the aircraft on ground numbers. So, the big benefit that you've seen is by converting some of these engines to spare pool, we've alleviated the pressure and the pain that the airline operators were facing. That's step number one.","In terms of the improvement in Pratt profit outlook, as you recall, we went from being down $200 million to down $125 million for this year. That $75 million essentially is all a function of lower negative engine margin due to this shift in allocation. So I think that's probably what it is.","In my view, Lucy, this is essentially front-running some of the investment we would have had to make in spare pools in any case. Over the years, there is a certain ratio of spare pools to the number of engines that you have out in the field. All we are doing is doing that investment earlier than what would have happened over the next couple of years. I think we probably have one more year of similar level of investment in spare pools, but then that level of overall spares will help manage the growing fleet at GTF in 2019 and 2020. So, a little front-running of investment, but overall not a bad thing.","Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC","Very helpful. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Akhil, just to follow up on that, if you did pull some of those expenses forward, or the shift in spares, you had talked about $1.1 billion worth of new engine margin losses next year. How does this change in accounting treatment affect that loss as we look into next year?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah, it doesn't change the absolute number for the negative engine margin next year, Sam. So that's still $1.1 billion or so. What it does do is it creates a little bit more headwind for Pratt on a year-over-year basis, because negative engine margin this year has come down, next year stays the same. So, it puts a little bit more pressure on Pratt in terms of staying flat for next year in earnings. But they are working on it.","Commercial aftermarket has been a little bit better. We do expect the GTF, the V2500-related shop visits to continue to grow next year. So, we are all in the middle of working through all those dynamics. Pratt Canada should be better. Joint Strike Fighter production is better next year. E&D should be flattish to maybe down. So, I think all those things are in the mix. While there is incremental negative engine margin year-over-year, the absolute number does not change from the $1.1 billion.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then on the pension contribution. Can you talk about what that does to both the book and the cash taxes for this year and next? How should we think about that?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So, for this, the tax benefit is essentially all this year. There is no benefit to the book tax rate. But, certainly, from a cash point of view, we do see a reduction in our cash taxes as a result of the $1.9 billion contribution. And if you go back and look at the chart I had at the last webcast, which was middle of September, there was a reconciliation which took into account $1.9 billion going down to roughly $1.2 billion impact on cash flow for this year adjusted for the tax benefit that we got. So we took that into account when we gave the new guidance of the $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The cash benefit on taxes was offset against the $1.9 billion.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good. Thank you.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey guys. Just obviously CCS trends pretty robust across the board in terms of sales trends. Thinking about just the high single digit growth in non-resi and commercial construction, commercial HVAC in North America, would you say that that's ahead of the market, in line with the market? Do you think you're gaining share generally in commercial HVAC?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah, I think it was up about 8% in the quarter which was the strongest quarter we've seen there in some time for commercial HVAC. I think what it really is, Nigel, is just the introduction of new products. We've been talking about the new big chillers that we've got out there, up to 3,000 tons. And this is just really the payoff from the investment that they've been making at the Carrier commercial HVAC business. It's coming through in markets. So I think we're probably gaining a little bit of share. We'll see when the final numbers come out here shortly, but I think we feel pretty good about where we are.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So it sounds like it a little bit ahead of the market. And then how do you then describe the price\/cost dynamic in CCS? Obviously, we're seeing commodity prices moving higher by the week. So how is that looking today? And how is it looking into 2018?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yes, that's the several million dollar question for 2018 that we are still working through. Certainly, if you break down the markets, Nigel, I think North America residential business, probably seeing the best level of discipline in terms of passing some of the cost inflation through price increases. Other portions of CCS, not so much. I think commercial HVAC continues to see significant price competition as the fire and security business and the commercial refrigeration business. So I think it's more a phenomena where North America residential feels good in terms of the ability to pass some of the cost inflation. But the other places, probably the dynamic shifts adversely. Both in 2017, we have seen that and I think that pressure will continue in 2018.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Greg, the hire you made of Judy over at Otis, it's the first outside leader of, if I can recall, for one of your operating segments in some time. So I'm just curious, can you talk about the desire to go outside the organization to look for a President. It's kind of been tougher to find a sticky President in that business for a few years. And also, does this equate to a fresh look for 2020 goals?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Well let me answer the second question first and the answer to that is no. The 2020 goals are the 2020 goals, and Judy and I have had some long conversations about that. I think we've got clear line of sight to the 2020 goals at Otis. I would say when Philippe decided to leave earlier this year, we had a robust slate of internal candidates and there were four or five people that I was confident internally could do a great job running Otis. But I also thought this is an opportunity to look outside to bring some additional talent into the organization. And so we conducted a search. We talked to a lot of folks out there.","And I got to tell you, when we talked to Judy, I said this is absolutely the right person for the job. She's got a great background. She worked at IBM. She's worked at Lockheed and she's worked at Siemens. And so she's got big company experience. She knows international and I just thought she added a lot to the senior leadership team. And again, it's a unique situation.","We typically have a very robust leadership development process here, again lots of folks that can do that job. But this is just a unique alignment of the stars, I would say, where we found someone really, really super that I thought would bring the focus on execution as well as a global perspective to Otis. The challenge at Otis, as you guys know, it's a decentralized organization. It's a little bit like herding cats. You've got to have strong process. You've got to have a strong focus on execution. And I think Judy brings all of those things to the table here.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. No, I think it's a good hire. And one follow-up, the size of the UTAS gain, is it $25 million or so, Akhil?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. In fact, a little less than that, yes, about (37:50).","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just to follow up on Otis China. Good news that price pressure doesn't seem to be getting worse. But it's still been tough for a while and now there's probably raw material pressure on top of that. And I guess my question is whether you believe that's starting to impact some of your small competitors more. Do you think you're closer to a shake-out of some of the excess capacity? Are companies more willing to look to partner or get acquired or exit the market? Any market changes you're seeing in Otis China now?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Not to a great extent, Matt. That is our expectation. We are certainly seeing, if you look at the publicly disclosed results of the second-tier players, people underneath Otis, some of who supply to all of the elevator manufacturers in China, they've seen significant profit reductions over the last year, almost 25% or so. And so that situation cannot sustain itself for very long periods of time.","We haven't quite seen a shakedown or a reduction in order capacity yet. That is what will happen over time, but certainly there is more resilience in the Chinese market. The profit expectations are probably much lower than what Western world would expect. And as a result, companies tend to stay longer than they would in some other markets. But I think that's again a situation which won't last forever. However, it is still continuing and keeping a little bit of pressure on the earnings in China.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just switching gears a little bit on the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS, if you could talk about what drove some of the strength. How much was initial provisioning of the benefit, if you can elaborate on that?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Sure. So provisioning was pretty strong at UTAS and some of it is just as a result of the decision we took to reallocate the engines away from the airframe manufacturers, aircraft manufacturers to the spare pool. That is counted as provisioning in the UTAS sales. So that number was higher, to some extent driven by that decision. As Carroll said, that that number unfortunately creates a higher eliminations at UTC level as we have to eliminate the intercompany profit on those transactions.","Aftermarket at Pratt was up, largely driven by the V2500. The strength there has been continuing. The number of shop visits going again, no surprise there. I think it's coming in a little faster than we had expected. That's why the aftermarket business for Pratt has been growing faster than our original guidance. Let Carroll give additional color on that.","Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.","Yes. Sheila, it's a product of both higher volumes and shop visits on the V2500, really good content there as well. The 4s and the 2s, the legacy models, they continue to be in attrition mode and the shop visits were down as we expected, but we saw a bit higher content on our legacy models than we had expected. Some higher life-limited part replacement by some operators that's driving that strength. And as we talked about earlier in the call, some of those going to pull through.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Greg. Greg, a quick one on just on Otis, just circling back. I know you've made a lot of investments in kind of the service transformation. I think you're supposed to have full deployment across all your mobility devices as we get out to 2018. How do we think about just the same profile regarding the E&D investments? I know that was stair stepping up. But should that continue or does it stabilize at some point?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","No, I think, Peter, it's a good question. As you think about first of all in the service deployments, we've got about 13,000 mobile devices out there through the end of the third quarter. As you know, we've got about 31,000 mechanics out there. So we've been rolling these things out, and change management is the key, obviously trying to train the mechanics to use the devices and to get the productivity. So we've been rolling it out quickly, but trying again to do it in a rational fashion. In fact, we probably won't do all 31,000. There will be some markets where it just doesn't make sense. It's not a big enough market to pay for the investment. But we're on track with that initiative.","Similarly, on the R&D investment, we've stepped it up over these last couple of years. There's not going to be another big increment up in the coming years. I think there's plenty to do right now with the money that we've allocated for R&D. And I think in Otis, as we said, they've doubled the number of new product variations that they can offer and just in the last two years by this increase in R&D. You got to keep in mind that an average R&D program at Otis is somewhere between $1 million and $3 million as opposed to $1 billion and $3 billion on the Aerospace side. So it's obviously a different animal over there, but there's lots to do and I think we've adequately resourced the R&D function at this point.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's helpful color. Thanks, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On UTAS, can you talk about the A320neo Nacelles? And Airbus is moving to take those in-house. And could you walk through what happened there and what you expect to be the impact on UTAS?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","So, okay. It's a great question, Doug, and as with all great questions, it's going to take a little bit of background to fully discuss it. But we have been the supplier of the A320 Nacelle for some period of time. And with the neo, we were selected for the Nacelle for the life of the program. As part of that contract, we were guaranteed all of the volume through the early 2020s, and then that kind of steps down through 2024, where I think we're guaranteed about 50% of the volume.","Airbus came to us a couple of years ago us and said they were thinking about in-sourcing. They wanted to get pricing from us on the various components so that they could in-source the Nacelle. And we obviously talked a lot to them about that. They decided to go ahead in the mid-2020s to offer a different Nacelle to our customers. At the same time, we'll continue to offer our Nacelle to the customers through the life of the program, as is our right under the contract. And we think, again, we have a great Nacelle. We've got we think to be a competitive one from a cost standpoint and we'll unfortunately be competing with our customer in the offering of that Nacelle in the late 2020s.","But I got to believe that the customers, once they have the Pratt GTF with the UTAS Nacelle, the switching costs will be somewhat significant. So, I think the prospects of us losing that business completely are pretty low. But we'll keep working with Airbus. And I think we've seen this play before where the aircraft manufacturers decide to in-source, and then after a while they recognize that some things they can do really well and some things not as well as some of their supplies. So we'll keep working with Airbus and we're going to keep our focus on delivering the best quality Nacelle to our customers.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But you went through the situation with Boeing on the 777 landing gear, where they clearly were looking for a lower price. When you look across these situations, how pervasive do you see this in UTAS where you're getting this additional pressure from the OEMs?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","The focus from the OEMs to reduce cost is never ever ending. We saw it with PFS 1. We've been talking to Boeing about PFS 2. And the fact is, we recognize we have to continue to take cost out of our product if we want to be competitive, and we've told both Boeing and Airbus we'll continue to work with them to find ways to do that across all of the portfolio. But this is not going to end.","The landing gear was a particularly difficult discussion. We've been making the 777 landing gear for a very, very long time. Boeing asked for a large price reduction, which we could not accommodate, which would have ended up us losing money on a product with no aftermarket. And so we declined and Boeing decided to re-source it, as is their right under the contract. So, we're going to do what's right for the business. I'm not going to start shipping my margin to the OEMs though without some way to recapture that over the long term.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","The other element, Doug, as you well know, on this whole equation is technology, right. So to the extent we can come up with differentiated products that can provide significant value to the customers, whether it's the airlines or the airframers, there should be no reason why we should worry about that. But to the extent we go down the path of offering just commoditized products or print-to-order type of business -","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Build-to-print.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Build-to-print type of business, which will be generally low margin, it's okay if we lose some of that. But it's not going to be just a sheer transfer of margin from our shareholders to somebody else's shareholders with no return for us.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","And if you think about it, the whole premise behind the Rockwell Collins acquisition is to find ways to be more innovative on the airframe, to take weight out, to take cost out and to offer innovative solutions to the airframers. And it's the scale that they bring to us gives us the opportunity to do things that we couldn't do on our own. And I think that's what you have to focus on with the Rockwell Collins, is there is a huge value proposition to our customers with this acquisition.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But it seems like a tough environment. I would have thought the Goodrich acquisition would also have had that argument I would say even more strongly because there was more overlap.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Well, there was more overlap from a mechanical systems content standpoint. You're exactly right. But if you think about what's going to drive the next generation of airframe decisions, it's going to be about connected aircraft. It's going to be about communications systems. It's going to be about the ability to take digital across all of the systems on the airframe. And that's one of the benefits to us, is we've got all of these systems that we can now connect and that we can do diagnostics on that can really differentiate our offering and add real value to both the OEMs as well as to the airlines by providing real-time data, real-time diagnostics, real-time spare parts availability.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","All right, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Doug's question, Greg. Boeing will say that they've not seen any benefit from the merger, and that's their objection to Collins. So, if you look at the landing gear, you look at the Nacelle, what would you point to as benefits that they've gotten from the Goodrich acquisition?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Well, there is something called PFS 1, which was a significant concession on the part of our Aerospace Systems business to take cost out, to reduce the cost to Boeing on the 787. And it was a big bite at the apple, I would tell you. And we have been working, as you know, to try and cover some of those costs. The problem at UTAS today of course is, we don't make any money on any product that we sell to the Boeing Company. None. In fact, we lose money. And so, Dave Gitlin and his whole team are laser focused on how to take cost out to overcome the headwinds associated with all of these new OEM programs versus the old OEM programs.","I would tell you, Boeing got a benefit from the acquisition. And look, we're six to nine to 12 months away from closing on the Rockwell Collins deal, so I can't comment specifically on where the savings will come from. But I know that Kelly Ortberg and Dave Gitlin have been working, thinking about from an innovation standpoint, what can we do together, where can we take cost out, where can we take weight out, where can we add value across the connected airplanes. So look, it's too early to say, to point specifically to where the benefits will come from. But it's one of the things that we're going to commit to the airlines and to the airframers is we will provide value to you guys because of this.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","And let me just get one follow-up probably for Akhil. To get a low single digit growth at Aero, we need a step-up of a couple of hundred million dollars in revenues in the fourth quarter. Can you just tell us where that may be coming from?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah, so George, year-to-date, they're about 1% up. You're talking UTC Aerospace Systems organic growth. 1% is low single digit. And so all they need to do is fourth quarter of something similar. And I think where we see the change happening is their military business, which was down, slightly down in the third quarter, is expected to be up in a decent amount in the fourth quarter. That's based on the timing of some of the programs that shifted from third to fourth quarter. So we feel the ability for UTAS to get the 1% to 2% type of growth in fourth quarter is pretty real, and hopefully we get there.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Thank you, George.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Hayes for closing remarks.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Latoya. So again, a really solid third quarter, good results year-to-date, high confidence in the year. I think that's reflected in the uptick that we gave in the full year guidance. Carroll Lane and the team will be here, along with Akhil, the rest of the day to answer any questions you might have. So I want to thank you all for listening, and have a great day. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day, everyone."],"21058":["United Technologies Corp.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's a presentation available for download on the UTC's website at www.utc.com.","Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results for continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of non-reoccurring and\/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings include its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. So 2016 a solid year for UTC we delivered on the commitments that we set back in December 2015 and today we reported adjusted EPS of $6.61 just a $0.01 above the high end of the outlook range that we provided. I think importantly sales $57.2 billion at organic growth of 2% and free cash flow to net income was 93% even with the continued investments in the Aerospace ramp. Hopefully with this course within our expectations with the range for the year and of course we continue to be disciplined with our capital deployment in 2016. We returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends on top of the $10 billion from 2015.","Looking forward to 2017 we remain confident in our full year targets. Adjusted EPS again in the $6.30 to $6.60 range and sales of $57.5 billion to $59 billion again with organic growth rate projected to be somewhere between 2% and 4% of course it\u2019s on top of the 2% organic growth we reported in 2016.","2016 we saw a number of significant accomplishments across all the business units. Well Pratt & Whitney and our Aerospace Systems business had impressive years in the area of innovation and they achieved some noteworthy program milestones. We feel good about the GTF accomplishments that engine is now in service powering 46 A320neo and CSeries aircraft with more than 82,000 revenue hours.","We are also adjusting some variability issues on the GTF. We have some fixes identified and of course we\u2019re supporting our customers in the field. With that though we remained very excited about the value proposition of the engine since we\u2019re meeting or exceeding both the fuel and noise and the emission targets right out of the gate.","Pratt was also awarded the engine contract last year for the B-21 Raider. With that, Pratt has added another program to the already impressive military portfolio including the Joint Strike Fighter and the refueling tanker. Pratt\u2019s military business was truly set up for a very bright future. Aerospace systems last year we supported 15 critical program milestones including first flights, entering the service and aircraft certification across the multitude of commercial, military and business jet platforms.","At Otis, 2016 marked the year of market segment gain for new equipment orders globally and most impressively in China. These gains were driven by higher engineering developments investments that was up almost 30% in the year. It was also helped by better market segmentation and improved sales coverage. But we\u2019re not just investing in new products we\u2019re also investing in service transformation including new IT platforms and digital tools for our 31,000 service technicians. All of this to increase our productivity and improve the customer experience.","As you know driving cost out of the business is part of DNA. As the example CCS expanded their margins by another 60 basis points in 2016. Over the last four years since 2012 Climate, Controls and Securities have achieved 400 basis points of margin expansion all along continue to increase R&D and spending. The investments of course drive new product introduction and last year CCS introduced over 100 new products into the market.","Aerospace Systems another great story; last year they had about $300 million of adverse impact from declines in their high margin legacy products and they were able to offset almost all of that through product cost reductions, lower E&D and lower SG&A really solid performance by Mr. Gitlin and team. So I\u2019m pleased with the progress being made in each of the businesses and despite the continued macro uncertainties we\u2019re confident in the UTC\u2019s 2017 outlook. Our continued focus on the key priorities around innovation, execution, cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation were a major factor in achieving 2016 results and they will continue to help us meet our 2020 goals of delivering a long term sustainable growth at UTC.","With that let me hand it over and Akhil and Carroll to take you guys through the results. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thanks Greg. So let\u2019s talk a little about Q4. We reported good performance in line with expectations and what we had said in December. Adjusted EPS of $1.56 was up 2% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis the earnings were $1.26 so that had $0.30 of restructuring and other significant items about $90 million from restructuring. We talked about some pension liability reduction initiatives that we had taken in October that we run out in October that came with a one-time non-cash charge of $423 million or about $0.32. We also redeemed some high coupon debt about $2.25 billion of that in November and that gave rise to $164 million or $0.13 charge also in the quarter partially offsetting that on the positive side, we had additional tax settlements within the US IRS and that gave us a benefit collectively between that and some French tax law changes of about $0.23 below the line that also we have pulled out of our adjusted EPS.","Overall cash flow came in strong 116% for fourth quarter, 93% of net income for the full year slightly above expectation, so pleased with that performance. If you look at the organic growth on Slide 3, no major changes in the trends that we were seeing throughout the year, just some minor puts and takes here. Americas for the commercial businesses had continued with a strong growth. Otis particularly up 4% in the quarter year-over-year that was on top of 10% growth that they had in Q4, 2015 over 2014 so again strong performance. CCS was up 2% largely on both residential and commercial HVAC showing decent growth.","Within EMEA actually the change the data decline that you see on the page it\u2019s entirely a function of Middle East. Middle East sales saw the pressure from the order reduction that we\u2019ve seen in prior quarter than were actually down 35% year-over-year for commercial HVAC and nearly 40% down year-over-year for the Otis new equipment business. Excluding that Europe was actually up low single-digit for Otis largely on the strength of new equipment business and CCS was down low single-digit. Asia was flat continued pressure from Otis. China new equipment which was down low double-digit 12% and both the CCS and Otis were both up in rest of Asia nicely.","Now Aerospace the quarter is not really meaningful because you\u2019ll recall we had some volatility last year between third and fourth quarter as a result of the new logistic center that we had launched last year in Q3, so what is more meaningful certainly from my perspective is looking at the second half in totality and if you do that, we were up 4% to 5% for UTAS and Pratt combined in the second half which is more in line with what we expect in 2017 and going forward through our 2020 target, so in line with that so the fourth quarter numbers is not that meaningful there.","The interesting thing and encouraging thing frankly for me was being orders we saw pockets of improvements in some of our commercial businesses. Firstly for the first time this year on a quarterly basis CCS equipment orders were up. They were up 2% in fact if you include services they were up 6% year-over-year so an encouraging sign as we go into next year. Otis China new equipment orders were also flat on a dollar basis. Now we all know one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this is still encouraging.","And as I said in December obviously Q1, 2017 we will see probably the lowest organic growth at CCS in terms of their full year outlook. We also expect EPS for first quarter to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 largely driven by two facts I think, if you look at our bridge for the full year that we shared with you in December. We expect $0.32 of good news from share buybacks or lower share counts. First quarter will have a smaller portion of that, so it\u2019s only $0.04 to $0.05 good news in the first quarter. Secondly for the commercial business both Otis and CCS we expect to see better year-over-year profit performance in the second half than in the first half and so that\u2019s impacting the first quarter to some extent, but overall pretty good start.","And with that let me hand it over to Carroll to walk through the BU detail. Carroll?","Carroll Lane","Thanks Akhil. I\u2019m on Slide 4 and I\u2019ll be speaking to the segment at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder there\u2019s an appendix on Slide 14 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. So Otis; in the quarter sales were flat to the prior year at constant currency while profit was down 4%, foreign exchange translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings. Profit in the quarter benefited from higher service volume, productivity and mark-to-market FX tailwind. These benefits were more than offset by continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA as well as additional E&D investments.","New equipment sales were down 2% driven by low double-digit decline in China and close to 40% decline in the Middle East offsetting these headwinds we continue to see strong growth in North America with new equipment sales of 13% as well as solid growth in Europe. Europe was up 7%. Otis service sales were up 3% with continued growth in modernization and repair. Maintenance sales were up slightly. New equipment orders were up 3% in the quarter and saw a mid-teen growth in EMEA and low double-digit growth in Asia excluding China and this is partially offset by North America down about 20% of tough compares. You recall last year North America orders were up over 50% in the fourth quarter.","New equipment orders in China were flat on a dollar basis but up 5% in units and that\u2019s despite a market estimated to be down mid-single-digit. For the full year operating profit was down about 6% in constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Organic sales excluding China were up 4%. FX translation for the year had a 2 point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit.","Turning to Slide 5, Climate, Controls and Security sales were up 5% in constant currency in the quarter that was all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 5% driven by acquisitions and lower cost partially offset by around $15 million of impact from the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound. FX translation was a 2 point headwind to sales in earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter with strength in North America residential HVAC offset by declines in Global, Fire and Security and Middle East commercial HVAC.","Transport refrigeration was down 1% with container down slightly and that was a sequential improvement after being down almost 30% through the third quarter. Commercial refrigeration was up 9%. Total equipment orders in CCS were up 2% for the quarter and up for the first time this year, if you all noted. Strong growth in commercial refrigeration up nearly 20% combined with high single-digit growth in fire and security products more than offset continued pressure in North America truck trailer.","Global commercial HVAC equipment orders declined 5% and that was primarily driven by the Middle East which was down over 50%. For the full year CCS grew operating profits by $130 million at actual FX with organic sales down 1%. FX translation for the year had an unfavourable 1 point impact to sales and profit. Operating profit growth was driven by continued productivity, restructuring gains and tailwinds from commodities.","Shifting to Aerospace on Slide 6. Pratt & Whitney\u2019s sales were flat organically in the quarter. The military business saw low single-digit growth driven by OEM, development programs and aftermarket. We also saw growth in commercial OEM driven by favorable mix and development revenues. For the year, we delivered a total of 138 GTF engines and now support 13 operators in service. In the quarter we delivered 62 GTF engines supporting customer requirements and that was in the highest output for a quarter to-date on the GTF for Pratt.","Commercial aftermarket was down 6% in the quarter. In the large engine business the transactional aftermarket was up 3% and above tough prior year compares. However this strength was more than offset by unfavorable long-term contract adjustments for fleet management program. Pratt Canada aftermarket saw a growth in the quarter up 6%. Pratt operating profit was down $80 million driven by the unfavorable contract adjustments in the commercial aftermarket, additional ramp related costs and unfavorable mix in military engines and that did included the absence of F117. This was partially offset by tailwind from pension, FX and lower negative engine margin. For the full year organic sales were up 6% and operating profit was down $162 million. Higher negative engine margin E&D and ramp related investments were partially offset by drop through from the double-digit sales growth in the commercial aftermarket as well as tailwind from pension and FX.","Turning to Slide 7, Aerospace Systems operating profit was up 4% in the quarter on flat organic sales. Commercial OEM sales were down 1%. Continued growth on next generation platforms was more than offset by decline in legacy volumes. Commercial aftermarket was up 3% with 4% growth in parts and repair combined and a slight decline in provisioning. As we\u2019ve seen throughout the year military sales declined in the quarter down 4% and that included the continued headwind from the completion of the C5 Nacelle retrofit program that wrapped up earlier in the year.","Operating profit growth was driven by drop through on higher commercial aftermarket sales. Continued cost reduction and pension tailwind partially offset by unfavorable commercial OEM mix and lower military volumes. In line with expectations full year operating profit was essentially flat on 2% organic growth. Strong performance in cost reduction offset new program mix in military volume headwinds.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay, thanks Carroll. So overall 2016 no drama, at the end of the day. Lot of challenges throughout the year but good execution by the entire team as a result we were able to meet all the commitments that we laid out for the year, so that\u2019s 2016. Let\u2019s focus now on 2017 for just a second. Lot of challenges ahead of us. I think all of us recognized we\u2019ve got a new administration in Washington which has an agenda to be friendly to business and I think, we\u2019re anxious to see how all of that will play out certainly tax reform is the biggest single item that we\u2019re focused on this year.","On top of that, however there is always the issue of FX. We recall we\u2019ve pegged the Euro at 1.05 to the $1, we\u2019re little bit better than that today. I think it\u2019s 107 but FX remains a watch item for the year especially with the impacts of tax reform potentially impacting the exchange rates. We are also of course closely watching the economic environments on both China and Europe our second and third largest markets. Also of course what happens with BREXIT and also the elections in France and Germany will create some uncertainty as we move through the year.","Despite all of this, I\u2019m very confident we have a portfolio industry leading businesses. We\u2019ve got a global footprint, we got a global scale, we got a strong balance sheet as well as an experienced management team. All of those things give me a high confidence in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we wait out of month ago. We, of course, remain committed to the key priorities, we\u2019re going to continue to innovate for growth. We\u2019re increasing R&D investments in both Otis and CCS and we\u2019re going to continue to drive cost out through restructuring and product cost reduction.","We also remained disciplined in our capital allocation. We recalled last year we had to place over $1 billion to $2 billion for M&A, we ended up only doing about $700 million but again trying to be disciplined with your money. This year we\u2019ve got a place over $3.5 billion for share buyback and $1 billion to $2 billion for M&A again. High confidence that we\u2019ll continue to buy back stock as we continue to see intrinsic value of UTC significantly in excess of the current share price.","In total we remain on track to return $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017. Entire organization is focused on execution and meeting these commitments. These include commitments to both our customers, our shareowners and our employees. We\u2019ve never been better positioned for growth. We get strong backlog and these great four global franchises that all provide recurring revenues and resilient business model. UTC is uniquely positioned to deliver shareholder value well into the future.","So with that let me stop and open it up for questions. Brian?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question will come from the line Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Sam Pearlstein","Can you talk a little bit more about the Pratt and Whitney aftermarket? You mentioned a long-term contract impact, I'm trying to - I guess can you size it? Is it one time; is it something that is ongoing? And is there any way to read into that how you were able to get price in terms of the fourth quarter because that's usually when we would see the pull forward in terms of - that\u2019s probably more the parts side.","Greg Hayes","Yes, Sam I think you\u2019re exactly right. The contract adjustments we typically see these on a quarterly basis at Pratt. We go through all of our - I think we got some 80 long-term contracts out there with the airlines and we look at each one of these every quarter because there\u2019s some issues that we\u2019ve seen in the V2500, we went back and we had some negative adjustments on some long-term contracts specifically related to the V program. Again I would say it\u2019s not a one-off it\u2019s just something we look at every quarter. We recall, we get good news, some quarters we get bad news, some quarters. This year I think net probably $200 million of bad news on these contract adjustments, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. The good news of course is, we\u2019re selling more spare parts and you saw that I think first spare parts were up 3% or so in the fourth quarter and that was off of a really difficult compare for the 2015 where I think we were about 19%. So wouldn\u2019t read anything into it, I think it was just kind of one off thing at Pratt clearly something we had anticipated as we started looking at this. And the reason Pratt\u2019s got at the low end of the guidance range for the year.","Akhil Johri","Keeping mind Sam that for the full year, Pratt commercial aftermarket was 10% up which is exactly what I think we had said sometime middle of the year. So we\u2019ve seen some good strength on the transactional side as Greg side. Some of it was driven by some of these issues that we\u2019ve seen unfortunately the reverse side of that shows up in our FMP contracts and so the net-net is still a pretty good solid story.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland","Greg, I wanted to ask about the GTF and just what you guys have been seeing in terms of in-service reliability. Clearly you\u2019ve been swapping out some engines there\u2019ve been some to come off wing. I just wondered if you could speak to, how that\u2019s trending and what you guys are seeing in terms of delivery to spare engines and how that trended versus your original expectations and just sort of what the implications are for how that engine is performing given it\u2019s got such a high level of FMP\u2019s.","Greg Hayes","Carter, that\u2019s a good question. As we exited the year, we saw really two issues around the durability I would say with engine. We\u2019ve got 82,000 hours now in service on the engine and we\u2019re starting to see some issues out there but it\u2019s really related to two specific things and one we\u2019ve been talking about since probably the middle of last year which is the combustor liner is not having in some harsh environments like India. We\u2019re not getting the light bottom that combustor liner that we had expected so there is a redesign that\u2019s being implemented we\u2019ll get those out there in service later this year. Second issue is, oil seal or a carbon seal where we\u2019re seeing again some premature failures on that. We\u2019re working with the supplier on that to correct that, again we\u2019ve got a fix in place it should be delivered by about May I think of this year.","So these are annoying things for the airlines, they obviously closed them some disruption. We\u2019ve got a lot of spares out there to try to keep the fleet runnier than the fact, we\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job with supporting them. It is still a pain for the airline so a little bit of noise in the system but I would characterize it as typical of a new program introduction and we exited the year on a good trajectory for production. I think we built 62 engines in the fourth quarter. This year we\u2019re going to build 350 to 400 big chunk of those, over 50 off those engines will be spares to again to support the fleet going up there to make sure when we do have these issues the customers are not impacted too much so, just normal growing pains in any new engine. But I would say nothing causing us to lose a lot of sleep.","Akhil Johri","And Carter just to put in perspective, you know this industry better than I do but certainly to put in perspective historically when we introduced engines in addition to some teething pains, we also struggled with fuel burn and some of the other commitments and the good news is that, this time at least those key performance characteristic are being met right out of the box and that\u2019s unusual and so that makes us feel good. The gear architecture is holding up very well and so the fundamentals of the engines are still very sound and it delivers the fuel performance. So some teething issues will get through this is always part of what happens and the good news is, we\u2019re catching these early and we will fix these as soon as we can.","Greg Hayes","Thank you. To Akhil\u2019s point too, Carter I would just say I think the gear system has performed flawlessly and this oil seal issue that we talk about has nothing to do with the gear system. So medium [ph] fuel burn we\u2019re doing everything, there is been no order cancelations. It really just normal new product introduction issues that everybody goes through.","Carter Copeland","And just as a clarification on that topic, do you build in cushion into the long-term service agreement to account for this sort of stuff?","Greg Hayes","Yes, absolutely. We take a look at all of these contracts. You build in a warranty cushion if you will in terms of but, you\u2019re going to have to get away for the first couple of years. So we don\u2019t see any big drama on the long-term FMP\u2019s as a result of this. Again we\u2019ve got fixes identified, we get them in the fleet this year. These contracts less or run over 10 plus year, so there is not flying the hours which is the good news.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Lucy Guo with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Lucy Guo","This is Lucy on for Cai. Can you talk about the moving parts of the Trump administration policies in terms of any tax cuts or the border adjustments and whatever manufacturing implications maybe?","Greg Hayes","Sure, Lucy. Well first of all, we obviously have been following the Trump administration closely in terms of what you\u2019re talking about on tax reform and it looks like we\u2019re going to be following the Chairman Brady blueprint out of Ways of Means which would lower the top rate to somewhere around 20% eliminate the deductibility of interest but also provide for immediate expensing of capital, also provide for a territorial system which is really good news for us because as you know we\u2019ve got about $6 billion of cash sitting overseas that we can\u2019t bring back to the US, very cost effectively, so we look at this as a huge opportunity to again drive growth in the business and growth here in the US by being able to bring cash back.","There is still some question mark around border adjustability and we are net exporter, so if that were to remain in place probably a positive for us, but again there is a lot of moving pieces in tax reform and we will be actively involved in the debate. Again the good news is, if it does happen this year it\u2019s going to be a net positive for the US economy.","Lucy Guo","Great and can you just say, is it net positive or favorable or not?","Greg Hayes","Well I would like to say it\u2019s going to be a net positive but as you know Lucy, the devil is always in the detail around taxes. Our reflective tax rate is about 28%, if they drop the rate to 20% or even 15% obviously that would be helpful. Lose the deductibility on interest which you know we\u2019ve got about $1 billion of interest expense a year so that would hurt. Again it will all be what happens in the transition rules too and how do you transition in the lower rate, how do you transition in the border adjustability. But net-net I think it\u2019s positive even if our effective tax rate doesn\u2019t drop all the way down to 20% just having access to foreign in cash to territorial system is a very, very positive net for the US economy.","Lucy Guo","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel","Greg, you\u2019ve talked a lot about innovation and focus on new products R&D is up a little bit and in 2016, where are you initiatives for 2017 and what will see the spending on other than obviously improving GTF?","Greg Hayes","Yes, so if you think about we spent about $2.3 billion. We saw probably the biggest increase percentage wise at Otis and then I think it\u2019s just some deferred maintenance where we haven\u2019t been spending enough on new product introduction. So you\u2019ll see Otis, E&D go up a little bit again this year as we look both to introduce new products as well as to help on the service side as under the service tools. As far as the Aerospace businesses go, Pratt ought to start coming down the E&D curve here relatively soon, I think we\u2019ve got one more big, first we have got the MRJ certification I think that happens in the first quarter. We got Embraer out there. I think once those get behind us, we should start to see E&D tail off and trying to deal these reliability problems has caused a little bit of additional E&D but that\u2019s not really significant.","I\u2019m saying that Aerospace Systems I think we ought to see that numbers start to tail off as you get some of these new program introductions behind us.","Howard Rubel","And then just as a follow-up on Otis. You very much called out the change in trajectory with orders and it sounds like there is a lot of organizational items that went into this. Could you elaborate a little bit on this customer touch or what is it in the organization that made for this change?","Greg Hayes","So a couple of things I would say, Howard. One thing is, Philippe is putting a management team we still have the typical Otis structure which is really based on branch offices and regions but we now have a President of Service Business, we also have a President globally of the new Equipment business and the idea here is to drive commonality and to drive best practices across all of the Otis organization and sometimes you should know when a decentralized organization like Otis things might not always be as easy to change as you would like. And so I think Philippe with this new organization is really encouraging the collaboration and trying to again push best practices throughout the entire organization.","For instance we look at our business in Japan, we\u2019ve got cancelation rate of less than 2%, globally it\u2019s north of 5%. So I think we can learn in Japan. Similarly what we\u2019re doing with new products coming out of France and coming out of Spain. I think we can do some things and use some of that knowledge to help us in our businesses here in North America and South America. So a lot of things to do from the organizational standpoint but the key is focus. The new equipment market again very competitive. It\u2019s about driving cost on the service side. It\u2019s about including the customer experience.","We talk about these 31,000 service mechanics at Otis. Those are the touch points for our customers. Those are the people that represent Otis to the customer and giving those folks the right tools is imperative. We are starting rolling out some of these digital tools in Hong Kong here in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll roll out digital tools to about half of the service technicians this year that will cover about 75% of our total service sales so, a lot of things to do, a lot of best practices and it starts at the top of having the right organization, but I think Philippe and team are on track.","Akhil Johri","Yes, on the new equipment side Howard I think some of the more encouraging things I have seen is really thorough segmentation of the market looking specifically targeted sales force additions. So seeing markets where maybe it\u2019s a tier 3 city in China or Bangalore in India where we are underrepresented vis-\u00e0-vis some of the other sales people from other companies and adding selectively sales force in those markets to provide better coverage, so it\u2019s really a very deep down analysis with targeted investments beyond just the new products staff and other things that Greg talked about. So really happy with the projects we\u2019ve seen on the equipment side there.","Howard Rubel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Julian Mitchell","My question was on Otis. You talked back in December about maybe a slightly narrowing or at least leveling out of the price mix headwind in 2017 for Otis. I was just wondering in China it does like as if the price and mix declines are kind of narrowing in your order book at least, maybe just give some color around that?","Akhil Johri","Julian I would say differently because it did narrow. If you think about it, our orders were up in units 5% and dollars were flat, right so the gap was only 5 points this time compared to a larger gap that we\u2019ve seen in the earlier quarters. On the pricing side, we did see pricing pressure go down to 6% to 7% range from the 9% range that we\u2019ve seen before and if you recall from our December conversation that is what our plan is for next year. Now obviously one quarter does not make a trend and the local team would still say it\u2019s very competitive out there in China, a lot depends on what happens with the policies on the real estate side and the housing markets in China. But certainly Q4 was a little more encouraging than what we\u2019ve seen for the first three quarters.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks and just a quick follow-up, did you see the same in Europe, how\u2019s the pricing in the EMEA sort of particularly aftermarket business right now.","Akhil Johri","Unfortunately not much of a change there, so Europe service business has seen similar level of pricing pressure that we\u2019ve seen historically. The real thing there that will change that as you know is two things. One is inflation because most of our contracts have built in price increases related to customer price inflations etc. and we\u2019ve seen virtually no sign of that, so that starts to change that will automatically ease some of the pricing pressure. The second thing that will probably change that dynamic will be greater strength in the new equipment business because that will better conversion and it will also drive a little easing of the comparative pressure on some of the people.","So there at least we saw some signs, the new equipment orders in Europe excluding Middle East were up 13% for the year. Right. That\u2019s a pretty strong sign of new equipment project, the modernization side is also up strongly. The backlog for modernization in Europe was up over 30%, so when you look at those data points it\u2019s encouraging but really not much change in the service pressure yet. It is a long-term story it will probably take another year or two before we will see that.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.","David Strauss","Greg, F35 obviously the new administration have taken a lot of interest in that pushing on the cost side, given you\u2019re the engine provider can you talk about how you might be participating in that as well?","Greg Hayes","Just to be clear, we negotiate separately from Lockheed on the engine, we negotiate directly with the Joint Program Office, the JPO. As we\u2019ve said for number of years we remain committed to a cost curve that we establish back in 2010, which is essentially an 88% learning curve meaning that every time we double production we\u2019ll take the price or the cost down by about 12% and we remain on that 88% learning curve. I think we\u2019re just on lot - LRIP 11 negotiations right now [indiscernible] drama with us and JPO on cost as we continue to meet the commitments we have there. Obviously Lockheed has got some work to do, but I think even Mrs. Houston [ph] said yesterday they\u2019re coming down to cost to curb nicely as well, they\u2019ll have a JSF out there next a lot less than $90 million from over $100 million today. So there is cost reduction coming, volumes are picking up and it\u2019s a great aircraft. I think if you ask the Marines, they like the aircraft in service and certainly the Israelis and some of the other foreign buyers are very happy with the aircraft. So there\u2019s always going to be pressure on price what is the biggest DOD procurement program in history. But I think Lockheed is committed to continue cost reduction as Pratt & Whitney.","David Strauss","Okay, thanks and as a quick follow-up on the outlook call Greg I think you talked about the idea that, we could see share repurchase come down significantly in 2018 relative to 2017 more of a focus on M&A and dividend. Could you just expand a little bit on that and your thinking there? Thanks.","Greg Hayes","Yes, so as we think about, we\u2019ll do about $3.5 billion of additional share buyback this year. Which is a little bit above the historical norm, so remember back in late 2015 we committed to this $22 billion of capital redeployment or capital returning to shareholders, we\u2019re on track to do that. As I think about when we get to 2018, 2019 we\u2019ll probably go back towards that $2 billion a year, $1 billion to $2 billion a year of share buyback. We need to do a little less than a $1 billion a year just to offset dilution so that\u2019s I would say the minimum number out there. But we\u2019ll continue to be judicious in terms of where we spend the capital. I\u2019m not looking to do big M&A, but again if you get cost or if you get tax reform this year you could actually see it a little bit different capital allocation because maybe you can take the dividend off if you know you can get access to your foreign cash. Well right now as you know about half of our cash is generated overseas and most of the cash is going out, it\u2019s for US purposes like the dividend, like debt repayment, etc. so happy to access to that foreign cash through tax returns I think it will be very beneficial to us and allow us to really look at this whole capital allocation strategy that we have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe","Greg, just turning back to the V mark that you took on the long-term contracts. I am sorry if maybe you provided more color, I was going back and forth on another call. But can you maybe just provide a bit more color on what drove those adjustments? And given that you review these contracts periodically, to what extent do you think there could be further contract adjustments over the next 12 months?","Akhil Johri","Nigel, as you know the way the process works is, we\u2019ve got about 80 contracts that Greg mentioned earlier and we look at them on a quarterly basis and as we have more data on cost performance or the product performance that factors into re-estimating the overall cost, it\u2019s also a function of what time period the contract is in and if it\u2019s eight years out of 10 already done, there may be a [indiscernible] catch up for which has a larger impact than normal and I think some of what you saw in this quarter was a function of that. Again no surprises here we kind of knew as we saw the transactional spares come in stronger as a result of couple of these technical issues we\u2019ve talked about. There the impact on the FMP\u2019s was going to be adverse and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve factored into our guidance and was affected as well as in Q3, so I think periodically as we do these things, we catch up. But I think it\u2019s behind us I don\u2019t expect that.","Greg Hayes","I think the issue that\u2019s caused the re-estimation bad news a specific durability issue that we saw on V related to a part that supplied from one of our partners. We\u2019re in the process of campaigning the fleet because we had to the campaign the fleet, it\u2019s been a little bit more expensive when we do the overhauls in the shops, but to Akhil\u2019s point that means we are also selling a lot more spare parts and to those non-FMP customers. This is not a flight safety issue, this is just kind of one of those things that you encounter with an engine that been out there for a while, not a big surprise we knew this was coming but there shouldn\u2019t be, to Akhil\u2019s point more bad news related to this issue. I think we\u2019ve gone through all the contracts and done all the catch up that we need to do.","Nigel Coe","Great, thanks that\u2019s great color. And then just switching back to Otis pricing. Obviously good news directionally on that. Do you think that the pricing umbrella in China is getting, do you think that\u2019s reflective of just the broad pricing in China or is this, do you think this is Otis specific and any color on market share trends would be helpful too?","Akhil Johri","Clearly on the market share that\u2019s an easy question to answer right now because we\u2019ve seen 4% to 5% growth in our unit orders and we know that the market is declined by about 5%, so I think that clear demonstration of a share gain and this is just China I\u2019m talking about. I think if you do the similar analysis in most parts of the world, you will see the Otis new equipment business in orders has done really well and gain share for being on a global basis, this year that\u2019s really encouraging. On the pricing side, Nigel I think while pricing pressure has always been in China it used to be in the 3% to 5% range. It escalated a little bit to the 8%, 9% type of level early in 2016 and that was partly a function of the fact that the market declined in unit terms for the first time in many years and therefore people were responding to it through price reduction. I think that is not something that can sustain forever, so we\u2019re seeing a little reduction on that. But on the other hand, you also see commodity prices going up so I think that may have some impact on pricing as well. we\u2019ll see how it all plays out, but as you know our guidance is for 5% to 6% decline in pricing next year for Otis new equipment business and similarly on the CCS business we expect slight decline in pricing there, low single-digit which are both better than we have experienced in 2016.","Nigel Coe","That\u2019s great color. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.","Jason Gursky","Sorry, if this is already been covered. Actually been having a bout between a couple of different calls. But on Geared Turbofan I think you said 64 units delivered in the quarter, you confirm that and then just talk about the ramp as we move into 2017 and 2018, some updated thoughts on that.","Akhil Johri","Sure. 62 Jason to just correct that data point, 62 units in fourth quarter. And the good news is that the run rate in December was exactly lined with what we need in the first quarter and January so far has been trending okay as well and this is largely on the translate side, which is what we\u2019ve talked about a lot. There is key data points that we track, that Greg looks at almost on a weekly basis. If the yield and the throughput from the fan blade facility and that\u2019s trended up, so we\u2019re at about 80% yield on the fan blade facility and a throughput down to 45 days. Both those are significant improvement from where we were in June of last year, so feel a lot better about our plans there. As you know IHI our partner had certified their facility in fourth quarter and now are going to start producing parts fan blade in first quarter this year, plus we\u2019re making excellent progress on the second facility in Michigan which will add capacity in the second quarter of this year.","So given all those actions, we feel a lot better about the fan blade situation and overall industrial plan for Pratt, GTF production capabilities and feel very good about being able to deliver the 350 to 400 that is our goal for this year.","Greg Hayes","Just to add some color there, Jason we reviewed this in detail yesterday with the Pratt team. There\u2019s about 1,200 engineered components out of GTF and Pratt is engineering responsibility for about 1,000 of those. Off that 1,000 in Pratt has responsibility for there is literally six parts where we have some concern about availability to MRP and there is a plan for each one of those parts as well as the other 1,000 parts that are out there. So this, there will always be challenges as we\u2019re ramping up new engines. There\u2019s always learning that you\u2019re going to see out there. But I feel very good about what the Pratt team has put in place in terms of leadership and in terms of the analytics around understanding what\u2019s going on the supply and understanding where the shortages might and working aggressively to address those things.","Jason Gursky","Okay, great. One last clarification question here. You suggested second half profit in the commercial business and I couldn't hear whether you said CCS or in Otis, second-half profitability is better than the first half. Can you confirm which business it was? And then what are the major drivers of that ramp and kind of what are the risks there?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So in the case of CCS, Jason it\u2019s just a function of the organic growth because as you saw the order rates in Q4 came up but we still expect the trend would be relatively low organic growth in first quarter for CCS and then that order rate will continue to drive better organic growth in the second half. So it\u2019s more a function of superior organic growth later in the year driving better profitability at CCS. In the case of Otis, as you know we are still in the process of making strategic investment as Greg described a little bit about, so there will be more cost upfront before we start to see the returns on that. The second point is pricing pressure in China is more intense in the first half because of what we saw in the order book in the third and second quarter this year which gets translated into sales in the first half. So I think Otis similarly will see better profit in the second half on a year-over-year basis than in the first half.","Jason Gursky","That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Ron Epstein","Maybe a little more detailed question on the GTF. Just kind of surveying around some of the folks looking at it closer. It seems like you guys are on the fifth generation of combustor for the engine. Does that fall in the realm of normal for a new engine, five combustors? It seems like a lot to me. I don't know. Any thoughts?","Greg Hayes","So I think your math is little off to - let me, so the first 17 engines went out what we would say was the first combustor, we knew that had to be upgraded and in fact, so the B combustor is the current configuration that\u2019s out there in the fleet field. As I talked about some of the durability issues that we\u2019re having the combustors, the B version of combustor is not having the life that we would hold it to have in these very harsh environment so like India and so we\u2019ve actually got one more combustor redesign on the way, we\u2019ll have that in place later this year. So I\u2019m not sure where you got five, but we\u2019re clearly working on the third version which we think will give us the expected life that we had committed to airlines and again it\u2019s one of those things where you don\u2019t know until you get out there in the service and not all operators are having issues with the combustors, but the ones that are it certainly painful and so we\u2019re working aggressively with spares to make sure that they\u2019ve got the right level spares out there to be able to deal with this lower than expected life on the engine.","Ron Epstein","Okay, cool. And maybe one more follow-on kind of along the same lines. One management team ago the goal was set forth that maybe one day you guys would be able to sell engines at breakeven OE. And given that the GTF compared to its closest competitor has what, 30% fewer parts, right? So there is less and it. Is that still a goal that one day you could sell these things at breakeven as opposed to losing money every time you ship one?","Greg Hayes","You know I had a dream just like Akhil had a dream that one day we would be able to sell these and breakeven but the fact to the matter is, just with the market dynamics out there and a very competitive marketplace pricing just does not allow us or the market doesn\u2019t allow us to sell these new engines at anything other than a loss. The good news is, I think longer term value is still there, the IRR and the GTF program still north, well north of our cost to capital and we continue to see opportunities to improve that. So this is a game not for the faint of heart, Ron you know that and these are long-term programs, returns come in the later years. The good news is, most of the investment is behind us, we\u2019re going to continue invest in negative engine margin for the foreseeable future. But three, four years from now we start seeing the first overalls on these engines is going to be very profitable with Pratt & Whitney. So again we all dreamed about breaking even and getting real value upfront, but unfortunately the market did not allow us to do that.","Akhil Johri","The other thing, Ron. I think is we\u2019re being very disciplined and selective with regard to the campaigns as well. I think if you look at and some of that shows up in our market share, we\u2019re not chasing market share here, but we\u2019re chasing more profitable part of the engine portfolio and trying to make sure that we are being disciplined and at least tilt that windmill a little bit. So that\u2019s part of what we need to do.","Ron Epstein","Got you, got you. And then maybe one last one. A while back there was some talk about maybe doing a big sister to the GTF, right, a higher thrust engine. If an aircraft OE were to do a middle of the market airplane, and there is some speculation that one based in Seattle may. Would you guys want to do an engine for that? I mean, what\u2019s your thought on doing a wide body version of the GTF?","Greg Hayes","Would we want to do an engine, of course we would want to do an engine, Ron. I think the question always goes back to the business case and you have to make sure that the economics for a single point aircraft and that goes to how big is the market, that goes to what pricing looks like, that goes to as well, whether or not it\u2019s going to be one or two engines offered on the aircraft. So all of those things will go into our decisions were obviously working with that company in Seattle on trade studies on the engine, just like they\u2019re not committing to, I\u2019ll say we\u2019re not going to commit to it and we\u2019ll see what happens with the economics. As you know in the airline business it\u2019s all about cost, cost and cost and we\u2019re trying to make sure that whatever product that we have out there can meet the very stringent guidelines around cost, while also delivering on the fuel burn and other key parameters for this new engine, so we\u2019ll see.","Ron Epstein","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Harned","On Otis in China, if I go back a while ago, you used to talk about margins, OE margins in China as running kind of at the same level as Otis overall back in those days it was kind of a 20% type level. But recently, since we have seen these price declines and they may be slowing some but if we are down 6% now, we were down 9% before. When you think about Otis margins in China, where are they headed now for OE? I mean are we looking at something that has a lot more pressure on it than we have seen in the past? Or have you been able to get cost down in a commensurate way?","Akhil Johri","Yes, so I think the answer is yes and yes. The team in China has been very good at getting cost out of the supply base that\u2019s step number one and then they have also been consolidating the operations within China to make sure that we have a common supply chain, we have a common management team, managing the supply chain, factories have been shut down and consolidated. So I think the team\u2019s very active at ensuring that we can offset and thus far they have been successful although you\u2019re right that there is increasing pressure, pricing pressure is greater, commodity prices are starting to become more of a problem now but we still remain committed to trying to keep the margin that are pretty good level on the OE side in China.","Doug Harned","And then on the service side, I mean a big part of this is trying to get the attachment rates up. And you saw the regulatory reform, it has been about two years now in terms of meeting service contracts for elevators that have been installed. What does the attachment rate look like now and how are you seeing the trends both in your service volume as well as service margins?","Greg Hayes","As we look at the attachment rates, they\u2019re still around 35-ish percent.","Akhil Johri","Improved slightly.","Greg Hayes","Yes, which improved slightly over the last couple of years. The problem in China on service from a profitability standpoint is still lack of density in many of the routes. It\u2019s fine in the tier 1 cities, but we\u2019re still struggling on the profitability side. So service margins are pretty close to what you see on the new equipment side, you don\u2019t see the big differentiation that should change overtime, but part of this too regulation in China which requires two service mechanics when we visit an elevator as oppose to one, so that\u2019s driving cost up. We expect I think service this year will probably grow another 10% in China, feel very comfortable with that. The key for us that was actually getting the service technicians, we need to hire over 1,000 people again this coming year to meet the demand for these higher levels of service.","So again it\u2019s a very long-term gain for service in China. Service didn\u2019t start, the market is still new relatively speaking. So we\u2019ll get there eventually, but it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work and more investment I would say on the Otis side, but that is ultimate price as the service portfolio. There\u2019s over 2.5 million elevators in service in China today. There is lot of opportunity there.","Akhil Johri","The conversion rates Doug within the Otis business in China as you know and we talked about this before, the higher end the conversion rates are even closer to the western markets which you would expect because they are people, the customers are more reliant on and they\u2019re more careful about making sure they have the right people doing the maintenance work. But on the lower end, it is significant the regulation hasn\u2019t quite kicked in yet.","Doug Harned","But is there a point where we should expect this to really take off? In other words, do you have goals for volume, market share those sorts of things that would give you the kind of density you want at a certain point in time? I am trying to understand when we can see this as an important contributor, if it is 10 years away or if it is three years away.","Greg Hayes","It\u2019s probably five year away, Doug. I think about we got about 165,000 under current maintenance contracts, maybe 175,000 through December. We\u2019ve got another probably 50,000 out there under current this like one year service warranty that we give. So I think once you get north of 250,000 to 300,000 elevators again to big country, you need density, once you get to that level, I mean we should start to see profitability increase. Again this is, it\u2019s still new business and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to get the workforce trained and to get the efficiency and the service technicians up to the efficiency levels that we see in the rest of the world.","Doug Harned","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa - JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Steve Tusa","On the GTF, just to make sure that we are kind of reading the comments right. You are still saying that the 2018 peak loss is intact and there is not risk that there is extra cost on top of that just to make that clear, right?","Akhil Johri","Yes. No change to the outlook of a $1 billion of negative engine margin in 2018.","Steve Tusa","Right, okay. And then on CC&S [ph] for the year I think it is kind of like a mid-single-digit type of increase in profit you said it is going to start a little slow. Will it still grow here in kind of both quarters here in the first half? Just trying to judge the magnitude of the ramp expected in the second half of the year.","Akhil Johri","I would say, I think the CCS team would be very disappointed if they don\u2019t go there. So use to delivering profit growth every quarter that they would be disappointed if they don\u2019t grow. Now the magnitude of that is, can be questioned and that\u2019s what I was referring to more than their ability to grow earnings there, a very determined team and they know that - shareholder value that\u2019s created by growing on.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And that's for the first half, right? Growing profits?","Akhil Johri","Yes, but at very low rate, probably compared to the second half.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And any change on the price cost dynamics there given a bit of a move up and kind of a bit of a backup recently in commodities?","Akhil Johri","Certainly CCS will not see the kind of commodity tailwind they saw in 2016 and that pressure has been there a little bit. The pricing side still has to play out, as you know the biggest pricing plays out in the residential market and for that the list prices are up, I think all competitors have done that. We\u2019ll have to just see how it plays out as the market goes into the cooling season.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Akhil Johri","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. This is all the time we have for questions today. So now it is my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Mr. Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for closing comments and remarks. Sir.","Greg Hayes","Okay, thanks Brian. Thank you all for listening in. I would just remind everybody 2017 has lot of challenges out there, but we remain highly confident in the guidance that we\u2019ve got. And again for us it\u2019s about execution this year, execution, execution and we\u2019re confident we got the right team to do that. So Carroll and his team will be around through the rest of the day [indiscernible] answer any questions you guys might have. Thank you guys all for listening and have a great day. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does include the program, and you may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day."],"21193":["United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Greg Hayes - Chairman and CEO","Akhil Johri - EVP and CFO","Carroll Lane - VP, IR","Conference Call Participants","Carter Copeland - Melius Research","Julian Mitchell - Barclays","Kristine Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Steve Tusa - J.P.

Baird & Co.","Doug Harned - Bernstein","Robert Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investors Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will seek to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring cost and other significant items of non-recurring and\/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.","UTC's SEC filings, including its Forms 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. In addition, in connection with the proposed Raytheon merger to be discussed today, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement which includes a prospectus of UTC and joint proxy statement of UTC Raytheon that will contain important information about UTC Raytheon the merger and related matter.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks Denial, and good morning, everyone.","Let me start out by apologizing for the consistency of these calls for the last year or so. But as you guys saw in the press release this morning, it was another really good quarter for UTX.","Our reported adjusted EPS of $2.21 and that's up 15% versus the prior year and a continuation of the performance that we've seen for the last year. Sales are up 18% with an organic growth of 5%. And importantly, margins expanded in each of the four segments.","Free cash flow $2 billion in the quarter really, really good number. So based on our year-to-date performance, we're going to raise our outlook for the year once again. And we now expect adjusted EPS of $8.05 to $8.15 for 2019. That's up from our prior expectation of $7.90 to $8.05.","Akhil will take you through the puts and takes to that in just a minute. We're also going to raise our free cash flow outlook and we now expect $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion for the year. And again, that's up from our prior expectation of $4.5 billion to $5 billion.","Just to note $500 million of that increases from a portion of expected portfolio separation costs, primarily the tax related payments that will probably get pushed out into 2020. The remainder is good news from operations.","So, no surprise here 2019 is shaping up to be a really good year for UTC. And the businesses are focused on driving results and meeting customer commitments.","Beyond delivering on the current year, we continue to execute on our strategic portfolio initiatives. And those of course include the integration of Rockwell Collins, the separation of Otis and Carrier in the standalone public companies, and lastly, of course the merger with Raytheon.","So, looking at the results in Q3, Collins continues to deliver great performance with legacy Rockwell, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted EPS accretion in the quarter from Legacy Collins was $0.16.","For the full year, we now expect to see around $0.60 of accretion from Rockwell Collins that's up about $0.10 from our prior expectations, and about $0.25 up from our outlook coming into the year, really good performance.","This performance is really highlighted by accelerated costs synergy capture, which only strengthens our confidence in our ability to realize at least $600 million in acquisition related costs synergies by year four. The team is also targeting a pipeline of over a $1 billion in sales synergies, of which over 175 million are already been captured in orders.","Okay, maybe just a second on the spin, we continue to make good progress on day one operational readiness and the public company management teams are now largely in place.","As I said last month, we continue to target April 1st as the spin date for both businesses. That is, of course subject to the timing of the tax rulings from the U.S. and Canada, which we continue to expect to receive by year-end or shortly thereafter. However, no surprises with the portfolio separation, we remain on track.","Finally, earlier this month, we were very pleased that both UTC and Raytheon share owners overwhelmingly approved the combination of our aerospace business and Raytheon. We\u2019re going to continue to work closely with regulators for approvals required for the transactions, and we're making good progress on forming the management teams for Raytheon technologies.","No surprises so far, which is really the good news. I am very excited about the opportunity the merger is going to create it for a best-in-class technology driven, global aerospace and defence system provider. And we continue to expect the transaction to close shortly following the completion of the portfolio separations.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take it to the results, and I'll be back to wrap it up and then we'll take some Q&A. Mr. Johri?","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Greg. So, I'm on slide two. For the third quarter, reported sales of $19.5 billion were up 18%, including 5% organic growth. And that's on top of 8% organic growth last year in the third quarter. We also had 14 points of M&A benefit, mainly the Rockwell Collins acquisition. Foreign Exchange was a 1-point headwind in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS was $2.21, up 15% versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.33 down 14% versus prior and included $0.06 of restructuring and $0.82 of net non-recurring charges, the largest of which was $0.73 related to the portfolio separation activities.","Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2019 was $4.7 billion, up 48% or approximately $1.5 billion compared to 2018. This strong year-to-date performance gives us confidence in the increased free cash flow outlook for the year that Greg mentioned earlier.","As a reminder, we expect significant outflows in Q4 from the tax and transaction costs related to the portfolio separation actions. Overall, there is no change to our estimate of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the total onetime portfolio separation cash costs.","However, within that, tax costs will be lower than the $2 billion we were expecting earlier. And debt redemption and other transaction costs will be slightly higher.","Turning to slide three, you see the drivers of our organic growth in Q3. Looking at the commercial businesses first, in the Americas sales were flat, Otis up low single digits and Carrier down slightly.","On an encouraging note, award activity for Otis in North America remains strong in the quarter, on very high levels already. For Carrier transport refrigeration was down year-over-year off a hard compare. Within EMEA sales were also flat in the quarter. The economic outlook across Europe remains mixed and weaker than our expectations coming into the year.","Activity levels in the Middle East remain very low for both Carrier and Otis. In Asia, sales were up 7%, China sales were up 11% including mid-teens growth at Otis. Importantly, this was the eighth consecutive quarter of positive price mix in Otis new equipment orders in China.","On the aerospace side, commercial OEM sales were down 1% driven by Collins Aerospace, which was down 8% on an organic basis. Growth in new platform sales there was more than offset by the expected declines in legacy platforms. Pratt & Whitney commercial air OEM sales were up 13% organically.","For commercial aftermarket, sales were up 11%. We continue to see healthy air traffic and strong fleet utilization. At Collins aerospace commercial aftermarket sales were up 20% organically. Provisioning for the legacy UTAS business was up over 30% driven by continued MRO demand and airline activity. Pratt & Whitney saw commercial aftermarket growth of 6%.","Organically military sales were up 15% at Pratt & Whitney and 14% at Collins Aerospace, driven by both OEM and aftermarket strength across key platforms.","Now, before I hand it over to Carroll, just a few comments on our updated 2019 outlook and the moving pieces. As you saw, we have improved our adjusted EPS and free cash flow outlook range for 2019.","We have also tightened our sales range for 2019 and now expect total reported sales of $76 billion to $76.5 billion versus our prior outlook of $75.5 billion to $77 billion. This updated sales range reflects the adverse impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, as well as a reduced organic sales outlook for Carrier, more on that in a minute.","At the UTC level, we continue to expect organic sales growth of 4% to 5% given the strength in the aerospace businesses.","Now at the segment operating profit level, a reduced outlook at Carrier is offset by the continued strength at Collins Aerospace. Like last quarter, we've included a chart in the appendix on slide 12, with updated sales and profit walks for both those businesses as a reference.","So, what's happening at Carrier? In Q3, we saw continued weakness in orders in the refrigeration business, higher distributor inventory in the U.S. residential HVAC channel and a softer EMEA market. We now expect organic sales for Carrier to be down low to mid-single digit in the fourth quarter with low double-digit decline in the refrigeration business.","We have reduced Carrier\u2019s full year sales expectations by approximately $500 million and profit expectations by the corresponding approximately $125 million. The change in profit also includes nearly $25 million of negative impact from the significantly lowered discount rates used for revaluation of long-term liabilities, including warranty.","However, looking beyond the short-term challenges fundamental growth drivers for Carriers and markets remain intact, Carrier continues to have significant value creation opportunities through their focus on innovation, G&A reduction and portfolio optimization.","On the positive side, we see a $125 million improvement in the full year adjusted operating profit outlook for Collins Aerospace, driven by continued strength in commercial aftermarket, both at Heritage UTAS and Rockwell Collins, higher military sales and higher synergies from integration efforts.","Both Otis and Pratt continue to perform well. And we have raised the low end of their respective operating profit growth outlooks.","Below the segment operating profit lines, we now expect a full year tax rate of approximately 22.5% compared to our prior range of 23% to 24%. There are other puts and takes that are slightly negative, of significance we realized a pension curtailment gain of $98 million in the third quarter that was adjusted out of earnings as you saw.","However, as part of those actions, we were also required to true up the 2019 pension expense discount rate based on the discount rate, which resulted in a $0.04 headwind to our non-service pension income for the year, mainly in the fourth quarter.","With that, let me turn it over to Carroll.","Carroll Lane","Okay, thanks Akhil. I\u2019m on slide four. I'll be speaking of the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there's an appendix on slide 15, with additional segment data you can use as a reference.","All right, starting with Otis, Otis sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, that\u2019s up 4% organically. New equipment sales grew 2%, high-teens growth in China was partially offset by low single digit declines in North America and EMEA. Service sales growth was broad-based and was up 6% in the quarter. New equipment orders grew 6% in the quarter with growth across all major regions.","Orders in the Americas were up 10% that was driven by the timing of major project bookings in North America, Asia, excluding China and Europe. So orders up mid-single digits in the quarter. And China orders grew 5% as the business continues to benefit from favorable pricing and mix. And that's the sixth consecutive quarter of value growth in China.","Operating profit was up 7% of constant currency driven by strong volume growth, as well as favorable price and mix and both new equipment and service. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter for operational profit growth at Otis and it's largely from consistent improvement in the profitability of the service business.","Foreign exchange translation was a two-point headwind to sales and earnings. And given the strong year-to-date performance, we expect that Otis will finish at the high end of their constant currency profit growth range, that's approximately 75 million. The profit growth and actual FX will be in the range of 0 to 25 million.","Turning to slide five, Carrier sales were flat organically in the quarter. Transport refrigeration was down 6% with container down more than 20% and commercial refrigeration down 5%.","Global HVAC sales were flat with North America residential down 1% and global commercial HVAC up 1%. Global fire and security were up 2%.","Carrier equipment orders contract at 11% organically in the quarter and was primarily driven by a decline in refrigeration orders.","Transport refrigeration orders were down 68% driven by higher than average cancellations cover coupled with tough compares in North America truck trailer. You'll recall the orders for transport refrigeration were up more than 90% in Q3 of 2018.","Commercial refrigeration orders were down 5% in the quarter, the fire and security product orders were down 2%. Global HVAC orders were up 6% with both North America residential and global commercial HVAC up mid-single digits. In constant currency operating profit was up 1% in the quarter. Pricing benefits and material productivity net of tariff impact was partially offset by lower volume and mix.","Foreign exchange translation was a one-point headwind to earnings. As Akhil referenced, volume is expected to be down in the fourth quarter and as a result, we are lowering Carrier's outlook for the full year. We now expect organic sales to be flat with operating profit down 100 million to 125 million at actual currency.","Okay, Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on slide six. Sales of 5.3 billion we're up 11% on an organic basis, and 10% on a reported basis. Commercial OEM sales are up 17% on Pratt & Whitney Canada engine shipments and a favorable mix of large commercial engine sales.","Commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%. Early GTF shop [ph] contributed to the growth, as well as V 2500 overhauls returning to expected levels, with inductions up 10% versus the prior year. Favorable aftermarket content and Pratt & Whitney Canada also contributed to the growth.","Military sales were up 15% driven by the continued ramp of the F135 program and strong aftermarket demand. Operating profit of 471 million was up 15%. Results benefited from commercial engine mix, continued GTF cost reduction and drop through on higher commercial aftermarket and military volumes.","These tailwinds more than offset the absence of prior year commercial aftermarket contract adjustments, and higher E&D and SG&A. So, looking ahead, we expect Pratt & Whitney to grow full year operating profit by 225 million to 250 million.","Turning to Collins Aerospace systems on slide seven, sales in the quarter were $6.5 billion, up $2.5 billion on a reported basis and up 7% organically. Operating profit of $1.2 billion was up $568 million. On a pro forma basis, which includes results for Rockwell Collins in the third quarter of 2018, Collins Aerospace delivered operating profit growth of 23% on 6% higher sales.","The pro forma sales growth reflects continued strength in the commercial aftermarket and defence channels, partially offset by lower commercial OEM volume and commercial aftermarket sales were up 17%.","The passenger traffic investment -- passenger traffic as well as investments and initial provisioning, and demand for modifications and upgrades all remain strong. Military sales were up mid-single digits driven by higher F35 volume and aftermarket demand.","Commercial OEM sales were down low single digits driven by declining volumes on legacy programs as Akhil referenced earlier.","Operating profit growth was driven by the contribution from Rockwell Collins dropped through on higher organic sales as well as synergy benefits. And this growth was partially offset by mix headwind and higher SG&A spend.","Given the continued end market strength and solid execution accounts, we now expect full year reported sales growth of approximately 55% with organic sales up mid to high single-digits versus our prior outlook of mid-single-digits.","And we now expect Collins Aerospace operating profit to be up $1.85 billion to $1.875 billion for the full year. That's an increase from our prior expectation of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion.","And with that, I'll hand it back over to Greg.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Carroll. So, as always, a few moving pieces but overall, I would tell you, we're very pleased with our third quarter results, and we're confident in our improved adjusted EPS and cash outlook for 2019.","While the macroeconomic environments show varying degrees of strength through our commercial businesses depending upon the region, we continue to see growth in commercial air traffic as well as favorable trends in defense spending, the combination of which benefits both Pratt and Collins Aerospace as you've seen in this quarter. We do have some near-term pressure at Carrier, but I'm confident that Dave Gitlin and team are taking the right actions to position the business to drive long-term shareholder returns.","We see solid long-term growth fundamentals in the commercial end markets driven by urbanization and growing middle class and regulatory changes; all drivers that will translate into growth for Carrier as well as Otis.","Across to all of UTC, we remain focused on the key priorities which remain unchanged. First and foremost, it's executing on customer commitments. Continuing to innovate, continuing to take cost out and to be disciplined in capital allocation.","I remain very excited about the future for Otis and Carrier, as standalone public companies, and for the future of UTX, as we merge with Raytheon to become Raytheon Technologies.","So, before we go to Q&A, just a couple of personnel announcements, something we don't typically do here. I think as some of you probably have already heard, Carroll Lane, this is his last earnings conference call after about three years in the seat, have done a great job. Carroll, call sign Kujo for those of you that follow that type of thing will become President of our Commercial Engine business at Pratt & Whitney reporting to Chris Calio and that'll be effective about the first of the year, assuming we let him go then.","Carroll has done a great job; I hope all of you have a chance to thank him for that. And we wish him well as we hand him the keys to the future of Pratt & Whitney. Good luck.","Secondly, just in perhaps more importantly, Akhil Johri will be stepping down as CFO of UTC on November 1st. For Akhil, this caps a 31-year career at UTC. And everybody, I'm sure will miss him; I will personally miss him both for his sage advice, as well as for his calming influence. Our goal, however, is to make you miss him not so much by ensuring a seamless transition.","Akhil, as you know, has been instrumental in the transformation of the UTC portfolio and he's been a great partner. If there is a better CFO in Corporate America, I haven't met him. That includes me. So Akhil, thank you and good health to you and Sashi in retirement and I'm sure you guys will keep busy. Best of luck.","So, with that, effective November 1st, Neil Mitchill, formerly the Chief Financial Officer of Pratt & Whitney will assume the job of Acting CFO, Neil will hold that role until the merger is complete with Raytheon sometime early next year shortly after the separation of the commercial businesses.","Neil joined us in 2014 from Pricewaterhouse, where he was a senior partner. Many of you know Neil from his time at Pratt. And before that as Controller of UTC. So again, we wish both Neil well, and the whole team as we go through these transitions. Our goal again, is to make this as seamless as possible. So, best of luck to all of you.","And with that, let me open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland","Hi, good morning guys. And congratulations, Carroll on the move and Akhil, it's been an absolute pleasure to work with you over the year. So, we wish you the best in retirement and you will be missed.","Akhil Johri","Thank you. Thanks, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just some clarification around the aftermarket strength, Greg. I mean, obviously, ADS-B and that mandate has had a big impact on sales growth this year. Can you give us a sense of what your updated thoughts on that contribution are?","And I wonder if you have any insight, there's clearly some indirect sales benefit for that upgrade cycle where, you have an airplane in there and you do some other work while you do that mandate work. And I wondered if you might have any insight on how much indirect benefit you've had from ADS-B in addition to the direct. Thanks.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Carter. First of all, what's important as you look at the third quarter results at Collins? The ADS-B mandate actually was not a driver of growth. It really was provisioning, in support of aircraft that are already out there. So, we saw decent parts growth, ADS-B was relatively flat. But the provisioning it was what drove this strength which is, again, it's episodic. So, I wouldn't get excited about 30% provisioning growth, it's not going to repeat itself here in the fourth quarter.","At the same time, the ADS-B mandate is certainly is driving growth. It's been a key driver of some of the good news that was not really expected on the Collins acquisition this year. And keep in mind that an ADS-B mandate, it has to be completed in the U.S. here by the end of the year and in Europe by June of next year. So, we'll get a little bit of a benefit, but it's a pretty tough compare, as we think about next year for Collins, both on ADS-B as well as just the overall strength in the aftermarket.","So, again, no drama. I think it's all what we had expected. As far as ancillary business associated with an ADS-B mandate, again, this is kind of a one-off thing. And we really haven't seen anything that would indicate that we're pulling through a lot of additional work as this mandated change have been occurring.","So, I think it's really just - it goes to the fact there is a huge demand for spares and for provisioning as people are looking for capacity. Capacity is at an all-time high. And with the 737 Max continuing to be grounded, people are flying older planes a lot longer. We expect obviously, that trend is not going to continue once the Max gets back in the air.","So again, good news for us this year, but a little bit of headwind next year.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks for the color, Greg.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Kristine Liwag","Hi, good morning, guys. This is Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. There was news earlier this week about the Airbus A220 program. Can you provide any details on how we should think about the progress of the engine in that program and the progress of the fixes?","Greg Hayes","Yeah, hey Christine. Maybe it's just a quick word. We did have a couple; we had an issue that we found on the GTF engine on the A220. That's the 1500 PW1500. It's the same engine that's on the Embraer 195. As a result of this issue, we're actually had a mandated inspection period for the airlines. And so, what you saw earlier this week, one of the major operators actually put their fleet down for about a day and a half to go through and updated all the inspections. That went off without a hitch and we continue to have an accelerated inspection on this engine.","Keep in mind, this has nothing to do with the A320 fleet, which is the PW1100 which is the vast majority of the fleet. There is probably about 100 of these engines out there in service today.","We're working through the root cause analysis. I don't have anything to report other than the fact that we remain confident in the engine, clearly anytime you've got an issue like this, we're on top of it. The guys are working through it.","Akhil Johri","It's not a safety - it's not a safety issue, first and foremost, that's an important thing to remember. This is just an increased inspection routine that we have. There is an AD out there for that and Pratt has instructed or asked the operators; we feel badly about what they're going through, but they still have to just have increased inspections on for this issue. But no other concerns at this point.","Kristine Liwag","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. And I wish Carroll and Akhil all the best and thank you for the help. In terms of I guess my question really around the outlook at Carrier, sales are guided to be down in Q4, probably down through much of next year just given what will happen at the refrigeration business. So, just wondered what your outlook was for that that revenue line in the coming quarters?","And also, do you feel that you're doing enough on the cost base? I saw restructuring spending was up almost double in the nine months at Carrier where you've got a pretty big EBIT, decline in Q4, should we see even more acceleration and restructuring coming up in that business?","Akhil Johri","So, first, just to give you a bridge for what has changed in Carrier, it's isolated largely to two businesses. One is the transport, the commercial \u2013 the refrigeration business in total, but transport refrigeration specifically.","Julian, if I was to break down the $500 million decline in sales from our prior outlook, 100 million of that is just FX, right, dollars being stronger. 200 million is on the refrigeration business and about 150 on the residential HVAC business, which is going to be flattish now compared to our expectation of mid-single digit growth. So not a decline, just a mid-single -- a flat growth profile there.","Transport refrigeration is where the biggest drama is and that's because some of it is just because we had tougher compares, some of it is just declines in the backlog that we have seen both on the container and the North American truck trailer side, and some weakness in Europe truck trailer.","Now that business, I have lived through that at least four short cycles in the last 20, 25 years and I'll tell you that goes down sharply, but it comes back pretty sharply as well. The redeeming feature of that business is that the underlying growth of refrigerated trade continues unabated at 3% per year type of levels. And even if you believe that this short-term perturbation we are seeing, I'll give you just one example and it can apply to container as well, but if you look at the North America truck trailer market today, it's about 46,000 units we expect for this year. 15 years ago, that market on average was somewhere in the mid-30s. So, 33,000 to 35,000 units. That would suggest the compound annual growth rate of 2% in terms of capacity of the market, when the underlying trade has been growing at 3%.","So, even if there is some short-term adjustment, and there is some decline that happens in North America truck trailer next year, it will come back, whether it's the second half of next year or whether it's 21. But it will come back and come back strong. We saw the same phenomena in containers. So, I'm not too worried about that.","The good news on the residential HVAC side is, I think the fundamentals for end market remain pretty strong. We have been impacted more by the two-step distribution that we have. So, the inventory in the channel is higher than what we would have liked and that's impacting short term Carrier's sales. Overall, again, not a big concern and restructuring certainly is being ramped up.","Greg Hayes","Yes, let me just pile on there a little bit, it's a couple of points. So, we have been taken out a lot of costs, we've reduced over 1000 headcount at Carrier in the last few months and that will continue on is Mr. Gitlin and company adjust the workforce to the size of the market.","Obviously, it's a challenge when sales are dropping in these very profitable businesses and we know the sales will come back. As Akhil says, the fundamentals remain very strong. And I think, even in the U.S., resi was essentially flat in the quarter, off of a pretty tough compare from last year where we saw pretty good growth of that market. So, there is no panic here at Carrier, I mean, the business remains strong.","I think the thing to keep in mind is margin still expanded by 30 basis points, even with all of the drama in the marketplace and just as importantly, the market in China, we actually saw decent growth. And I think that's, like 5% growth in commercial, which is pretty solid. Otis, the same thing. They saw really good strong growth in orders and even saw positive sales again, as we've talked about, so the fundamentals of both the commercial businesses remain really good and I hate, I don't want people to get too worried about this refrigeration piece which, again to Akhil's point, it's very cyclical, but it does come back whether it's container or whether it's truck trailer, Europe or the U.S. and the high confidence and Dave and team will work through this.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning. So, just on this ADS-B thing, and I'm not an aerospace analyst, so maybe I'm not as much of an expert as the other guys. But Honeywell talked about it as being like, extremely minor, like less than maybe 50 basis points of growth on their total aerospace business over the last couple of years. I mean, you talked about it as being a tough comp, but is that you guys are maybe even a bigger aerospace, more diverse aerospace business.","So, is that kind of the right kind of framework for how big that is? Because it just seems like it's like being talked about or it's just should not be that big of a deal?","Akhil Johri","Steve, yeah, ADS-B mandate is driving about $250 million to $300 million of sales this year, right with good margins. So that's what you have to assume. I think on a normal basis, you would probably see $60 million to $70 million of sales from that aspect of that product line, so that -- so it is significantly higher.","Again, you can do the math better than I can, in terms of the total aerospace impact, but that's the level of sales that we are expecting. Some of that will continue next year as well, as Greg said, because there is still the European mandate, which goes through till June of next year, but we will see a step down next year and then see a little bit more of a step down to normal levels in 2021.","Steve Tusa","Yeah, so like maybe like a little less than $100 million a year for the next couple of years, type of step down?","Akhil Johri","Yeah, next year could be a little more than that in 2020, because you may go from like $300 million to $100 million $150 million type of a number, again we will give more guidance and specificity in January. But then the year after it will be more somewhere in the 60 to 75 type of range in 2021.","Steve Tusa","Okay, and then just picking on Carrier here a little bit. Lennox yesterday reported 20% growth in their independent channel, and our checks kind of suggests that they're kind of aggressively moving in that direction, because they're having a hard time kind of regaining the share they lost at the high end.","Are you guys seeing any of that - I know you guys are mostly independent, and I mean, they've attacked you before in like commercial. So, are they trying to kind of pick away at some of your some of your independence there, is that partly the reason why you guys are kind of more flattish and kind of into the fourth quarter little more cautious?","Akhil Johri","No, I think it's more a function of -- you saw the Watsco results as well. I think those results weren't that different from say the Lennox also in terms of the quarter or the distribution out in the -- with the end consumers. The thing I look back at Steve is the -- how is our market share doing, right, ultimately, that's the real test of what -- whether we are winning or not in the market, we have got a pretty good position.","And the good news in the U.S. residential market, as you know is that there is good data available. AHRI provides us with the total industry shipments, we know our shipments, we don't know what other peoples are, but we at least know what the total industry is doing and what we are doing.","And as when we look at that on a 12-month rolling basis, 12 month for a year, because the quarter maybe up or down, but when you look on a 12 month basis, our total splits business Ducted and Ductless is up about 15 basis points in terms of share from a reasonably high level already.","On the furnaces, we are probably down a little bit, 30 basis points or so, 30 to 40 is what I've seen. So, it's I think it's not like we are irrespective of what the others may be doing or seeing. We certainly know what we are seeing and from that perspective, the shares are not that different than what we have seen historically, and our shares are pretty good in that market.","Steve Tusa","One more just very quickly, just to clarify this ADS-B headwind, I mean, there's plenty to offset that there's other products that are ramping and I mean, you guys are obviously absorbing the max way better than others that are calling it out as more of an excuse. So, there's obviously other things that will offset this, this ADS-B is kind of not to be isolated in the context of other platforms that are growing for you guys. Correct?","Greg Hayes","Yeah, look. Yeah, that's exactly right. The 2020 we would still expect to see growth on commercial aftermarket with Collins, I'm going to stop right there because I'm not going to give guidance for it. But I would say the ADS-B mandate is just part of one of the many moving pieces. And what is a very large commercial aftermarket for Collins.","Steve Tusa","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks for the details, always.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolf Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","I think we've covered ADS-B here in quite a bit of depth. So, Akhil first of all, thanks for the help, you\u2019ll be missed. And good luck with the next move. What I'm going to Otis and touch on the service strength, 6% growth in service is by sales standards very, very strong and it's very, very poor based across geographies.","So, maybe just touch on what's driving that, how you view the durability of that kind of growth rates, and then maybe touch on Europe, which also saw missing digit growth, what we've seen in terms of price and volume in that region?","Akhil Johri","Yeah, that's actually the most encouraging part of the Otis story. The improvements we are starting to see in the service side, which is where a lot of our investments were focused in terms of digitalization of that business overall, are starting to bear fruit.","And the best thing about Nigel, as you said was the broad-based nature of the growth in service, it was across geographies, it was across all major countries. And it's across the three categories, maintenance, repair and modernization all grew and I think the credit goes not just, the focus that Judy and the team have put on it but also the investments that we have made in ensuring that the mechanics finally into the modern age with the digital tools that they need and have.","The repair business is doing particularly well and that\u2019s again part of the tools that we have given, the new app that the team has put in put forth, which makes it easier for both the customers and our mechanics and our service sales people to offer value added suggestions to improve the performance of elevators and buildings and all that is starting to show in the number.","So, productivity was pretty good in Europe, per say this is been now the second quarter in a row where we have seen actually profit growth in Europe, after several years of decline, as you know.","So, China is now four quarters a profit growth after a few years of decline and Europe two quarters of profit growth year-over-year after many years of profit declined. So, it\u2019s all pointing in the right direction.","Nigel Coe","So just a bit quick follow up, obviously the 30 bps of margin expansion this is very good news but with positive price mix in China, positive mix on after market, low steel prices why can't margin expand more than 30 basis points going forward.","Akhil Johri","The new equipment growth clearly margins, the growth where it is coming is repair and the modernization side, so there is a little bit of a mix negativity if you will, in the Otis service side. The service contribution is going in absolute dollars and margin is expanding as a percent, but we also are continuing to make strategic investments that you know right, there is still more of these handheld tools being given to additional service technicians, there is still some pricing pressure on the new equipment side as we've talked about.","So, I think China is seeing price mix improved, but in North America on the other hand, on the new equipment side there is certainly increasing pricing pressure. So, we're happy that Otis is showing profit growth, that\u2019s the first step and margins are expanding. I won't get too far add up ourselves and start to expect 100 to 200 basis points of margin expansion.","Greg Hayes","I think just to be very clear. We think margins can expand, continue to expand or market-leading today or like 15.5% this quarter, actual FX good progress. But to Akhil's point, we still have investments to make, we still have ERP systems that need updating. We have digital tools that need updating and I think again steady margin progression is the store that you're going to hear for obvious for the next several years ago and when Judy is out, talking about the other story for the coming years I think that will be key messages.","We will get margin expansion but most importantly we're going to get top line. And every time you sell an elevator you service that 80% of the time and that's the annuity, we want to continue to invest in. So, fundamentals are strong but were not going to get ahead of ourselves here in terms of curtailing investment just up score year or two and again steady progresses is the word.","Nigel Coe","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you and congratulations to Akhil and Carroll. Maybe this first one for you, since you're taking over this business. How do you think about what's going on with the GTF, maybe if you could update us on how is the business trending as commercial deliveries were down in the quarter, what engine models were driving that?","Carroll Lane","The GTF program overall is doing extremely well got over 4 million revenue flight hours on the engine dispatch liability 99.8%, so overall feeling very good. If you think about the shipments, yes, you can look at the quarter, but more importantly year-to-date shipments to customers nearly 30% on GTF. So, feeling very good about our progress there. Feeling very good about our cost take out on the engine that's clearly an ingredient to our success going forward.","So, I think overall and holistically, we're feeling good about our market share. Good around the cost take out, good around the profitability, and we've got plenty of work to do in supporting our customers, but pretty positive at this point.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great, thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up, I\u2019m not an elevator analyst, but on Otis what are you seeing in the service portfolio. What do you think in terms of attrition rates and maybe investments needed there, Greg or Akhil?","Akhil Johri","The attrition rates actually have been part of the reason why we're seeing growth in the portfolio as I've often talked about before, Sheila. I think the first step is to ensure that the portfolio keeps growing quarter-after-quarter and we're close to 2.05 million units now at some point, Judy will start rounding that up to 2.1.","But just a little shy from that, but the good news is that the portfolio grew across geographies. The only place where we are being a little more selective right now is in China where we've adopted a strategy of smart service growth where we are trying to make sure that we are not just taking service contracts for the sake of service contract, but that they are profitable service contracts over the long-term. And we are continuing to look at the portfolio carefully from that perspective.","But really encouraging news is that there is good service growth. If you screwed China, the growth in portfolio from Q2 to Q3, compared to last year, almost similar levels encouraging. And that's the basic secret sauce, as Greg said, right. You install elevators so that you can keep servicing them for years to come.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congrats, Carroll. Akhil will be very much missed. Hopefully we see on the beach somewhere else.","Greg Hayes","On the beach.","Jeffrey Sprague","On the beat or on the beach. I don't know. I don't want to see him on the beat. I'm hoping to see him on the beach. Hey, a couple questions from me. So, there is kind of continued discussion of investment at Otis and Carrier. And obviously, Judy and Dave are going to have their own decisions to make once they're fully independent.","But should we think these businesses are exiting the portfolio at kind of a representative run rate of investment required relative to kind of their forward plans? Or should we be thinking about they need to step up investment once these businesses are separated?","Greg Hayes","Well, look Jeff, I think we made a conscious decision four years ago to step up investments in the commercial business. E&D and Carriers specifically, we've taken it up. It's over $500 million today. I think that's a rate that's sustainable. It's about 2.5% of sales. And they're going to have to continue on with that. I certainly don't see any pullback there, but I don't see a need for a big step up in investment.","I think what you're going to see at Carrier is two things. One is a renewed focus on SG&A and that is the biggest pool of costs that they have that they can work on. And Dave and team has started working on that today.","The second piece is on the portfolio. And again, more from Dave on that in the coming months. But I think optimizing the Carrier portfolio has a huge opportunity to create value for shareholders to get to a more focused portfolio than what we have today. And again, you can quiz Dave on all those pieces and what they're thinking. And it really is a decision for the next management team. But I would tell you that in our view, significant opportunity.","As far as Otis, we had started again making investments four years ago in the service tools and in the IT infrastructure, specifically the Global Service Systems, the GSS to give us the data, give us the ability to service these elevators more efficiently. And those investments are starting to pay off, but they're a long way from done in terms of the payback.","So, I would expect the level of investment to remain about the same, but I would expect the payback to improve dramatically over the coming years. And again, that's what's going to drive margin expansion.","Akhil hit on this repair. Repairs were up really solid in the quarter and part of it, we can attribute to the fact that the service mechanics now have an app on their phone, which let them sell repair directly to the building operator when they're out doing regular maintenance. Those are sales that we probably otherwise wouldn't have gotten. And I think that's just an indication of the opportunity set in front of us.","The other thing is, and we touched on this before is improving the cancellation rate. And the cancellation rate two years ago was north of 7% on existing elevators is down around 6%. That's a very, very profitable way to grow. Earnings is to reduce your cancellation rate, which means you don't have to replace them with lower margin new business.","So, again, I don't see that as an investment. I think again, or an additional investment that's just a continuation of what we've been doing, which should yield benefits for the next several years.","Jeffrey Sprague","Is there any evolving thought on how the kind of post separation balance sheets of Carrier and Otis might look? And I kind of asset kind of in the spirit of, sure refrigeration will cycle back up. But we could be going into a little bit more challenging macro environment.","Greg Hayes","So, look, let's be very clear. As we look at the separation of the two businesses, they'll probably be about $18 billion of debt between Otis and Carrier with obviously more of it going to Carrier, because of its size. But the goal is for both of those businesses to be investment grade coming out of the chute.","And one of the things obviously that we would be concerned about is can they survive in a potential recession scenario; we don't see one. But we're going to make sure that they have the financial wherewithal that if we do see -- I would say a normal business cycle correction here sometime in the next couple of years, that they won't lose their investment grade rating.","And that's again the key to the capital allocation to those two businesses in terms of the amount of debt, the amount of cash that they're going to have on their balance sheets, it splits so we're cognizant of that, we'll be out with the rating agencies next month. Now the next 30 days and we're back to you guys early next year with the final look.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter Arment","Yes, thanks. Good morning, Greg. Congrats. Akhil and Carroll. And Greg, only one six-part question here. Just quickly on the - just if you could just update us on your thoughts how the BE Aerospace businesses doing inside Collins and also just on the synergies itself. The UTC playbooks always been to exceed these targets but is any of these just timing related and pull into the left. Thanks again, Greg.","Greg Hayes","Yes, so the BE Aerospace side obviously last year was a pretty tough year at BE after the acquisition by Rockwell ahead of the close. I would tell you that most of those issues are behind us. We have seen really good progress. Dave Newsom, who runs that business doing a nice job. The orders that had been deferred last year are being fulfilled, margins are coming back to what we expected. So that business actually is doing that was even better than what we had expected for the year and part of this the $0.60 of accretionary we're getting obviously coming from the BE Aerospace.","As far as the synergies go, we are pulling synergies to the left, obviously, we had the $600 million goal, we'll be close to $200 million -- 250, in synergies this year. Now, are we going to take up the synergy target beyond 600? Not today.","I think this is the same playbook that you would expect from UTX which is - get our feet under us, there's always more ideas out there to take cost out and I would expect as Kelly and team go through this process over the next two, three years, there will be more and more ideas that will be generated.","But after three years or so, we hit the 600 million, everything else kind of flows into just normal cost reduction actions anyways, but there remains a basket load of opportunities on the Collins aerospace side with the footprint that they have and the product geography they have to continue to drive cost out.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the details. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Doug Harned","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to, I wanted to look at Pratt, and then you raise your outlook for commercial le and aftermarket combined. And can you talk a little bit about what led to that if we think about the legacy engine, aftermarket growth benefits from the gear turbofan some of the early work on that and then reduction in costs on the OE side, how would you balance those different pieces?","Akhil Johri","So the mix Doug is what is helping that particular line that you are referring to in the in the outlook, and the fact that we are seeing more favorable customer makes inside the GTF and OE deliveries and the fact that costs are coming down as we expected or in line with our expectations is what is driving that growth to be slightly better than what we expected. That at the highest level, that's probably what it is some better customer. Carroll anything?","Carroll Lane","The aftermarket Doug remains very healthy. So, no real change to trend there. UV 2500s we talked about we're up year-over-year. Remember, we started in a bit of a hole on the V-2500 with some operational issues in the network earlier in the year. We are recovering from those we made good progress, there's demand for well over 1000 shop visits on the V-2500, not clear that will get to serve all them maybe closer to 975.","So, you think about the aftermarket and total is probably more like low to mid-single digits, as we kind of close out the year. The Legacy models in obviously the shop visits were down we expect those to be down to the fours and the twos, but the content remains pretty solid. So overall very, very good aftermarket.","Akhil Johri","The other thing we don't often talk about is the strength in the Pratt Canada business. And that's also reflected in that line to some extent, Doug, and you see good shipments, engine shipments there. We see good aftermarket growth there. So always good on the small engine company side as well.","Doug Harned","So sort of all the way around and the Vs, I mean, you were really pushing capacity limits on MRO. Now, I would expect, I mean, this is -- should be a lot of upward pressure, I assume.","Carroll Lane","Well, it's a pretty tightly coupled system. So, you start out in a hole, it's just an issue of getting them through the shops, but the team has made a ton of progress on that front, and we're now up to the kind of monthly run rate for inductions that we would have expected. So that's good news.","Doug Harned","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn","Just sticking with the -- with the geared turbofan for a minute and Pratt, you did mention the -- the early shop visits are starting to come through. I'm curious how the where has been there relative to expectations? I know you're just getting into this at this point.","Then separately, was there any opportunity for the geared turbofan on this new Gulfstream aircraft? I understand it's a derivative of the 650 and it uses that engine, but might there have been an opportunity since you're on some of the other products?","Carroll Lane","Well, I'll core the first part. Rob, we are getting the engines into the shops as we bring up these -- the prior configurations, the current configurations, which is going to extend the life of the, of the engine. And so far, it says, it is early, but nothing from wear modes or anything like that nothing out of the ordinary, I think pretty much as expected. So that's something that over time, you have to keep an eye on because those were modes, by definition emerge over time, but at this point, we're feeling like it's pretty much situation normal there.","Greg Hayes","I would just add to that, one of the obviously the biggest concern when we launched this engine five years ago was the gear system. And we have seen a lot of these engines come back, we've had an opportunity to go through those gear systems. And I would tell you the wear is much less than expected, in fact, much more robust design and that was probably necessary. But the fact is, the gear system works as advertised.","And so, if you're thinking about things to worry about with the engine that isn't one of them. Obviously, we're still working through the retrofits of the combustors and a couple of the seal issues, but in terms of the actual long-term durability of the engine went to the gear, not an issue.","As far as Gulfstream on the 7,000 -- 700 rather. We did not offer an engine for that. We do have of course the engine on the new 500 and 600 Gulfstream, which are going into service now, which is a Pratt Canada PW815, if I got that number, right?","And we continue to work with Gulfstream on additional opportunities, but we did not participate in the bid, because quite frankly a GTF a gear does not work a long-range business jet. And even PW815, while it's got the same architecture is the gear, does not have a gear upfront, the way, the rest of the GTF family does.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning. Just a quick one for me, for you, Greg. You talked earlier about $150 million or so of revenue synergies. Can you talk about where that's coming from and then how that's working and implications for RTX as we look forward and your confidence there?","Akhil Johri","Yes, Rajeev, hi. This is Akhil. I think a couple of examples which are very real and very encouraging is the forward leaning organization that Rockwell Collins brought to the table, they have lots of -- thousands of people actually sitting very close to the airline customers, and are able to pick up opportunities that may not have been possible otherwise for the UTAS organization.","And so one of the examples of this attributes two large projects that we are talking about in the 175 million, one of them was just simply -- now that we have a bigger bag of offerings that these sales people have out of the Collins Aerospace, there was an opportunity, which came up for a product that UTAS makes out of their sensors business before. And when the airline was looking for that, we were able to offer that opportunity out of the UTAS -- the heritage UTAS product line. And that created sales, which UTAS would not have seen before and Rockwell Collins did not have an opportunity to offer before.","So that's part of the thing that we saw as in the synergy bucket. And that alone is about $80 million of revenue we would not have seen otherwise. And there is other examples of that, but it's leveraging their reach, Rockwell Collins reach and generating additional business.","Greg Hayes","And if you think about the Raytheon side again, the thing that most excites I think Dr. Kennedy and myself about the merger is the technology. And the fact is Raytheon has premier technology in cyber that is primarily dedicated to DOD and the military customer, we see an opportunity to take that cyber capability and move it into the commercial aerospace arena, which today Raytheon would not have a channel to do that.","The same in terms of coordinating on the new air traffic control system with a shared GPS mixture married up with Raytheon radars to allow airplanes to fly much closer together and airspace. That would be allowed today.","We're going to have to do that if we're going to see that air traffic growth that we expect in the U.S. And I think again, those are the types of big synergy opportunities. And there will be others. Some of that will be in the ISR space, some of it will be in the material space as we think about hypersonic and other new defense technologies.","But again, these they don't happen overnight. But what was encouraging about the Rockwell Collins synergies is the guys are out there and they're incentivized to find these things. And Kelly, or Bergen team are driving these every day. And we'll have the same type of organization at the new Raytheon technologies to drive these technology synergies and revenue synergies near term.","Rajeev Lalwani","Great, thanks. And best of luck, Carroll and Akhil.","Akhil Johri","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Hayes for any closing remarks.","Greg Hayes","Okay, thanks, Daniel. I just want to thank everybody for calling in today. Obviously, Carroll and the IR team will be available all day to answer your questions. Thanks for listening and we'll talk to you guys early next year. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"21056":["United Technologies Corp.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Vice President, Investor Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs and significant other items of a non-recurring and or non-operational nature often referred to by management as significant other items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings including its 10-Q and 10-K report provide details and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth target that we laid out back in March of this year. As I told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our commitments. The old UTC of under promise and over deliver is our goal again.","And we're seeing the results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance. Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82 on almost $15 billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share are up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also of course raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60 and we're also increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion. And we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what remains a low growth and volatile macro environment.","I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through details but four key takeaways from today.","First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan is performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8% dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours and four operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn, noise and emissions.","Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential products, and we recently announced Otis partnership with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that will enhance connectivity and the customer experience.","Third, we're also of course seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and we remain focused on cost reduction, structural cost reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter and corporate expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year.","Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to maximize share and value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. And we recently announced two strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service business in Japan and CCS acquired a 70% stake in Riello which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will enhance our offerings to our European customers. Just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined.","These are just a few of the many examples of why we're executing our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the results and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Greg. Taking a look at slide two, organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging. Consumer spending remains strong and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as opposed to the 3% plus that we would all like to see.","During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis which was up 10%. Sales at CCS were flat as lower commercial HVAC exports and field and security sales were offset by 3% growth in U.S. residential HVAC. Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both Otis and CCS, reflecting little change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a near-term impact in our businesses.","In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices particularly in the tier 1 cities show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales were down 3% principally driven by China. We're consistent with our expectations. We saw sales at Otis decline 7% while CCS sales in China were down 2%.","Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket at Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were down 8% driven by original equipment declines at Pratt, primarily due to headwinds from the F117 program, where as you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5 nacelle retrofit program is now complete.","Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide three. Just as a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So, at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China where orders were down 14 % on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis however. Excluding China, new equipment orders at Otis were up 3% with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA in both cases off tough compares.","Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration which was down almost 30%. Recall that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the quarter. Low to mid single-digit growth in fire and security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high single-digit decline in commercial HVAC entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment orders in the Americas were up low single-digit with mixed single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the quarter.","Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20% driven primarily by the V2500.","Moving to slide four. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as one point of organic growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by a point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71 which included $0.11 of restructuring and other onetime significant items.","As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about $180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million, down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings as we have been able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list and we have been disciplined about not fully replacing voluntary attrition.","Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued aero ramp-related investments at Pratt & Whitney. As Greg said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15 and we still have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%.","There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through, but as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half as well as some higher second half expenses below the segment. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year.","Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have recently come on the radar screen after Brexit. One, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and second, lower yields on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our pension expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate is around a $30 million profit impact.","With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail.","Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on page five. And please note, I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency and adjusted to exclude restructuring charges and other significant items as we usually do. Also note, we've included an appendix on page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful.","In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind to earnings.","New equipment sales increased 2%, led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we've seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter.","Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly in the quarter. Better than expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better than expected foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and $200 million. That's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit organic sales growth.","On the next page, climate controls and security sales were up 1% at constant currency with 2 points of growth from acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was \u2013 that growth from acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits.","As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix, but to call out a few highlights, during the quarter, we saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss midway through the second quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential it was the best June we've seen in about seven years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continued to put pressure on the container business which was down 39%.","Despite a softer top line, CCS continue to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8%, driven by benefits from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record 20.4%, we continue to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first half organic growth was weaker than expected with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum, and favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security.","Turning to aerospace on slide seven. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20% including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware. Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both pre-buy from a service bulletin and also from where we are in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about nine years old and that's a sweet spot for overhaul activity, and we continue to see RPM growth. In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan shipments in the quarter were higher than in Q1, but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines in 2016.","For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the general aviation and helicopter markets. Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop through from the strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D.","We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from a product line sale and contract closeouts were a headwind, but were offset by favorable contract settlements in the legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid single-digit. Drop through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from lower than expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related investments. Add it all up and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at Pratt & Whitney.","At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on next-generation platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts, provisioning and repair. Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the C-5 Nacelle retrofit program.","Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines in legacy program rates and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations and improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.","With that, I'll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Paul. So encouraging start to the year with 2% organic growth and slightly better than expected earnings. Based on this first half, we feel very good about the year. We obviously raised the low end of the guidance by $0.15. We took up the revenue, low end of the revenue guidance, so again, very comfortable about the year. But as Akhil noted, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the global macro environment and this is a long journey. And we've laid out a plan through 2020 and we feel very confident about that plan.","For the meantime though, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more with less. Investing an innovation for growth. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation. Most importantly, we're going to focus on executing out the record aero backlog. As I said many times before, I've never been more confident in UTC's long-term outlook. With the aero backlog and the investments we've made on all of our businesses, we continue to be set up for above GDP growth, well into the future.","With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a quick question on Pratt. You had good aftermarket growth, but the organic growth was well below that aftermarket growth. So what shrunk in the quarter to kind of offset what happened in the aftermarket??","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. The \u2013 if you'll notice, Ron, the commercial OE shipments were lower than last year. Also, on the military OE side, we had fewer engine shipments and then Pratt Canada OE shipments were lower as well. So I think it is more about the OE story where commercial was \u2013 commercial and military OE was down.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Super, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. My question would be on Otis. So Otis China, you seem to see the price mixed delta get quite a bit worse in Q2 than Q1, similar to the market leader there, I think price mix must have been down sort of high teens against nine (21:04) in Q1. So I guess the price mix headwind for the year in EBIT is probably bigger than what you guided back in December and March. What are the sort of offsets in the organic earnings guide in Otis? Is it cost cutting or Europe after market?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Julian, first of all, even though the delta between the value at 14% down versus units up 4% feels large, 18 points, only half of that is pricing. Rest had to do with more the mix, if you will, right. We had last year's significant major projects at higher value per unit and this year that's not been the case. So it's about 9% price out of that delta which is a couple of points worse than what we saw in first quarter, not the dramatic number that you would conclude without having this context. And so it's not \u2013 I mean, overall, we think pricing for China this year is just slightly worse for the P&L impact for this year. Yes, the margin and backlog is a little worse than what we were expecting. But offset to that, as always in China is to greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions on suppliers. And that's what they will do.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the aerospace OEMs? And we saw a supplier yesterday talk about slow payments, I know that they've been pushing change in terms, and just if you can talk a little bit about that. Just I noticed the receivables were up about $600 million sequentially, not sure if that plays into it at all, but just what's happening from the OEM customers?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Sam, it's Greg. I would say the pressure on cost continues unabated at the OEM levels. We have Scope Program (23:02) currently in Airbus to \u2013 we've talked to Boeing about Partnering for Success 2.0. There's obviously a lot of pressure in a very competitive environment to reduce costs and we obviously are working with the customers to find ways to take cost out of the product. But it's got to be win-win for us. As far as the payment terms, I know there's been some talk out there. We have not seen any extension of payment terms beyond that which we have in the contract. And we have general terms agreements with both Boeing and Airbus and they pay to those terms. So we have not really seen any big deterioration in receivables as it relates to any or either the operators.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Just to clarify, Sam, the increase in receivables that you referred to, some of it has to do with the acquisition that we had and also we had a very strong June as Paul referred to in the script. So, when you have late sales in the quarter, you tend to have more receivables because you just haven't had enough time to collect it as part of your normal terms.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, strong residential HVAC sales in June.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, I was hoping to ask a, I guess a multifaceted question on cash. Thank you for the pension color on the P&L. But just thinking about cash this year and into next year, can you give us an update on what, if any, cash call the pension could have next year? And then, Akhil, it was interesting that structuring is coming down a bit. Is there some cash use relief there? And then finally, cash working capital, actually looked okay in the quarter relative to what I was expecting. How does that play out over the rest of the year and maybe the ability to whittle away at some of the safety stocks into next year?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great, great question, Jeff. Good to see the focus on cash. But clearly, I think on pension side, we have no mandatory requirements to fund. Of course, depending on where the discount rate ends up on December 31, the pension deficit could be a little worse than what we reported at the end of December last year. But definitely, there is no mandatory requirement for us to fund domestic pension, pension plan. We will evaluate it as part of our normal cash utilization capital deployment plan and see if we need to do anything on a voluntary basis, but no call on it.","The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I talked about for the year, essentially was keeping the savings intact, could benefit a little bit on the cash side, but again, that's small and doesn't play out in one year, it generally plays out over a couple of years.","And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think it's \u2013 Greg had mentioned many times, we are not satisfied with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still have on our supply chain side through buffer stock and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It is probably a multi-year effort as we get our suppliers to performing in goal levels which are very high standards by the way, right. We want people to have 95% or more on-time delivery and less than 500 PPM on quality. All that says is that, in order to meet our customer commitments, we will continue to have a little bit of buffer stock for a year or two more.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just a quick one. Is there anything non-operational in the Otis margin? Thank you.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, not this quarter.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. I'm going to try to stick to one question. And just to talk about this investment in Pratt, Greg, how do you see that paying out over time? Or are the returns occurring in time?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Howard, as you know, this is a \u2013 it's an expensive game in the commercial engines business. And I've said before we're going to invest or we have invested about $10 billion in CapEx and R&D over the last dozen years or so to bring the products to market. The good news is, at the end of the year, we should have all of the aircraft engines certified. We'll get Irkut. We'll get MRJ. We'll get Embraer. So the big phase of investment is really \u2013 will slow down after this year. We're not done. But in terms of the major spending, we should start to see that turn down. At the same time, as you know, we're going to see an uptick in negative engine margin. And as I look out over the next ten years or so, you're going to see a big number there, close to another $10 billion of negative engine margin on all of these platforms. That's going to step up in the next couple of years to get to about $1 billion in 2018. And they'll stay about that level. Even though production rates will increase, costs will come down but that is a significant investment.","The good news of course is the aftermarket will come. As we saw this quarter on the V, when the engines get out there, that six-year, seven-year, eight-year timeframe, the engines do need to be overhauled. We will see the returns. But this is not a \u2013 it's not a short-term gain. These are 30-year programs. The returns remain on track to what we had expected which is well in excess of our cost of capital. But it's not for the faint of heart either, as you know, Howard. And we're in for the long-term. We've got great engines. The performance has been phenomenal out of the box. Right now, our focus is just on delivering engines and then servicing them for the next 25 years or 30 years.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve.","Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.","Hi, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Paul, thanks for all the detail on slide 11, very value-add.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, good. Thanks.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On CC&S, what is the now commodity spread for the year and what was it in the quarter?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So it was $50 million, good news in the quarter. This was probably the best quarter from commodities' point of view. For the full year, we expect about $125 million. That's CCS.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And is that a change from what you guys had had before?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Just slightly higher, not meaningful. Aluminum has been slightly better than we expected and that's showing up, but maybe $20 million to $25 million, not too much.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll give you a little more breakdown on that, Steve. When we talked about our guidance for CCS for the year, we had commodities and price together. So there is a price offset there in the second half. So it won't see quite as much tailwind as the $125 million.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on the transport and \u2013 sorry, that's price costs, that's not just commodities, right?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Correct.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on the transport business, you mentioned the container business was down substantially. What was kind of like core U.S. truck trailer down? And could you just remind us of, I know that's a profitable business, just the margin profile and the mix within there because your margin was really good despite transport being down. So, obviously, it wasn't a mixed drag that you weren't able to overcome.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. So, if you look back a few years ago, the Transicold business, there was some disparity in margins amongst the different segments. Container was quite high and North America truck trailer was quite low. And that's changed over the years. If you look at the average margin, it's sort of at the CCS broader average today, and there's no major difference between the different segments. A little bit of color just on the quarter, North America truck trailer was essentially flat, but orders were down similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, at least for the North America truck trailer piece, we're largely booked for the third quarter as we should be at this point. So I would say we're okay.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning. I just wanted to go back to the military business for a moment, Pratt and UTAS. Akhil, you did a nice job of explaining some of the puts and takes there, but I was wondering if you could perhaps let us know when you feel like you're going to have kind of a clean comp on a year-over-year basis, given the C-17 and the C-5. And then you \u2013 is that the first quarter 2017, I guess, is the question. And then on Pratt, you suggested that it was worse than expected this quarter on military. Can you just dive a little bit deeper on why it was worse than expected? Thanks.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So the first question in terms of when do we expect the turn in the military side, I think on Pratt probably 2016 is most likely a low point because of the mix shift that we have talked about and reduction in the F117 engines. First quarter next year, you will see improvement there on the F117 compares. For UTAS, the C-5 that we have talked about, that was \u2013 we saw some benefit of that in first quarter this year as well. So that two compares would become easier starting second quarter of 2017 onwards.","For this quarter, slightly weaker than Pratt expectations. Actually, a lot of it was in line with what we expected. I didn't necessarily say it was hugely weaker than expected, it was \u2013 the slight shortfall was on the OE shipment side which were down year-over-year, partly due to what our production schedule was and partly due to some parts availability. But overall, it is okay.","Karen, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. And I'll echo the comments on slide 11, very helpful. Unfortunately, it's taken half our questions, but...","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That'll keep your workforce down (33:10).","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm sure that was the reason, Paul. Just what \u2013 I mean sounds like the news flow on the neo engine was positive from Farnborough. Can you maybe just comment on that, Greg, and just give us an update on the quarterly phasing for the engines shipments in the back half of this year? And on top of that, does that place additional pressure on Pratt margins versus 2Q?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nigel, I think \u2013 as you saw it coming out of the airshow, we had a very productive airshow from an orders standpoint, a couple of big orders. Right now, we stand at about 8,200 firm and option orders for the GTF and I think the operators, as I said, they all seem to love the engine. The dispatch reliability is good, so things look very positive from that standpoint. As far as production, I think it was Akhil or I guess Paul mentioned, going to build about 140 engines in the back half of the year. That will probably be spread pretty evenly over both of the next two quarters. That's up from what, 36 engines I think. We built 60 engines, 36 got delivered in the first half. So production ramp is continuing as we expect. A little pressure on negative margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up. But the good news is we're coming down the cost curve exactly as we had expected. We look at it every month. We look at it by engine. We're right on that 87% learning curve that Bob Leduc laid out earlier this year. So we feel good about the cost of the engines. We feel good about the ramp. Always a challenge, but we're working through it.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, I wondered if you could expand on that a little bit? It looked like on the commercial OEM revenues, you were sort of off tens of millions, but the op profit delta year-over-year was probably more like $150 million or $200 million with Pratt being the vast majority of that. I wondered if you could speak to \u2013 are you seeing higher losses per engine or is there a non-recurring cost element and that just seemed like a pretty large number there on a year-over-year basis.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So I think the best way to answer that, Carter, would be to give you the EBIT roadmap, if you will, for Q2 for Pratt, right? So the negative engine margin, first of all, is exactly in line with what we expected. It's not higher than what \u2013 there are some additional ramp up costs that Paul referred to. But overall, we got about $120 million good news year-over-year on commercial aftermarket. Plus, we had another $55 million or so of good news between pension and E&D \u2013 sorry, pension and FX. Those were offset, so $175 million of good news offset by $70 million of negative engine margin, $50 million on the military mix issue that we've talked about before, F117 principally and others, another $35 million net of pension increase in E&D and then the rest about $50 million plus on Pratt Canada OE shipment reduction and the ramp up cost that we've talked about. So that's essentially the makeup of the Pratt earnings as to why Pratt earnings were down in spite of good strong commercial aftermarket.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's important, Carter, to point out, Pratt is doing what they need to do in terms of investing in the ramp. We've added about 400 people to the supply chain this year to make sure that the suppliers have adequate plans in place to deliver on their commitments for the ramp, and some of that investment that we're making will continue out into next year. It's a little bit more than we had originally expected, but it's what we need to do to make sure we get these engines out on time. So a little bit higher investment, but tracking exactly where we expected on cost.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfectly clear. Thanks for detail, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks so much. So it sounds like what you're saying is you expect now to deliver 175 engines versus 200. How are you doing on the supply chain because I know that's been an issue? And where are you with all the little technical issues? The start time, the error messages on the engines and when do you expect to have those behind you?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let's be clear on the production. We're going to build, deliver 200 engines this year. We built 60 in the first half of the year. We're going to build about 140 in the back half of the year which is exactly what we talked about or Bob Leduc talked about back in March. So, timing of revenue recognition might be a little bit different as I said. I think we actually revenue-recognized about 36 in the first half. Again, there's engines that are sitting there on the docks, sitting in transit. So feel good about the build plan. We're not going to come off of the 200. As far as the supply chain goes, there are always challenges. But if you think about this, with 8,000 parts and about 800 different subassemblies in this engine, there's a handful of parts that are causing some pain in the supply chain right now, and Bob and the team are all over this and we will get through this. On the technical stuff, I would tell you it's in the rearview mirror, Cai. The start time with the software drops have been pretty well addressed. The nuisance faults are behind us. As I said, 99.8% dispatch reliability with the four operators over 5,000 hours of revenue service since its introduction back in January. So the engine is performing exactly as we had expected and no surprises on cost, no surprises on delivery.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","How come you're only \u2013 you missed by \u2013 I guess you delivered 36 but you built 60. How come, given Airbus claims they want to have the engines, how come you were not able to ship more?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, they don't all go to Airbus, keep in mind. Some go to Embraer, some go to Bombardier, some go to MRJ. There's also a large number of spares that we built in the first half of the year to support the in-service fleet. So it's not just production there. Obviously, Airbus would like engines sooner, but we're exactly on the production plan we committed to them earlier this year.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Greg, you mentioned a few times through the call your confidence in your two 2020 revenue growth targets. And I look at the slide from the investor day, there's some pretty strong rates in there. It's a low of 4% and a high of 10%, depending on the segment and all kind of blends to 5% to 6%. And I guess the numbers you reported today are pretty good, but we're still walking along these low single-digit organic revenue growth levels. Not a ton of reason, I don't think, to expect 2017 to materially accelerate from 2016, correct me if that's wrong. So you would kind of need 2018, 2019, 2020 to be growing high single digits organically. Is that realistic? And what makes that happen outside of the macro getting better?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know I think you need to break that down, as you mentioned with the four segments. I would tell you I got the highest confidence in Pratt and in UTAS, just based on the backlog and the skylines coming out of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind 200 GTF this year then 400 then 800, we're ramping up to almost 1,500 engines. So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF on all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than replaced with volumes with the neo, plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-series, MRJ. All of those things give us really high confidence on the organic outlook at Pratt, and similarly at UTAS where the Aerospace Systems grew. They've got line of sight probably the 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period.","The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down 1% organically, Otis only up 2%, but we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D, on new products. We're spending money on digital at the commercial side to enhance growth. So I still see a clear pathway. Now, again, we assume the world's going to grow at 3%, not 2%, and if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little share with these products, we can be in that 4% to 5% range as we move towards 2017, 2018. But, clearly, it's more of a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, the urbanization trends continue. The growth of the middle class continues. All of those things favor the commercial products. People need air conditioners. People need elevators. So we're confident in the product mix and in the growth outlook.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Noah, one additional data point on the UTAS business, I think we've talked about this, the content per aircraft is significantly higher on the new platform than the platforms that are being replaced as we've talked about going from 2 million per chipset to 4 million per chipset. So, even if the production rate of the aircraft does not increase too much, just the change in the introduction of the new platforms is going to increase the UTAS sales in any case. So I think aerospace side, as Greg said, very high level of confidence. You don't have to go out and compete those every day again for the 2020 skyline, it's more the commercial businesses.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And, Akhil, what's now in the 2016 guidance for euro, dollar?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's $1.10.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So no change. Or I'm sorry, you were at $1 before, correct?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Right. And that's part of the reason why we have increased our bottom end and also the Otis guidance if you will. And because...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","...the euro has been around $1.12 or so for the first six months and we're expecting $1.10 for the next six months.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Thank you. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Banc.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I think you said that aftermarket's now mid single-digit growth that with Pratt in the plan which probably gives you north of $150 million of additional EBIT, but the segment came down $50 million. So $200 million of higher EBIT in there being absorbed I guess by E&D and ramp costs, is that how you'd characterize it?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So let's do the full year math on EBIT Pratt, EBIT, right (44:10).","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, please. Thanks.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So commercial aftermarket would give probably $125 million of good news versus what we expected.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That would be offset by $50 million more in E&D, $50 million lower from military business and the remaining $75 million from the fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments plus the additional ramp costs that we talked about. So three high level things offsetting the good news from commercial aftermarket.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. That's perfect. And then if you think about, Greg, you said the \u2013 this is a follow-up to the same question. When you said that the certification of the engines are all done this year, E&D, how quickly does that drop over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the roadmap has us going down about $250 million over the next three years as we look at the R&D. Again, just because the engine's certified doesn't mean all the flight testing's done. So there still is significant cost out there and we're not going to stop investing in the technology either. We're not going to go to zero. But clearly, you can expect to see it probably in that 4% to 5% range as a percentage of sales going forward.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, David.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Greg, I wanted to touch on Otis' new equipment in North America. The orders were up this quarter, but I think the smallest kind of increase we've seen in quite a while. Could you just frame the North American new equipment market and do you think we've kind of peaked out there in terms of order rate? Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just to be clear, the U.S. order rate was actually up I think about 6% in the quarter. Canada was down big. There were some big projects that didn't repeat year-over-year. But we still see growth in the backlog at Otis this quarter in North America. So has it peaked out? I don't know if it's peaked. It's clearly back to where it was in 2007 which is good news. It'll probably \u2013 we won't certainly see double-digit growth. We're not expecting double-digit growth over the next year or two.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","In the back half, David, you're right. There were some very strong orders in Otis North America last year like the Hudson Yards. So we \u2013 in the back half, we saw almost 50% growth in North American orders last year, and that clearly is going to be tough compares to jump off of, so don't be surprised if the orders in North America are down year-over-year in the back half. Again, very robust economy, things still look pretty good. The good news is that the orders from what we have seen over the last several quarters are converting into sales now. So the new equipment sales are very strong in North America and we expect that to continue for a period of time.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for the color.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On Otis and CC&S, after a few years of cost focus, you've talked about the need to spend more on product development in each of those business areas. Could you give us a sense of where that spending is going to occur and is this something we should see over the next couple years? And then see a margin benefit subsequently? Could you give us a sense of what that trajectory would be for the two businesses?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. So we talked about Otis spending only about 1% of sales on E&D, and a very small part of that was on actual new product. Most of the E&D historically has been on cost production. We can see that doubling over the next couple of years. We saw E&D up this quarter at Otis. We'll continue to see it grow over the next couple of years. They're investing in a couple of different things.","First of all, refreshing the aesthetics in the cab, very important. We're doing that across the globe, and that's done in each individual market. We're also investing in high rise newbuild technology and looking at ways to again enhance the offering on the service side. So investments in new equipment, investments in service technology, investments in service productivity tools. On CCS, they've already doubled E&D over the last four years or five years. It's right about 2% of sales. It should continue at that level. The focus there is really on the large commercial chillers where we had not had a competitive offering for a number of years. Reinvesting in that business, we continue the see big opportunities in the big chiller side. But it will take several years and some additional R&D expenditures to get the product line where we need it to be.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Are these levels that you expect to continue as sort of a natural level for investment in these businesses or would there be a margin benefit that we would expect in a couple years down the road?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know what, I think, Doug, you've got to continue at this kind of 2% level of sales. Think about $30 billion commercial business, 2% of sales is about $600 million a year. It's not an unreasonable amount of money. And I want to \u2013 these are long-term businesses. You have to continue to invest. So, if I'm looking for margin opportunities on the commercial businesses, it's going to come from improving productivity on the service side at Otis and it's going to come from cost reduction on the CCS side.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","R&D was up $30 million year-over-year, Greg, and you've talked about it being up at Pratt, Otis. Can you break out how much it was up in each of the sectors?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So I mean the number I quoted on Pratt, up $35 million, was excluding pension because that we took out in the math on the good side. So the numbers that you see in the $30 million include the benefit of pension. So the Pratt number was a little north of $20 million, about $25 million increase. Otis was another $10 million or $11 million increase, and then offset by slight decrease in UTAS and CCS was flat and corporate office was down slightly. So that's the net math of $30 million.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And then quickly, it looked like F-35 engine deliveries were less than the first quarter where I would have thought they'd be ramping. So can you just talk about what's going on there?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Some of it, George, was just simply the Q4 deliveries which got pushed into January. It drove up the Q1 more than what the original schedule was. So I think it was a little bit of catch up in Q1 that you saw. Q2 is more in line with what we expected, and I think you'll see some ramp up happening in the second half. But again, the profile was not very different, it was just that Q1 was higher than originally we had expected because of just the move from Q4 to Q1.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay, thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Hayes for any closing comments.","Gregory J.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning, everyone. United Technologies is off to a good start in 2017. Today, as you saw, we reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $1.48 and, importantly, 3% organic sales growth. All four businesses saw organic sales growth in the quarter, and orders were up impressive across all four businesses. As a result, of course, we remain confident in our 2017 expectations with sales of $57.5 billion to $59 billion, and that includes 2% to 4% organic growth and adjusted EPS, as we said earlier, $6.30 to $6.60.","So we continue to make progress on our four strategic priorities. Those are, of course, execution; structural cost reduction; disciplined capital allocation; and, the one I'm most excited about, innovation for growth. The investments we've made in the past few years and the investments we're making today is driving organic revenue growth, and not just growth this year; it'll be growth for years to come.","Looking at each of the businesses in the quarter, at Climate, Controls & Security, the investments in new products, and the investment in additional feet on the street, are indeed paying off. We saw 2% organic sales growth, and new equipment orders in the quarter were up 7%.","At Otis, we continue to feel good about our overall market share. Even in China, we saw new equipment orders grow 1% in units in a still very challenging market. We also continued to make progress with our service transformation at Otis. We're on track in 2017 to provide half of our 31,000 service technicians with the digital devices, applications, and training to significantly increase their productivity. This initiative is a critical step in providing better value and quality to our service customers around the world, which will in turn improve both top and bottom line.","On the Aerospace side, at UTC Aerospace Systems our commitment to developing aircraft systems with greater data connectivity has yielded a couple of key wins. Recently, Lufthansa Technik underwent an extensive industrywide evaluation for an aircraft interface device and selected our offering based on our ability to connect multiple data sources from the aircraft into the cockpit, a key win.","Pratt & Whitney. We have course remain focused on the geared turbofan engine ramp and entry into service for our customers around the world. The GTF has been in operation for more than a year now and has more than 150,000 hours of passenger service. The GTF is in service at 13 operators currently flying over 100 destinations on four continents daily, providing 60% better fuel burn, 50% lower emissions, and a 75% reduction in noise footprint.","To be fair, of course, we have had a couple of issues that we need to fix in order to improve durability on the GTF. First, let me start off by saying that we know that we've been causing our customers pain with these issues. As I said in January, they're not happy and we're not happy. The good news today is that we're well on our way to solving these early entry-into-service issues. Two weeks ago, the European regulators certified the improvement package we developed for the carbon seal issue, and it's being incorporated into engines in the field as we speak. We plan on having most of the retrofits complete by the middle of May, and all new production engines being shipped today include these upgrades. On the second issue we discussed, we expect to see upgraded combustor liners to be available in engines starting in the fourth quarter. As we've said before, neither of these are flight safety issues, and we'll continue to support operators with additional spare engines while we upgrade the fleet. The good news is, as I said, 13 operators, a little over 100 engines in service today. It's a manageable problem.","With regard to capital allocation, we've remained disciplined. During the first quarter, we spent over $930 million on share repurchases. That's well on our way to the $3.5 billion placeholder we have for the year. We also continue to have a $1 billion to $2 billion placeholder for opportunistic M&A. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business beyond typical research and development. We're focused on new materials and manufacturing processes, which include additive manufacturing technology along with a big push into digital. We recently launched a state-of-the-art digital accelerator in Brooklyn, New York. This is a $300 million investment over several years, and it's focused on leveraging software, analytics, and the Internet of Things across our businesses to develop enhanced customer experience and product innovation, as well as to drive continued productivity.","Let me stop there and turn it over to Akhil and to Carroll to take you through the actual business unit results. Akhil?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Thank you, Greg. I'm on slide 2. So reported sales of $13.8 billion were up 3% year over year. Organic sales were also up 3%, with stronger growth across the two aerospace segments. Acquisitions benefited us by a point, largely at CCS, and that was mostly offset by FX translation headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.48 was up 1%. Reported of $1.73 had the benefit of $0.29 from the sale of our stake in Watsco that we talked about in March, and there was a press release in February. That was offset partially by $0.04 of restructuring.","Free cash flow to net income, 48% for the quarter, in line with our expectations and ahead of prior year, especially when you take into account the fact that the Watsco transaction increased our net income by about $250 million in the quarter, but the cash that came from that transaction of roughly $450 million was reported in the investing line, so causing obviously an adverse impact to the metric. On top of that, if you add the Canadian payment of about $250 million as well, for which the net income charge was taken in Q4 of 2015, it has a reduction in the ratio. Overall, cash was exactly what we expected, and we feel very good about being able to get to our full-year guidance of 90% to 100%, although because of the Watsco transaction probably more at the lower end now.","For the full year, we remain confident in our expectations. Q1 EPS of $1.48 adjusted was a $0.10 beat roughly versus our expectations. I would say some of that was timing. For example, at UTAS, provisioning was really strong in the quarter; it was up almost 30%, largely driving the 12% aftermarket growth. Now, as you all know, provisioning can be lumpy. We do expect full year still to be flattish, so we got some good benefit in the first quarter. Also at Pratt, negative engine margin will pick up sequentially every quarter as we have delivery ramp of GTF. And finally I think our corporate expenses will be up in the back half, including in investments in the digital accelerator that Greg talked about. So we had a really good start with Q1, feel very good about that, but it is only the first quarter of the year.","Looking at organic growth on slide 3, global environment remains mixed. Americas remains strong. We saw improvement in Europe, but there is continued pressure in China and Middle East.","Looking at our commercial businesses, Americas, we saw Otis up 7% in the quarter, and that's on top of 9% Q1 2016. CCS was up 3%. Within EMEA, Europe excluding Middle East was strong. Both new equipment sales and orders at Otis were up substantially. And for the first time since Q2 of 2011, service in Europe excluding Middle East was up slightly. CCS was also up in Europe excluding Middle East, driven by commercial HVAC and commercial refrigeration businesses. Middle East remained under pressure. Commercial HVAC was down over 20% in the quarter and Otis new equipment sales were down just around 40%. Asia was down 2% with continued pressure from China new equipment at Otis and the container business at CCS. For the rest of Asia, we saw good growth at both Otis and commercial HVAC.","Within the aerospace businesses, commercial aero is up 5%, largely on the back of strong commercial aftermarket at both Pratt and UTAS. Military business was up 1%, driven by Pratt aftermarket and development revenue. Pratt OE volumes and UTAS military business were down. Q1 orders felt really good, as Greg said, particularly the strength in CCS. It is the strongest quarter of orders in over two years. We saw growth throughout the business, and Otis new equipment orders excluding China were also up 11%. So pretty good growth there. And that strength in orders gives us high confidence in the organic top-line growth and earning expectations for the year.","With that, let me hand it over to Carroll to walk through the business units.","Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Akhil. I'm on slide 4. I'll be speaking of the segments in constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there's an appendix on slide 13 that has additional segment data as a reference.","Otis sales were $2.8 billion in the quarter, up 3% organically. Operating profit was down 4%. Contribution from higher volume was more than offset by continued pricing pressure in China and strategic investments in service, IT and E&D. Foreign exchange translation was a 1 point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales were up 2%. High-teen growth in Europe and low-teen growth in North America were partially offset by continued pressure in China and the Middle East. As expected, new equipment sales in China saw high-single-digit declines.","Service sales were up 6%, including the benefit of acquisitions, with strong growth in modernization and repair. Maintenance sales were up low-single digit. New equipment orders were up 4% in the quarter. As Akhil mentioned, orders excluding China grew 11%. Otis saw order growth of nearly 30% in North America. And recall, that was on top of 33% growth in Q1 of 2016. Europe was also up nearly 30% with broad-based strength, and this is partially offset by declines in China. China was down 10% in value and declines in the Middle East, which was down more than 40%. Full-year expectations remain unchanged. We continue to expect operating profit to be down $50 million to $100 million at constant currency, with higher investments in the remaining quarters and continued pressure in China.","Turning to slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales grew 6% at constant currency in the quarter. Operating profit was down 3%, and that included an unfavorable contract adjustment of $25 million that was recorded on a large commercial project during the quarter. FX translation was a 2 point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were up 2% in Q1, driven by mid-single-digit growth in North America HVAC with strength in both residential and commercial. Commercial refrigeration saw a mid-teen sales increase. Fire and security sales were flat. Transport refrigeration continued to experience sales weakness and was down 8%. Within transport, container was down almost 40% and North America truck trailer was down 10%.","Total equipment orders at CCS were strong, up 7% in the quarter. Transport refrigeration orders were up 30%. That was primarily driven by North America truck trailer. With 6% growth in commercial HVAC and 8% growth in commercial refrigeration, CCS saw its highest organic order growth in a quarter since Q4 2014. Operating profit gains from organic volume were offset by the contract adjustment I mentioned earlier. Absent that adjustment, profit at CCS was flat in the quarter, including FX. CCS saw margin pressure in the quarter from lower transport refrigeration sales and unfavorable mix within fire and security and commercial refrigeration. Based on the strength in equipment orders and productivity initiatives, we remain confident in full-year expectations for CCS of operating profit up $150 million to $200 million at constant currency on low-single-digit organic growth.","Turning to Aerospace on slide 6. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. Aftermarket sales were strong, with commercial and military each up high-single digit. Despite a tough compare in the large commercial aftermarket, higher shop visits and content on V2500 more than offset declines in legacy models. Commercial OEM saw a 4% sales growth, while military OEM was flat. Geared Turbofan shipments increased in the quarter and totaled 70 engines, and that included 26 engines to be used as spares in support of customer fleets. With additional industrial capacity being added through the year, Pratt & Whitney remains on track to build 350 to 400 GTF engines in 2017, including spares.","Pratt operating profit of $393 million was down 5%. Headwinds included higher negative engine margin and lower OEM shipments at Pratt Canada and military. Also recall that Q1 2016 benefited from a favorable contract settlement that contributed $0.03 to earnings last year. These headwinds are partially offset by margin contributions from commercial aftermarket and FX benefit. We continue to feel confident in Pratt & Whitney full-year operating expectations of down $150 million to $200 million, including the benefit of FX.","Turning to slide 7. Aerospace Systems reported profit of $599 million, up 9%, on $3.6 billion of sales, and included 5% organic sales growth. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 does offer the year's easiest compare due to the transition to a new ERP system that was implemented last year. Commercial aftermarket was up 12%, with high single digit growth in both parts and repair and nearly 30% growth in provisioning. As Akhil mentioned, provisioning did include some one-time benefits in the quarter. If you exclude these items, provisioning was up 4%. Commercial OEM sales were up 2%, while military sales were down 2%, and that military sales was against a 2016 compare that included the delivery of the final units for the C-5 nacelle retrofit program.","Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and continued cost reduction, as partially offset by unfavorable commercial OEM mix and higher E&D. With a solid start to 2017, Aerospace Systems continues to expect operating profit to be up $50 million to $100 million for the full year.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Carroll. So I think we've said it often enough: good start to the year, confident in the full year. I'd also tell you that we're encouraged by signs of momentum in the global economy. We've seen really good strength here in the U.S. We've seen recovery in Europe. Even in China, we saw good economic growth in the first quarter, although some of the markets that we operate in remain challenging from a pricing standpoint.","Every CEO in corporate America talks about uncertainty. I'm not so worried. The fact of the matter is we all face the same headwinds, the same uncertainty. We're going to focus on what we control, and we're going to continue to invest for the long run. I'm confident that UTC is well-positioned for the long term because each of our businesses is supported by solid long-term market fundamentals. Those fundamentals, along with innovative new products, a relentless focus on cost reduction, and our commitment to providing the best possible value to our customers is going to drive both top and bottom line growth for years to come. We're confident in the outlook not just for this year but for 2020 and beyond.","So with that, let's open up the call for questions. Chelsea?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Just a first question \u2013 well, the main question \u2013 on CC&S. Obviously, people are very sensitive to any sense of margins plateauing in that business. So maybe you could walk through how quickly some of those issues around the unfavorable mix and the Transicold volumes \u2013 how quickly they'll reverse over the balance of this year? Is that something that can come in Q2? Or it's really a second half issue?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So, Julian, I think the 140 basis points, just to do a quick math for you first, 140 basis point decline in margin obviously on the face of it looks shocking. Half of that is just on the basis of that contract adjustment that Carroll talked about, the $25 million. 40 basis points comes from acquisitions that we did. As you know, acquisitions in the early years don't necessarily come in at the same ROS level as the existing business, but over time that improves. So we got sales with little earnings on acquisitions. That was 40 basis points.","The mix impact was a little bit \u2013 the rest of it, right? So to give you some examples of the mix, within Fire & Security we had growth in the installation business while service business declined. That will change as the year goes by. Similarly, in the commercial refrigeration business we saw growth coming largely from new products where costs in the first quarter were not at the levels at which they will be sequentially as we go through the year. So cost reduction efforts the rest of the year will drive margins higher on these new products that have been introduced in the commercial refrigeration business.","So we think the mix gets better. We also think the transport refrigeration business gets better. Container business was down 39% in the first quarter. We know that the refrigerator trade is growing 3% to 4% every year, so that market is going to bounce back. Our expectations now are that the market will probably be seeing some recovery in the second half. It certainly won't be down 39% for the year, so I think the mix gets better as we move through Q2 and the rest of the year.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Julian, I'd also add just two points. One, we continue to invest in R&D. R&D was up about $10 million in the quarter there, so there's a little bit of headwind there. The other thing is, we've talked about this investment in feet on the streets and additional salespeople out there to try and drive additional top line growth. You guys should be assured we haven't lost our focus on cost at CCS. Bob McDonough is \u2013 he's gating all of these head count additions to make sure that he can meet his commitments for the year. He and we remain confident in his overall guidance for the year. So, look, it was a bad first quarter, but as Akhil said, there was a couple of very specific things that caused it. Bob's got his eye on the cost line. We'll get the margins back to where you expect.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks; good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Morning, Myles.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was wondering if I could do the same litany I guess on Otis. So it looks like services sales were up nicely in the quarter. That should've helped mix, presumably. Can you talk about the margin driver and the pressure from China? And also, how much of the $75 million year-on-year growth in R&D dropped in 1Q?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So the easy question first. I think $17 million of the $75 million was in the first quarter. That's the strategic investments in totality, but there is also the pressure that you saw last year in our booking in terms of the China new equipment ultimately translated into the earnings, as you would have expected, right? The pricing pressure from China is where essentially a lot of the margin pressure at Otis is coming from.","If you look in totality, Myles, the first quarter in Otis was not that far off from what you expect for the full year. We do expect margins at Otis to be down this year, around 100 basis points or so, a little more than 100 basis points. And first quarter was a little worse than that, but not that much. So I wouldn't say Otis was a reason for concern. I think it's just the pressure in pricing at China that is continuing through the P&L now and will continue for a while. The move towards the lower mix as well in China, but rest of the business is performing well.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And remind me the service expectation for the year versus the new equipment expectation for the year, in terms of total sales growth.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So service we expect to be low to mid-single digit growth, and new equipment is low single digit growth. Now, in service, keep in mind \u2013 I agree with you that 6% should have given greater drop-through, but part of the service growth came from acquisitions that we did in Japan last year. And again, same phenomena, right, when you have intangibles amortization associated with new acquisitions, the drop-through is not that great. So a little bit of impact from acquisition there in Otis Japan.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Greg, I wondered if you could give us some color. It looks like you recently got the number 3 bearing fix certified. I wondered if you could give us some color on the path to getting all of those retrofits done and the cost there. And then, Akhil, I wondered just in light of all this cost growth \u2013 something I know we've talked about before, but I wondered if you could give us an update \u2013 when you look at the IRR of the program, the GTF, and incorporate some of this cost growth that you've seen, does that have a material drag versus what your initial business case may have planned? Any color there would be great. Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Is that all, Carter? So let's start, I think, on the thing that's on everybody's mind and, as I mentioned before, this is the carbon seal on the number 3 bearing on the geared turbofan. Obviously, as we said back in the first quarter, it was causing the customers pain, and there was some work that we needed to do to go out and verify the engineering fix. We completed that flight testing about a month or so ago. We had the European airworthiness authorities. They approved the fix about two weeks ago now. We have all the hardware for the fix pre-positioned out in the field. We've got about 25% of the engines retrofitted today. This is a four- to five-hour retrofit; they do it on the overnights. So we expect, as I said, most of these aircraft engines will be upgraded by the middle of May. There'll be a few stragglers, but most affected populations will have it all done by the middle of May. So that's the good news.","Look, it seemed like it took a long time, and I always tell guys around here, when we have customer problems, we look at our watch and not our calendar when we're trying to solve these things. And I would tell you, Pratt's done a pretty good job within the constraints of all of the airworthiness authorities and getting the proper testing done. But to that end we're going to continue to do additional endurance testing, working with Airbus through the back half of the year. We'll spend another $40 million or $50 million doing that testing to ensure that there's not another problem out there. We've got 150,000 or so hours on the fleet. We haven't seen any other surprises or concerns so far, but just to be cautious and to be complete, we're going to continue to do endurance testing.","So is the problem completely behind us? Obviously not. Some of these engines, you'll still see some removals, but I'd tell you the Pratt team has jumped on this just like the combustor issue that we talked about, and we have solutions. So the good news, Carter, if you think about it, is as I said, only about 100 engines out there in service. This is not a huge cost. The cost to do the retrofits, the cost in terms of helping the airlines through some of this, it's all in Pratt's numbers already for the year. Akhil can take you through the longer-term implications, but I would tell you, again, it's not material.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. I think just as Greg said, Carter, I think the IRR still above cost of capital clearly on the GTF. The higher volumes are certainly helping the business case there. The incremental costs are very early in the program. As Greg pointed out, it's only 100-odd engines at this point which need to be retrofitted. I'd rather see these problems being discovered now than when we have 1,000 engines out in the field. But the other more encouraging part is that with all the sensors that we have put in the GTF, compared to the old conventional engines, there is so much more data that we are getting, and taking benefit of that digital effort, we would be able to be much better at predictive maintenance and, therefore, reduce the cost of maintenance over the long term. So, I don't believe that has fully been factored into the business cases as well.","So while, yes, there have been some negatives with regard to the cost early on, there is also a huge opportunity with the digital aspect of the GTF engine that can give us some improvements versus our long-term business case.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, gents.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, gents. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. So just going back to Otis, China orders down 10%, I didn't hear how that's split between units and price. If I missed it, I'm sorry, but if you could just give that data point? And down 10% versus a big pickup in residential construction in China during 1Q, so I'm just wondering, if at all, when you expect to see that uptick in activity coming through on orders?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Sure, Nigel. So, I think 1% up in units. That's more in line with the China residential activity. Unfortunately, the value doesn't necessarily represent what's happening with the market. It's the units that you have to look at. And we believe we did better than the market. The market \u2013 again, exact data is not available, but the best estimate is that first quarter was probably flat to maybe slightly down in terms of units. In terms of value, the difference still remains the same. We are seeing continuing price pressure in Otis China. Roughly half of that disconnect of 11 points was pricing, and the rest was continuing move towards the mix of lower price, lower value units being sold or being asked for by the customers. So it's \u2013 units still decent, market share gains at Otis China continuing, and the pressure's unfortunately on the negative side on pricing and\/or mix continuing as well.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So price down 5% to 6% roughly, so that's in line with your full-year plan, I think.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","On the mix side, how does the margin on \u2013 in some of these lower-end residential units, how does the margin compare on those to obviously your typical margins on residential?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So margins as a percent is relatively close, Nigel, but as you can imagine, since these are lower value, lower price overall, it hurts the margin dollars. And that's one of the issues that we have to continue to face and deal with. We keep looking for more cost opportunities out of the product through reengineering, through using alternate materials, but the commodity price increases which have been happening not just in China, but globally, are not helping that very much. So, that definitely is a negative which we continue to watch at Otis.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a quick one as well. Just on the OE side in North America and Europe, are we seeing OE margins rising with the volumes?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","The OE margins, I would say, are \u2013 on the new equipment side, are still okay. Some of the order strength still has to flow through the sales line. The book margins seem to be consistent; in fact, slightly better than what we have seen in the past. But I would say no perceptive \u2013 no material changes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Akhil.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Well, thank you very much. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about UTAS and sort of efforts to reposition the business a little bit? By that I mean, using the example of the electronic controls in the interface with the customer and avoiding some of the commodity products in the past that have given you fits on pricing?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Fits on \u2013 we'll stay away from the pricing discussion, Howard. But look, I think as you think about the Aerospace Systems business, it's obviously one of the most complicated businesses that we have. As a result, it's complicated to do business with Aerospace Systems. We have over 300,000 separate parts that we sell. And the efforts underway today are to make those transactions with our customers much more seamless. And again, that's just where digital initiative comes into play. First of all, being able to predict when parts are going to fail, being able to communicate that, having the parts available, but also having a single interface for an airline technician who's out on the line to be able to diagnose and then order, and then reinstall a part seamlessly is all part of the long-term goal of where we're going with digital here.","So it's not something we're going to finish this year or next. It's a longer-term journey, as you can imagine the complexity of this. But they've got a good start. We talked about this $300 million investment we're making in digital. Dave Gitlin's folks will be a big part of that initially. I think they've got a very good road map in terms of where they want to be. The technology clearly exists to do all this; we just have to put it all together. I think we've got the right channel partners to do that. We've got the right folks internally to help.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Looking at the balance sheet, and looking at the inventory growth of $680 million, I know there's always a seasonality with regards to Carrier at this point in the year, but can you just kind of help us understand what's the normal growth, and what's really extra, or excessive, because of, say, the geared turbofan issue? I'm just trying to help size the opportunity for shrinking the inventory levels.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Sam, you hit on one of the hot-button issues that we have around here, and there's no bigger sinner from an inventory standpoint, of course, than Pratt & Whitney. They got almost $4 billion of inventory today. That's up over $1 billion in the last 18 months. The good news is the parts are flowing in, engines are being built, but I think Pratt, in order to protect schedule, in order to ensure that we have all the hardware we need, they have been more aggressive in bringing parts in than we probably needed, but it's okay. That stuff will work itself out. As you think about going from 160 engines last year to 350 to 400 this year, and then doubling again next year, the inventory turns will improve, and those inventory balances, while they seem large \u2013 they'll get more in line over the next 18 months or so. CCS, the U.S. res business, obviously it's all seasonal. Inventory's up a couple of hundred million there. The other piece, of course, is at Aerospace Systems. They have some opportunities on the inventory side as well, but certainly not at the same magnitude as the engine company.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","We've seen a nice rebound in air freight, and given the engines that Pratt has out in the field, and their exposure to that, did we see a pickup in order activity at Pratt related to that, or just broadly speaking the level of air-traffic growth that we did see so far in the first quarter of the year?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Most of those, Ron, as you can imagine, are old PW4000 engines. We did not really see a pickup there. Most of the pickup that we did see at Pratt was on V's. We continue to see again a lot of hours on the V fleet, a lot of activity there in our shops on V, but I wouldn't say we saw anything abnormal in terms of growth. The good news is as air freight does improve, that means they're putting hours on those engines, so they will come back for their normal scheduled overhaul, but that's probably 18 to 24 months out.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","The normal phenomenon, Ron, is continuing. We saw a good, high shop visits and content at V2500, but the legacy spare parts and legacy aftermarket associated PW4000 and PW2000 was down, and those trends we expect to see continue in spite of some of the other macro things that you mentioned like air freight, et cetera.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, okay. And then, Akhil, one follow-up for you. You mentioned a 40 basis point hit to margins due to some acquisitions in CCS. Can you give us more color on it? Like, what did you guys buy that would give you that kind of headwind? Because that seems a little high.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Well, this was basically acquisitions we did last year, Ron. I think there was a company in Europe that we bought, which was in the commercial HVAC and heating space. If you look at the appendix, you'll see that CCS had 4% benefit in their reported sales from acquisitions, and that essentially is about $150 million or so, and that comes with very little earnings to begin with. Now, those acquisitions will give us earnings as we grow, as we continue to take costs out of those, but initial amortization of the intangibles, initial margins that come in always keep pressure on any acquired entity, and we fully expect those to improve. The acquisition CARs, or our business cases, are all in double-digit IRR, so good value-creating opportunities, but the initial economics is always tough from an accounting point of view.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In the aerospace aftermarket, I think you said the 12% reported in UTAS was 4% excluding provisioning. Did I hear that correctly? And then I also heard high single digit in parts and repair. What's the variance between the high single digit in parts and repair and the 4% ex provisioning? And then if you could maybe just speak a little bit more qualitatively, I guess, to what you saw in the quarter. Are airlines no longer delaying shop visits? Or are you seeing less third-party parting out? Or anything that changed in terms of the trends you're seeing in the business?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So first just the reconciliation on your UTAS math. So the 12% overall commercial aftermarket growth was made up of roughly 30% on provisioning and high single digit on repair and parts. The 4% number that was quoted was just provisioning by itself, excluding some of those one-offs: a large sale of A380 landing gear, for example, or new higher engine build units than we had anticipated to support the Pratt \u2013 the neo nacelles, which go into the lease pools. So it's special exceptional items like that that drove the really exceptional growth in provisioning, which is a lumpy business, as you know. So we wanted to give you the color of 4% to make sure that you guys don't start projecting 30% growth for every quarter going forward.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I see.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yes.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So what was UTAS commercial aftermarket ex provisioning?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So ex provisioning it will be about 7% to 8%. Somewhere in that range.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. Which was still pretty good.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, yeah.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So we feel good about things there. It's an on-condition situation, which is not so much a number of shop visits, or other. So the more flight hours are translating into better parts requirements. So that's certainly very encouraging and good. Obviously, it's just one quarter. We've got to continue to see how that trends. Our internal dialogue with Mr. Gitlin is to try and see if he can do better on his commercial aftermarket than the guidance that he gave, but obviously we'll have to see how the next few quarters play out.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So the 70 deliveries of the PW1000s in the first quarter, how many of those went to customers? And how many were revenue deliveries? And how many were spare engines, spare engines just so that they could keep their planes going? And maybe walk us through the expected pattern of shipments over the year and the expected build in the engines that go out for spares? Thanks.","Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. Cai, we had 44 deliveries to customers, and we had 26 spares, which, when you think about the mix spares to deliveries, we expect obviously to shift towards deliveries as the year progresses.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. For the full year, I think we expect, Cai, a little over 50 engines to go into the spares to support the customer fleet. So this was \u2013 in conjunction with Airbus, we agreed to pull forward some of the spare engines for the entire year into first quarter so we could support the customer fleet today for the issues which we're having. Given the improvement package that Greg described, we expect the need for spares to come down a little bit as we go through the rest of the year. And so for the full year, we still expect a little over 50 going into the spare pool.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","So the 139 large-engine deliveries for the full quarter includes the 44 PW1000s?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yes, yes.","Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.","Right, yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So just on this provisioning and kind of the aftermarket growth there, will there be any comp dynamics through the rest of the year where the aftermarket there could actually go negative? I haven't gone back to check on how that provisioning growth was over the last three quarters of last year, but just from a quarterly progression perspective?","Carroll Lane - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. Steve, I mean, I think if you look at the comps going forward, obviously you get tougher comps in Q3. We still feel like provisioning is likely to be flat on the year. Akhil mentioned the A380 spare landing gear. That's a big-ticket item. Don't expect it to reoccur during the year. So, yeah, to get to flat on provisioning obviously from where we're starting from, we expect some tougher comps and some lower requirements.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And I guess we can just use this quarter's kind of influence as a base for how it would influence the total reported number at UTAS for aftermarket?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Well, I think \u2013 yeah, our expectation for UTAS is still to do low to mid-single digit type of growth in commercial aftermarket. I think it was originally low. We are hopeful that maybe they do a little bit better than that given the strength in the first quarter, but again, we still have to watch. As you know, 2015, everybody was a little disappointed, including us, with the fall-off we saw in provisioning in the back half of 2015, and this year I'd rather have a good quarter to begin with as opposed to relying on a heavy back half.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So, if anything, this gives us more comfort about the full-year guidance.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then in CC&S, any update to your price-cost spread there?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So I think if you \u2013 again, you've got to look at it business by business. I think in the residential side, we feel still \u2013 you know the commodity prices have been going up, and so the benefit that we expected, or most of the industry got last year from commodities, is certainly not there this year. We were sort of flattish at CCS on pure commodity. Pricing in the residential space feels okay, although the season is ahead of us, so we've still got to see what exactly happens and how the industry behaves as the season comes around. On the commercial side, pricing remains a little bit of a pressure, right? So we're still seeing more competitive pricing environment in the commercial HVAC space, not just U.S. but globally, and so that is one thing we're watching.","So I would say net-net in our provisional road map we had probably $25 million of tailwind from price commodity. I think that probably is looking more like flattish. On the other hand, we think to compensate that we'll probably see a little higher volume than we were expecting at the beginning of the year. So I think net-net, still feel good about the guidance for CCS, but maybe a little pressure on price commodity.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Greg, Akhil, good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Morning, Peter.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Morning.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Greg, just a quick one. When we were in Florence, there was discussion in Fire & Security about modeling the oil and gas market end market flat for 2017, and it was kind of a watch item on the CapEx front. What's the latest update there? And how are you bracketing that?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. I would tell you first quarter was not a great quarter in the oil and gas. I think everybody is experiencing this still with the volatility in oil price. We had some hope when we saw oil up at $60 a barrel. But when it trades below $50, I think it puts a little bit of a challenge into the plan for the year. Again, it's not a huge driver at Climate, Controls & Security, but clearly it's one of those things that Bob's got on his watch list that we have to be looking at for the rest of the year.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And what was, I guess, the planned restructuring for CCS this year?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","The plan for restructuring across all businesses collectively is about $300 million. CCS is a portion of that. I would say the largest one is UTAS, where we continue to look for continuing benefit on the footprint side. They need the cost reductions to help offset some of the mix problem that we have talked about there with the new products coming in. So CCS has a portion of that. I wouldn't like to give out an exact number on that.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Nice quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is now open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Greg, in the prepared \u2013 good morning. In the prepared remarks you guys talked about Otis Europe's service improving I think for the first time in five, six years, something like that. Can you talk about how you feel about the sustainability of that? And then a second question on GTF, specifically on the A321neo, what's going on there? I think your engine certified before the LEAP, yet the LEAP had their first delivery on the A321neo. Just what's holding up things there? Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, David. On the service side, there was very good strength in Europe, as I think Carroll pointed out in the remarks. There was good news really in repair and modernization. Those are the pieces that drove big service growth. And repair and modernization has been a little lumpy. You recall there were some programs five years ago, required upgrades that drove modernization. We'd seen a very, very low uptake there for the last couple years. So, it's encouraging to get these repair and mod jobs back in line. But having said that, even what we call our O or our basic maintenance was up in Europe. And it's market by market a little bit different, but there was strength in most of the European countries, a little bit of growth in the O. We saw some pricing stability, I would tell you, on the service side.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","In some countries, not broadly.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","In some \u2013 yeah. Right. So there's still challenges out there, as my CFO will point out here. But broadly speaking, I think the trends are encouraging in service. And as you recall, the key for the O service growth or the basic maintenance is just to get a little bit of inflation in the system, and I think we're finally starting to see that. And as unemployments come down, as the economy gets better, and quite frankly as our service quality gets better, we're starting to see a little traction there, so I think it's all very encouraging.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Then on the 321 \u2013 yeah, thanks.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. On the 321neo, nothing really to mention specifically, David. I think it's just more a function of Airbus and the customers in terms of how they want to prioritize their requirements. But our engine again continue to work as per the customer requirements. I think the big news, the good news, as Greg pointed out, is that we have the improvement package in place now, which has been approved by the regulators. So as soon as that's in the new engines and retrofitted on the existing fleet, we should start to see significant confidence.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. David, I think the real question here is are we on track to our contractual commitments to Airbus for the year for the GTF? And the answer is yes. We continue to see a path, as we said, 350 to 400 engines for the year. We should hit the delivery requirements at Airbus. How they allocate those engines, it obviously changes month to month, quarter to quarter based upon customer input, customer needs, but there's not an issue with the A321 versus the A320 or the A319.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is now open.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Jason.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hi, Jason.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a quick question on Otis and the longer-term margin trajectory there. I think, again, as we were down in Florence, I think one of the keys to margin expansion at the time were going to be some of these productivity tools that you're rolling out into the service area. So, can you just quickly provide us an update on the further rollout of those productivity tools? And when we should expect, here from the outside, that rollout to have a material impact on margins at Otis? Thanks.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Sure, Jason. So I think as Philippe mentioned in March, we've started the rollout. The launch country was Hong Kong, and we are seeing some really good results there. The mechanics seemed to be very excited with the new tools and everything that's going on with the new apps and everything else that comes with it to improve their productivity, and also the customer experience, by the way. As Philippe said, we have plans to get roughly half, 16,000 of our 31,000 technicians, with the new tools, followed by the remaining half in 2018. So, the impact of that obviously we expect to start to see some returns on the investments this year coming into 2018. That'll only be, for part of it, to technicians that will have the tools with them. Certainly, 2019 will be the first full year with all technicians around the world having the tools, and as we have said many times, a 1-point improvement in the productivity of the technicians can yield $30 million of benefits. So I think you'll see the real benefits starting showing up in 2019 to a full extent, and then it should only get better after that.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, and our last question today comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I'm interested in looking at the five-year guidance that you've given for Otis and CC&S. And in Florence, you talked about a level now which is really a 3% to 5% CAGR in top line over the 2016 to 2020 timeframe. And that really appears to tick up in 2018, 2019, and 2020. So when you look at those two businesses, what are the things that you're expecting to see that will make you confident that you're going to see that upturn in growth? Is that some specific improvements in the market? Is it market share? What should we watch for to know that it's really going to be on track to have that growth?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. Doug, a couple of different things. Obviously the dynamics of each of the businesses are different. I think what you want to look at for Otis is really what's happening with order backlog on the new equipment and the translation of that new equipment into the service portfolio. We've been very encouraged. I mean, these last couple of years we've had very, very solid new equipment growth. And as you know, that will translate into new equipment sales between six and 36 months out. We've got some of these major things that we're doing like the Willis Tower in Chicago. That's a three-year project in backlog. So I think from an Otis perspective, the metric you want to be looking at is new equipment orders.","The other thing, of course, on Otis is all about service conversion, and we track that, as you would imagine, on a monthly basis. And as the conversion rate continues at historical levels, that will translate into sales. So Otis is the easy one because it's, I think \u2013 Philippe talks about regaining a little bit of global market share. I think we've been doing that very effectively with some of these new products that they're going to be introducing, as well as, again, a more targeted sales and marketing effort.","On the CCS side it is, as you would expect, more market driven, but we still expect a point or so of growth from market share gains, and that's going to come from continued investment in these new products. We had 130 new products go into production this year. The pipeline remains robust within the whole Climate, Controls & Security portfolio. We're always looking for ways to upgrade the products, improve value, improve efficiency. And so that's the market share gain. I think you really need to look at market share of all of the businesses within CCS. And the thing that you can't, of course, control \u2013 when you have a container business that's down 40% because the ship owners are having a difficult go. Those things are temporary. I think you want to look at the underlying markets like for refrigerated transport, which Akhil said grows at 3.5% or 4% a year. Those things all support that 3% to 5% organic sales growth that we were expecting for CCS.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. And I would just add that, as you know, the residential market in U.S. is seeing some good strength, some solid market fundamentals, both in terms of new housing starts as well as replacement market that comes in. A large part of the installed base was created in the early 2000s, and all that 100 million of split units and 50 million of furnaces and coils are going to be replaced over the next four or five years. So as we look at the market fundamentals, they are pretty solid, and in addition with the innovative new products, we should be able to gain some share. So that's the combination.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But I just want to make sure I understand on Otis, which makes sense that it's the more predictable one. Given that a very large portion of your OE sales are in China \u2013 you've had the pricing pressure, you've had the mix shift to lower end products. When you look at that market, how do you get comfortable about the service conversion there? I know this has been something that has been improving over time, but it seems that that would be a very important part of your scenario for 2016 to 2018 for Otis.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Doug, you're exactly right. I think what you've seen over the last three years is about 20% compound growth in the service portfolio. We've got almost 200,000 units under service today. We expect that to continue to grow kind of 10% to 15% a year, each year. And part of that is conversion, but it's also there's a large number of elevators out there that do not currently have service contracts that were out. And the key for us there is, of course, hiring enough technicians to actually do the work. That's the challenge. But, yeah, service in China will be a big driver of growth in China, but still, if you think about it, it's less than 10% of the China market for elevators is in service. So there has to be a normalization of the OE market in China as well to support that 3% to 5% because, to your point, that's still the world's biggest elevator market.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Greg Hayes for any closing remarks.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Chelsea. I just want to thank everybody for listening in today. As always, Carroll and team are available to answer all of your questions. And appreciate the confidence in UTX. Take care.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC's website at www.utc.com.","Please note, except or otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-reoccurring or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.","The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its Forms 10-Q and 10-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","In addition, in connection with the pending Rockwell Collins acquisition, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement that includes a prospectus from UTC and a proxy statement from Rockwell Collins, which is effective and which contains important information about UTC, Rockwell Collins, the transaction and related matters.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory Hayes","Okay. Thanks and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release, Q2 another solid quarter for UTC. Adjusted EPS was $1.97. It\u2019s up 6% versus last year, and that\u2019s on top of the 20% adjusted EPS growth that we delivered in the first quarter, so a really good start to the year.","Sales were up 9% with 6% organic growth. That reflects contributions from all four of the businesses, and also marks four quarters in a row of organic growth of 5% or better. Clearly, we are seeing some positive momentum in these results driven by our investments, specifically investments in innovation. Based on the first half performance and our expectation for the second half of the year, we are going to raise our outlook for the 2018 EPS, so we now expect earnings of $7.10 to $7.25, and that\u2019s up from our previous guidance of $6.95 to $7.15. And just a reminder that that excludes the impact from Rockwell Collins.","We are also raising the lower end of our sales outlook by $0.5 billion and now expect sales of somewhere between $63.5 billion and $64.5 billion. And that includes an improved organic outlook now to 5% to 6%, and that's up from 4% to 6% previously. Again, that's driven primarily by continued strength in our commercial aerospace aftermarket.","You saw on the press release this morning that we highlighted the expected impact to our adjusted EPS regarding the pending acquisition of Rockwell. With regard to the closing of the transaction, let me just say that we are on track with regulatory approvals. We believe we are down to the final stages of the process, and we expect the transaction to close here still in the third quarter.","As we look forward to the integration of Rockwell, we are clearly excited about the future and what Rockwell brings to the UTC portfolio. Collins Aerospace will give us differentiated products and services that are more intelligent and more connected than ever before and allow us to enhance customer value in the aerospace industry. And of course, we remain confident in our ability to deliver at least $500 million of net cost synergies from the combination.","Turning back to our operating results. As I said, we are halfway through the year, and we all remain focused on meeting our customer commitments. There\u2019s a lot of good things happening in the business, but a couple of highlights to note. The Aerospace Systems, they remain on track with their cost reduction initiatives offsetting some of the margin impacts from all of these new programs. Pratt & Whitney, they\u2019re continuing to ramp new engine deliveries, and in fact it's the first time in several decades this quarter that Pratt delivered more than 200 large commercial engines in a single quarter.","At CCS, again continued strong organic growth and that's driven by new product introductions. And at Otis, they continue to execute on their service transformation initiatives, which will lead to margin growth in the future. So overall, end markets continue to show strength. On the other hand, there are some risks that we need to watch, particularly in terms of tariffs and their impact on product cost.","Based on what has been enacted so far; again, this is just the first round of tariffs. The near-term impact to UTC appears to be relatively modest. We will see about $0.05 a share. The net $0.05 is included in our revised EPS guidance. As always, we're going to stay focused on what we can control and we\u2019re feeling very good about the way the year is shaping up.","With that, let me stop and turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you through the results, and I\u2019ll come back with a little wrap-up in the Q&A. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thanks Greg. I\u2019m on Slide 2. Reported sales for the quarter was $16.7 billion, up 9% with 6% organic growth and two points of favorable foreign exchange. The remaining one point of sales growth was driven by the adoption of the new revenue standard with the largest benefit at Pratt & Whitney. You can see the details in the appendix on Slide 19.","Adjusted EPS was $1.97, up $0.12 or 6% versus prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.56 or up 42% versus prior year. This, of course, included a $0.74 gain on the sale of the Taylor Company in the quarter. Partially offsetting this gain was $0.07 of restructuring, $0.05 of a non-cash asset value adjustment, and $0.02 of charges related to the Rockwell Collins transaction.","Free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and there is no change to our full-year outlook of $4.5 billion to $5 billion. Just as a point of note, we will be absorbing over $200 million of headwind in the 2018 free cash flow from the tax payment associated with the gain on the sale of the Taylor Company.","As you probably know, cash from the divestiture is reflected as an inflow from investing activities, but the cash taxes we pay on the gain flow through the operating cash. Also the gain on the transaction increases our reported net income. So for those of you who are looking at the free cash flow to net income conversion, this transaction will mathematically put some pressure on that metric.","Slide 3 shows components of our organic growth this quarter. Overall, we continue to see strong fundamentals across our two end markets. Looking at our commercial businesses, in the Americas sales were up 6% with growth across both Otis and CCS. End market activity levels remain robust as new construction continues at high levels and consumer sentiment remains strong.","Within EMEA sales were up 3%. In Europe, sales were up mid-single digits with strength again at both Otis and CCS. At Otis, we continue to see stabilization in maintenance revenue per unit, but did see some pressure on the input costs due to the increasingly tight labor market across the region.","Middle East remains a watch item. In Asia, sales were down 1% with Otis China down 6%. The good news is that in Otis China, we once again saw slightly positive price mix in the second quarter orders. The rest of Asia was up mid-single digits at Otis and down 7% at CCS. On the aerospace side, commercial aerospace sales were up 11% organically in the quarter, driven by strong GTF shipments as well as ramping up of next generation products at Aerospace Systems.","And on the aftermarket side, we see continued high traffic demand and strong utilization of in-service products, which translated to 11% organic growth in the quarter. Military sales were up 10% at Pratt & Whitney and up 5% at Aerospace Systems organically, driven by continued strong aftermarket demand and ramping production programs.","Lastly, just a few comments on our 2018 outlook before I hand it over to Carroll. Within our improved outlook, you will see a few moving pieces. At the operating levels, strength at Aerospace Systems offset the reduced outlook at Otis versus our prior expectations. The change in outlook at CCS primarily reflects the removal of the profitable Taylor business from the second half and is offset by favorable items below the segment operating profit line.","Additionally, we now expect the adjusted tax rate in 2018 to be 24.5% compared with the prior 25.5%. And this is based on certain recent clarifications to the U.S. tax reform and higher than expected benefit from stock compensation related taxes.","At the midpoint of our improved adjusted EPS range, we still have approximately $70 million of contingency. As Greg said we expect Rockwell Collins to close in the third quarter this will likely result in $0.10 to $0.15 dilution in 2018 to get adjusted EPS. Bottom line we feel really good about our improved EPS range of $7.10 to $7.25, excluding the dilution from depending acquisition of Rockwell Collins.","With that, let me turn it over to Carroll to take us through business unit details.","Carroll Lane","Okay. Thanks Akhil. I\u2019m on Slide 4. I\u2019ll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do, and with the exception of organic data points, all results include the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.","And as a reminder, there\u2019s an appendix on Slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. Otis sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter were up 3% organically. On a constant currency basis new equipment sales grew 2%. High-teens growth in Europe and high single-digit growth in Asia excluding China were partially offset by a 10% decline in China. Where 2017 backlog with it\u2019s embedded price headwinds continued to convert into sales.","New equipment orders were up 10% organically in the quarter with growth in all regions. In China, unit orders grew 2% with their corresponding value growing 8%. That's the first quarter since 2014 and which order growth in dollars has outpaced the growth in units.","Service sales were up 4% in the quarter. I\u2019d saw strong growth in modernization and mid single-digit growth in maintenance, while repair was down slightly in the quarter after being up 13% in Q2 2017.","Otis operating profit declined 11%, pricing pressure and adverse mix in new equipment largely from the backlog in China coupled with higher input costs more than offset contribution from higher volume.","Additionally, one-time legal charges and adverse transactional mark-to-market currency adjustments accounted for approximately $30 million of headwind. As we discussed in Q1 transactional currency adjustments can fluctuate through the year. Foreign exchange translation it was a four point tailwind to sales and earnings.","For the full-year we now expect Otis operating profit in the range of down $25 million to up $25 million and actual currency. This largely reflects the one-time charges in Q2, the outlook for higher input costs we discussed last quarter and our updated view on foreign exchange which is less likely to provide a favorable offset to these increased costs. The full-year outlook for organic sales at Otis continues to be low single-digit growth.","Turning to Slide 5, climate controls and security sales are up 4% organically. Transport refrigeration sales were up 11% driven by strong container sales up 45%. Residential HVAC was up 5% in spite of trucking shortages that impacted June shipments.","Global commercial HVAC grew 3% in the quarter and fire and security sales were up slightly. In the first half total CCS sales were up 5% organically. Equipment orders at CCS were strong again in Q2 up 8% and that follows 11% growth in Q2 of 2017. Transport refrigeration orders grew 27% on top of 38% growth last year. Residential HVAC orders were up high single-digits and global commercial HVAC orders grew 6%.","At actual currency CCS operating profit grew 2% in the quarter as the benefits of higher volumes improved pricing in North America and foreign currency translation were mostly offset by higher commodity and logistics costs and continued investment in new products.","Looking ahead we can expect continued volume growth in the second half of the year and pricing initiatives are expected to more than mitigate rising input costs. For the full-year we know expect CCS operating profit to grow by $75 million to $125 million at actual FX.","The revision from the prior outlook of $125 million to 175 million in growth reflects the completion of the divestiture of the Taylor business as announced in June and our current view that foreign exchange is less likely to offset higher input costs.","Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 6, sales of $4.7 billion were up 12% organically. Including the previously discussed impact of the new revenue recognition standard reported sales were up 16%. Commercial OEM sales were up 20% driven by 48% growth in large commercial engines. Total Geared Turbofans shipments including those to the spare engine pool more than doubled from Q1 2018 and more than tripled from Q2 2017.","Pratt & Whitney is on track to meet its full-year GTF customer delivery commitments. Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments were up modestly, that marks the second quarter in a row growth. Pratt Canada OEM sales were down 3% due to mix. Military OEM sales were up 42% driven by F135 and tanker.","Commercial aftermarket sales were up 12% as the large engine aftermarket continues to benefit from strength in V2500 and higher content on PW4000 models. Military aftermarket was up 3% on a tough compare and grew 9% sequentially that was driven by F135 an F119 programs.","Operating profit of $400 million was up 8%. Headwind from higher negative engine margin was more than offset by drop through from higher commercial aftermarket and military sales.","Based on first half results and in anticipation of negative engine margin increasing with GTF deliveries in the second half of the year, we continue to expect credit we need to grow operating profit $25 million to $75 million.","Turn to Slide 7; Aerospace Systems delivered another strong quarter with 17% profit growth on 8% higher organic sales. Sales growth was driven by the commercial aftermarket, which was up 12%.","Parts and repair were up 4% and 12% respectively and provisioning grew by 20%. Provisioning included 15 points of growth related to the Pratt & Whitney spare engine pool and these intercompany sales are expected to be a headwind for Aerospace Systems in the back half of this year given the significant shipments made to the Pratt spare pool in the second half of 2017. While compares will be tougher in the back half, leading indicators remain positive and we now expect full-year commercial aftermarket sales to be up mid to high single-digits.","Commercial OEM sale grew 8% driven by new production programs, primarily the A320neo is partially offset by declines in legacy programs. Military sales were up 5% driven by continued F-35 volume growth and strong spares.","Operating profit growth of 17% was driven by drop through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, lower E&D and continued product cost reduction. These benefits were partially offset by OEM mix headwind, higher SG&A spend and adverse foreign exchange impact.","Based on first half results, we now expect full-year sales to be up low to mid single-digits versus our prior outlook of low single-digit growth and it's driven by strength in commercial aftermarket.","Projected drop through from these sales, allows us to raise the full-year outlook for operating profit growth to $175 million to $225 million and likely towards the high end of the range. That's up from our prior expectation of $150 million to $200 million.","With that, I'll hand it back over to Greg.","Gregory Hayes","Okay, thanks Carroll. So it's a lot of moving pieces in the quarter as is typical. But I think this is a really key thing to highlight and I would start out with the organic growth that we saw at 6% and I think maybe most importantly each of the businesses saw growth in orders. You take a look at the 12% aftermarket growth on the Aerospace side. New equipment orders up 10% at Otis. The end markets are delivering and we're very, very confident about the \u2013 not just 2018 and as we move into the future.","I think the one point again worth repeating from what Carroll said, if you think about the GTF and the ramp and all the issues that we've had, I would tell you that the Pratt team has done a tremendous job and if you look at the deliveries in the second quarter, doubling what we did in the first quarter and tripling what we did just a year-ago, phenomenal, phenomenal results for the year, for the Pratt team. And again keeping pace with what is a growing aerospace market across the world, so again very, very confident about the future of the portfolio in UTC.","Regarding the question of the portfolio, I know it's on everybody's mind everywhere. Let me just say that there's nothing more to report today. We continue to do the work with our Board of Directors that we continue to believe that we will have a decision here in the fourth quarter that we share with everybody. But nothing new to report out of the fact that we continue to do the analysis and continue to work through that process.","So with that, happy to answer whatever other questions you have. So let's open up the call for questions if we could.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to Otis and understand that there's a legal charge weighing on the second quarter profits, but one of your competitors last week was talking about a prolonged headwind from price cost into next year. Obviously, looking at your medium term, guide implies decent profit recovery in Otis. So I just wondered how you were assessing the likelihood of that today and if the business is really progressing as you thought or every quarter we get sort of an extra headwind or two?","Akhil Johri","Great question, Julian. So I think let\u2019s \u2013 the 230 basis points margin drop at Otis is the startling number and everybody is probably focused on that. Let me just break it down for you quickly. As you said, about 90 basis points of the 230 essentially is the $30 million that Carroll talked about, which are one-time exceptional charges. We didn\u2019t pull them out of the segment as is our normal practice since they were not large enough, but they're all one-time type of things and doesn't happen very often. So hopefully that's just behind us.","The second item is that price cost, price mix issue that you talked about and that's largely driven by the backlog in China. That was another 90 basis points in the quarter. So if you take that \u2013 the trend there that is encouraging is for three quarters in a row now, we have seen price mix being positive, slightly positive in the China orders, so as we run through the backlog of 2017 badness, when I look at 2019, hopefully that number starts to become a little bit better as opposed to continuing headwind that we have.","The final piece is obviously the increase in inflation and increase in the cost that we have seen. Some of it in the case of Otis, it\u2019s a little more difficult to pass on as price increase is right away because there is a backlog that is there. You've got to take the cost increase and adjust it against the backlog margins unfortunately, but that again -- the intent on the Otis team is to try and increase prices going forward, so that we can offset some of these input cost inflations.","Gregory Hayes","Julian, let me just pile in there. So I think this whole issue of input costs is a recurring theme that we\u2019ll be talking about as it relates to the commercial businesses, and the input costs are related to a couple of things. Obviously, commodities we see a little bit of headwind, although not that much this year, but steel is up 25% in the last year. Aluminum is up and copper is up about 14%, 15%, so input costs are up. And the other place our costs are up is our labor cost, and there really is a labor shortage here in the U.S. and in Europe, and as a result of that, we're seeing some cost pressure that we need to deal with.","I\u2019m not going to just say we're going to surrender and the margins are where they are going to be. We're obviously taking actions to reduce costs, to look for ways to resource products, but input cost inflation is a real issue that I think is something new for us. And again, tariffs don't help, again another $50 million of cost input on top of what's happening with the basic commodities and labor costs. But the future of Otis is about selling new equipment.","And I think if you look at the quarter where you saw 10% growth in new equipment at Otis, that's solid, right, and that will deliver in the long-term, and it takes a couple of years to play out obviously before we install all those elevators and start servicing them. But it is that growth in new equipment that people should be focused on as it relates to Otis and growth in the service portfolio.","And again, as I highlighted before, the service initiatives, what we can do from a productivity standpoint will also help drive Otis profit growth over the long-term. So, look the headwinds that we have are the same as everybody else. The way you deal with them is the same as everybody else. Obviously, we need to be more aggressive about pricing, which we will do. Easier on CCS than it is at Otis, obviously because of the short-term versus long-term nature of the contracts, but the folks are on top of it.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Gregory Hayes","Thanks Julian.","Operator","Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ronald Epstein","Good morning. If we could just maybe dig in more into the aerospace aftermarket. I mean, the growth there was really good, right, I mean, above global air traffic, maybe 2x global air traffic. What's underlying that? Is it one of your smaller competitors mentioned that they're seeing the pool of serviceable used spare parts really kind of fading away and that's driving some aftermarket growth, but just in your case, I mean what's driving that aftermarket growth?","Gregory Hayes","Yes. As always, there is no one simple answer here. I think if you think about the Aerospace Systems business, where we have really seen growth beyond our expectation, it has just been on the repair side of the businesses. The repair shops have done a much better job and I think we've got about 74 repair operations around the world. They\u2019ve really focused over the last couple of years on improving churn time, improving customer responsiveness, and we're starting to see that market share gain.","So that's very positive. I think on the Pratt side, we continue to see very, very strong growth with the V2500, and that's not unusual. We are also still seeing some of the PW4000 aftermarket being a little bit stronger than what we expected. This trend line won't continue at 12%, I think you know we all recognize that, but right now as you pointed out, there has been a consumption of spares out there and spare parts airlines have to reorder; you can't continue to take things off the shelf.","And so we're benefiting a little bit from this. So our tropical probably up 5.5%, 6% again this year and I think that's kind of the long-term trend that we're looking at which is we're aftermarket should grow but clearly there's a little bit of catch up this year. But we would look pretty good about it. Carroll?","Carroll Lane","Yes, Ron. Pratt it's really continuation of what we talked about in Q1. So we've got strong content and V2500. We expect V2500 shop visits would be there's demand for more than a 1000 of those worldwide this year no change to that view. And then to 4000 well visits will be down the mix is favorable, the PW4000 112-inch powering 777 fleets. We\u2019re seeing operators recapitalize some of those engines just speaks to the demand for lift out there in the marketplace. So really just a continuation what we saw in Q1 and will take it.","Gregory Hayes","Yes. The fundamentals remain - Ron fundamentals really I mean strong I think the promise of the aerospace industry is if you get on new platforms you have good content and then aftermarket follows. And that's what we're starting to see with the V2500 engine, with the continuation in the PW4000 in the aerospace side. So I think if you're in a good spot given the OEM growths which will again translating to aftermarket for many, many decades to come.","Ronald Epstein","Okay. Great. And then maybe just to follow-on why wouldn't you expect maybe that 12% but continued growth kind of at the higher end of a range, something above global air traffic growth?","Carroll Lane","Yes, I think we should expect that and I know what's been Greg said you shouldn\u2019t expect 12% every quarter maybe high single-digit in some cases or it could be mid-to-high single-digit as we have upgraded the increased the aerospace systems guidance as you\u2019ve noticed in our outlook change. So it could be higher than traffic growth there will be three days when it could be, but over the long-term it's probably closer to approximate the traffic growth than double-digit growth forever.","Gregory Hayes","Also you keep in mind Ron print to get with it's reentry into the commercial business with the GTF. They should see outsized growth of the aftermarket in the next 10 years. And just like the V2500 kind of in that sweet spot that Carroll\u2019s talking about for repairs and demand for overall visits. Because we think about is Pratt delivers what is now what we see 10,000 orders we've had for GTF engines now. That those 10,000 orders will play out over the next 10 years of generated huge increase in aftermarket of Pratt.","Ronald Epstein","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Gregory Hayes","Thanks Ron.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning. Thanks for the time.","Gregory Hayes","How are you?","Rajeev Lalwani","Greg, if I ask you question on the strategic review. I appreciate that there isn't a whole lot to add and the process is underway. But I just wanted to clarify some comments you've made publicly already. I think previously you\u2019ve highlighted sort of looking at play in the company into three pieces. To that precluded any other sort of alternatives that\u2019s you would maybe pursue I mean I imagine there's lots of permutations in their account. Taking a look at what you did with Taylor, I think I was well received. I can't you do more or value more than just a simple break up or staying together that make sense?","Gregory Hayes","Yes. Rajeev, let me just say there's nothing simple about a breakup. But as you think about what's going to create the most value for shareowners long-term I think all options around the table with the board. And that's I think the key message if you want to take one away here is that it's not just about splitting the company up three ways.","More evaluate other potential options that could create value be it acquisitions or be it divestitures as part of this strategic portfolio review. So again like we did was Sikorsky initially was going to be a spin we ended up finding a great perform for Sikorsky in Lockheed Martin. We will look for ways to maximize value long-term whether that's together as the entire UTC portfolio or apart I think all options around the table. Clearly there are alternatives that maybe attractive in the long-term and we\u2019re going to continue to pursue those.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good day everyone. Hey, just on Collins. The fact that you're giving us a sense of the delusion here today, a) does reflect your confidence, I guess in closing. But b) will also seem to suggest you do have a little bit of certainty now on just some of the accounting machinations of conforming accounting and what the amortization may look like and such? If that's the case, could you give us your early thought on what the accretion dilution picture looks like for 2019 based on Q3 2018\u2026?","Gregory Hayes","Yes, Jeff, really that's a nice soliloquy that will lead into guidance on 2019, but we\u2019re not going to do that.","Akhil Johri","Hey, no the reality Jeff is that we are still working through the intangible amortization calculation we have now. Again I have not seen the data because we cannot see it legally. But we have an accounting firm, which has got the data on Collins and is evaluating the cash flow streams of the future, which as is the basis of determining the intangibles amortization. So that work is going on.","I think the preliminary estimates are that we are probably not too far off from the number that you've seen in the X4 on that. But there is still lot more work to be done. I think next couple of weeks is probably what is needed to get to a formal answer, obviously as you know, assuming we closed in third quarter.","We will have to book something in the quarter with regard to those intangibles and until we had working very hard to make sure we get a number, which we don't have to change or update in the future.","So that work is still going on, which is why you see the range we do. We do feel we are in the closing stages of the approvals and therefore feel a lot more confident about being able to do that this quarter, and tell you more as that transaction closes.","Gregory Hayes","Yes, I think the best thing to say is no surprises here. As we look at the amortization, we had expected it to be, there's no real surprises from what we had originally estimated. So we'll talk about this in September probably in terms of what we think 2019 looks like. But obviously it's going to be accretive to earnings. We just need to work through what that number is.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just one other one, and I appreciate the compliment on the articulate soliloquy, by the way, I haven't gotten that off. Just could you give us a little bit of update in general on aero supply chain and then in particular looking at this NORDAM bankruptcy? Any anything could be concerned about here in the near-term and kind of managing your way through all that sort of thing?","Gregory Hayes","I would tell you \u2013 let's take NORDAM as a separate issue because I think that's kind of a one-off, but as far as the aero supply chain goes. I think we've got pretty good visibility. In fact, we\u2019ve got very good visibility into the supply chain for all of the key components on the GTF engines and we're working through that same process on the Aerospace Systems side.","So I don't see any big bottlenecks other than the continuing challenge that we have with the ramp. It\u2019s always going to be castings and forgings and things like that that are difficult to do. But again, no shortage per se that would say that we can't meet the contractual commitments that we have.","I think I said this earlier; it was just last week in Farnborough, we continue to work with airbus and continue to work with the supply chain to see if we can ramp up even more quickly. But that will take additional capital and additional time, but we will work through them. So today I don't see an issue. I think if there's another big ramp up in production beyond what we see today. It will be a challenge, but we will work through that as the year progresses.","As it relates to NORDAM, NORDAM for those of you that are familiar with is a small supplier out of Tulsa that is in the sells primarily. They are to kind of the contract with us back in 2010 to do the nacelle for the Pratt & Whitney 815, which is the engine that goes on the new Gulfstream aircraft.","We've had some challenges. They've had some challenges in terms of getting their products certified and the cost has been a challenge for them as well. Unfortunately, they had to enter bankruptcy proceedings this week. We're continuing to work closely with the bankruptcy court with the lenders and with the folks at NORDAM, to try and find a solution here.","And I think there will ultimately be a solution that ensures continued production of the nacelles as well as a good resolution, I would say for all the parties involved here. So it's not great. Anytime you see one of your key suppliers going to bankruptcy, but it didn't come as a surprise. We\u2019ve been working with them very closely for the last six months, and I think it will be a pretty \u2013 not easily managed, but at least a good outcome here in the not too distant future.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks for the color.","Gregory Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland","Good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory Hayes","Hi Carter.","Carter Copeland","Hey, just a quick question on CCS. I mean, I know for the remainder of the year, Akhil you highlighted that the Taylor impact, but when you just look at the order flow you had in Q1, and you guys had talked about having some pricing tailwinds that you expected to come through. When you look at the conversion of orders into sales and maybe the potential pricing tailwind just didn't seem to come through in Q2. I wondered if there was something in there that we were missing or it\u2019s just takes time for that to get in? Any color would be helpful.","Akhil Johri","Sure, Carter. So I think the good news in Q2 was that the price cost, and I talked about price cost, it's commodities cost versus the price increases that we have. It was slightly positive in Q2. As you recall in Q1, it was still slightly negative. We have had additional price increases go into effect in early July, which are in the market now and seem to be having traction. So we feel good about our ability at CCS to continue to see improvement in the price cost dynamic as we go forward. So that certainly encouraging thing. The other encouraging part is the strength in the orders that they have had, but those orders are certainly going to translate.","I mean if you look at the residential business in North America by itself, both in Q1 and Q2 the orders that we booked were greater than the shipments that we made in those quarters. So backlog is pretty healthy coming into the third quarter. We feel again good about the ability of CCS to convert that. And as the price cost mix continues to \u2013 price cost equation continues to improve; we should see better conversion later in this year.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick clarification on the comment you made around provisioning. Can you guys quantify what sort of pressure you expect in the back half on the inter segment sales on UTAS?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So I think the back end, you probably see if you go back to look at the numbers for last year, very strong aftermarket at UTAS and some of that had to do with the data \u2013 the engine build units that UTAS provides to Pratt and that goes into the lease pool engines. In the second half, you\u2019ll probably see reductions to the tune of about $10 million to $80 million across the two quarters, so somewhere between $50 million to $100 million in the second half versus what they saw last year. So that still is all factored into our thinking when we said that UTAS will grow aftermarket by mid-to-high single-digit. So that's all been factored into in our thinking about the guidance.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just going back to Otis, can you talk a little bit about the service portfolio in particular and just price increases. Is that a matter of time where pricing should start to improve? Or is it something structural within the industry itself? And if you could just comment on maybe what you saw on a regional basis for pricing within the service portfolio? Thank you.","Akhil Johri","Sure. So the good news on the service side at Otis is, I kind of look at it in two ways. One is, is the portfolio growing by itself, and I think that the good news is the portfolio at Otis did grow in terms of the number of units under maintenance in the second quarter compared to the first quarter or compared to last year, so that's a positive sign. The biggest element from a regional perspective, Sheila as you know is Europe.","And after several years of decline in the revenue per unit line item which drives \u2013 which is an indicator \u2013 indication of the pricing, we have seen now in the first half revenue per unit stabilized for maintenance portfolio in Europe. So it's been flattish, which is again a good sign.","As you know, we are working on all these service transformation initiatives. So right now because of the investments we're making, we have this dynamic of costs, not cost growing, not being fully offset by productivity. But as these initiatives take traction and the new tools become prevalent all across the world you will see productivity gains starting to offset some of the cost inflation that if they're in that line.","So looking forward still a lot more positive about the trends that are there. Other places North America service still doing well and in China we continue to make progress with regard to growth in the service business as a percentage of the total.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great. Thank you for the color. And then just one more if you don't mind on Pratt. Military continue to be very strong. How long do you think at growth is sustainable?","Akhil Johri","Pratt is going to see \u2013 to be Joint Strike Fighter is continuing to grow as you know right. The number of engines, the number of aircraft required will continue to grow are the engines that we are supplying and all the components that you have to supplying to them also continue to grow as a Joint Strike Fighter is the big driver of the growth in Military Engine business.","We also have great strength in the aftermarket side of the business as these assets continue to fly a lot. So I think overall we do expect to see our guidance for this year is 20% OE growth in military engine side and that we feel very good about our ability to hit that aftermarket growth is expected to be around 10% for the year and that also feels very doable. So it's a pretty good story and think there is several years of legs on that.","Gregory Hayes","Yes. Sheila, if you think about the fleets, I mean F100 fleet still massive out there flying a lot hours, F119 fleet generally a lot flying hours, and the F135 you know not just delivering and which are also equipping the fleets worldwide to sustain themselves. You start to see the aftermarket in that program as well as we progress out here in the next few years.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Samuel Pearlstein","Good morning. And I know you just it\u2019s a long question. Quick just the first one I just in NORDAM, is there any sort of impact receivables we just quick question. But then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about just the Rockwell Collins dilution and help us just understand what\u2019s in and what's out and I'm thinking about the cost to extract the synergies versus the synergy savings kind of a one-time closing cost around a transaction. Just trying to see what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out of that in terms of the adjusted earnings?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So our NORDAM there is no receivables impact, there are a supplier to us. So there is no impact from that side. There is obviously going to be some impact on the cost side which we'll talk about that things progress there and as we have a better understanding of the solution to that outcome. On the Rockwell Collins number as we've already said I think the number that we talk about on adjusted EPS is consistent with our definition of just adjusted EPS which means we exclude any restructuring costs.","We exclude any one-time step up inventory amortization or any integration costs for the first six months to a year if you will which are exceptional in nature. But going forward any intangibles amortization of a normal recurring nature on customer relationships, trade name, et cetera that will be part of the adjusted EPS. For the reference to those who care we will provide an extra data point which is on the cash accretion if you will.","We will provide that you can see on a cash basis clearly the transaction is going to be greatly accretive and our commitment was that even with taking into account our large significant intangibles amortization and the transaction will be accretive in 2019 and we still believe that will be the case.","Samuel Pearlstein","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Arment with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter Arment","Thanks. Good morning, Greg, Akhil. Akhil just you mentioned I believe that the China pricing in backlog at Otis that lingers into 2019? Can you clarify if that goes throughout 2019 and should be thinking about that? And then just Greg, just related to this you mentioned $0.05 of risk from tariffs. Maybe you could just walk us through how you're thinking about that just in general? Thanks.","Akhil Johri","Sure. So the price mix point I was making is that Otis is starting to see improvement in that Peter. So lot three quarters now, price mix has been slightly positive in Otis China orders and as you know it takes about 9 months to 12 months for the orders to convert into sales.","So what you are seeing in our P&L this year is in effect the margin that was booked in the backlog in 2017 which had pretty high negative price mix. So as we get into 2019 we should start to see an improvement in that metric, not lingering impacts. There will be some impact of that, but not, not by a large amount. So I expect that to see \u2013 to get a little bit better.","With regard to the tariffs, roughly $50 million or $0.05 as Greg mentioned that included in our outlook about half of that is at CCS. Another $10 million or so would be at Otis and then the rest is between the aerospace companies. And that's got to do with the \u2013 not just the stool of the steel and aluminum, it is also the List one of the tariffs that came from the $50 billion list that\u2026","Gregory Hayes","[During that recession 301].","Akhil Johri","Yes.","Gregory Hayes","I think one thing to keep in mind is, as is our normal practice. We will walk in those steel and aluminum. Most of the commodities are for six to nine months. So we're actually not seen falling back in 2018 of what the steel and aluminum tariffs are and is anybody's guess along those thing in place?","I think if you think about next year, obviously you could see a much bigger impact from all of these tariffs. Right now, we're rolling half a year impact on the 301, but full-year impact there plus potentially there is some higher steel and aluminum tariffs is as well as \u2013 is copper input cost higher.","So we've got a lot of work to do to try and offset that. And I think the key will be our ability to continue to push price in the marketplace as these input costs go up. Of course that\u2019s going to lead to a little bit of inflation and hopefully not so much of this going to curtail demand. But we are always mindful of that tradeoff. So again it's \u2013 these tariffs are helpful to anybody. But we're going to have to deal with them.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the call. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Winoker with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Gregory Hayes","Hi, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Hey, could you just maybe give us a little more color on that strong working capital number in the quarter as a sort of liquidation of deliveries despite ramps on the GTF or what are some of the dynamics back and forth there? And can we expect that to continue?","Akhil Johri","Well, some of it was the bad Q1 we had, Steve, right? I mean, you saw that shortfall in our cash in our cash in Q1 and as a result, there were significantly higher receivables that came into Q2, which we were able to collect upon and that's helped the working capital number.","The area which we still have worked to do, which is the long-term opportunity for our cash flow metric is inventory. We've seen continued growth in inventory to support the ramp that is there. The supply chain stability that would come in that area over the next few years as production rates start to stabilize as supply chain gets more stable. I think all that is the upside that is still ahead of UTC with regard to the cash flow metric and the working capital turns.","As I\u2019ve said before, I think our aerospace businesses had seen inventory turns decline over the last several years. This year I expect that turns to start to improve and then cash flow benefit starts to come in, in the forthcoming years, but a lot of opportunity ahead of us.","Steven Winoker","Okay, so that you expect it to basically normalize stabilize in the back half of the year?","Akhil Johri","Back half and going forward. I think the supply chain stability will probably take you longer than just next six months Steve. These are not easy things to do. By the time we are able to get some of the safety stock reductions in our inventories. It will probably be a few more years. But I think the good news is that it's a multiyear, good news self-help story that is ahead of us that we can take advantage of.","Steven Winoker","Okay, and Akhil, just a point of clarification, the $70 million of contingency that you mentioned that\u2019s at the midpoint of guidance?","Akhil Johri","Yes, it is. In the updated guidance, which is at $7.18, effectively $70 million.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. Thank you.","Akhil Johri","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Stephen Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just on CC&S, can you maybe just more specifically update us on that profit bridge? And what kind of the moving pieces are now with the reduction in the guide that you gave earlier in the year on March?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So if you look at that specific profit bridge in the other line, there was a negative $50 million. That is where we\u2019ve got Taylor divestiture impact. So in an updated bridge that number would be closer to about somewhere between 75 to 100 let's say, maybe closer to 100, as Taylor comes out of the second half and it was a profitable business. In the other pieces I would say we had $50 million of good news between price cost that number looks more like 25 positive now we still believe it's 25 for the first half. We're pretty much neutral.","All that goodness is going to come in the second half and we have price increases in there. The offsets to those sort of negatives are on the higher volume. So organic growth has been doing reasonably well. So to the extent that there is any offset needed to those specific numbers it will come through the volume line. So overall we feel very good. The FX number is now it was looking stronger, Steve, at the first quarter but it's probably back to the 25 million bridge that we stated in the guidance.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. And then just on to follow-up on Steve's question on free cash flow. So can your actual cash generation at Pratt be up next year in 2019?","Akhil Johri","I would certainly hope so. Pratt should continue to grow cash going forward; the other element is CapEx Steve where we have been spending a lot of money in standing up the production facilities to support the ramp. The OE side of the ramp related CapEx is going to be pretty much behind us or become de minimis, but there is still aftermarket ramp related capital expenditure which is still ahead of us at Pratt and to some extent at UTAS. But those numbers are probably going to start I think after 2019, we would start to see CapEx at Pratt and UTAS start to decline a little bit and that should help overall cash flow for both those businesses as well as UTC overall.","Stephen Tusa","And are they up this year and it Pratt?","Akhil Johri","Yes. Pratt the CapEx is flat to slightly up this year. Overall for UTC as you know we've talked about CapEx being flattish and that's probably affected across the businesses.","Stephen Tusa","But the cash \u2013 free cash flow is what I meant at Pratt?","Akhil Johri","Yes, free cash flow for Pratt is slightly down this year compared to last year at this point.","Stephen Tusa","That\u2019s make sense. Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate details always.","Akhil Johri","Take care, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Gregory Hayes","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Just wanted to pick up on the Otis China pricing commentary, the backlog kind of conversion 9 months to 12 months. That implies \u2013 how we now seen peak pressure from the pricing in the first half of the year and therefore we start seeing a moderation of that pinch? And then maybe just out to Europe, what do you seen in European sales pricing?","Akhil Johri","So the price mix in China should I think your assertion is right Nigel. We should probably start to see a pinch improvement and pinch is probably the right word improvement in the second half in the price mix going to the backlog. The backlog still has some negative pricing in there. With regard to Europe service revenue per unit is starting to stabilize.","As I said earlier I think first half of this year is the first time in many years that Otis businesses have seen revenue per unit for maintenance contracts in Europe is flat to slightly positive. And we do expect to see that don't you know again it's not broad based at this time Nigel.","So within Europe there are different countries you would see pressures continuing still in cases like France and Spain where we have a pretty high installed base. But there are also on the other hand improvements in other markets within Europe. So it's a mixed story there, but overall at least for the first time in many years we're seeing flattish revenue per unit year-over-year.","Nigel Coe","Great. And then just quickly on the 301s. I think you said the $50 million is solely List 1. Have you done any work in terms of trying to quantify List 2 and List 3 impact?","Akhil Johri","No. There is still more look to be done there Nigel, I think it is not till those things get firmed up and we know exactly what I mean the good thing is it's not a finished product issue because we generally make product for the local market. So most of the China production in China it's for that market. We don't export too much out of it to us specifically, but there are components that are drives, there are motors, there are all kinds of small components that we do buy which get probably get impacted by these tariffs.","So the ultimate solution as Greg said is unfortunately going to result in higher inflation there be and others will attempt to pass all of that to the consumers. So over the long-term, you and I pay for this stuff, but that's the way business works.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great color. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Douglas Harned","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to \u2013 if you give us a little more of an update on the GTF, I mean you've had some very good delivery ramp so far this year now. How are you looking at the rest of the year in terms of the number of deliveries, the kind of cadence and really when do you see production proceeding in a way that it's more stable that we're not dealing with the kinds of backend loading that we had last year?","Gregory Hayes","So if you think about the total production of GTF, this year will be a little bit more than double what we saw last year. Obviously the cadence of deliveries in the second quarter was making up for a little bit of the first quarter issues that we had with the seal.","But having said that, we're back on track and we're meeting with all of the delivery milestones. The engine itself \u2013 and I'll speak to the neo specifically. It\u2019s got about 800,000 hours on it right now. So we're approaching that point where we always say about a million hours most of the [indiscernible] problems have at least been identified. So I will clearly get there before year-end.","I think the good news is, in the last year, we've had over 2,000 orders for the GTF. And as you think about all the issues that everybody has been concerned about, the fact is this motor really works in a really delivers on the fuel burn, on the emissions, and on the noise signature.","So the airlines are confident. We've got the hours. We continue to build hours every single day. We're still dealing with some of the issues you recall. We had the combustor issue on the \u2013 some of the early units that we continue to see those come off wing above on schedule.","So it\u2019s creates a bit of a challenge for some of the operators. But for the most part, there's enough spares now out there to deal with that. And I think everybody is pretty happy with the performance. I think on time or I think we're 99.89% on time right now in terms of availability of the engine.","So again, we're not causing delays at the operators and people are generally very, very happy with this. And I think you'd say the same thing at Bombardier, now I guess Airbus with the A220. That engine continues to perform very well and we're just starting to see some early introductions of the E2.","So again all very, very positive and I think it really attribute to the Pratt production team and the engineering team for getting some of these issues dealt with very, very quickly and effectively.","Douglas Harned","So is it fair to say that since you resolve the seal problem earlier and you continuing to make progress on the combustor? Do you see any other issues that are out there that appear to be any significant hurdle to getting this ramp continuing to go up?","Gregory Hayes","Well, I don't see any issue today. But like I said, we're still \u2013 we haven't hit that million hour market. Keep in mind, with these engines even on the V2500, which has been out there for 25 years and delivered over 7,000. We continue to find ways to improve the performance and improve durability.","And we will continue to find ways to do that on the GTF. As you know, we still have a long way to go on the cost reduction curve and GTFs will be introducing some cost reduced components. But as we do that we will also be looking to improve the durability with components that we're putting on wing.","So this is \u2013 you never done in the engine business, right. This is a constant evolution of the engine to try to getting the best possible configurations you can. And we're continuing to work that, but today I don't see there is no showstopper out there. There is no new drama that I'm aware of today that would cause us any concerns.","Douglas Harned","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Hayes, for any further remarks.","Gregory Hayes","Okay. I just want to thank everyone for listening in today. A really solid quarter again, and I think more importantly, a really solid outlook for 2018 and beyond. As always, Carroll and team are available to take your calls and look forward to seeing you all in the coming weeks and months. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"21015":["United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) Q2 2013 Earnings Call July 23, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Gregory Hayes - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President","Jay Malave - Director, Investor Relations","Analysts","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Ron Epstein - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Operator","Good morning and welcome to the United Technologies\u2019 second quarter conference call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jay Malave, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.","Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone an opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue and we will answer as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory Hayes","Okay, thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC reported second quarter earnings per share of $1.70, that's up 5% versus 2012 with better than expected segment operating profit growth and higher net gains. Second half profit grew by 15% led by strong performance at Climate Controls and Security, and also with the benefit of the Goodrich and IAE acquisitions.","Gains in the quarter receded restructuring by $0.05 as compared to $0.04 last year and taxes were a $0.13 headwind to earnings growth. You recall that last year we had about 23% effective tax rate in the second quarter as compared to about 28% this quarter. So the solid first half of the year, given an uneven economic environment.","We have accelerated restructuring, positioned the business now for further growth. Additional restructuring savings, combined with good orders momentum and easier compares in the back half, give us confidence to increase the bottom end of the EPS guidance range, so you saw the press release. We now expect earnings per share of $6 to $6.15. That's growth of 12% to 15%, an increase with our prior guidance of $5.85 to $6.15.","We continue to expect double-digit earnings growth despite these uneven end markets. In the U.S., the potential fed tightening caused some volatility in the markets, but we still believe the economy is recovering and we are seeing strengthen in the leading sectors. Auto sales were up 8% in the first half and are growing at the fastest rate in five years. Housing starts are 24% higher year-to-date. And, in commercial construction, the Architectural Billing Index has shown expansion in eight of the last nine months, so good progress in the US.","Europe, of course, a little different store with unemployment now over 12% in the PMI or Purchasing Managers Index consistently below 50, and we didn't plan for much growth in 2013, but the fact of the matter is, we are actually still seeing a slight contraction in sales in Europe. Year-to-date sales are down about 3% across our commercial businesses.","On the other hand, we do see continued strength in China, and we are all cautiously watching the economic indicators coming out of China. We talked about some falling imports, exports, tightening of credit markets, lower GDP forecasts, so whether it's 7% or 7.5%, GDP growth, is still one of the fastest-growing markets. Because fixed investments has continued to grow and that's driving very strong order growth at both Otis and CCS.","Aerospace, we continue to see strong growth in the commercial aviation industry. RPM's up 5.6% in the month of May, airlines are now projected to earn over $12.7 billion for the year. While we continue to see pressure in the military, and particularly at Sikorsky, the overall aerospace industry remains very healthy.","Okay. Let's talk about orders for a second. We are on slide two for those of you following along on the webcast. I talked about economic uncertainty remains, but as you can see on slide two, overall our orders positioned us well for growth in the second half of the year. Just as a reminder, we talk orders at constant currency as we normally do.","Otis as we mentioned very strong quarter, 22% growth in new equipment orders. That was led by China with 35% growth. That's 32% growth in China year-to-date for Otis, so very strong recovery.","Climate Controls and Security global equipment orders grew for the third straight quarter. This reflects the strength in the U.S. economy where residential HVAC orders were up 19%, but partially offset by Europe, which was down about 4% across the CCS businesses.","Turning to Aerospace, a very encouraging sign of Pratt & Whitney, after five quarters of contraction, legacy Pratt & Whitney large commercial spare orders grew 15%, organically. And importantly, this included growth across all three major engine families PW2000, PW4000 and the V2500.","Aerospace Systems, we saw growth for the second straight quarter with orders up 4% on a pro forma basis. We're still looking for more recovery in the back half, but it's good to see growth of both Pratt and UTAS on the commercial spares side.","So, in summary, despite the uneven end markets strength in the U.S. emerging markets in commercial aerospace are going to offset the softness that we are seeing in Europe and defense. Our orders momentum still points towards recovery in the back half, but as I said in June, with year-to-date. organic sales down slightly we are now probably going to see organic revenue growth of about 3% for the full year, which is at the low end of our prior range, so total sales are now expected to be just around $64 billion for the year.","Turning back to Q2 results and on slide three, total sales and segment profit increased 16% and 15%, respectively. That's driven of course by Goodrich and IAE acquisitions and the strong operating performance of CCS.","Organically, sales were flat versus prior year following a 2% decline in the first quarter. CCS had another strong quarter, 7% operating profit growth and margin expanded to 120 basis points as they continue to realize savings from the integration of carrier in FNS and capitalize on their operating leverage.","Overall, segment operating margins at UTC declined 20 basis points with the strength at CCS more offset by headwind from pension and the decline in the military business at Sikorsky.","Goodrich and IAE acquisitions continue to exceed our expectations and contributed $0.20 of earnings in the quarter. As I mentioned, earnings per share of $1.70 include $0.05 gains in excess of restructuring. $0.19 of the gains in the quarter came from the sale of the Pratt & Whitney Power Systems business and some small tax settlements. These are more than offset by $190 million we invested in restructuring, including $93 million at Pratt & Whitney as we continue to reduce the cost base there.","Foreign currency, small impact of about $0.01 in the quarter. Free cash flow, 101% of net income. We repurchased an additional $335 million of stock and we expect to buyback a similar amount here early in the third quarter.","So I will stop here for a second and let Jay take you through the segment results, looking back and talk about full year. Jay?","Jay Malave","Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page four. Otis sales improved 4% at constant currency in the quarter led by solid high-single digit growth in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. New equipment sales were up in all regions led by double-digit growth in China and Russia. Operating profit was up 1% at constant currency. Solid growth in China and other emerging markets was offset by continued weakness in developed Europe and transition costs associated with the factory transformation in North America.","New equipment order growth was strong, up 22% at constant currency with double digit growth in Americas and Asia led by a 35% improvement in China. Orders in Europe were down mid-single digit. Given continued pressure in Europe and a significantly weaker Yen, we now expect full year profit growth at Otis of $75 million to $100 million versus the prior range of $100 million to $150 million. We expect profit improvement to come in the second half based on conversion of a higher new equipment backlog, especially in China, continued savings from restructuring and completion of the factory transformations in North America.","On slide five. Climate Controls and Security increased profits to 7% in the quarter on 1% lower sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins, up 120 basis points from prior year to 16.9%. Organic sales were up 1% with mixed results across geographies. Europe was down mid-single digit amid continued economic weakness in the region, while Americas was up low single-digit, driven by 13% growth in the residential HVAC business. China was also up mid-single digit, while Asia overall was flattish, driven by a decline in Australia. Transicold was up 11%. While the organic growth in the quarter was modest, this was the first quarter of growth in over a year and we anticipate acceleration through the remainder of the year.","On profit, CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth driven by strong conversion on the higher organic sales, restructuring and productivity, including continued savings from the consolidation of carrier and fire and security and lower commodity cost. Global commercial HVAC orders were flattish with 10% growth in Asia offsetting declines in North America and Europe.","Orders for global fire and security products were up mid-single digit while the fuel businesses were down a similar amount. Transicold orders were up 5% and commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were down 5%. With solid results in the first half and anticipated organic improvement, we now expect profit growth to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million, up from $150 million to $200 million on low-single digit organic sales growth at CCS.","Turning to aerospace on slide six. At Pratt & Whitney, sales and profit increased 5% in the second quarter. Higher sales were driven by the consolidation of IAE and transfer of the AeroPower business. Organically, sales were down 6% year-over-year due to lower military engine shipments, partially offset by higher large commercial engine OEM sales. Large commercial spare sales were up 2% organically over last year's second quarter. On a pro forma basis, including consolidated IAE sales in both quarters, large commercial spare sales were up 5%. Profit growth was driven by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, restructuring savings, and lower E&D, partially offset by lower organic sales and higher pension costs. In addition, the absence of favorable one-time items in last year's second quarter offset the benefit of a commercial contract closeout this quarter","As Greg mentioned, Pratt & Whitney, large commercial spares orders were up 15% organically. Based on year-to-date sales however, we now expect large commercial spares to be flattish for the year organically from up mid-single digits.","Pratt & Whitney's proactive cost reduction and restructuring measures give us confidence in its full year profit growth outlook of $100 million to $150 million and mid-single digit sales growth.","UTC Aerospace Systems delivered another solid quarter with operating profit of $532 million and sales of $3.3 billion. On a pro forma year-over-year basis, sales were up mid-single digit with commercial OEM, up double digits and commercial aftermarket, up mid-single digit, partially offset by declines in military OEM and military aftermarket of mid-single digit and low-single digit, respectively.","Orders for commercial spares grew 4% on a pro forma year-over-year basis. Compared with the first quarter, profit was up 4% on 2% higher sales, driven by solid conversion on sales growth and continued synergies capture.","With the first half of the year complete, we now expect full year sales to be around $13.5 billion, the low end of our previous guidance range of $13.5 billion to $14 billion. We continue to expect operating profit of around $2.1 billion in spite of lower sales due to continued cost containment and better than expected synergy traction.","Turning to Sikorsky on slide eight, operating profit decreased 24% and 3% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 62 aircraft, including 47 based on military platforms and 15 commercial. Sales decrease was driven by lower military aftermarket volumes as well as unfavorable military aircraft mix, partially offset by higher commercial volumes.","The profit decline was driven by lower sales as well as headwinds from the multi-year 8 margin reset and higher pension and export compliance costs. For the full year, we continue to expect profit to be down $100 million $150 million and low single digit sales growth. We expect profit improvement in the second half and benefits of higher aircraft volumes and restructuring savings.","With that, let me turn it over to Greg to wrap up.","Gregory Hayes","Okay. Thanks, Jay. So, I am happy to report that with the completion of the Rocketdyne divestiture in June, we are now done with the major portfolio transformation. Entire organization took on a huge task over the last two years, complete two significant acquisitions, integrate new organizations, divest over $4 billion worth of businesses and paid down $7 billion of debt.","I'll tell you that team executed flawlessly. We now have a portfolio that's well-positioned for long-term growth and we've capitalized on the big the urbanization and commercial [aerospace].","Some other highlights in the quarter, we announced significant wins across our aerospace businesses at the Paris Air Show. Pratt & Whitney announced orders for over 1,000 engines and claim orders for the launch of the second-generation Embraer regional jet. Customers see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option orders now for over 4,500 engines.","UTAS Aerospace Systems business is also well positioned with the electric system, cell, wheels and brakes and other systems at Embraer. They also secured new long-term MRO contracts from several airlines and supported Airbus in the certification A400M.","Sikorsky continues to see strong international demand announcing orders for 11 S-76D search and rescue helicopters for Japan, and 6 additional S-92 for the Chinese oil and gas market.","On the commercial side, our business has continued to win key orders. Otis was awarded the largest elevator contract ever in India. We sold 670 elevators and escalators for the Hyderabad Metro. Otis also won a contract to install 255-unit at Tianjin 117, which is nearly 600 meters, will be one of the tallest buildings in China.","CCS was rewarded the contract in the quarter with China resources land to provide HVAC, fire detection system in residential and commercial buildings across China over the next two years. So, the investment in innovative products is paying off. We are delivering real value to our customers and securing keywords that will drive top line growth well into the future.","Okay. Let's take a look at rest of 2013. As I mentioned, we now see earnings of $6 to $6.15. That's the top end of our prior range and represents earnings growth of 12% to 15%. Our relentless focus on cost reduction will allow us to delivery double-digit earnings growth. We continue to invest in restructuring as well. We spent about $240 million in the first half of the year and the businesses have good payback projects in the pipeline.","With almost $435 million of one time gains realized to-date on a pretax basis, we now expect about $450 million of both gains and restructuring for the full year. That\u2019s up from our prior estimate of $350 million each. So you can expect about $100 million of restructuring in each of the next two quarters.","Strong cash flow, of course, remains the hallmark of UTC and we continue to expect free cash flow to equal or exceed net income for the year. We paid down $1.2 billion of debt in the second quarter. That\u2019s almost $1.6 billion in the first half and we have an additional $1 billion due in the fourth quarter. So we will pay down about $2.5 billion of debt this year.","We are also buying back shares. The remaining $335 million in our original share repurchase plan will be completed here early in the third quarter and we expect to do a little bit more towards the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter assuming cash flow remains strong.","So portfolio transformations behind us, we are focused on integration and execution and we are seeing a gradual recovery in our end markets. The order book supports a resumption of organic growth in the back half and we are confident in the revised EPS guidance.","So with that, Bob, let's open up the call for questions, if we can.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hello, Carter.","Operator","Mr. Copeland, if you wouldn\u2019t mind checking your mute button. Moving on to our next question in queue from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Just a couple of questions. Greg, first just on share repurchase. So you are going to blow through your placeholder really quick but it still sounds like you are kind of soft cuddling in the back of the year? Can you just give us some thought on how cash looks in the back half? Your effort to maybe repatriate some foreign cash that you talked about and why there wouldn\u2019t be room for that that repu to come up a little bit more?","Gregory Hayes","Yes. So this year was the soft peddling in the share buyback. We are going to take it up. I think the question is how much. I said we are having $200 million, $300 million, $400 million, and it will really depend upon strong cash flows in the back half of the year. As you know, CapEx is at a ramp. We spent a little over $600 million year-to-date, and we have got plans for about $1.7 billion. So there is still a call on cash in the back half of the year which is a little higher than what we expect.","We will also, as I said, are paying down about $2.5 billion of debt and you recall going into the year, we talked about only about $1 billion of debt due. So I think we have been aggressive on the debt paydown. We have got CapEx in front of us but we still have room to take share buyback up and we have still got that $1 billion placeholder out there for M&A.","Not a lot going on, but there is always the possibility something could still happen for the year. So I think we are in line to do more share buyback and clearly if the M&A doesn\u2019t happen, it gives us a little bit more room but I am just going to tell you, there is other calls on cash right now.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Right, got it. Understood. Also, could you just give us your quick take on what your pension tailwind looks like for next year? If you were to snap a line today at these interest rates?","Gregory Hayes","So obviously there is going to be tailwinds next year in the pension. There is a lot of things going on there. First of all, you have got the fact that four years ago, we decided to sell the plant so we have taken the tough actions and that gives us tailwind. We also have losses for 2008 that come off. And you have got (inaudible) about 4.6% on a discount rate versus 3.% last year.","You guys know how to do the math. That\u2019s about $28 million to $29 million (inaudible) basis points. So there is definite tailwind from pension next year. Again, it is a little early because there is other assumptions that go into the pension number for tailwind and all that but for the most part, there will be pretty good tailwind next year.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Then, finally, and I will move on, but just on China Otis, can you just give us a little more color on where you are seeing the strength? Is it broad or is it less than China? And, just what's going on kind of competitively with pricing in particular.","Gregory Hayes","Yes. So, we talked about it. Orders on a constant currency basis were up 35%. I think HVAC were 39% orders growth and sales were up about 20%. We also saw pretty good traction on the service business with sales up 25%, so good strength there. Pricing remains tough, but the margins are holding up in China, because we continue to be able to take cost out of the supply chain and leverage on the higher volumes.","As I think about specifically from a market perspective, where we are seeing the growth, residential was obviously the key. It is the biggest market for Otis elevators and it is very, very strong still despite some of the cooling measures, we've also seen the commercial office buildings start to improve. Social housing has kind of leveled off. I think, Otis would tell you today that the market is going a lot faster than what we had anticipated going into the year and I think these order rates more than support that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Good morning. Thank you. Nice numbers. A couple things, Greg, and kind of rattle through them. One on interest expense, I can never seem to get it right. You are refinancing, you are taking some charges for doing some things. Could you just give us a range of what you think you could look for interest expense for the full year?","Gregory Hayes","Howard, for the year we are in the range of about $950 million is what we would expect it should be for the year.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Okay. You took some fairly substantial actions at Pratt to lower cost. Could you talk about some of the benefits from the operating leverage that you expect in the second half of the year and going forward given the change in mix and other things?","Jay Malave","Yes. So, back half of the year Pratt's good. Obviously, the spares are not going to be as we had expected originally going in. And, we talked about kind of 5% growth or so in spares going into the year, probably more like flattish given how low the first half was, but again good orders momentum. We should clearly get some traction out of spares in the back half of the year.","We took out I think about 575 people took advantage of the voluntary early retirement program that we just offered. That will help again in the back half of the year, add some earnings growth to Pratt. We are taking some other actions around the business as well to take advantage of some of the cost reduction opportunities out there.","R&D is coming down as we had expected about at probably $75 million $500 million. I think it was down about $14 million in the second quarter, $35 million in the first, so we are half way there in terms of the R&D reduction, so a lot of good things going on at Pratt. Spares are coming back and this is a tough year at Pratt. We got this big trough, because military engines are coming down significantly. Although mill spares that had held up pretty well and you've got an increase in the commercial shipments which as you know come with a little bit of a bill.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","You changed management at Pratt commercial, kind of separated the organization into two. What are the marching orders for the two gentlemen going forward on that?","Gregory Hayes","Yes. So, (Inaudible) call, because he led that business, he is President for the last seven years. He is the guy that has been at the forefront of the GTF marketing campaign. On that side he's done a hell of a job, but it's a huge job. And, I think what we have decided to do, what Dave Hess and Alain have done is to split that up between an aftermarket focus and an OEM focus, so Dave Brantner is going to take over. He is head of the OEM side of the Commercial Engine business, President there.","Then Matthew Bromberg, who is Head of our strategy development group for the last couple of years, who is going to lead the aftermarket, and his focus is simply on making sure we have a flawless launch on the GTF and making sure that we capture the aftermarket channel going forward on all of these GTF orders that we won. So, again, I think it makes a lot of sense [Greg] is going to focus on getting engines delivered, getting cost down, winning new campaigns and Matthew is going to focus on that moving that aftermarket and continuing to drive growth in the aftermarket.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","I just have one last question. 787 has had some challenges in operation are very minor ones, but some of it comes back to working on and enhancing the reliability of the electrical system. What are you doing there and can you talk some of the improvements you've made already?","Gregory Hayes","Yes, Howard, as you know I think with any new airplane, there is always teething problems and we have had a couple of issues of the electric power system and we worked closely with Boeing during the production hiatus. I think we took the opportunity to go out there and to improve reliability of some of our power panels where we had a couple of issues. There is just constant teething problems, but again, because the 787 has got so much publicity, I think people are hearing a lot more about it but the fact is, this plane is as reliable and more reliable than the 777 was when it was introduced into service. Our systems are doing very, very well. So, well here, we have got a lot of systems, nine major systems on the aircraft. Each one might have a minor glitch but I think, overall, The Boeing Company would tell you that are working very closely with them to get all these things behind us.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Hey, Greg, a couple of things in CC&S. Maybe can you just give us a sense of how you are thinking about the second half there. Transicold, you had revenues up 11%, but orders I think you said up 5%. That looks like make it slows a bit. Can you gauge the different components of the CC&S in the second half?","Gregory Hayes","I think we go through all of the CCS businesses. Obviously, Transicold is an important part but not the only part but we did see decent order growth in the second quarter and sales were up mostly because of the very easy compare last year. You recall, last year, on the container side, we didn\u2019t get any orders, I think, from May through September in that business.","So the compares get very east in the back half of the year and we continue to see pretty good traction on the container side. Also on the truck trailer side, both North America and Europe are seeing good order growth. Europe, surprisingly, is strong, given where the economy is but that\u2019s all coming from cold chain expansion in the Eastern European area. So that business is doing well. The thing about res in the U.S., again, very strong orders growth, good revenue growth. We think that trend is going to continue and it will support a very strong back to the year.","So if you think about it, first half of the year, we didn\u2019t get much growth out of CCS in total, but we did get growth in some key markets. Again, China was another place where we saw good growth at CCS. Orders, I think, on commercial HVAC were up about 15%, 16%. F&S products were up over 30%. So there is good momentum in the emerging markets despite the fact that Europe, overall, was down 1%, I guess, on commercial and a couple of points on the F&S business.","So lots of moving pieces. We have taken the revenue guidance down for CCS. We now expect probably around 3% organic revenue growth for the full year which still indicates pretty solid growth in the back half of the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay, great, thanks. Then just so taking up the restructuring. In terms of the payback, what kind of year-over-year savings do you now expect in '14 from the actions you are taking?","Jay Malave","One of these programs run average about two years, Shannon. So this year we are talking about incremental $100 million plus. So you are probably looking next year in that range of another $100 million of these actions.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","So that total, in terms of the total $450 million, how much year-over-year sales growth?","Gregory Hayes","So it gives us about $100 million of benefit this year because we have taken a lot of these actions in the first half year and a lot of them are on the quicker payback, like the voluntary early retirement program that we have done at Pratt. So the other headcount actions we have taken at CCS and UTAS. Some of the other things that we are still doing in the back half will be a little bit longer payback, probably 1.5 to two years. So its going to be $100 million this year and then $100 million to $125 million next year of savings. So it will be probably $250 million of runrate savings by the end of next year.","Operator","Our next question in the queue is from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Just following up actually on the restructuring. Greg, are you seeing the same payback opportunities now on some of these new projects that you were a year ago or two years ago when you look just across the company and you look going forward, do you think there is continued opportunity and the same kind of quality opportunities as we look into next year as you have seen in the past?","Gregory Hayes","Joe, we came into this year thinking we probably do $150 million to $200 million of restructuring. The fact is, restructuring is a way of life here at UTC. It's how we drive productivity. I will tell you, that we just continue to come up with good payback programs. There are some things out there that some of these structural factory, the actions that take a little bit longer.","Obviously, some of the UTAS actions that we are taking as we consolidate Goodrich, it will take a little bit longer to payback, but on average even with all that said we are still looking at two years or less payback for all of these programs.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Okay. Could you provide an update on CMH? There were some, they were media flurry the last few days. Just with some implications that they are still not taking helicopters. I know that's not new, but just an update on the program. And, I guess underlying the question, what is your level of confidence that this does not turn into a much, much bigger deal down the road?","Gregory Hayes","I would tell you, I feel better about CMH today than we have probably in the last year. We are gaining momentum with the customer. I think, importantly, we are going to start pilot training in August, so another month. We've got four helicopters up in Shearwater, Canada. That's going to serve pilot training. We've got another five helicopters that are sitting up in Hartford, New York, ready to be delivered. Two more in flight test.","The 8 that we talked about going into the year, I think we've got a solid plan to deliver those. Still some issues obviously to work through with our customer, but I think again, we are seeing positive momentum. I don't think we are going to see a big, big bad news item coming out of here. I think here you saw some things in the really impressed with the seeking 50 years into service and it's been a great helicopter, but again 50 years and they are starting to have some issues with that helicopter. We got the best military helicopter sitting right there ready to go, so I think it's all pretty positive right now. Rick has really done a great job with the whole team and starting to sing around.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Okay. Then just one more quick one. On UTAS spares, do you still expect high single-digit or 10% I thinks is your exact guidance. I know you dropped the sales guidance a little bit there or to the lower end of the range, but specifically on spares.","Gregory Hayes","So spares at UTAS, I think, were up about 4% on a pro forma basis in the quarter. They were up. For the full year, we had talked about 10%. That's probably going to be more like 7% or so by the time we get all done, just because we haven't seen the first half growth, but continue to see pretty solid growth.","Now looking at parts versus provisioning, remember we sell both spare parts as well as end items. Spare parts in the quarter were up over 10%. Provisioning was down about 10%, so still provisioning is a little bit lumpy. I talked to the guys yesterday. They see that we have got line of sight on the provisioning number to hit the full year, so pretty confident we are going to get in the mid-7% maybe 8% range.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Ron Epstein of Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Just a couple. On the Pratt orders, can you describe in more detail where you've seen them coming from? Is it you are seeing from the freighter market or where has the order activity pick up come from?","Gregory Hayes","I think, obviously, freighters is an important part, but I think most of the orders could actually come on the commercial airline side. As Jay mentioned, I think we talked about in the script, PW2000 spares were up significantly. The 4000s were up over 15% and Vs were up almost 15%, so we're really seeing strength across the board.","Inductions into the engine centers are down year-over-year and content hasn't really improved, but we know as these planes keep flying, the customers need parts and that can go only so long and the glue we've been talking, this one is a four quarters, five quarters or six quarters, eventually spares come back and I think that's what we saw this quarter and we expect that kind of momentum to continue into the back half of the year.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Is there any regional strength maybe you are seeing that starting to come out? North America, the Europe and Asia, if you could characterize that?","Jay Malave","Ron, Pratt legacy fleet is more concentrate in North America and Asia, so we saw that pretty much across the board there. The V2500 fleet is a little bit more broad-based excluding Europe. Again, there wasn't any one particular region. It really stood out one way or the other. It's pretty even.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Then Maybe one more, Greg, if you don't mind. A much bigger picture question. Now that the portfolio reshaping, I guess the settle down, what has to happen for you guys to feel comfortable again about maybe adding something else to the mix, right? Is there a bias towards aero? Is there a bias towards industrial? I mean, how should we think about, and I know this is a longer term question about where you want to go with the portfolio over the next several years?","Gregory Hayes","As we said, the portfolio, at least for the near term, is set. I think, we are 55% Aero, 45% commercial. Eventually, we would like to probably get back to kind of a 50\/50 split. But, for right now, we like the hand we have got. Especially with what's going on, on the other commercial Aero side. So the focus right now is really at execution. The next deal, I would tell you, that again as you think about the 50\/50 split, it will probably be on the commercial side. I know, Geraud has some ideas, [Major] has some ideas. Nothing really imminent though, and I think, again we have got a lot on our plate right now and we would like to handle that. Urbanization continues to drive and will drive strong organic growth for years to come on the commercial side and also help on the Aero side. So I wouldn\u2019t look for anything big coming out of UTX for a few years.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Just back on the restructuring. The incremental $100 million, can you talk about which segments those are in? Then, related what are the favorable items that are coming in to offset that, that weren\u2019t unexpected earlier?","Gregory Hayes","So most of the favorable items, we have actually already seen them. We had a gain this quarter from Pratt power to sales Pratt power systems. We also had a couple of small tax settlements out there with the IRS that gave us a little bit. There maybe one or two more small divestitures on the CCS side that might generate a little bit more gain. So the gains are pretty much done.","As far as the actual spend in the back half of the year, I think you will see that across the business here, UTAS, again we have talked about this, they have got about $100 million spend planned for the year. They have got some work to do to get to that $100 million, but they have got a lot of projects lined up. Pratt continues to look for things on the aftermarket side to do in terms of consolidation. More to come there.","Obviously, Otis in Europe has some work to do with sales continuing to atrophy there on service side. Pedro and team, I know, are looking for ways to take some structural cost out of Europe. So I would expect more to come there. Really, again, everywhere we look we find opportunities to reduce cost. It's amazing what Geraud and the CCS team have done as they brought F&S and Carrier together. They are on a run rate to probably take $200 million of cost out of the business, which is credible. So always opportunities and it will be spread across all businesses.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay, and then you talked about for Otis, the profit being a little bit worse because of Europe and the weaker Yen. Are those about equal and is there anything that\u2019s a positive move that\u2019s offsetting?","Jay Malave","Well, Sam, if you look at the move from the midpoint to the midpoint and you are talking about $38 million, two thirds of that was the currency that was driven by the yen. Then the other third was essentially the net weakness from Europe, partially offset by higher restructuring and some rebuilding in China.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay, and then the last question is, you had talked, I guess, in the last month about the F100 court case. I guess, as we look out into the remainder of the year, is there an additional reserve that we should be looking for or any sort of a cash impact as we go forward?","Gregory Hayes","No, and no. For those of you that, what we are talking about here is the FEC or Fighter Engine Competition that started in 1983. I think just (inaudible), that that\u2019s not my fault. So the whole issue here is, we had the case. We had won it at the trial court. Government appealed it. It was remanded back to the trial judge.","Right now, based upon outside legal counsel and our review, we believe that we will prevail on appeal. So we have not taken any reserve associated with this and we would not expect to have any cash impact on this for quite some time. The way these court cases work, I have my General Counsel sitting here, it will probably be a year and half or so before we ever get any resolution on this thing again. It has been going on for 30 years.","So we continue to believe the government wasn\u2019t harmed and as you take a look at the 10-Q which we are going to file on Friday, we will have expanded disclosure in there. So you can go through all that and if you have any questions, give us a call but bottom line is, we think we are going to prevail on appeal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Just first question, I guess on Pratt & Whitney, I get the margin there really from the consolidation and some of the restructuring gains, but I was surprised just given the amount of commercial engine ramps, particularly in large commercial. Is that the level we should be expecting for the second half with a sequential uptick?","Gregory Hayes","On the OE?","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","On the OE side. Yes.","Gregory Hayes","The OE should be growing a little bit in the second half. In the quarter, we had higher shipments, particularly in the wide-bodies with the GP7000 and A380. And, for the year, we are expecting GP7000 to still be up year-over-year, so we will see some growth there. Even now I don't know if it will be significantly higher than where it is today. I think, what we did in the quarter is generally speaking, probably where you would be.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay. That's helpful. Then just a quick one on Sikorsky, I get that domestic DoD pressures. Can you just give us an update or color on some of the major international pursuits that are out there?","Gregory Hayes","I think, Sikorsky continues to make good progress on the international side. We are working with Turkey on a relatively large opportunity there with the Turkish Utility Helicopter program. We expect to get something finalized by the end of the year there.","The India navy contract has been a little bit of a disappointment just because it keeps pushing out to the west, but we've had good traction in Brazil. We've had good traction in Columbia and the Middle East. So, again, there's lots of foreign military opportunities out there and Sikorsky continues doing more than its fair share.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Can you comment, give us some color on the impact at carrier of the blistering heat wave we've had in the U.S. and Europe in July?","Gregory Hayes","It's good to own a air conditioning company when it's hotter. We talked about this, Cai, the orders were up almost 20% in the quarter of res side.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Yes, but you basically didn't see the heat wave in June. You saw it in July, which is.","Gregory Hayes","So, sales were up 12%, 13% order were even more. The fact is, it takes some time to actually see that come through the channel. It's two-step distribution, so we sell into through our major distributors who then sell up to dealers, so we would expect to see some level of good news yet here in the July-August. I think, orders have continued to be pretty good.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","In Paris you were kind of talking about things being somewhat better, and it looks like things were definitely more than somewhat better, particularly on the 4000s. Was there sequential improvement as I read that you went through that quarter and kind of give us any color on what you are seeing in July?","Gregory Hayes","Sequentially, in the quarter, sales were up about 50% and orders were up over 30%, sequentially.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Talking about attached to PW4000.","Gregory Hayes","That was just in total. On 4000 itself I would have to get back to you on that, Cai.","Jay Malave","I think, Cai, that the fact as we started to see orders pick up April and May, I think it just accelerated into June. We had a very good month in June of bookings, but it's hard to point at any one thing in particularly other than just kind of pent-up demand that we've been talking about for the last year.","So, again one month or one quarter is not a trend make, but we feel pretty good about the back half of the year. Frankly, we are seeing here the 23rd of July I think orders are okay here, but I don't think I want to be giving order data on a weekly basis here pretty lumpy.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Just in terms of color, did this sort of sequential improvement continue in July is best you can tell?","Jay Malave","Cai, I'll have to get back to you on that. I don't really recall. I focus more on second quarter and third quarter, but we'll take a look and see if there is anything significant there.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company","Terrific. The last question, you mentioned that military after market was weak at Sikorsky, maybe give us a broader view of kind of the impact you are seeing or expect to see from sequestration and basically military aftermarket across the company.","Gregory Hayes","Yes, so military sales or military aftermarket sales were down about 25% at the Sikorsky in the quarter and orders were down about 40%. It is hard to delineate between just the budget cuts and what's going on as the overseas continuity operations wind down versus sequestration.","There has been some impact from sequestration just because it is taking us longer to get orders processed through the government to get contracts amended and things like that done. But it\u2019s a pretty tough environment on the aftermarket side but not surprising, the overseas continuity operations, the fund is down about half and Sikorsky, of course, is the big gun of this year of the Afghanistan campaign. So some of that is just natural and a little bit is also from sequestration.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Greg, just a couple of quick balance sheet questions. You have got around $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Do you think that\u2019s a good safe number to keep going forward? Or do you see an opportunity to bring that down going forward?","Gregory Hayes","The issue of the $5 billion, Rob, as you know, as most of that is sitting overseas. It's not all of that right now. We use that cash on a daily basis. We have got an inter company lending program where we lend out to the businesses for working capital needs. That\u2019s not $5 billion. You have also got a lot of cash, over $1 billion sitting in China that continues to grow as the businesses there continue to generate strong cash flows but hard to get at.","So how much do you really need? Probably half of what's on the books. The other half it, it's just hard to get at and quite frankly from a tax perspective, very expensive to bring back to the U.S. We talked a lot about this. One of the benefits of the foreign cash is it does give the opportunity to make investments overseas and to do acquisitions overseas. So when you think about the M&A agenda, that\u2019s probably where to look next.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Okay, and then secondly on the balance sheet. You mentioned you have got about another $1 billion of debt you want to pay down this year. if you look at it over the longer term, what's your thinking on debt repayment on say, a five year period?","Gregory Hayes","We have got over a $1 billion that\u2019s due in December. It\u2019s the eighteen month floating rate note that we issued last May. That will actually get paid off. Then I would say, there is no debt payments due next year, although I would expect we will probably do another $1 billion of paydown next year and probably another $1 billion of paydown the following year.","We are trying to get back into that solid A range with the rating agencies. So again, I think, I would model $1 billion, $1.5 billion of paydown each over the next few years and there is not much due after that. But again, I think, we will continue to deleverage and so we see an opportunity to do something more significant on the M&A side.","Operator","Our next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","I just had a question on Otis profits. I am looking at the guidance. It seems that you are assuming around flattish margins year-on-year in the second half. After that, it would be down about 70 bips in the first half. I just wondered, does the guidance embed any sequential or year-on-year improvement in your European aftermarket volume or price?","Gregory Hayes","No, in fact, I think Europe, in the first half has been a drag over probably over $40 million of headwind here in the quarter, or first half rather, from Otis's service business in Europe but we think they are starting to stabilize although there is still a little bit of pressure, particularly in Southern Europe. Year-to-date, Otis, essentially flat earnings.","We have taken the guidance down to $75 million to $100 million. Piece of that was currency, a piece of that's Europe. But with this very strong orders momentum that we say here in North America as well as China, the back half of the year should be very good progress. There should get back on the path for earnings growth and should be able to hold margins as well.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks and then on the overall business, I think you mentioned 3% organic sales growth for the full year. You are running at about minus 1% in the first half. So does that mean we should expect mid-single digit organic sales growth already in Q3? So otherwise you will need double-digit growth in Q4?","Gregory Hayes","Yes, it will pick up probably in that mid-single digits in Q3 and Q4 will be even a little better. Again, to think about these Otis orders that we are getting to date, it's about a six months turnaround time for the European groups or for the China orders. The other businesses little bit longer cycle than that. Spares, again, order rates are good.","Talking about spares at Pratt were up 15% organically, sales only up 2%, so very strong book-to-bill, so sales will pick up again as we move into the third quarter. Then lastly, I'd just remind you that CMH will deliver in the fourth quarter. We got eight helicopters. That's about $400 million of revenue out of Sikorsky just in the last quarter.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Then just lastly a quick one, the CapEx is up about 50% the last six months. is that sort of a good run rate for the second half as well?","Gregory Hayes","Yes. In fact it's going to pick up even a little bit more. I think we spent over $600 million first half of the year. We got $1.7 billion plan, and that's really being driven by the a aerospace guys as they continue to a ramp up or facilitize for the ramp up in production that we are seeing on the commercial aero side and the new GTF platforms.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in is from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","I am interested in UTAS. You talked about provisioning being down a little bit, but I would think going forward with 787 growth you would see some real benefits from provisioning going forward pretty soon. So, I am interested in how you look at the 787 and UTAS right now both, in terms of provisioning but also in terms of any impact we might see with respect to margin on OE deliveries.","Gregory Hayes","Yes. So, provisioning, obviously was a little bit slower in the first half of the year than what we had expected because of the production delays echoing. But, again, as mentioned before, we see pretty good provisioning picking up in the back half of the year, especially with all these new customers, come online. I think Boeing, is going. I think right now we are at seven a month. They are on track to get to 10 a month. We are going to support that and that's actually going to drive some good provisioning orders.","Keep in mind, about half of our customers are on care program where we actually do the provisioning ourselves and then charge a flight hour payment to the airline, so we're not getting quite a pick up that we had historically on some of the new program introductions, but from a return on investment standpoint it's a really good program. Benefits both, the airlines and UTAS, so good back half of the year.","On the OE, side it's still a pretty tough story. We've got about $6.5 million of OE content and the margins are awful, and we got a lot of work to do on cost reductions yet on 787 that we talked about this. We are working with the Boeing Company, trying to identify cost reduction opportunities to take cost out for them and us some money, but it's a tough slog right now and there's a lot of work to do on cost reduction, particularly aero structure side of the business.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","I am also interested. When you look broadly at the whole business, you've done quite a bit of restructuring over the last couple of years. It looks like it's been very successful in terms of delivering better margins, getting cost down. But now when you look ahead, you've gotten some very encouraging orders in this last quarter. Do you see a point here, where you are transitioning really a different way to think about the company in terms of more growth potentially less restructuring, because you may not need to get your fixed cost base down much more? When could you get comfortable there?","Gregory Hayes","I think as soon as we've turned the corner on organic growth, but I think as we exit the year, but if we do as we expect, which should be kind of 5% or 6% run rate going out of the year. I think we'll need to do further structural cost reduction while it never goes away. I think, again, although focus will be on delivering on the organic growth and that just gives us huge operating leverage.","I could imagine, CCS grew profits in the first half of the year and really no revenue growth, so cost takeout. That's really been the story in the first half of the year, but I got to tell you it's a lot more fun to see the top line growing and to focus on satisfying customer demands and restructuring, but restructuring never goes away. We're always looking for productivity and room to grow margins.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Are you comfortable that with restructuring efforts you have done and you have underway right now, you haven't done anything to your base that would constrain your growth, you are basically getting to the point where you are prepared for it? Is that correct?","Gregory Hayes","That's exactly right. I think on the aerospace side, specifically we moved some work to lower cost locations trying to consolidate work across the UTAS business. There's still more work to do for the Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand consolidation standpoint, but we feel very comfortable with where we are with the footprint.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Gregory Hayes","All right. And thanks very much.","Jay Malave","Alright, well thanks to everyone. I appreciated that you are listening in on the call. We will, obviously, be around later in the day, so if you have any, to answer any of your specific questions but I really appreciate you all listening. So have a great summer. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. And again, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"21192":["United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Greg Hayes - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Carroll Lane - Vice President, Investors Relations","Conference Call Participants","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies","Steve Tusa - J.P.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investors Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there\u2019s a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will seek to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring cost and other significant items of non-recurring and\/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.","UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its Forms 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. In addition, in connection with the merger to be discussed today, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement which will include a prospectus of UTC and joint proxy statement of UTC Raytheon that will contain important information about UTC Raytheon the merger and related matter. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Sonia, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from the press release, Q2 another strong quarter for UTC. As you can see we reported adjusted EPS of $2.20 and that\u2019s up 12% versus last year and a continuation of the strong performance we saw in the first quarter of this year. Sales were up 18% with 6% of that organic, driven by contributions from all four of the businesses. And I think importantly, free cash flow is really solid at $1.6 billion in the quarter.","Just a couple of highlights. Pratt & Whitney, they booked nearly 1,000 GTF firm and option orders at the Paris Air Show. And the Pratt team continues to execute on the GTF cost reduction initiatives and importantly are meeting the customer delivery requirements. At Otis, nice to see that they\u2019re on track, 50 basis points of margin expansion in the second quarter and a continued focus on the service transformation initiatives that are starting to pay off in the business.","So based on the strong first half of 2019, we are going to raise both the top and bottom end of our adjusted EPS outlook. So we now expect earnings this year between $7.90 and $8.05. That's up from our previous expectation of $7.80 to $8. We are also going to raise the low-end of our organic sales outlook. So we now expect 4% to 5% of organic sales growth, that's up from our last look at 3% to 5%. And we continue to expect free cash flow somewhere between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. But keep in mind, that includes a $1.5 billion placeholder for the one-time portfolio separation costs. We will talk more about that later.","Beyond the quarter, maybe just a few comments. I know there are some things that people are wondering about, so let me just go through the other big things that are going on starting with the integration of Rockwell Collins. Q2, again a great quarter for Rockwell. Acquisition -- post-acquisition the business continues to exceed our expectations. We saw like $0.15 of accretion in the quarter. And for the full-year, we now expect about $0.50 of accretion from the Rockwell Collins deal. That\u2019s up from $0.35 at the start of the year.","As we also highlighted last month, we now expect to see about $600 million of cost synergies related to Rockwell by year four. That\u2019s up a $100 million from our original guidance. And as you know, Kelly Ortberg, as he discussed in Paris, the team has identified more than a 100 projects, which are expected to drive over $1 billion of revenue synergy opportunities. So really a great start to the year for Rockwell, a great start for Kelly Ortberg and the whole team at Collins Aerospace and we see great things in the future.","Maybe just a minute on the spin transactions. They\u2019re on track as we have noted before to be completed in the first half of 2020. And as you know, we are targeting completion at the first half or the end of first quarter of next year subject to the timing of the tax rulings in a couple of jurisdictions. As you saw in early June, we name the CEOs for both Carrier and Otis and we're making good progress on the Board formation for both companies. So everything continues to be on track with all of the portfolio separation activities.","We got about 600 people working. We got about 13,000 tasks yet to complete, but we will get this done and we are confident by the early part of next year, we will be ready to go with the spins. Finally, I mean, just a word on Raytheon. As I said in Paris, the combination of Raytheon and United Technologies Aerospace largely completes our strategy to become the leading platform agnostic provider of high tech systems to the aerospace and defense industry. We are really confident that this proposed merger capitalizes on the unique opportunity to create significant long-term value for our share owners, for our customers and employees, and we believe that we will redefine the A&D industry for decades to come.","In the near-term, we can also expect to see over $1 billion of gross cost synergies by year four and allow for accelerated capital returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As we said last month, you can expect $18 billion to $20 billion return to shareholders in the first three years post-close. The transaction we expect will be immediately accretive to UTC earnings and we expect to see $0.20 to $0.30 of EPS accretion on an adjusted basis in the first full-year following the close. To see a few exhibits in the appendix that highlight some of the key attributes of the deal.","So with that, let me turn it over to Akhil and Carroll to take you through the results. And I\u2019ll be back at the end for wrap up, and then we will take your questions. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Greg. So I\u2019m on Slide 2. For Q2, reported sales of $19.6 billion were up 18%, including 6% organic growth, 13 points of M&A benefit, largely Rockwell Collins acquisition. Foreign exchange was up 1 point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.20, was up $0.23 or 12% versus the prior year. Coincidently on a GAAP basis, EPS was also $2.20, down 14% versus prior year and included $0.06 of restructuring charges offset by $0.06 of net nonrecurring gains.","The nonrecurring items included $0.37 of gains associated with finalization of some tax audit. The good news is Legacy UTC is now current with the IRS through 2016. This was partially offset by $0.28 of charges related to the UTC portfolio separation activities and $0.03 of net other charges. Now just as a reminder, last year second quarter included a $0.74 gain associated with the sale of the Taylor business, which is we are down year-over-year on a GAAP basis. Free cash flow for the first half was $2.8 billion, up more than 50% or approximately $900 million compared to the first half of 2018. That puts us exactly in line with our expectations and on track to deliver on our full-year outlook as Greg noted.","So on Slide 3, you see the drivers of our organic growth. Looking at the commercial businesses in the Americas, sales were up 4%. Nonresidential construction indicators remain positive. However, housing starts are now expected to be down low single digits in 2019 versus the low single-digit growth we expected coming into the year. We\u2019ve also seen a slower start to the summer with cooling degree days in weather sensitive states down 18% through Q2 compared to 2018.","Within EMEA, sales were down 3% in the quarter. In Europe, excluding Middle East, Carrier was down mid-single digits, while Otis was up slightly. The economic outlook across Europe remains mixed and overall is weaker than the expectations coming into the year. In the Middle East, activity levels remain very low for both Carrier and Otis. In Asia, sales were up 8%. China sales were up 10%, including mid-teens growth at Otis. We continue to see modest price increases and favorable mix in Otis new equipment orders in China.","On the Aerospace side, commercial OEM sales were up 8% driven by Pratt & Whitney, which was up more than 20%. At Collins Aerospace, Commercial OEM sales were up only slightly on an organic basis as higher sales and content on new platforms like Boeing 787 Airbus 350,320neo and 220 were largely offset by lower negative platform related sales.","For Commercial Aftermarket, sales were also up 8%. We continue to see high traffic demand and strong utilization. Commercial Aftermarket sales at Pratt & Whitney were up 2%. At Collins Aerospace, Commercial Aftermarket sales were up 18% organically. Provisioning for the Legacy UTAS business was up over 30%, driven by MRO stocking activity, which is not likely to continue at these levels in the second half.","For the year, Collins now expects organic provisioning sales to be up low-teens due to the strength we saw in the first half. Organically military sales were up 15% at Pratt & Whitney and 9% at Collins Aerospace, primarily driven by the ramping JSF production.","Now before I hand over to Carroll, just a few comments on our improved 2019 outlook and the moving pieces. At the operating segment level, a reduced outlook at Carrier is more than offset by the strength at Collins Aerospace. We\u2019ve included a chart in the appendix on Slide 12 with updated sales and profit walks for both businesses as a reference.","At Carrier, while market fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in the U.S., we are not seeing growth at the levels we expected coming into the year. Soft order rates in the first half, particularly in the refrigeration and global HVAC end markets have led us to reduce the full-year top line growth expectations by $350 million to $400 million. This translates to around $100 million of earnings headwind, which is what you see dropping out of Carrier's operating profit outlook. So while Carrier is still expected to grow the top and bottom line, the growth will be less than what we expected coming into the year.","Dave Gitlin and the Carrier team continue to drive cost reduction and other productivity initiatives to offset under absorption and other impacts related to volume aim shortfalls in 2019. More importantly, Dave is reinvigorating operational excellence initiatives at Carrier, which will strengthen the business for long-term success as an independent company.","On the positive side, we see $150 million improvement in the full-year operating profit outlook for Collins Aerospace. This is driven in equal parts by higher cost synergies, better legacy Rockwell Collins performance, primarily in the avionics business, and the strong aftermarket results we saw at the Legacy UTAS business in the first half. No significant changes below the line. We continue to expect the adjusted effective tax rates to be between 23% and 24% in 2019.","Bottom line, we feel very good about our improved organic sales and adjusted EPS range for 2019, and for those who are keeping score at the midpoint of our improved adjusted EPS range, we still have approximately $60 million of contingency.","With that, let me turn it over to Carroll to take us through the business unit details. Carroll?","Carroll Lane","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on Slide 4. Now I'll be speaking of the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there\u2019s an Appendix on Slide 15 with additional segment data you can use as a reference.","Otis. Otis sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, up 4% organically. On a constant currency basis, new equipment sales grew 4%, mid-teens growth in China and low single-digit growth in the Americas were partially offset by mid single-digit declines in EMEA and low single-digit declines in Asia, excluding China.","Service sales were up 5% with growth in all regions driven by mid single-digit growth in maintenance and repair as well as modernization. New equipment orders declined 6% in the quarter and are down 1% on a 12 months rolling basis. Orders in North America were down high-teens, driven in part of the timing of major orders.","Now despite soft orders in the first half, backlog in North America is up low single-digits this year versus the prior year. And the overall activity level in North America including project awards remains stable. Asia orders, excluding China were down mid-teens on tough compares, while Europe was up slightly. China orders were up 5% as the fifth consecutive quarter of value growth with orders benefiting from favorable pricing and mix.","Operating profit was up 9% at constant currency, driven by strong volume growth in both new equipment and service. This marks the third consecutive quarter for operational profit growth at Otis, largely driven by continued improvement in the profitability of the service business. Foreign exchange translation was a 4 point headwind to sales and a 5 point headwind to earnings. So given slightly better-than-expected first-half performance, we remain confident in Otis's full-year operating profit growth of $25 million to $75 million at constant currency.","Turning to Slide 5, Carrier sales were up 2% organically. Global HVAC was up 3% with North America residential up 2% and Commercial HVAC up 4%. Refrigeration and Fire and Security were both up 1%.","Carrier equipment orders contracted 12% organically in the quarter. Transport refrigeration orders were down 63% on tough compares in North America truck trailer. You'll recall that orders were up more than 100% in Q2 of 2018. In Europe, truck trailer orders were down more than 25%, commercial refrigeration orders were down 11% in the quarter, as European markets have softened.","Commercial HVAC orders were down 4% with EMEA down 10%, reflecting the market dynamics that Akhil noted earlier. North America residential orders were down 3%, also on tough compares. For the first half, North America residential orders were up 1% including the impact of the cooler than expected start to the summer.","At constant currency, operating profit grew 2%, excluding a 1 point impact from the divestiture of Taylor. Earnings growth from higher volume and pricing more than offset commodity and tariff increases as well as investments and productivity initiatives.","So looking ahead, we expect carrier earnings growth in the second half of the year driven by cost reduction actions, productivity initiatives and easier compares on commodities, tariffs, logistics expenses and foreign exchange. However, given the revised outlook for Carrier's end markets, we are lowering Carrier's outlook for the full-year. We now see low single-digit organic sales growth and earnings growth in the range of $25 million to $75 million at constant currency.","Okay. Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 6. Sales of $5.2 billion were up 9% on an organic and reported basis. Commercial OEM sales were up 22% on higher Pratt & Whitney Canada engine shipments and the favorable mix of large commercial engine sales.","Commercial aftermarket was up 2%. Pratt & Whitney Canada aftermarket saw growth from higher content and favorable mix. This is partially offset by unfavorable contract re-estimates related to PW4000 engines. V2500 overhaul inductions in Q2 were up 5% versus Q2 of 2018 and up 20% sequentially from Q1 as capacity in the overall MRO network increased. That follows the temporary induction delays that we discussed in the first quarter.","Military sales were up 15%, driven by the continued ramp of the F135 program. Adjusted operating profit of $427 million was up 7%. Favorable large commercial engine sales mix and continued GTF cost reduction more than offset the impact of the PW4000 contract re-estimates and higher E&D. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney to grow full-year operating profit by $200 million to $250 million.","Turning to Collins Aerospace systems on Slide 7. Sales in the quarter were $6.6 billion, that's up $2.6 billion and operating profit of $1.2 billion, was up $538 million. On a pro forma basis including results for Rockwell Collins in the second quarter of 2018, Collins Aerospace delivered strong operating profit growth of 21% on 8% higher sales. The pro forma sales growth reflects strength across the combined Collins Aerospace business.","Commercial OEM sales were up mid-single digits and commercial aftermarket sales were up 16% with double-digit growth across all sales channels. Passenger traffic and demand for modifications and upgrades including avionics sales related to the ADS-B mandate remained strong and we saw another quarter of above trend provisioning sales.","Military sales were up mid-single digits driven by higher F35 volume and an overall strong order book. Operating profit growth was driven by the contribution from the Rockwell Collins business, drop through on higher organic sales and synergy benefits. This growth was partially offset by mix headwind and higher E&D spend.","As a result of continued strength in sales volume and aggressive cost synergy capture, accretion from the Rockwell Collins acquisition to UTC earnings was approximately $0.15 in the quarter. Given the strong first half of the year, we now expects Collins Aerospace operating profit to be up $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion for the full-year with the Rockwell Collins acquisition delivering $0.50 of accretion to UTC earnings.","And with that, I will hand it back over to Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks, Carroll. Maybe just to note here, the second quarter results really above our expectations, but really a testament to the teamwork across UTC. These results don't just happens. Truly, the efforts of all of our employees, from the leadership of Bob and Kelly and Judy and Dave and the corporate folks right down to the folks on the shop floor, people that are building air-conditioners, servicing elevators, assembling the engines in Aerospace systems. It's a great team. This is a team that gives us confidence in our full-year improved adjusted outlook for 2019. And there is more good things to come.","On the macroeconomic side, obviously the outlook varies region to region. Each business is expected to grow both top and bottom lines in 2019. And as Akhil noted, some of Carrier's end markets have not grown at the rates we expected going into the year. However, we are confident, Dave Gitlin and team are taking the actions to deliver on Carrier's revised outlook.","Dave Gitlin, as you know, has a strong background in optimizing operations. We\u2019ve high confidence in his leadership as well as the rest of the Carrier team. Across all of UTC, we remain laser focused in our key priorities which are unchanged. That's execution, innovation, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. And I remain confident both the near and long-term prospects for each business and we are excited about the future as we transform the portfolio over the coming year.","With that, Sonia, why don\u2019t we go ahead and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you and good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Greg, as part of the proxy you provided some long-term forecast for Pratt, specifically in 2023 EBIT margins for the large commercial business are expected to generate 7% margins. I guess, how does this compare to today and how should we think about the moving pieces with the GTF ramp and production or mix at aftermarket? Thank you.","Akhil Johri","So, Sheila, good question, good point. The number you caught is the large commercial engine business are not Pratt overall. That also has the impact as we have talked about, the decline from the Legacy aftermarket businesses that has a negative impact and that's a highly profitable business as you know today. So as the PW4000 fleet start to go down as the V2500 will remain stable, but some of the other PW2000 and PW4000 fleets go down, that aftermarket will come down and that's come with a high margin. On the other hand, the GTF aftermarket would not have started kicking in to a great level at that point which is why you see the suppressed margins. We expect full-year as you fast forward that and go into the late 2020s or the 2030s, you will see the LCE business, large commercial engine business profitability improved significantly.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you. And so is it fair to say it's a low single-digit margin business at the moment, large -- Pratt large commercial engines?","Akhil Johri","Today, yes, based on all the investments that had been made and the negative engine margin in the GTFs, which is all in that business.","Greg Hayes","Yes. You think about that, you were spending over a $1.2 billion in negative engine margin plus nearly a $1 billion in R&D still across the commercial business. So it's a -- it is definitely a low single margin business, but as Akhil said, once the aftermarket kicks in 24, 25, that\u2019s when the margins really tick up.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just talk about now what you expect for kind of the market for resi HVAC, I mean low single-digit revenue is not bad orders there it can turn pretty quickly. So do you see anything in July that makes you a little more positive on that front and what you now expect for kind of the total market to be in 2019 for resi?","Akhil Johri","Yes. So obviously I think the early part of the summary has not been great, but the heat last couple of weeks it should help the moment of the residential business in the U.S. as you know, we are a two-step distribution, right? So our data is the shipment to our distributors, then the distributors have to sell it out to the consumers. We expect the market -- the replacement market still to be good with these late summer coming in, hopefully that helps with that. But overall market may be flat to slightly down now. We were expecting it to be up sort of mid-single-digit, low to mid single-digit when we came in with the us, with Carrier growing at a slightly faster rate than that. We still expect that trend to continue that Carrier growth will be a little faster than the market, but the market probably flat to down.","Steve Tusa","Got it. And then in Otis, just as a follow-up, you said timing of orders in North America there has been a few project delays driven by tariffs and labor inflection perhaps. Is that kind of what you are referring to? Any kind of a read on U.S non-resi from that? What's your take on that front?","Akhil Johri","I think it's slightly different, Steve. I think it's more about the strength of the orders last year. We saw some really good orders, if you remember, last year Otis North America orders were up 10% on a year-over-year basis, which was off a strong 2017. So '18 was exceptional and we kind of expected our orders in North America this year for Otis to be slightly down. That's not a reflection on the market. It's just that extraordinary strength that Otis saw last year in the orders. We do still see good award level activity. So the non-residential construction activity is still pretty robust and strong. Awards are pretty good. We -- but I think the market is probably the best way to characterize it is stabilizing at the high levels in North America. There is a little bit of margin pressure, but overall market is stabilized.","Steve Tusa","And then one last quick one. You mentioned E&D was up at Pratt, I think the guidance for the year has it being a bit of a tailwind. Is that related to middle of the market or anything like that or why is E&D up there?","Greg Hayes","So E&D is up really across Pratt. It includes both Pratt Canada as well as the large Commercial Engine business. For the full-year, we still expect E&D to be flat. So it will be a tailwind in the back half of the year for Pratt. But there's, I would say minimal spending, although a little bit on the NMA, but that's not driving this. This is just other programs that we've got in the hopper.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ron Epstein","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Ron.","Akhil Johri","Good morning, Ron.","Ron Epstein","When you think about the investments that you can make across the entire franchise, I mean, what is the appetite to make new investments -- investments on new programs, specifically? I mean, where do we stand on NMA? Where do we stand on maybe the replacement of 737, that kind of stuff?","Greg Hayes","Look, Ron, I think you can't look at investment in a single year and make any type of determination. We are going to continue to invest across the aerospace portfolio and those markets where we think we\u2019ve a significant advantage, the GTF is one of those. We are prepared to invest in the NMA. I think we can put in an offer to Boeing, which we hope is compelling, but if that doesn't happen we are going to continue to invest in the GTF technology so that we are ready for the next generation single-aisle, which we don't really think will get launched until probably 2025. So I would expect overall E&D to kind of remain flattish at Pratt until such time as we have a brand new engine program. We are also -- as I think about the E&D, it's not just Pratt, it's also across the Collins Aerospace business. We got a lot of great products there, be it avionics or electric power, the aerostructures business, all of which represent opportunities. And what we are really focused on is how do you innovate and have the next generation of technology ready when the aircraft manufacturers are ready.","Akhil Johri","Just one point to add on the Pratt side, Ron, I think Pratt Canada is a business we shouldn't ignore when we talk about investments because that\u2019s clearly a crown jewel, as Greg has often mentioned and that\u2019s a business where we continue to refresh our product line and continue to make sure that we\u2019ve the latest product available for our customers, because that generate significant installed base and aftermarket on a continuous basis. So that's another area where investment continues.","Greg Hayes","Look, we are not going to step down the pace of E&D spend. I think may be as a percentage of sales that will go down a little bit as we continue to see solid growth on the top line, but the absolute level of E&D I would expect to remain relatively flat as we look to continue to stay ahead of the curve.","Ron Epstein","And then just -- and I may, as a follow on, just quickly?","Greg Hayes","Sure.","Ron Epstein","How does having Raytheon in the portfolio, if you will, or the combination change you\u2019re thinking about that, right? I mean, Raytheon should be a fantastic source of additional capital, so on and so forth, right? So, I mean, how does that -- how does having Raytheon change that versus not having Raytheon?","Greg Hayes","Well, look, I think when you look at the cash flows of the combined company, you understand that some of these decisions as a standalone commercial aerospace business, it's a much bigger deal than as a combined aerospace and defense industry. But also I think it gives us the ability to capitalize on their technologies and for them to capitalize on our technologies. And with 60,000 engineers between the two companies, I got to believe we are going to find some savings on some of these programs as we are able to capitalize on each other's technology. But I think fundamentally what Raytheon gives us is the scale to compete anywhere anytime in any program that we choose to. And again, it's not that we are going to go chase everything, that's not the idea. We still want to be disciplined in where we put our capital, but I think, again, it's just a great opportunity for us to be able to continue to invest, but also to give a lot of cash back to shareowners over the next three to five years, and I think that's the beauty of the Raytheon merger.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Ron.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you and good morning, gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Hey Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Hey. Just a couple of cash flow related questions. First, do you expect to fully spend that $1.5 billion separation placeholder in 2019? And is that grand total number moving around at all as we look into 2020?","Akhil Johri","Still a little early, Jeff, to comment on the total number, but on the $1.5 billion, a lot of that as you can imagine, it relates to the tax costs as we do our legal entity restructuring. The good news is the team is working really, really hard and is on track, as of now, to achieve the steps that were critical. You will see probably a larger amount in Q3 associated with that as we do a lot of these legal entity restructurings. But will the exact number be $1.5 billion for the year? I don't know. And that's part of the reason why we didn't change our guidance for the $4.5 billion to $5 billion for the year, even though on the operational side we feel better about our outlook. The uncertainty associated with the separation cost related cash flow is why we've kept it where it is, but I'm still hopeful that overall we see little better news on cash flow than we have in the guidance.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then also, just coming around to the S-4, I understand the unlevered free cash flow that we see there's different than the free cash flows defined typically in the world we operate in. But the numbers there do suggest that perhaps there's some upside to that kind of $8 billion number you laid out for 2021 post merger for the combined aero company. Am I interpreting that correctly? Can you address that at all?","Akhil Johri","You\u2019re absolutely interpreting that correctly. There will be about $1 billion difference at this point, if you do the math. I think it's easy for anybody to do that, but what I would tell you is two things. One is, what you see in the S-4 and what was used for valuation purposes were our internal plans. As you would expect, any reasonable management team to do is to not necessarily put that out as guidance. So we would -- when we gave you the $8 billion number that had a little bit of conservatism baked into that as a -- because I knew you would ask me that question in 2021. So I just wanted to make sure that, that number was something we could absolutely deliver on. And the second point is that there's still the discussion we were having earlier, even though these separations may happen by 2020 which are likely to happen by 2020 first quarter or second quarter at the latest, there may be some lingering tax payments associated with the separation activities, which may go into 2021 as we file returns in foreign jurisdictions and actually make cash payments in 2021 associated with the separation. So we kept a little room for that so -- but net-net you're right, operationally it should be high.","Greg Hayes","Look, I think the key thing there, Jeff, is that when we did the valuation of UTC Aerospace, we had full of cash flows of the businesses forecast and you've uncovered Akhil's little hedging technique there, which is probably not a surprise to anybody that knows Akhil. But the fact is we think we got full and fair value for all of those cash flows going forward and we will see what the -- what the other cash looks like as it relates to separation activity, but really it was just our own conservatism in terms of what we put out to the Street versus how we actually value the business.","Jeffrey Sprague","Sorry, I couldn't wait to 2021 to ask the question.","Greg Hayes","That\u2019s okay.","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Carter","Carter Copeland","Just a follow-up quickly on that S-4 cash disclosure. I know that just from a methodology standpoint, there was, I guess, some difference in there and how it treated non-operational aerospace investing cash flows. Can you help explain what those were and maybe how much we should think that impacted that number that you -- that we see in the S-4?","Akhil Johri","So, Carter, this is something that we've talked about a little bit over the last couple of years as people have been looking at items below our free cash flow definition, the investing cash associated with the payments we make to Rolls Royce, the lease pool assets that we have -- put in place every year, some limited amount of customer financing that we do, right, all that stuff shows up in our investing cash flow below free cash flow number. So for purposes of relative valuations, since that is a relatively reliable number or outflow, it was only fair to reflect that in the unlevered cash flows for purposes of valuation of the company because that number will stay going forward. Now that will come down over time as we\u2019ve talked. This year, it's probably between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, that number goes down below a $1 billion. As we move forward in time, lease pool assets won't be as high as they are. Customer financing will be a little bit less and the Rolls Royce payments have a finite life to it, they go away after 2027. So we took all that into account, but it was a fair cash call on our aero future cash flows.","Carter Copeland","So it's reasonable to assume that the Rolls payment is, as we know it's always been, you've got a leased pool build and then you got lease pool sales presumably at the back end of that forecast period?","Akhil Johri","Well, leased pool sales, I would say, is not something to rely on because if you think about it, the installed base will continue to grow. So the best way to think about that is that we won't necessarily add to the lease pool assets at the same rate that we have done in these first two years, but we typically don't see sale of leased pool assets till very late in the program. It's more about not continuing to build it at the same rate.","Carter Copeland","Okay. I was just trying to get some perspective on the gross uppers and downers, if you will. So thanks for the clarification.","Akhil Johri","Yes, no problem.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just circling back, nearer term, give a little bit of color as to how much of a slowdown in order intake and general customer activity you've seen in those global HVAC and refrigeration markets? Was this something that fell off late in Q2 or was it a steady sort of deceleration for three or four months?","Akhil Johri","So, broadly speaking, Julian, I think the only place where I would say, we\u2019ve been negatively surprised is Europe broadly speaking for the HVAC business, right? For the HVAC business or for the refrigeration business is the number Carroll quoted for Europe truck trailer orders, down over 25%; commercial refrigeration business was down near double-digit on that as well. In Europe, specifically which is where a big part of the business is. Commercial HVAC was also down in Middle East. As you know, it's down over 25%, I think in terms of that area. So I think Europe has been the one where the order decline has been greater than what we expected and probably a little bit of a surprise. The other places, I would say, is more of a compare issue than really a fundamental market issue at this point. It doesn't feel like that. North America residential, lots of people have talked about it, you understand it well. That's probably a cool start to the summer. I don't think there's fundamentally anything wrong with the market. The replacement cycle is still pretty strong; housing starts down this year, but we expect that to continue to grow as we go forward into the next year. So I think fundamental still okay there. It's the Europe market, which is probably a little weaker than we expected.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just my quick follow-up. Tying that may be to Otis, where you\u2019ve seen very good improvement in service profitability for several quarters. Europe is obviously the biggest profit pool for that service business at Otis. So are you concerned at all if broader construction is slowing in Europe? Did that may start to impinge on pricing in service at Otis and eat into that service profit improvement?","Greg Hayes","Look, I think, we\u2019ve been through a long cycle of pricing pressure in Europe on service and I think we have started to see that stabilize here in the last six quarters or so. And the focus is really going to be on how do we get productivity out of the technicians to offset whatever pricing pressure there's out there, but again, as these more modern machines get put into service, the ability of the independent service providers, the ISPs, to service the elevators becomes less as service becomes, in our words, little bit more sticky. And I think again, the more technology, the more we can offer the customers in terms of internet connectivity and predictive maintenance on these elevators, all of that goes to our ability to retain customers. And look, people typically don't change just for pricing, they change because of poor service. And what we\u2019ve found is that the better our service quality is, the better -- lower our turn backs or call backs to lower issues that are -- or the fewer issues that we\u2019ve with the machines, the better our retention rate is for those elevators. So I don't view this as a near-term or even a medium-term pricing issue. I think that we just have to continue to focus on the fundamentals of service in Europe and that will drive profit growth there.","Akhil Johri","Yes, I think to put a data point that we talked about in the first quarter call as well, I think the most heartening data point for me in Europe service for Otis was that the hours per unit came down by about 5% in this quarter, after a decline in first quarter as well, and that's Europe, right. So Europe service is seeing productivity. Part of that is with the growth in the repair business, in the -- outside of the maintenance. So that\u2019s helping as well, but certainly the service transformation initiatives that Otis has been working on for a long time is -- are starting to bear fruit now.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter Arment","Yes, thanks. Good morning, Greg, Akhil.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Greg, just on Collins Aerospace, just specifically on the commercial aftermarket. The higher outlook that you're giving there now, high single-digit growth, obviously a very strong first half, just maybe some insight on to the -- how you're thinking about the second half. I mean it seems like, are you expecting ADS-B volume to start to fall off or how you're thinking about what the provision and demand will be, just given this outlook? Appreciate it.","Greg Hayes","Maybe a couple of points there. In terms of ADS-B, as you guys know, the mandate is that by the end of this year, all of the U.S operators have to have the upgraded ADS-B. There will be some carry on into next year some of the other smaller operators, the European operators also get their upgrades. I think you\u2019ve to look at provisioning not just as a single quarter though. We said -- I think Akhil said it, provisioning was up over 30% in the quarter and well that\u2019s wonderful, it is not sustainable. And so I think we will try to put a reasonable back half forecast in front of people understanding that you're not going to get 30% type provisioning increases year-over-year, but we still feel very good about the market. I think what we're seeing repair and put is good on the Collins side. Spare part sales are still good, and people are flying a lot. And I think while it's bad news for that the 737 MAX isn't flying, it means that some of the older aircraft have to remain in service a little bit longer and that's also driving some of this volume. So as we think about this, I wouldn't get too excited about the first half. It's great performance across the business. But it's not going to repeat at this level in the back half. If it does, great, you will see it. You will see it in the earnings, you will see in the top line, you will see in the bottom line. But in terms of our guidance, we are not expecting this level of activity to continue.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the color. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good morning. Thanks for your time. Greg, Akhil, when coming back to the S-4 and some of the information in there, clearly you're providing some pretty good numbers as far as growth going forward. I think it implies, once you take into account capital return, somewhere in the mid-teens. One, is that right? And then two, what's the risk to all of that? You obviously caveated it in terms of maybe some potential incremental investments on engines and so on. So just trying to get comfortable with; one, is that opportunity really that big? And then two, what's the risk to it really materializing?","Akhil Johri","I think the biggest point that you made Rajeev is the risk associated and Bob Leduc mentioned this, so this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody is NMA investment, right. If we were fortunate enough to win the NMA -- if NMA is to be launched and we win the engine on that, that would definitely be an investment not contemplated in those numbers. What is also not contemplated, to some extent, probably -- this is business as usual internal plans that were put out there, right. There's also incremental and near-term, there could be some pressures associated with restructuring investments that we need to make in the business to continue to drive margins in the long-term. And as Greg said, if there is additional opportunities that come in front of Collins Aerospace that are associated with NMA or something else, you could see some. So this is business as usual, internal plans driving the businesses to better performance, as you would expect us to do, but there are always risks out there which -- or investments needed which can sometimes dampen that outlook a little bit.","Greg Hayes","Yes, I would just add to that, I think, look, this was a -- our best, most reasonable forecast that we put forward that we shared and felt comfortable sharing with Raytheon and the bankers as we went through the valuation. We try not to put everything, including the kitchen sink into this valuation. We wanted it to stand on its own. At the same time, I believe there's both upside as well as some downside risk. And the upside, as Akhil said, is we\u2019ve more to do on margins at Pratt. We\u2019ve to invest in automation, we\u2019ve to invest in the factories, we\u2019ve to invest to take the cost down even further than what's laid out on these plans. And all of that should lead potentially to higher margins, but it also require higher capital investments, higher cash investments on the restructuring, which are not in there. So we think it's a very balanced view of the business going forward, taking full benefit of course for the GTF investments that we've made over the last 10 or 12 years.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks. Just one quick clarification, but is my characterization in terms of that, growth potential, once you take into account capital return, something sort of mid-teens or so over the next five years, could it be that high?","Akhil Johri","You don't do capital returns from a point of time, right, because I mean if -- that would be ignoring all the investments we\u2019ve made in the business in GTF, for example. I mean, obviously looking forward, I think we've talked about this before, Rajeev. If I look at engine campaigns for GTF to pick one example, we generally have low-to-mid teens returns on every engine campaign. That's our goal. But when I factor all of the investments in E&D and capital and everything else made the GTF program overall, it is not a mid-teens return. It's above cost of capital, but it's more close to double-digit type of thing, right. So I think it depends on what your starting point is and what investment you want to consider, the returns would change. I think the good news is that all these investments generate returns in excess of cost of capital and if you look isolated just on a look forward, it would be in the low to mid teens type of thing that you're talking about -- yes, or it could be higher.","Rajeev Lalwani","I will leave it there. Thanks.","Akhil Johri","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Good morning. Akhil, I just wanted to go back to your comments about the resi HVAC market flat to down. Is that a volume unit forecast or would that be revenues? And this gets to my question about pricing, are we seen pricing discipline continuing in light of the weaker conditions in that market?","Akhil Johri","Good -- very good point, Nigel. What I was talking about was volume, so units essentially is what I was talking about. When you take pricing into account, you do see maybe some up -- a positive number on the market from a value perspective, but yes in terms of units, it's flat to down. Pricing has been reasonably good. I think the second quarter, as Carroll mentioned in his comments, we saw pricing more than offset -- significantly more than offset actually the commodities, logistics and other input cost increases. So we\u2019re seeing the pricing state at this point, obviously a lot depends on how the summer plays out as you know this market well, and also what happens in the future with any tariffs or anything else. So it's something we watch on a day-to-day basis, but the good news is that at least through the first half we\u2019ve seen pricing stick and fall through to the bottom line.","Nigel Coe","And then, my follow-on is really about the back half guidance. You're pointing towards, I think the math is 50 to 100 of EBIT growth in the back half for Carrier. How much visibility do we\u2019ve around raw material deflation benefits or specific cost actions that get us -- give us confidence that we can generate that level of growth in the back half? And I\u2019m curious \u2026","Akhil Johri","Yes.","Nigel Coe","\u2026 whether transportation business could be a headwind, given the negative order development there. Do we\u2019ve a headwind from transportation in the back half of the year?","Akhil Johri","At this point, I think the backlog was still okay for the transportation, to answer your second question first. So I think we're still relying on some level of growth in the refrigeration business in the back half. Clearly, we will need orders to get a little bit better than what we\u2019ve seen in the second quarter. So definitely the good news or the expectation of earnings and sales growth in the second half rely on improving order trends. The things which are positive for Carrier, as we look in the back half is improving raw material headwind, as you point out, commodities, tariffs, all that becomes a little easier, logistic costs on a year-over-year basis comparisons become easier. Plus Dave and Bob McDonough before him, have done a 1,000 people headcount reduction that we see some benefits coming through as that headcount action took place in Q2, etcetera, we see the benefits of that coming through in the second half as well. So restructuring actions, easier compares on commodities, logistics, tariffs etcetera, FX as the other element, when you take all that into account, some things to rely on as we look at second half, but clearly also relying on improvement in the order trends.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So your guide assumes high teens commercial aero aftermarket at Legacy UTAS, which would, I think mid-teens or mid-to-low teens in the second half. Give us some color on the sequential trend over the last couple of months in aftermarket. And at one point, you guys talked of $0.10 negative hit if the MAX is out for the entire year. How does that factor into your thinking currently?","Akhil Johri","Yes, I think to answer your second question first, Cai, it's still the same estimate. We -- I think you've heard from Boeing as well, they're assuming 42 per month type of production through their end of the year. We had calibrated that in our first quarter call, as up to $0.10 and that number still stands. So that is baked into the forecast and Collins was able to raise its outlook in spite of that headwind, so that's certainly good news. With regard to the aftermarket, I think the point I will come back to and Greg mentioned this a little bit as well is, if you look at provisioning, Cai, a lot of the strength we saw in the second quarter at the heritage UTAS business came from stocking orders from the MRO shops, right, with some constraints on supply with the grounding of 737 MAX and no new supply coming in for that aircraft. Clearly, the incentive is and with the traffic still staying robust, the incentive is for all airlines and MRO operators to ensure that the existing fleet is not on the ground for very long at all, if at all, right. And the one way to ensure that is to make -- to be clear that all the parts that may be required for repairing something are available on site and where it is needed. So we saw some stocking orders, which drove exceptional performance, which is great to see and helped us raise our full-year, but to count on that to happen again and repeat itself in the second half would probably not be appropriate and would not be the right call to make. So that\u2019s -- what we have assumed that second half slows down a little bit, still grows nicely. And as Greg said, if it comes in stronger, you will see it in our numbers.","Cai Von Rumohr","I guess my question was, it has to slow, it would look like to a level, still slightly above 10% that's still pretty good, if we\u2019ve any slowing and destocking and more impact from the MAX.","Akhil Johri","Yes, I think part of that is exactly what -- yes, what you said, Cai, I think because of the MAX you -- we continue to expect a reasonably strong second half relative to first half, it will be smaller, but relative to year-over-year or normal trends, it will be stronger. So that's the benefit that will definitely be there. You're exactly right.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Your line is now open.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask about the Pratt aftermarket and maybe Akhil, could you give us what the aftermarket growth would have been without the PW4000 adjustments?","Carroll Lane","Yes, Myles, I mean the aftermarket is doing very well overall. If you think about the organic demand for V2500 shop visits, it's still a 1,000 shop visits or better. And if you think about the step up in inductions that we saw sequentially, very strong, obviously. You take out the PW4000 contract adjustment, you are probably at that mid-single digit overall aftermarket growth. So really the question in terms of getting to the full-year, mid-single digit is just one of execution in the back half, can you get as many these through the shops worldwide as -- is there demand -- the demand remains very strong.","Myles Walton","And that 4000, look, was that customer-specific driven or is that an overall look at the market and kind of -- you are kind of forward look as to the demand and profit looking on that specific engine platform?","Carroll Lane","No, I mean we look at individual customer fleets on a regular basis, assess the cost of the individual contracts. In the case of this quarter, when we looked at some PW4000 contracts, which is obviously a smaller fleet than the Vs, we had a bit higher costs on several contracts. So the good news is we\u2019ve repair development going on continuously to reduce any additional wear modes on some of these older engines because that's what they\u2019re. These are engines that are in the later stages of their life. So, it's a part of doing business and we feel very good about the Pratt aftermarket overall.","Myles Walton","Okay, got it. And just one clarification on the slide that talks about favorable large commercial engine mix. Is that implying that you had lower GTFs year-on-year as proportional to the mix or is that implying something specific to the contracts in the GTF deliveries?","Akhil Johri","No, it's more about the lower GTFs, because if you remember, last year second quarter was a very strong. It was bit of a catch up quarter, right, after the issue we had in the first quarter last year, with the knife-edge seal. The recovery from that took place in the second quarter, so there was a much higher value -- volume of shipments.","There's also a mix issue in terms of -- there's the second element which is probably a smaller contributor to the whole thing is the customers to whom the sales were made, right, that\u2019s the point you\u2019re making about contract. I think that -- there's a little contribution from that as well. And the third element I would say is, sales of some spare engines, right, because as customers are getting confidence in the configuration that we have out in the market now, they\u2019re willing to invest in some leads -- some spare engines themselves as oppose to requiring us to hold all of the spare engine pools.","Carroll Lane","Myles, the other thing we had going on at Pratt this quarter, we don\u2019t talk enough about is Pratt Canada. You had shipments up and really shipments up across all categories, regional was up, corporate was up, rotorcraft was up. So just feeling pretty good about things at Canada, which was a contributor to the OEM line this quarter.","Myles Walton","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Noah Poponak","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Akhil Johri","Good morning, Noah.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Just one quick follow-up to that, Pratt aftermarket topic which is, is the V2500 inspection issue that you had at the two MRO shops that started last quarter, is that fully 100% resolved or does it linger slightly? And then, I wanted to ask on Collins the synergy increase, on a percentage basis, is pretty large for year one. Maybe you could elaborate a little bit on where you're finding that and is there a new multiple-year out synergy number?","Greg Hayes","Yes. So I will start on the V question. We\u2019ve redeployed those engines and we\u2019ve the capacity that we think we need. Really the question is just getting them through the shops, right, because you had delayed inductions and it's a tightly coupled system. So I think the issues that kind of precipitated the disruption have been resolved. But we still have a lot of work to do to get the engines through the shop from an execution standpoint.","Akhil Johri","And the Collins increase, Noah, that's -- again, it's great to see we are -- looking at about $200 million synergies in the first year. And so the $600 million number that you're referring to which was the increased number that Kelly showed in Paris could have some upside. Hopefully that's what Kelly and team are driving to. I\u2019m highly confident that they're not stopping at $600 million as -- like we did in the case of Goodrich, we will continue to drive the synergies. The good news is that we are seeing that level of cost benefits in the first quarter itself. It's in two areas. SG&A, as you would imagine in the first year, generally that\u2019s where you get it and then it's indirect supply that's where the other part of the benefit comes from. So I think the team is focused on driving as high synergy number as we can and $200 million is a good start for first year.","Noah Poponak","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg Hayes for any closing remarks.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Sonia. First of all, thanks for listening today. As always, Carroll and the whole IR team will be available all day to answer your questions. Please feel free to give him a call and thanks to all for listening. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

And welcome to the United Technologies\u2019 Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.","Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.","The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permit.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC recorded third quarter earnings per share of $1.55 that\u2019s up 13% versus 2012. We also saw a resumption of organic growth albeit modest and margin expanded to 16.6%.","There\u2019re always a few bumps in the road such as the recent political impasse in Washington that has threatened economic recovery. But our strategy to deliver double-digit earnings growth remains in place.","Following solid year-to-date performance, we are now confident in our earnings per share range of $6.10 to $6.15 that\u2019s growth of 14% to 15%, at the high-end of our previous expectation of $6 to $6.15, that\u2019s despite slower top line growth.","The majority of our end markets are gradually improving but with defense down more than expected, and based on where we are year-to-date we now expect full year sales to be about $63 billion versus our prior estimate of $64 billion.","There are still a couple of puts and takes to the year, and as I said earlier this month, some headwinds at Otis and Sikorsky, but upside at the other segments. Absent this significant external event, we see in fact the high-end of earnings per share range based on our proactive and aggressive restructuring and cost reduction actions, as well as improving end markets.","As you see on slide two, organic sales grew 1% in the quarter with good growth across most of our end markets, tampered by relatively flat European markets and continued significant declines in defense.","Our commercial businesses grew a combined 3%. We saw a continued recovery in North America with sales up 3% led by residential HVAC and Otis new equipment. Europe declined 1%, China was up 11% and continues to be the bright spot in Asia, but overall sales were up only 3%.","Aerospace business continues to see good growth in commercial OEM and recovery in the commercial aftermarket. Revenue passenger miles were up 6.8% in August and were up 5% year-to-date. Oil prices have dampened profitability a bit, but the airlines are still forecasted to earn $11.7 billion this year and $16.4 billion in 2014. So a healthy industry and we see this in our business with our commercial aero sales up 7% in the third quarter. On the other hand, the military business remains a headwind with sales down 14%. We see this impact across our aero businesses, but most acutely at Sikorsky. Given the continued impasse in Washington, we don\u2019t expect this trend to improve over the next year. ","Okay, take a look at orders on Slide 3. At Otis, new equipment orders were up 4%, a solid growth off a tough compare with the third quarter of last year which had a major contract awarded in the U.K. North America and China, both saw a double digit increases. Climate, Controls and Securities global equipment orders grew 13% as strengthen in Transicold and commercial spares orders were up 17% at Pratt & Whitney and 5% at UTC Aerospace Systems on a pro forma basis.","All right, Slide 4; total sales increased 3% in the third quarter. Net acquisitions including Goodrich closed on July 26 last year contributed two points while the FX impact was negligible. Segment operating profit grew 14% and operating margins increased 160 basis points. That includes about 100 basis points from the absence of the inventory step up amortization at UTAS last year. As you heard from Geraud at our recent Investor Day in Monterrey, Mexico, CCS continues to drive synergies and leverage their global scale. Operating profit grew 10% leading to margin expansion of 170 basis points.","Pratt & Whitney also expanded margins 290 basis points, on higher commercial aftermarket and aggressive cost reduction. And Sikorsky maintained double digit margins in the face of significant headwinds from sequestration and reduced defense spending. So the third quarter earnings per share grew 13% and we initiated $103 million in restructuring actions. Excluding restructuring and gains for both periods, earnings per share grew 19%. As previously noted, we expect to invest about $500 million of restructuring this year including over a $150 million in the fourth quarter.","For the year, we continue to expect restructuring to be offset by onetime items. Free cash on the quarter was 82% of net income. This was unfavorably impacted by an increase in inventory over $500 million primarily at Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky as each ramps up their shipments in the fourth quarter. While we continue to see progress on the CMHP with the commencement of pilot training and we\u2019re maintaining our [place order] [ph] eight aircraft in the fourth quarter. In addition to the four aircrafts at the training facility in Shearwater, Canada, we have six aircraft, fully assembled and flight tested at the [Pittsford] [ph], New York storage facility.","Seven are undergoing flight testing at our West Palm Beach facility. The balance of the 20 aircraft are in production. As the program continues to advance, we\u2019ll provide updates as more progress is made. ","The quarter capital expenditures were $383 million, a little more than $1 billion year-to-date as we invest with the aero ramp up at both Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems. For the year, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion as we noted before. Also in the third quarter we brought back $330 million of stock and we expect to buy back about $200 million in the fourth quarter.","We remain confident that cash flow will equal net income in 2013 and we increased our dividend to $0.59 per share in the quarter a 10.3% increase. I\u2019ll be back to talk about 2014 in just a second, but let me stop there and turn it over to Jay, as he takes you through the business unit results.","Jay Malave","Thanks Greg. Turning to Page 5, Otis sales improved 4% at constant currency in the quarter led by solid high single digit growth in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. New equipment sales were up in all regions led by double digit growth in China, Russia and the Americas. Operating profit was flat at constant currency, but operating margins remained solid at 22%. Continued growth in China was largely offset by transition costs associated with the factory transformation in North America. In developed Europe, the rate of profit decline is slowing, the sequential growth in northern and Central Europe offsetting the continued weakness in Southern Europe.","New equipment order growth was up 4% at constant currency with mid-teens growth in Americas and Asia with continued double-digit expansion in China. Orders in Europe were down high single digits as the prior-year benefited from our major contract award in the U.K. Excluding this award as well as a significant order this quarter, Europe new equipment orders grew 12%.","Given the headwind from the manufacturing and supply chain transition from the Nogales, Mexico to South Carolina and continued weakness in Southern Europe, Otis now expects full-year profits to be up around $25 million, from up $75 million to $100 million and mid-single digit sales growth.","On Slide 6, Climate, Controls and Security increased profits 10% in the quarter on flattish sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins, up 170 basis points from prior year to 17.1%. CCS is continuing to see slow but steady improvement in organic growth as Q1 was down 3%, Q2 was up 1% and now Q3 is up 2%.","As you have seen all year, organic growth is mixed across geographies. Europe was down low single digit. China was up mid single digit while Asia overall was down about 1% driven by a decline in Australia. Americas was up low single digit driven by 9% growth in the residential HVAC business.","Transicold was up 22% on a robust recovery in the container market after an exceptionally weak period last year. On profit, CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth, driven by strong conversion on organic sales, restructuring and productivity including continued savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire and Security, and lower commodity costs.","Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up high single digit with growth in Asia and Europe more than offsetting flat orders in North America. Orders for global Fire and Security products were up mid single digit while the field businesses were down high single digit.","Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were up 2% while Transicold was up 17%, driven by Container and an easy compare over last year. With continued solid results through three quarters and steady sequential organic improvement, we expect profit growth to be around $200 million, the high end of the prior guidance range of $175 million to $200 million and 1% organic sales growth, all resulting in operating margin above 15%, two years ahead of target.","Turning to aerospace on slide seven. Pratt & Whitney delivered solid results with 18% profit growth and 5% lower sales, resulting in margin expansion of 290 basis points. Organically, sales were flat as 22% growth in commercial spares was offset by lower military engine sales.","Reported sales were down due to the power systems business divestiture. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by higher commercial spares volume and restructuring benefits, partially offset by pension headwinds and lower military volume.","As you recall, last year we had the benefit of a supplier settlement that was largely offset by the benefit from licensing agreements this year. For the full year, we now expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit grow $150 million on low single digits sales growth.","We expect profit growth to be at the high end of the prior profit range as large commercial aftermarket has stabilized and the benefits of proactive cost actions are realized.","UTC Aerospace Systems delivered another solid quarter with operating profit of $525 million and sales of $3.3 billion. On a pro forma year-over-year basis, sales were up low single-digit with mid single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket, partially offset by low single-digit declines in both military OE and aftermarket.","Year-on-year profit growth was driven by the absence of last year\u2019s inventory step-up cost, additional market of Goodrich and continued synergies realization. UTC Aerospace Systems expects to deliver around $250 million in synergies for the year and is well on track towards achieving the $500 million synergies target by 2016.","Orders for commercial spares grew 5% on a pro forma year-over-year basis with improvement in both parts and provisioning. With approximately $1.6 billion of operating profit generated year-to-date, we\u2019re confident in the full-year operating profit outlook of $2.1 billion and sales of around $13.5 billion.","Turning to Sikorsky, operating profit decreased by 21% on 7% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 61 aircrafts, including 42 based on military platforms and 19 commercial.","The sales decline was driven by lower military OEM and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by strong growth in commercial shipments. The lower overall sales volumes, as well as headwinds from higher pension and compliance costs contributed to the operating profit decline.","Sikorsky continues to see robust demand for its commercial product line with orders this quarter of over $400 million, a strong backlog in excess of $2.5 billion, including approximately $350 million from customers in China as of quarter-end.","For the full year based on continued pressure in military aftermarket, we now expect profit to be down around $150 million, the low end of our prior guidance range and the low single-digit sales decline versus up low single digits previously.","With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks Jay. Before we take a look at 2014, there some other key items to note in the quarter. In late September we announced the creation of our new buildings and industrial systems organizations under the leadership of Urel Denise.","While they will remain separate reporting segments, this will strategically to unite Otis and climate controls and security. This will create the leading commercial building organization in the industry and will allow us to accelerate growth by fully utilizing our unmatched capabilities and scale.","Building on the success of combining our HVAC and fire and security platforms under CCS two years ago. This new organization creates opportunities to unlock further synergies and leverage each organizations field network to service customers in a wider geography. And with 30% of revenues in emerging markets we will focus our innovation on our next-generation buildings and integrating systems, where we see opportunities to create value for our customers.","Also in the quarter Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems supported the maiden flight of Bombardier C Series aircraft on September 16th in Mirabel, Canada. A PurePower geared turbofan engine performed flawlessly on this historic flight of the first next generation narrow body aircraft. We are confident that the flight test program will further validate the performance characteristics, its noise, low emissions, significantly better fuel efficiency.","While we always like to focus on the improved fuel burn of the GTF designs, just as importantly, the GTF noise footprint is up to 75% smaller than today\u2019s engine. And this creates opportunities to fly more direct routes into congested noise controlled airports.","Smaller noise signature also allows to streamlining airport operations to expanded runway usage, as well as expanding current operational curfews at airports and heavily populated areas. This will give airlines the opportunity to work with airports to generate more revenue by opening additional take-off and landing slots, a good example of the value creation that our game changing technologies will bring to the table.","Pratt & Whitney\u2019s performance, its best-in-class technology readiness and program execution is the reason why the GTF has captured orders for more than 4,700 engines. We also saw the first flight of Boeing 787-9 in the quarter as UTC Aerospace Systems continues to support Boeing in the development of this next generation family of aircraft. So a busy quarter and several significant milestones at UTC.","Let\u2019s change gears for a second here and take a look at 2014. We had not surprises that compared to what we talked about just a couple of weeks back. Our strategy remains in place and we continue to target double-digit earnings growth in 2014.","We expect solid growth in commercial aerospace and the commercial construction markets in North America and Asia to more than offset declines in our military aerospace business.","As you all know, Europe remains a question mark. We will take a cautious approach and we are not planning for growth in Europe as we sit here today. The good news is that we finally seem some tailwind from pension next year.","There were approximately $800 million of pension expense flowing through the P&L this year and it will be a welcome relief to see some benefits for lower acquisition charges and a higher discount rates.","On the other side of the ledger we do have about $0.30 of headwinds from three significant items. It\u2019s obviously continued reduction in defense spending, both sequestration as well as the overseas contingency spending.","There is also pressure on the tax rate primarily from the expiration of the tax extenders. And lastly, we will see some headwind from the initial GTF engine deliveries. It will improve as the technology matures but Pratt & Whitney will face some negative engine margin on deliveries of each platform over the next several years. These are great long-term progress that point towards bright future for Pratt & Whitney, but we will need to work down the learning curve as these aircraft enter service.","So as always some pluses, some minuses and question marks as we look towards next year. We continue to leverage our industry-leading franchises and global scale. With the right strategy in place, we\u2019ll remain committed to delivering double-digit earnings growth once again next year.","So with that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) First question is from David Strauss of UBS. Your line is open.","David Strauss - UBS","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hi, David.","David Strauss - UBS","Hi, Greg. In terms of looking at your revenue guidance and what implies for the fourth quarter it looks like in spite of about 4% organic revenue growth the comps were a little bit tougher relative to the third quarter. So can you talk about how you get there, what\u2019s different in the fourth quarter versus your third quarter?","Greg Hayes","I think, David, you are right. I think we will see organic revenue growth of about 3% to 4%, probably closer to 4%, as we sit here today. Again, you are going to see better deliveries at Sikorsky. I think Sikorsky takes up deliveries to about 80 aircraft in the fourth quarter. It delivered about 160 year-to-date, so you get a little bit a bump there, that\u2019s both commercial and the military, you see a little bit better performance at Pratt especially on the military aero side, I think we will ship about 20 JSF engines in the fourth quarter.","And you are going to see on the commercial side an acceleration of organic growth, just because of the orders that we are seeing going into the year. We saw that here in Q3 in orders, I think organic was up 4%. Orders remain strong, so we will see again acceleration of growth at Otis and acceleration of growth at CCS into the fourth quarter.","David Strauss - UBS","And then on the order side, obviously the comps get a lot tougher as well in the [inaudible]. Would you expect order growth will still be positive in the fourth quarter at Otis?","Greg Hayes","Absolutely. I think, Pedro and team would tell you that their order trends remain, booking look very strong. We are still seeing good strength in North America. We are seeing good strength in China and even Europe is recovering. Again, I think as Jay noted before, if you take out that big U.K. Crossrail order for Q3 of last year I think orders actually grew about 12% there. So the economies are recovering and commercial construction seems to be at the leading edge of the recovery here.","The one caveat I would say is Asia, outside of China has not been so great. India has been down, Japan, Korea, Australia. So that may be the dampener on the growth story in the fourth quarter, but we still expect solid orders growth. Same with CCS, again Transicold had a huge quarter. The orders were up 70% in the quarter at Transicold. But again that was off of a very easy compare. Compares will get more difficult but we had good momentum going into the fourth quarter.","David Strauss - UBS","Thanks. I will get back in queue.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hey, good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Just a couple of quick ones. First, on the commercial, the spares piece, I wonder if you might provide a little bit more color around that growth rate and what you saw in the Vs versus PW4000s and some of the other engines?","Jay Malave","Sure. Carter, what we saw as growth in the PW4000s as well as the V2500 and that more than offset some declines in the PW2000 in both really sales and orders.","Greg Hayes","If you think about it, I think on a legacy basis, Carter, legacy Pratt spares are up about 10%, even the overall spares were up 17%. So really good strength in the V. Again it\u2019s a young fleet, we are starting to see [shaft] [ph] business pickup as we expected and a little bit of softness on the 2000. But again, legacy businesses is recovering.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Okay. Great. And on the military side, you talked about fewer engine shipments. Obviously the weakness at Sikorsky on the aftermarket side, but when you kind of look around against some of your peers, the size of the weakness at Sikorsky certainly stands out as anomalous, at least from what we can see so far today. So, are there any other elements of weaker military spending that aren't captured in those two and with respect what you're seeing at Sikorsky, what do you think is making that standout so much more versus what we\u2019re seeing you know elsewhere across defense space?","Greg Hayes","","I guess there is a couple of pieces here to look at. I mean, military aero was down across all three of the aerospace businesses. We\u2019ve seen in Pratt again, we stopped the 119 deliveries last year, so we got some headwind from F119s, the F117, that goes on the C-17 that\u2019s going down and JSF is really ramping very, very slowly. So that\u2019s not a great story, although the aftermarket there is okay. At UTAS, we actually saw a reduction in military that surprised us a little bit and this is not sequestration so much as just some of the government agencies just curtailing and cutting back on some of their spending and our sensors business, which was most impacted.","And then we go to Sikorsky. Sikorsky is a -- there is a couple of things there, obviously the aftermarket that we're seeing orders down 15% for the year, which was completely unexpected and we expected it to be down, but not by 15%. And then you've got again just the reduction of the quantities for the multi-year 8 versus multi-year 7 and the timing of some of the international military which is also getting pushed out of this year and into next. So it's been almost a perfect storm at Sikorsky this quarter. And as a result, they are going to be down at the high-end of their earnings range, down about a $150 million for the year earnings. ","Carter Copeland - Barclays","As far as the Sikorsky spares go, I mean, on the aftermarket side, how much visibility -- how far out does that visibility go in terms of -- as you think about the impact on next year and how that rolls through, how much longer could this persist or are you just assuming that we get down to this level and stay there, any color would be great.","Greg Hayes","","Yes, so a couple of thoughts there, I think, part of this again the bigger ramp that we've seen over the last five years in military spares at Sikorsky was really funded by the overseas contingency spending or funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And that is coming down and we expected that to come down. The rest of the military spares piece I would say that was just, we didn\u2019t see the bump in the third quarter that we had expected typically at the end of the fiscal year for the government. We see a large influx of orders as everybody tries to spend their budget, we didn\u2019t see that this year because of the uncertainty I would say around military budgets and what was going to happen in the last quarter of the year. ","So I would say we should have about 50% of next year booked and we don\u2019t have much visibility into next year as we sit here today. I think that the good news for Sikorsky is that the commercial businesses is taking off, it's been very, very well, ramping up production, the aftermarket is picking up, but of unfortunately it's 20% of the business versus the [18%] [ph] which is military so Sikorsky is going to have a tough year next year. I think that\u2019s the long and short of it; it\u2019s not unexpected given the next step down in sequestration which I think takes another $12 billion out of defense spending starting in January. So it's a tough couple of years for Sikorsky.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Great, Thanks for the color Greg.","Operator","","Thank you. You next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley, you\u2019re line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","","Yes, thanks, good morning. So just looking at the 2014 framework, obviously there is no changes since we published in Monterey. Just looking at the question column and you\u2019ve got [subsidy price] [ph] commodities in there and no surprises in there, but based on the ramp down in copper hedge price for 2014 and I\u2019ve seen that the price remains pretty solid, what do you expect in terms of tailwind for next year, at current levels?","Greg Hayes","","There should be some modest tailwind from copper going into next year, copper has come down, but I think it's still trading around $3.50 or so a pound, also we\u2019ve taken down the amount of coppers as we\u2019ve talked about it. We had a visit across all of the CCS I think, 7 years ago there is a 120 million pounds, we\u2019re down to 50 million or 60 million pound. So well copper is an important element of the cost structure, it's not as big as it used to be. We\u2019re also seeing a little bit of headwind on steel, which is going to impact both Otis as well as the CCS, but now it's kind of early. I think generally speaking I would hope that that commodity\u2019s pricing is going to move over into the positives as we get towards the end of the year, when Louis stands up and gives guidance, but we have to wait and see how those last quarter plays out.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And if we could say anything about the pricing side of the equation, it sounds like spares pricing is still pretty good, [inaudible] pricing looks very solid Otis seems quite negative. I'm just wondering, if we look at the backlog build that we see in Otis, what kind of margins do you see in that backlog?","Greg Hayes","The margin in backlog has actually started to improve a little bit in North America, again we\u2019ve got some new products out there. We have been able to get a little bit of pricing but again, not big numbers that we are talking about.","And in China we continue to see pricing pressure at Otis on new equipment, not a surprise. Again, I think, the beauty of Otis is they continue to be able to reduce cost of the factory to offset this pricing pressure and still deliver significant margin on new equipment as a result of the scale of the factories and the relentless focus on cost reduction.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just a quick one on fab margins, obviously very impressive there, you\u2019ve run through some of the factors. But the deconsolidation or rather the sale of Rocketdyne Power Systems, did they have a positive impact on mix?","Jay Malave","Power Systems maybe a little bit there, Nigel, but again by and large what we saw on that 290 was really the benefit from the aftermarket mix with the spare parts as well as the restructuring benefit.","Greg Hayes","Yeah. Keep in mind, when we took Rocketdyne out we restated the numbers for last year and this year. So the year-over-year doesn\u2019t really have any impact on those discontinued ops.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Good point. Yeah. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Just back to Otis, Greg, just speaking about the South Carolina factory disruption? Can you quantify how much of that kind of played into the Q3 margins and as you look into Q4, obviously the guide kind of speaks for itself? Do you think that fully encompasses the kind of correcting issues and you have that behind you by the end of the year?","Greg Hayes","It\u2019s not going to be completely behind us, Jeff, by the end of the year. I would tell you in the quarter the impact was less than $15 million, let\u2019s call the penny a share from the disruption at Florence.","At the same time, I think they are making good progress. They took overdue from 1,000 units at the end of the second quarter down to about 350 million -- 350 units rather at the end of Q3. Hope they get the overdue all out of the door by the end of the year. But some of the root cause issues, some of the systems issues and some of the other factory issues that we have seen today are still going to take some time to work through.","Having said that, I think, what we are not going to see is a repeat next year all of the additional costs. We kept in the Gallos plant open for additional six months or so this year. That\u2019s close as of the end of September. So that\u2019s going to be tailwind for next year.","I think, the strategy is going to work. We want to have all of the CLC, all the engineering, all the manufacturing, all the procurement all at one place down in Florence. The work force is coming up to speed. It\u2019s getting better. It\u2019s just going to take some time. But I don\u2019t think we are going to see a full run rate savings that we had expected until probably towards the end of next year there.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","So we should have a non-repeat of at least kind of $50 million of costs?","Greg Hayes","Yes. I think that\u2019s probably the best way to think. We probably won\u2019t see big year-over-year savings ex that $50 million of costs that won\u2019t repeat. This \u2013 that\u2019s pretty significantly at Otis.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","I just wondered on CapEx also in aggregate. I don\u2019t think you said 1.6 to 1.7 before, I think it was 1.7. Not to split hairs, but are you finding ways to kind of bend the curve a little a bit on that CapEx bubble and what do you think about next year?","Greg Hayes","Yes. So year-to-date, we spent a little over $1 billion on CapEx. So I think we spent $383 million in the quarter, that\u2019s up $65 million. We are trying to, as you say, bend over that curve. I think we are trying to keep that number closer to 1.6 and 1.7, a 75% of that spend is at the Aero units and really goes to the ramp up that we are going to see in production. We have got the 5 GTF engines. We have the big ramp up of UTAS and the consolidation of the Goodrich Hamilton businesses.","So there is pressure on CapEx. So I think next year it will probably be the peak year which could even be up from what we are seeing this year. So, we are doing we can to try and push this capital under the supply chain. We are looking at partners for much of this work. We are doing a lot of things, I think to try and address this. But the bottom line is, there is a lot of CapEx coming in the fourth quarter of this year, you will see even more next year.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And then finally, can you just give us a little more color on the European building-related businesses both Otis and CC. I think, Jay said field weakness in the Fire and Security organization but equipment orders, I guess, were better at Otis. Just a little more color on the lay of the land there and how things are playing?","Jay Malave","Sure, Jeff. Let me -- I\u2019ll go through sales and I\u2019ll do orders. At CCS, commercial HVAC was down low single digits, Fire and Security was down low single digits and the products were down slightly and the field was down low single digits. Commercial refrigeration was up slightly.","Switching over to orders at CCS, commercial HVAC was up mid-teens and commercial refrigeration was up low single digits. As far as Otis as we said, sales were actually up in the quarter low single digits and orders were down high single digits, but for that big order last year. And again as both Greg and I mentioned, excluding these big one-time orders, it would have been up 12%.","Greg Hayes","If you think about it, it really -- I mean, it looks as if we are positioning for improvement here as we go into the fourth quarter then to next year as we deliver on this. So it\u2019s been a tough year, but we do see signs of stabilization, it\u2019s not getting worse. CCS, I think, we were down 2% a quarter, but again the orders would indicate that there should be recovery here in Europe, although we\u2019re not going to count on a whole lot as we go into next year. At least we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get worse.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you very much.","Greg Hayes","Thanks.","Operator","","The next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. The line is open.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. More on housekeeping side of things for a moment. Greg, first, R&D for the year continues to trend up. How do you see that flowing out from here? I mean, you talk about a lot of work on GTF and we think you are getting closer to a peak on that?","Greg Hayes","The GTF actually did peak. I think what you saw at Pratt was that E&D was actually flat in the quarter. We were down $50 million year-to-date. You are going to see a further reduction in the fourth quarter at Pratt as engines get certified and we complete much of the testing.","A whole growth in third quarter E&D was at the legacy Goodrich. It\u2019s just the fact that we had Goodrich, it was up $40 million year-over-year, so I think we are right on the plan that we had expected. In fact, Pratt we had said down 75 probably closer to down 100, which will help fourth quarter margins.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","I have never gotten a tax rate right this year\u2026","Greg Hayes","Me either.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","But you find things that sort of help matters. So how do you think about a normalized tax rate? I mean I recognize that some of that will be a function of repatriation and every other credit one can find.","Greg Hayes","Yes. I think there is a normalized rate with the tax law as it stands today. I will be very specific there. It should be around 29%. The fear of course is the tax law changes next year and when we lose some of the benefits from the tax extenders like the R&D, tax credit and the CFC look through rules and everyone wants to put upward pressure between a point and a point and a half on the race. So, if you think about next year and we are keeping probably a 30.5% tax rate unless by some miracle the folks in Washington to get those tax extenders passed. But I think that\u2019s unlikely that anything is going to happen down there this year yet.","Howard Guguel - Jefferies","And then finally, you talk about restructuring, I think you said $150 million in the final quarter of the year. Can you sort of, can you outline a bit where you plan to target it and how are you anticipating capturing some gains?","Greg Hayes","But there is obviously a few things out there in terms of the gains. There is probably a little bit on the tax side. We will probably get another couple of one-time items there that will help fund some of these restructuring. But I\u2019m not counting on it. The fact is most of the restructuring in Q4 is actually going to go to Pratt, as they are again preparing for the ramp up, but at the same time they are trying to adjust their cost structure to the reality of today.","UTAS, I think, again, you are going to see further synergy plays there with headcount and further restructuring and the same at Otis and CCS. So there\u2019s, again, that $150 million is pretty well spread across the businesses. Sikorsky is going to be teeing some things up too, I think. And maybe that number probably wants to go up, and if it doesn\u2019t go up in the fourth quarter, it will go up in the first quarter.","Howard Guguel - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question is from Julian Mitch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks a lot. Yeah, I was just curious about the extent of the expansion in your gross margin. That was sort of flat to down in the first half, up almost 190 bps year-on-year in Q3. You mentioned lower commodity cost in CC&S helping. I just wondered if there was anything exceptional in that gross margin in terms of input costs or mix, or it really does reflect kind of the benefits of restructuring and is something that should be sustainable.","Greg Hayes","So there is a couple of pieces there, Julian. I think, again, one of the biggest pieces is the absence of the inventory step-up amortization. Last year, it was, I think, $100 million.","Jay Malave","$150 million.","Greg Hayes","$150 million in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter. So that really helped the UTAS\u2019 margins improve. As far as Pratt, the big improvement in gross margin was really the recovery in the commercial aftermarket as well as the restructuring savings from all the actions that we took in the first nine months of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks. And then on just following up on R&D. You didn\u2019t put in your sort of outlook for next year. Is the assumption then that it will just track in line with the sales development because you\u2019ve still got lot of legacy Goodrich stuff to catch up on?","Greg Hayes","No. I think there\u2019s -- if anything, E&D should start to trend down, especially on the aero side here. We are completing the 787-9. We are completing the GTF engines. Again, I\u2019m not talking about a huge step-down, but it should generally trend down over the next couple of years, which should be helpful.","Again, there is not a lot of newer platforms, but we do have to complete all the work that\u2019s out there from the Embraer aircraft, the CSeries and the neo. So there is lot of work to do, but I think it\u2019s generally going to trend down slightly.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks. And then lastly just within Otis, so I think your EMEA services revenues were down sort of low single-digit in Q2s, but that was still running at the same trend here in the second half.","Jay Malave","Yeah. It was down slightly in EMEA in this third quarter.","Greg Hayes","Yeah, I think the pressure there is not surprising. Spain is down, Italy is down, but we are seeing good traction. I think France is up a little bit. Germany is up a little bit. So, it\u2019s really the same story that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year and a half. Southern Europe continues to be a headwind, although much, much less so than in the past 18 months.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning. The first one is clarification, just on the CMH. So eight deliveries are baked into that dime headwind is in the numbers for the fourth quarter at this point?","Greg Hayes","So to be clear, the eight aircraft we have assumed that we are going to shift those in the fourth quarter. But year-over-year it\u2019s actually tailwind, Myles, because you recall last year, we took $157 million charge. Those eight aircraft would go out with negative margin around the $120 million. So there is actually tailwind in Sikorsky numbers in the fourth quarter from CMH, strange as it seems.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","So, I was just thinking -- I was just saying versus your underlying EBIT guidance down to $150 million?","Greg Hayes","Yes. That\u2019s in there later perhaps.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. And then, Greg, can you talk about the other operating cash flow line item? I think that $350 million negative swing this year and I think -- and some of it\u2019s the fleet management, some of it\u2019s the total revenue going the opposite direction. But can you talk about the trend for the rest of the year and also into 2014?","Greg Hayes","Yes. I think you saw a little bit of anomaly here in the third quarter. What we saw is some higher costs in some of the fleet management programs as you noted there at Pratt & Whitney where again, we are incurring cost upfront to get these engines up to kind of rebuild to a pristine condition before they go back in the field. So those costs go on the balance sheet, it goes out of the cash flows. There was a couple other minor things in there, Jay.","Jay Malave","Yes. We just had some increases in long-term receivables particularly again in the aero businesses. And then just again some payments in terms of -- on some of the longer-term reserves like a restructuring-type reserves, where we are liquidating those reserves to other payments.","Greg Hayes","Nothing, I would say is structurally different going into the rest of the year or even to next year that I would have been that concerned about.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So into \u201814 that become more of a historical trend?","Greg Hayes","Yes.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Joe Nadol of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. Good morning, Greg and Jay. ","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","On UTAS, so your EBIT was -- adjusted EBIT was down a hair sequentially. And just thinking about this, we should have over time. Sequentially, we should be thinking about aftermarket getting I think a bit better. And we should be thinking about synergies from Goodrich getting better. So, was defense the negative sequentially? And if so, could you help quantify that a little bit?","Greg Hayes","","Yeah. There was actually a couple of pieces of headwind there. And I think you hit on the biggest piece which was defense and that again, both at the legacy Hamilton business as well as there\u2019s Goodrich in the sensors business. We saw a headwind there. And we also saw additional headwind as sales picked up on 787. There is still negative margin there.","We also booked some loss reserves associated with the CSeries aircraft, which again is a very long-term program. But as you first start up, you are high on the learning curve, so there\u2019s a little bit of loss associated there and I think that gets better over the next couple of years and those are really the three biggest pieces if you will.","Jay Malave","Okay. So as we think going forward into Q4, I mean your guidance implies kind of flattish EBIT again. But as we think about that going into next year, how do you think about those various pieces? Particularly, are you worried more that Goodrich defense business was just a homerun for them in the last couple of years of their independence. Is that somewhere where we could expect or fear more downside?","Greg Hayes","Well, again, the sensors business is not really the DoD business. It\u2019s a U.S. government business, so we\u2019re not selling as much as you might think to DoD, although there is some there. But they are clearly going to be a little bit of headwind, but this is not a huge, huge number for us next year. And I think again, we come down to learning curve on the 787 next year, so that\u2019s going to improve.","We\u2019ll come down to learning curve on the CSeries. Sequestration will be an impact at UTAS, bigger impact in the next year at Sikorsky. But yeah, I think it\u2019s all kind of captured in there. We talked about $0.12 headwind from sequestration and probably a third of that\u2019s going to be the UTAS and two thirds will be at Sikorsky.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","","Okay. And then just one more. I think you tweaked down your cash flow guidance from better than or equal or better than to earnings to just essentially in line with. What were the changes there?","Greg Hayes","","Again, I think we\u2019ve always said, we target cash -- free cash flow net income and I didn\u2019t mean to imply that there was anything significantly different. As we get towards the end of the year, we clearly have line of sight to free cash flow or equal to net income. I think we\u2019re 91% year-to-date. Our fourth quarter is typically big from a cash flow standpoint. So, I can guarantee you one thing, it won\u2019t be exactly 100%.","It might be a little lower. It might be a tiny bit less, but we\u2019re targeting in the range of net income, so no surprise there. I think, again, we\u2019re on track to deliver and the same thing with the guidance here. We tightened the guidance range to that nickel. We see a path to the high end, but I don\u2019t see a path above the high end. So, as you guys think about the year, we\u2019re thinking about cash flow will equal to net income at $6.15 and what we\u2019re really focused on right now is 2014.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","","Right. I mean your guidance did change from October 1 to today in terms of what\u2019s in your slides. So, I guess that\u2019s -- it\u2019s just based on where you were.","Greg Hayes","Yeah. It\u2019s just based on the reality. As we get towards the end of the year, we will be a little over net income maybe, but we\u2019re not going to be at 115% of net income and I didn\u2019t want to imply, that\u2019s why we really tweaked the guidance to say it\u2019s going to be essentially equal to net income.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of Nomura. Your line is open.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Good morning, guys.","Jay Malave","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","","Hey Greg, as you looked into this military aerospace weakness, I mean have you been able to sort of get a feel for how much of this could be inventory reductions and when those might sort of play themselves out?","Greg Hayes","","And again, I think what we\u2019re really seeing is just a reluctance on the military services to spend on spares alone. What\u2019s most impacting I think is fleet readiness. We\u2019ve seen the BLACK HAWK readiness declined significantly because they\u2019re not working the hours, they\u2019re not doing the repairs.","And right now it seems to be comfortable that they can take down fleet readiness. But that trend cannot go on forever. I think we would expect to see a recovery from kind of more normal aftermarket levels across all of the defense businesses next year once we get this thing with sequestration sorted out.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. Okay. And then just maybe a little more color on Europe in terms of the commercial businesses. I mean, Otis and commercial HVAC are seeing these better European orders. What do you make of those? Are those or are you seeing sort of a material swing go on there? Or what color do you have around what you\u2019ve seen drive it?","Greg Hayes","Let\u2019s be careful there, Shannon. I think, again, we are seeing a recovery, but we are still well below peak rates that we saw in 2006, 2007. So orders are coming back. They\u2019re off of really, really low levels. So, recovery is coming. It\u2019s very slow and I am not expecting it. Orders are good. They are good in Northern Europe primarily, but there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in Europe. So we\u2019re going to be cautious. But again, I think it\u2019s all trending positively.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hi, George.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Greg, if I look at Pratt, you had big drops sequentially and even year-over-year in the large commercial deliveries. I mean, what was going on there? You had a strong second quarter, but what was actually happening in the third to be that low?","Jay Malave","George, that really just normalized. I think you would expect -- in the fourth quarter, we expect that number to probably jump a little bit to the 150 range in that ballpark and the second quarter was just a high quarter.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And then the 14.4% margin, I mean obviously got helped by the lower deliveries and the higher aftermarket. Was there anything else in there, or is that kind of a sustainable kind of new level margin for a while now?","Greg Hayes","Well, no, again, to the earlier point, commercial OEM is going to go back up in the fourth quarter. The other piece you are missing is the restructuring thing. Pratt has taken out close to a 1,000 people this year in the first nine months and most of that came second quarter. So you are going to see that benefit continue. And again, spares should be better, so that will help. But you get little bit of an offset, as commercial OE picks back up in the fourth quarter.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Greg Hayes","George, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Deane Dray of Citi Research. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Greg Hayes","Hi, Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Hey. On Fire & Security, could you just give us an update in terms of traction in the quarter? What it means on non-resi side and any developments on the portfolio rationalization? It sounded like there were still some divestitures that could potentially be done on businesses you couldn\u2019t scale.","Greg Hayes","Okay. What I will do -- I can give you some data points just on Fire & Security globally. The products were up low single-digits in sales and orders were up mid single-digits. On the field businesses, those were down high single-digits in both sales and orders in the quarter. So that\u2019s pretty much what we saw on Fire & Security globally.","Jay Malave","Yeah. I think this is not a new trend here. Again, some of the field business, again, we have been mostly deemphasizing, but we\u2019ve been somewhat more selective as Geraud said about not taking some of these installations, which is just installing pipes, if you will, for sprinkler systems or trying to -- by higher margin, higher value add that can pull some of our product along, so making good investment on the product side and we\u2019re seeing that traction in orders. But the service side continues to be a drag especially in Europe.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. And I might have missed this. But on the Canadian Maritime, are you -- have you made progress in the renegotiation of the contract, any closer to that resolution?","Greg Hayes","I\u2019m going to be very cautious here, atypical of me. But I would say that we\u2019re making progress although it\u2019s slow. And I think again, we haven\u2019t really started formal contract negotiations. Good news is the aircraft are up in the Shearwater. They are flying. We\u2019re getting traction with the customer. I think everybody recognizes they want to find solution here both at the Sikorsky and at the Canadian government level.","So we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s a great helicopter. And we were just down at West Palm Beach the other day I was talking to the test pilot. It\u2019s a phenomenal aircraft, but it\u2019s just going to take a little bit of time. So, I hope when Louis stands up in December that we\u2019ll have some really good news to report.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Okay. So thanks everyone for listening today. As I just said, we look forward to seeing you all at our Annual Investor and Analyst Meeting on December 12th in New York. We\u2019ll do the same. Last year, we\u2019ll be giving guidance on 2014 and look forward to seeing you all there.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC's website at www.utc.com.","Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and\/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.","The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K Reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","In addition, in connection with the proposed Rockwell Collins acquisition, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement that includes a prospectus from the UTC and a proxy statement of Rockwell Collins, which is effective which contain important information about UTC, Rockwell Collins, the transaction and related matters.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay, thank you, Candice, and good early morning to everyone. Appreciate people dialing in a little morning to everyone. Appreciate people dialing in a little early this morning. I know it's a busy day out there.","2017, a really good year for UTC. We did what we said we would do, and in many cases, we did even a little bit better than what we thought. Our financial results were above the high end of our expectations, and we grew adjusted earnings per share to $6.65, and of course, that's a small beat to the top end of our own expectations range.","Our sales also topped our expectations and we saw organic sales grow 4%, our best year of organic growth since 2014. And importantly, each of our four business units saw organic growth with Pratt & Whitney leading the way at 9%. We generated stronger- than-expected free cash flow of $3.6 billion while still making substantial strategic investments, and importantly, fully funding our U.S. domestic pension plan.","On Slide 2 on the webcast. Operationally, we continued to execute against our growing aerospace backlog. At Pratt & Whitney, we shipped 374 Geared Turbofan engines in 2017 and that's right in the middle of our 350 to 400 target and nearly triple our 2016 shipments. And of course, we successfully implemented the engine improvements that we promised to customers in 2017.","In our commercial businesses where we continued to innovate for growth, our investments are producing results. We gained share and generated solid organic growth at both Otis and in the Carrier business. Otis delivered its best year of organic growth since 2014, and CCS generated 4% organic growth and launched over 100 new products in 2017.","As you know, we announced the Rockwell Collins acquisition late in the third quarter. This deal will transform our Aerospace Systems business, positioning the United Technologies to enhance customer value in this high-growth end market. We also contributed nearly $2 billion to our domestic pension plan in the third quarter, and that plan is now fully funded. And this will significantly reduce our pension-related earnings volatility going forward.","On Slide 3. We're clearly pleased with the results we have in 2017, and we get it, you're ready to focus on 2018 and well so are we. And I think, importantly, we're optimistic of the year ahead. Our priorities, though, remain clear and consistent. We're focused on growth through innovation. We'll continue to focus on reducing costs, executing on our commitments to customers and being disciplined in our capital allocation.","We expect earnings growth in 2018 adjusted earnings growth of $6.85 to $7.10 and that includes the benefit of recently enacted tax reform. More importantly, we expect each of our four business units to grow operating profit in 2018.","Akhil will come back and talk a lot more about the tax rate in the coming minutes here. Let me just focus on organic sales. Organic sales should accelerate for the fourth straight year with a range of 4% to 6%, supporting sales in the range of $62.5 billion to $64 billion excluding Rockwell Collins. Free cash flow should be in the range of $4.5 billion to $5 billion even as we invest over $4 billion in E&D and CapEx.","Akhil will take you through the 2018 detail in a few slides, so let me just say that we feel good about the outlook. While there will be challenges to overcome, I think we have a very bright future. Now let me hand over to Carroll who will discuss the fourth quarter business unit results in a little more detail, and I'll come back and wrap it up and then we'll take some questions. Carroll.","Carroll Lane","Thanks Greg. I am on Slide 4. The fourth quarter was a good one for UTC, with reported sales of $15.7 billion, up 7%, including 5% organic growth and two points of foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 was up 3% from the prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.50 and included $0.07 of restructuring and $1.03 of other non-recurring items.","Non-recurring items included $722 million for charges related to the recently enacted tax law changes, primarily in the U.S., and the $96 million charge for a product recall at CCS. Our Q4 adjusted effective tax rate was 29%, which brought the full year to 27.8%, now that's 80 basis points above our original expectations for 2017 and so that was an $0.08 headwind to our adjusted EPS results.","Fourth quarter free cash flow was strong at $1.7 billion. That took our full year cash generation to $3.6 billion, above the high end of our expectations of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. So with that, I'll move on to the segment results and I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency, as we usually do. And just as a reminder, there's an appendix on Slide 19 with additional segment data as a reference.","All right, starting with Otis. Otis sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, up 3% organically. Operating profit was down 11% at constant currency. Contribution from higher service volume and productivity was more than offset by continued pricing and mix pressure, largely in China, as well as strategic investments in service.","Foreign exchange translation was a three-point tailwind to sales and a four-point tailwind to earnings. New equipment sales grew 3% mid-teens growth in North America and low double digit growth in Europe were partially offset by an 11% decline in China where the market remains challenging.","Service sales were up 4%. Otis saw solid growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up low single digit. New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter and grew 5% excluding China.","North America grew high teens and Europe was up mid-single digits while Asia, excluding China, was up high single digits. This is partially offset by China orders, which were down 7% in value, but up 1% in units with continued improvement in pricing and mix trends, but fewer major project orders. For the full year, Otis operating profit declined $135 million at actual FX on 2% higher organic sales.","Climate Controls & Security sales grew 6% in the quarter. Operating profit grew 12%. FX translation was a three point tailwind to sales and added two points to earnings. Organic sales growth was 3% in Q4 including 5% growth in global commercial HVAC with gains in every region. Transport refrigeration saw 11% growth and that was primarily driven by a strong recovery in container. Residential HVAC was up low single digits in the quarter.","Total CCS equipment orders were strong, up 9% in the quarter. That was driven by approximately 20% growth in both global commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. North American residential HVAC and fire and security orders were essentially flat.","Organic volume contribution in the quarter was offset by pricing and mix headwinds. Productivity gains from restructuring and net favorable year-over-year impact from non-recurring items helped drive 10% profit growth at constant currency. For the full year, CCS operating profit grew $75 million at actual FX on 4% organic sales growth.","Shifting to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales were strong, growing 11% organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket was up 25%. Now you'll recall, last year Q4 was down 6%. The military business saw a mid-teens growth. Commercial OEM sales declined 19% principally due to product mix and lower Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments.","Geared Turbofan shipments totaled 120 engines in the quarter including those allocated to the spare engine pool. And as Greg mentioned, full year GTF shipments totaled 374 engines. Pratt & Whitney operating profit of $437 million was down $33 million Higher negative engine margin and ramp-related costs were largely offset by aftermarket volume, lower unfavorable contracts adjustments as well as favorable FX and pension.","For the full year, FX and pension. For the full year, organic sales grew 9%, while operating profit was down $90 million. Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems delivered 3% profit growth on 5% organic sales. Commercial OEM sales were up 2% with growth on new programs more than offsetting declines in legacy program volumes in the quarter.","Now of note, the end of the Boeing 777 landing gear production at Aerospace Systems impacted commercial OEM sales in the quarter by approximately four points. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 10%. Provisioning was up approximately 20% from growth in intercompany sales to Pratt & Whitney.","Parts were up 10% and repair was up 2%. Military sales were up 5% in the quarter and that was driven by higher F-35 volumes. Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, continued product cost reduction and pension tailwind. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable OEM mix and higher SG&A associated with growth initiatives.","For the full year, Aerospace Systems delivered $103 million of operating profit growth on 2% higher organic sales. So with that, let me hand it over to Akhil who's going to provide more detail on the 2018 outlook. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Carroll. Before I get into the details, a couple of points to note. First, our 2018 outlook includes the impact of revenue recognition changes adopted prospectively on January 1. Now as we have said previously, the impact is not expected to be significant at any of the business units. Second, the outlook is on a stand-alone basis for UTC. It does not include any impact from the proposed Rockwell Collins transaction.","As you can see on Slide 10, the global macroeconomic environment is expected to remain robust in 2018. In the U.S., we are expecting modest acceleration with growth above 2.5%. Construction and housing trends still look relatively strong here. Conditions in Western Europe have been improving and we see that in our order rates. China reported strong fourth quarter GDP and will likely grow above 6% again in 2018. That said, construction-related end markets in China for us will remain under price pressure, although perhaps not quite as bad as we saw in 2016 and 2017.","And we'll likely see a little tailwind from FX as the dollar has been weakening recently. Now in the box on the lower left of that slide, you can see some of the key FX rates we have assumed in our 2018 outlook. The macroeconomic environment and our solid backlog give us confidence in the 2018 organic sales growth outlook of 4% to 6%.","As you can see on Slide 11, for the commercial businesses in the Americas, we expect 2% to 4% organic growth for both Otis and CCS, and that's on top of a solid high base that we have seen in the recent years.","In EMEA, we anticipate 1% to 3% sales growth where we expect significant improvement in the commercial HVAC business for CCS. And both China and Asia outside of China should see better trends compared to 2017.","On the aerospace side, we will continue to see solid growth in commercial aftermarket and military sales. Commercial OEM sales should grow 5% to 7% in 2018 largely driven by the higher GTF deliveries.","So on Slide 12, before I get into specific segment expectations, let me talk about the impact from adoption of the new accounting standard for pension. As you know, this change will move all pension-related income and charges except for service costs below operating profit. Now there'll be no change to UTC's overall EPS, but segment numbers will change. The table on the left shows you the restated 2017 results and we just are providing this so you can update your models to account for this change.","As we have said before, we expect sales and adjusted operating profit to grow in all four businesses. Detailed assumptions for the segments including the profit walks, as usual, are available in the appendix.","But let me summarize these here. At Otis, we expect low to mid-single- digit sales growth in 2018. New equipment will be up low single digits and service up mid-single-digit. China new equipment will be down low single digit, an improvement compared to down 10% in 2017. Europe service business is expected to grow again slightly with improving trends in the more profitable maintenance business.","On profits, we anticipate Otis to be flat to up $50 million at constant currency, driven by lower pricing headwind and the benefits from volume and productivity. Translation FX should provide about $25 million of tailwind. CCS sales will be up mid-single digits with growth in all business units. We will see continued strong performance in residential HVAC business, solid growth in the global commercial HVAC business, and better growth and mix in transport refrigeration.","Operating profit will be up $125 million to $175 million at actual FX, with the improved volume mix and pricing more than offsetting commodities pressure and investments in E&D and sales force to support growth.","At Pratt & Whitney, sales will be up low teens. GTF volumes will ramp again significantly and we expect to see higher shipments at Pratt Canada. Commercial aftermarket should grow around 10%, primarily driven by higher V2500 shop visits. The military business will also see benefits from higher Joint Strike Fighter engine shipments.","On the profit side, the growth in GTF segments will result in additional negative engine margin headwind, as we have previously discussed. That will be more than offset by solid growth in commercial aftermarket and military. Overall, we expect Pratt operating profit to increase between $25 million to $75 million.","Aerospace Systems will grow the top line low single digits with commercial OE up low single digits including one quarter of impact from the loss of the Boeing 777 landing gear business that we have talked about in 2017. The aftermarket and the military businesses will be up low to mid-single digits.","On the profit side, lower commercial OEM mix headwind net of cost reductions, combined with solid conversion on commercial aftermarket and military sales, should result in strong operating profit growth of $150 million to $200 million. Collectively, the four segments will grow earnings between 4% to 6% over the pension-adjusted 2017 results, a positive change from the last couple of years.","On Slide 13, you will see our EPS walk for 2018. The segments will contribute $0.39 at the midpoint of their outlook range. The new tax changes are expected to lower our effective tax rate to 25.5% versus the 27.8% in 2017. And I know that one of the key questions on your mind, so why 25.5%? Well, as you know, about 60% of our earnings come from overseas.","With the U.S. federal tax rate at 35%, our blended global rate was about 30%. We used to get a couple of points of credits that got us down to the 28% effective tax rate that you've been seeing for the past few years. These credits go away under the new rules, so you're starting from a 30% blended rate. Now the benefit from recent U.S. tax law changes is a federal rate reduction of 14 points from 35 to 21. And that is on 40% of our earnings.","So given no other changes, simple math would suggest our new rate should be 24.5%. However, under the new tax laws, there are some provisions that add another point for base broadening and that is how we get to 25.5%. As we all know new notifications and clarifications are still being written and we will continue to monitor these for any potential benefits that can help drive the ongoing tax rate lower.","On the other hand, these notifications and other refinements in the calculations will likely increase the tax-related onetime charge that we took in fourth quarter over the next four quarters. Finally, the tax law changes will result in a net $1.5 billion estimated cumulative cash payment on previously earned foreign income. This amount will be paid through 2026. That's probably enough on taxes, right?","Getting back to the rest of the EPS walk. Pension will be a $0.19 tailwind, mainly due to our 2017 voluntary contribution. On the other side, interest expense will be an $0.11 headwind due to the full year impact of Q2 2017 borrowings as well as higher interest rates. And again, as a reminder, we are not including any expense for Collins-related debt.","In terms of other big items below the segment profit. Corporate expense, eliminations and others will be an $0.18 headwind. And on the slide, you can see the contributors such as change in the mark-to-market accounting that we have talked about, higher intercompany eliminations and some settlements and other credits we got in 2017.","As usual, our EPS range of $6.85 to $7.10 includes contingency to account for the unexpected, it's $120 million at the midpoint. In summary, we feel good about EPS growth outlook with all four business units contributing. As in the prior years, our earnings growth will be weighted more towards the back half of the year as we get the benefit of cost reduction efforts. We expect Q1 EPS to be basically flat to 2017, primarily driven by the profile of the commercial businesses.","With that, let me hand it back over to Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I hope you guys got all that. The good news is, of course, Carroll and his team will be around later to help take you through all of the detail on taxes and pensions and all the other good stuff. But let me just say I feel good about the quarter that just ended, but I feel even better as we look forward into 2018 because those investments that we've been making, the strategic investments at Otis, the big R&D investments on the aerospace businesses, the new product development at CCS, all of that is actually paying off.","And not only will they pay off in 2018, but they'll pay off well into the future. A year ago, I told you we were excited about where we were, that we were on the cusp of seeing returns on the investments. Well, those returns are happening in 2018 and we expect accelerating organic sales and earnings growth with strong cash flows.","At Rockwell Collins, we continue to expect the transaction to close around the middle of the year. Of course, it's pending regulatory approvals. As you saw, Rockwell Collins shareholders overwhelmingly approved the deal a couple of weeks ago, and Dave Gitlin, Kelly Ortberg and the team are preparing to execute a successful integration that will create value not only for customers, but also for shareowners.","Bottom line, though, on 2020 growth objectives is we remain confident. The business unit presidents will actually get a chance, in March we're going to have everybody stand up to take you back through their 2020 objectives, both the top and the bottom line at our annual Investor Day. I think it's important to remember that each of us at United Technologies is focused on a shared set of priorities and that's, first of all, delivering on our commitments, innovating for growth and driving to long long-term shareowner value.","So with that, I'm mindful of the time, let's open up the call for questions, Candace. See what's on everybody's mind. Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Steve.","Steve Tusa","On CCS, yes, obviously, pretty good orders on the commercial front. I think you're guiding positive price costs in the bridge, if I'm right about that. Can you talk about what's happening on commodities and then pricing in commercial HVAC as well as residential HVAC?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So I think for next year, Steve, as you can \u2013 as we've talked about before, commodities is going to be a headwind, copper, steel, all those important inputs had been going up in price, and there's about a $50 million headwind at CCS next year. CCS has put through some price increases as some of the other players in the industry. Certainly, on the residential HVAC side in North America, we see a little better traction in terms of the prices being passed through to the consumers. Ultimately, we'll see how that all plays out when the season comes in on the cooling side, so that's still a bit of a wild card. But I think the discipline appears to be there and we feel good about that.","Commercial HVAC is a little bit more challenging. We are expecting that trend to change and improve and the plan assumes a change in the trend there. Again, prices have been increased. The big markets where we have seen the pressure have been China and Middle East and we are seeing a little bit of moderation, but not much. I would say you're actually pushing on the right button here. The key assumption in CCS is our ability to get pricing next year. We have assumed a net $50 million benefit, but that, I would say, is the one watch item to still observe as the year progresses.","Steve Tusa","So are you assuming any price in commercial globally?","Akhil Johri","We are assuming some price increase in 2018, yes. A modest amount.","Steve Tusa","Yes, okay. Great, thanks a lot guys. Thanks for detailed visual.","Greg Hayes","Thanks.","Akhil Johri","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matt McConnell","Thank you, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Matt.","Matt McConnell","So on free cash flow, I'm calculating a conversion of something in the mid-80% range for 2018. First, does that sound right? And could you talk through some of the drivers? I know there might be more cash tax for foreign earnings. And are there other working capital requirements? Or was 2017 a CapEx peak? Just help us walk through some of those drivers.","Akhil Johri","Sure. I think the math you're doing, Matt, is based off the adjusted net income. I think what you need to look at is the reported net income because obviously you have \u2013 the cash number that we talked to you guys about is the reported cash number. It's not for adjusted. So then you take into account things like the restructuring cash expenses that will be there.","Also even though we have not included anything for Rockwell post close, the first part of the year we have some expenses associated with the integration work of Rockwell that comes in with about a charge, which will again flow through our cash flow. Not included in our adjusted earnings, but flows through our cash flow. So when you adjust for all that, we have between 92% to 95% is [Audio Gap] $2 billion. Also, we have the \u2013 roughly $200 million to $250 million of payment to the Canadian government for the royalties that we had in Canada. The reality is with all that pressure, we feel pretty good about our cash performance. Actually, just for kicks, we did this math \u2013 I had the guys do this math for 2017. When you adjust all the noise out, pension, the Canadian royalty, et cetera, we actually ended up with 99% of adjusted free cash flow to net income.","Not a bad performance given that our CapEx was $2 billion, which will not stay at that level forever and given that we are still investing in our inventory for \u2013 to support our high organic growth expectations. So that's \u2013 it's a pretty good performance in cash flow, same thing for 2018. And I do expect for the metrics to truly convert back to over 100% by 2020 when the CapEx starts to go down a little bit.","Matt McConnell","Okay, all right. Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland","Hi, good morning, gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Just a quick elaboration question. I wondered, Akhil, if you could tell us \u2013 just elaborate on the lower unfavorable cume adjustments in Pratt that was in the release, just what that related to? And Greg, you hinted at still being optimistic about Collins. I wondered if you could just give us an update, obviously some moving things there in terms of potentially funding and costs, but as well as the more you get the chance to look at it, Dave and Kelly and the guys, how are you feeling about the synergy target and the accretion targets you guys laid out? And any update there that you can give us?","Akhil Johri","Sure. Carter, I'll do the easy one first and let Greg answer the Collins one. But I think the Pratt one is a simple thing. If you go back and look at our script from last year fourth quarter, there was a significant charge that \u2013 or adjustment that we had booked at Pratt for some unfavorable EACs and all we are talking about is the benefit this year that Pratt saw from lower negative adjustments this year. So it's just a favorable year-over-year compare. That's all.","Carter Copeland","Akhil, can you remind us what program that was on? Was that V2500?","Akhil Johri","It was PW4000 principally, but a little bit of V2500 as well, yes.","Carter Copeland","Okay, thanks.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Carter, on Rockwell, I think a couple of important points to make. We still do expect to close sometime here in midyear. We're working through the second request with the DOJ right now. And nothing has really come up from a regulatory standpoint that surprises us here, so we feel really good about getting this done. I think, importantly \u2013 or more importantly, though, is the cash aspect of the deal where we had originally expected to fund part of this through foreign cash, we're going to bring back about $1 billion a year to pay down the debt.","We now see a line of sight to bring back at least $3 billion this year, maybe a tiny bit more and a lot more than $1 billion a year for the next couple of years. So I think we'll be able to pay off the Rockwell debt a lot faster. The deal obviously looks a lot better, too, from an NPV basis because of the lower tax rate. As you know, Rockwell is primarily U.S. domestic income and so at a 35% rate that we assumed in the model, that 21% rate looks pretty doggone good. So feel good about that. I spent some time two weeks ago with Kelly Ortberg and Dave Gitlin. I think we've got a line of sight to what the organization should look like post merger.","But more importantly, I think the guys have a really good handle on the integration opportunities and the synergy opportunities. We're going to push for $500 million of net synergies. I know the list is a lot bigger, it'll shrink over time, but we are clearly on a path to get those synergies over the next few years. And this is going to be a great deal for customers as well as shareholders of this whole thing. It's done, so feel really good about it today.","Carter Copeland","Okay, thanks for the color, guys.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Carter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Akhil Johri","Hi Noah.","Noah Poponak","Hi, Akhil. Hey, Greg and Akhil, so you've got a 2016 to 2020 organic revenue CAGR outlook that, depending on exactly where you pick to land in the range of each business, and I guess exactly how you define 10%-plus at Pratt, looks like it averages kind of 6.5%, maybe even 7% organic revenue growth 2016 to 2020. And you just put up 4% for 2017. Your guidance for 2018 at the midpoint is 5%.","So in order to get to that, just mathematically, 2019 and 2020 would need to average something in the zone of 8%. Is that what you're saying? Is that what you're standing by today? And if so, how much of that is the 10%-plus at Pratt just having a big year or two because of GTF versus how much of it is meaningful acceleration in the rest of the business?","Greg Hayes","Yes. Noah, I think you're right on in terms of the Pratt when we point that 10%-plus. Obviously, Pratt, huge Q4 here, a great year in 2017 and growth will accelerate at Pratt this year. GTF deliveries were 374 last year and we'll almost double that again this year. So think about production going up quite a bit in 2018 and then it will go up again in 2019. And keep in mind, there's 8,000 engines in backlog. So the preponderance of the growth will come from Pratt & Whitney in terms of overall UTC.","The Aerospace Systems guys, they've got a good shot, but probably towards the lower end of the range there in terms of organic growth that we laid out. Obviously, the loss of the 777 landing gear was important in 2017 that cost some four points of growth. But they see growth accelerating. They get the headwinds behind them. And importantly, I think they've got a lot of new programs that are coming online, which is going to help. In Pratt, keep in mind, too, it's not just GTF, it's also JSF.","We also have the PW800 up at Pratt Canada, the new Gulfstream engine. So there is real growth out there. This is not just pie-in-the-sky on the aerospace side. And the Aerospace Systems guys benefit from all that Pratt growth as well because they have the engine controls and accessories on all their engines. On the commercial side, it'll be a little bit more challenging. I think, Otis, pretty good line of sight there, but it will depend on China. Yes, we're expecting China to stabilize. Clearly, we saw good growth throughout Asia last year x China, still strong growth in North America and a really strong recovery in Europe.","So again, I think you'll see accelerating growth. Backlog is way up at Otis in new equipment. Service is coming back. So yes, I think we can get there. And then, CCS, again, I think the biggest question mark, and a little disappointed in fourth quarter performance at CCS. But importantly, they put 130 new products out in the field last year. They got another 100 coming this year. The E&D investments are starting to pay off and that's what, I know, Bob McDonough and team are banking on in terms of what's going to accelerate growth for them.","Akhil Johri","Yes. And even on CCS, Noah, keep in mind, I mean, their backlog is good. They've had great order growth on the equipment side, 9% organic order growth on the equipment side in fourth quarter, pretty strong, pretty solid. So I think we do feel the comment about Greg's disappointment with CCS on fourth quarter was more related to the drop-through, not so much the top line. I think we do feel very, very strong and very good about their ability to continue to get results from their investment in innovation and the new products that they're bringing to the marketplace. So things feel okay as well.","Noah Poponak","Great.","Akhil Johri","But you'll have a chance to ask the presidents these questions in detail when they stand up in March as well.","Noah Poponak","Yes, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ron Epstein","Hey, good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Ron.","Ron Epstein","Can you walk through Pratt in a little more color? It was a pleasant surprise to see the uplift in the underlying earnings at Pratt next year. And is that V2500, is that PW4000 because, for sure, we're seeing a pickup in the freighter markets and you guys have a lot of engines in that market. Or is that GTF related?","Akhil Johri","Sure, Ron. I think, yes, the big driver for the commercial aftermarket, which is probably what you are referring to, the 10% growth, right, I mean, the GTF and the military engine business not really surprising just given the outlook for the engine shipments that we have. On the commercial aftermarket side, clearly, it's V2500. They are entering into the sweet spot, as we have talked about for a few years now, right? I mean, a lot of them, the average age of the fleet is a little over \u2013 is about nine years or so. First overhauls are coming in for a lot of those engines. We expect worldwide shop visits to be around 10% growth in 2018.","And that's what drives a lot of that commercial aftermarket assumption. On the OE side, I would tell you this. I think it's \u2013 Pratt is finally back in the large commercial engine \u2013 large engine business. If you look at overall production for next year, I think, finally, we will be over 1,000 large engines. This was last achieved by Pratt in the early 1980s. So it's a long time coming, but we are finally there and that number will only continue to grow as we look forward. So we feel really good about.","And then the third element of Pratt is the Pratt Canada business. And not just because of the PW800 that Greg referred to, we expect to see engine shipments to start growing in the other small engine segments as well. The helicopter market is bottoming out and hopefully starts to improve. There is an improving sentiment about the business jet market. We'll see whether that turns around or not, but we certainly have a market share gain with the Gulfstream. So I think it's all feeling like it's coming together, and this is an often used phrase, but it feels like Pratt is firing on all cylinders.","Ron Epstein","And at Pratt, I mean, is this year going to be the peak in the headwind for the GTF? Is that how we should be thinking about it? And what will that headwind be?","Akhil Johri","Yes, we've talked about the 2018 as the headwind \u2013 as the peak year for negative engine margin headwind on a year-over-year basis and in terms of absolute numbers and that number is going to be approximately $1.1 billion, as we have said before, right? So it will be the peak. In 2019, the volume increases will be there, but that'll be offset by the cost reduction benefits.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thank you very much, Akhil.","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on the portfolio update. As you think about the Collins transaction nearing and tax reform changes, how do you think about the portfolio from here? Any divestments needed to delever? If you could give some color there?","Greg Hayes","Yes. We've talked about we'll look at the portfolio post Rockwell and our thinking really hasn't changed there. I would tell you, with tax reform, the ability to delever is significantly enhanced just with having access to our foreign cash without having to pay a second toll tax on it. So I wouldn't think there is anything out there that we have to divest as a part of our deleveraging scheme. At the same time, I would tell you we're continuing to look at the entire portfolio, things that makes sense, things that don't make sense and we'll continue to evaluate what we're going to do longer term. Right now, of course, the focus is on getting it closed, getting it financed and then we'll come back to you guys with, I think, a more detailed look at everything.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Greg Hayes","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Just a couple of quick things here for me. Just first on Otis, China, particularly. I guess it still isn't really clear if pricing has stabilized there. But can you give a little bit of color of how you see the year playing out, Otis China price specifically? And then I was also wondering, on CCS, it looks like there was a recall in the fourth quarter. What does that relate to? Is that some legacy products or something new? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Akhil Johri","So on the Otis part, Otis China, again, I think you are referring to the disconnect between the dollar value in orders of down 7% and units up one point. That's \u2013 the eight-point difference is very consistent with what we have reported the last couple of quarters. The difference, Jeff, this time was that when we look \u2013 when we typically break that gap between three pieces, price, mix and major projects, right, because major projects can have a significant impact. They come with higher dollar value with fewer units. This quarter, for the same time, major projects more than explained the entire eight-point disconnect.","So price\/mix was actually slightly positive for the first time in many, many quarters that we have seen that. That's a change in trend that we are hoping will continue. Now one quarter doesn't make a trend, you'll remind me, but it\u2019s the beginning, and we hope that continues. That's what the assumption is in the plan, that pricing stabilizes and becomes slightly positive as we go forward for China. Obviously, because of the negative price\/mix in the backlog, the sales in 2018 will still have some negative impacts coming through as well the margins, which is why we have forecasted China to be down slightly low single-digit in the new equipment sales next year. But the order trends more encouraging in Q4 even in China than what we have seen historically.","Greg Hayes","On the CCS side, Jeff, that\u2019s the fire extinguisher, the Kidde U.S. fire extinguisher recall. You\u2019ll recall that we started talking about this. In the third quarter, we took a small charge at CCS for what we thought was the amount of the recall. But as the quarter progressed, what we saw was a much higher return rate than we have seen historically. A lot of these fire extinguishers are not just sold to consumers, but also to businesses and the businesses, be it the Coast Guard or the police, have a much higher return rate than what consumers typically do.","And so as the quarter progressed and we saw the return rates spiking significantly, we took another look at the reserve for that and we booked what we think is the \u2013 is an adequate reserve we\u2019ll see over time here. But hopefully, this is behind us now in terms of the financial impact of this fire extinguisher recall. Remember, these go back 20-some years. So while it\u2019s a big number in the context of the business, over some 20 years of production, it\u2019s not that significant. It\u2019s still a very profitable business long term. And we did the right thing here in terms of the product recall with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We\u2019ve gone out, we\u2019ve advertised to get these things back and just trying to correct what was unfortunately a manufacturing error.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Greg Hayes","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Greg, you had talked a little bit about the Rockwell Collins transaction and the discussions with the regulators. When this was first announced, certainly the large OEMs were saying they didn\u2019t see a lot of benefit from it, which clearly was a negotiating tactic. They have been talking a lot about that, so can we read that as you\u2019ve come to some agreement in terms of concessions? And anything you can add about how the OEMs are viewing the transaction now?","Greg Hayes","Well, Sam, we have clearly been talking to both the OEMs as well as to the airlines about the benefits of the deal. It\u2019s no surprise, I think the big OEMs are skeptical just in terms of what they perceive to be market power of a combined Rockwell and the Aerospace Systems business. But our message has been clear since day 1, which was we think this will add value to the customers over the long term. We\u2019re working with the OEMs now to get this thing finalized and hopefully we\u2019re not going to see big objections. But in terms of sentiments and all that, I\u2019m not going to comment on that other than to say that we\u2019re talking to folks on a daily basis and we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to prevent this deal from getting done.","Sam Pearlstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter Arment","Okay, thanks. Good morning, Greg and Akhil.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Greg, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get a lot of details at GTF in March. But maybe you could just give us some additional color of how you\u2019re seeing the production going, the fixes that are being put in place and obviously thoughts on maybe spare engine volume in 2018. Thanks.","Greg Hayes","Yes, it\u2019s good question and I\u2019m noting this is, I think, the ninth question and the first one on GTF, so that\u2019s a significant improvement as we\u2019ve seen in the field on the GTF, I might add. So just put it in context, we\u2019ve got about 500,000 hours today on the GTF. Dispatch reliability is 99.88%. That\u2019s all pretty good. And importantly, the number of AOGs or aircraft on ground waiting for spares is less than a handful. And in fact, we\u2019ve got more spares than we need today, which is fine because as we\u2019d talked before, we\u2019ll be retrofitting a number of these engines to incorporate the fixes for engines that were produced last year.","Every engine that\u2019s going out the door today has the two big fixes in it, that is for the number three seal as well as for the improved combustor liner. And I think all of those are contributing to the success or the reliability that the airlines are seeing today. The challenge in 2018 is you will have to do a number of overhauls for those engines that are already shipped. That\u2019s in the plan. We think we\u2019ve got adequate capacity to do that and adequate spares. We had more than 40 extra spares \u2013 40 spares at the end of the year. We\u2019ll make more this year, but we certainly won\u2019t make them at the same ratio that we did last year as you double in production. You\u2019re going to see a huge ramp-up in \u2013 at Airbus as well as increase at Bombardier. So I feel pretty good about the GTF today.","Akhil Johri","Yes. And keep in mind, with the fuel burn benefit that GTF provides, which is substantial, I mean, the airlines are seeing significant benefit. And with the fuel prices rising, which is a concern that we keep reading about nowadays, I think that\u2019s \u2013 even makes it an even more attractive engine to have on the aircraft. So I think it\u2019s all helped.","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think the one word that I would say summarizes the success of the GTF is Delta. The fact is Delta showed high confidence in the Bob Leduc and the Pratt team in selecting the engine in December to power their A321 fleet. Delta is a very sophisticated customer with Delta TechOps. They wouldn\u2019t have selected it if they didn\u2019t think it was the right engine with all the attributes that we\u2019ve been talking about with fuel burn and noise and reliability.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the color. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Winoker of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning, Greg, Akhil, Carroll. Greg, love to get a sense for where service attachment rates are for Otis these days in China and where you see that trending. And then if you could also kind of clarify your comment or Akhil\u2019s comment that your disappointment on CCS in the drop-through, was that mostly the product recall related? Was it price raws time frame and lag or factory absorption? What were your concerns thereto?","Akhil Johri","So first one, Steve, on the China conversion rates, we saw some improvement there. The rate now \u2013 as you know, it, for a long time had been in the low 30s. We ended 2017 with a 39% conversion rate, which was encouraging. But that\u2019s, for the long time, we have said, look, it\u2019ll be a slow progress. It is not going to overnight go back to the Western phenomena of above 80% conversion. And what we mean by conversion is new equipments coming off warranty and getting into a service contract.","So encouraging sign of progress, but it is going to be that level of progress every year as we continued to focus on more and more service in China. With regard to CCS, I think the comment Greg made, the disappointment, it was largely the mix factor that we didn\u2019t see can change that dramatically. There were also a couple of issues with our new products in the commercial refrigeration space where we were expecting cost reductions to come in at a faster rate, but unfortunately the factory performance was a little short of our expectations and we ended up having \u2013 not seeing the level of cost reduction that had been anticipated in that business. But it was more about that and a little less improvement in pricing, particularly on commercial HVAC. So I think those three factors are what ended up to the disappointment in the CCS numbers, as Greg referred to earlier.","Steven Winoker","And was that specifically Linde factories on the commercial refrigerator or was it someplace else? Or it was on the transport side, right?","Greg Hayes","No, it was primarily the old Linde business and it was just additional volume coming through the factories. We just couldn\u2019t get folks \u2013 not surprisingly, we moved the factories to Czech Republic a number of years ago and unemployment there is about 2%. We had a hard time getting people into the factories to build the product, and as a result, the costs were just higher than what we expected. On the container side, I think we had some adverse mix, but really it was the commercial refrigeration, the factory performance, that really wasn\u2019t up to expectations.","Akhil Johri","Right. And keep in mind, commercial refrigeration in Europe, the Linde business you talk about, Steve, is just about $1 billion of the total $17 billion, $18 billion that CCS has. So other factory performance, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Collierville or Indianapolis, all going extremely well. So it\u2019s not a systemic issue, it was just a lot of orders coming in and new products and that cost reduction not happening at the pace we expected or wanted.","Steven Winoker","Okay, sounds real and not a problem to have. Thanks, guys. Be in touch.","Akhil Johri","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So Akhil, you did a great job of explaining the difference in the tax rate. Given that, presumably, you have to pay something for repatriation 8%, you get bonus depreciation, what is the all-in cash flow impact of the tax law change on 2018?","Akhil Johri","Not a huge number, Cai, for a variety of reasons, right, in 2018. For the entire period over through 2026, we will have a $1.5 billion net payment that we have talked about. But a small portion of that \u2013 as you know, there is a graded payment that the government has allowed. And net of any credits that we get, the impact in 2018 is not meaningful, not that significant.","Cai Von Rumohr","Got it. And then you said you were going to bring $3-plus billion back. I mean, given that you have $7.5 billion to $8 billion abroad, how come not bring back more so you can whack more of the Collins debt? And given that you are bringing some back and can do that, does this bring you closer to the point at which, I think you guys once said, you might consider breaking up the company?","Akhil Johri","Well, let me answer the first one. The $8 billion of cash that you referred to, keep in mind that lot of that is related to our partners that we have, particularly in China, that Otis and Carrier has. So not that entire amount of cash, even though it shows up on our balance sheet, is not our cash per se. There is minority partner share in that cash, which belongs to them obviously. Also, through the Pratt joint ventures or collaboration agreements that we have, there is a significant amount of cash that is due to our collaboration partners that is sitting overseas as well. And then there are constraints that we have to look at such as withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions, et cetera.","So our tax and treasury guys work very closely together to try and optimize the most cost-effective way of bringing the cash back. At this point, we believe we can do $3 billion out of the $8 billion. Now we'll continue to push that and hopefully we can do more than that. But at this point, it's safe to assume $3 billion, at least that's the good news of the tax reform. The other point is that not only about the cash that is on the balance sheet today, but the access to cash as we generate going forward and being able to bring that back is what will help us delever faster than what we had originally anticipated.","So we'll be able to access cash. We generate over $3 billion internationally every year and that \u2013 having the ability to bring some of that cash back would be very meaningful from that perspective. With regard to the portfolio question, look, nothing has changed with regard to our thinking that we have discussed with you guys periodically and often. We will continue to look at all the options. We'll continue to look at that. But the first priority is to close Rockwell, get the synergies, get the integration done and delever so we can get back to our A rating before we have any conversation of any meaning on portfolio.","Cai Von Rumohr","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Doug Harned","Thank you, good morning. I wanted to go back to the GTF, a second question on it. Now that you're getting the fixes in place and you look forward, obviously the incident has been \u2013 it\u2019s been a challenging start. When you think about the aftermarket going forward, can you talk about how you see the profitability of that aftermarket over the next couple of years relative to your expectations? And given that these are going to be heavily on fleet management programs, when should we start seeing a material positive cash impact coming off of the aftermarket for the GTF?","Greg Hayes","First of all, Doug, I think the GTF aftermarket, right, these engines will be out there for 20 or 25 years. Almost all of 80% of the engines today are going out under some type of an FMP of or management plan. A portion of those are actually paying cash on an hourly basis, the other at \u2013 for shop overhaul. But again, these first business that we're going to see this year, we won't see any additional cash for those because this is really under warranty as we put the fixes into the fleet.","So realistically, you're talking 2020, 2021 when we really start to see the aftermarket from the GTF start to be a meaningful part of the Pratt story. The good news, of course, is, in the interim, you've got the V2500, which, as Akhil mentioned, probably over 1,000 shop visits this year and probably next and it still is in that kind of sweet spot. So our GTF is still a few years out, the V is exactly where we had expected it to be and the aftermarket is as strong as we could have hoped there. So I don't see any big changes there, it just takes time.","Doug Harned","So presumably, in a fleet management program, obviously you're making estimates on risks and costs and so forth and that's all in your pricing. So you haven't seen any changes to your expectations based on some of the early challenges the engines had in terms of what you expect that profitability to be?","Greg Hayes","No. I think, overall, it is about as we had expected. Obviously, we don't specifically plan for these two issues that we had. But given the nature of \u2013 the long-term nature of the contracts and the costs of the overhauls and the work because this is not a significant impact to the overall fleet profitability as you think about what is about 8,000 engines that we've sold so far, I think the best thing to think about that, Doug, going forward, there are still 3,000 Airbus aircraft out there that haven't had an engine selection on it yet. And I think given the success we had in the fourth quarter and what we're seeing from the operators today, we think we'll get our fair share of those. So hopefully, it'll be better even than what we're currently anticipating.","Akhil Johri","Yes. The good news, Doug, if any, is that in these problems, I mean, with every engine that we have out there, sometimes we do encounter problems which require costs to be incurred on the FMP programs, the good news is having caught the problems early, we have fewer engines to worry about with regard to that incremental cost, if any. And over the years, our experience has been that the engineering teams, along with the manufacturing teams, continue to work on improving the quality and the performance of the engines through cost reduction efforts and others, which will then help improve the projections that we might have at this point of time. It goes both ways, but overall I think we feel good about where things are.","Doug Harned","Okay, great. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","George Shapiro","Yes. A question on Pratt's margin. First, it seems like you must have shipped maybe another 30 or 40 spare GTFs in the quarter. I just want to know whether that was accurate statement and that's a big part of the reason you had the 25% sales growth in aftermarket. And the second is, which seemed to me, with the aftermarket up that high, that Pratt's margin should have been higher than what you reported. So I just wondered if you could provide some added color on that. Thanks.","Akhil Johri","George, first of all, the any spare engines sold don't go through the aftermarket numbers. That generally goes into our OE count itself if there are spare engines sold as part of the overall campaigns. Secondly, the conversion point, I think one of the things we have talked about \u2013 you and I talked about a little bit, is that the traditional old margin rates on aftermarket that we used to get on JT8Ds, JT9Ds or PW4000s was much higher than what we expect to get on V2500, first of all, because there is the payment to Rolls-Royce that we have for buying over their portion of the business, that comes with higher intangible amortization associated with that transaction and there is a significant amount of more engine services model that we have.","So our net conversion or drop-through on commercial aftermarket under the new programs is a low \u2013 is a little lower than what was traditional old margin expectations that you've seen on the Pratt engine models. So both those things actually explain the conversion. The conversion we are seeing is not different than what we expected. The higher growth rate was from V2500.","And some of it also comes from our \u2013 from the engine services we provide on some of the other engine models, which does not come through with great drop-through like we have for China Eastern. We have CFM engines that we service in our Shanghai engine center and that, as you can imagine, comes with very little conversion, right? So it's a combination of those factors is what explains the Pratt aftermarket.","George Shapiro","Okay.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet. And there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.","Please note except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs and significant other items of non-recurring and\/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as significant other items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flows, expectations, and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by re-inserting yourself into the queue as time permits. Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Kali, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better than expected results were against a difficult prior year compare and reflect solid operational performance. So we're off to a good start.","And as a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60.","Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out at our December and March investor meeting. And you can see these on Slide 1.","First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better than expected Q1 results were truly a team effort. Pratt [& Whitney] is ramping up production as planned. Our Middletown, Connecticut, and West Palm Beach engine centers had the strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade. That includes both commercial and military engines. At our Climate, Controls & Security business they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.","The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation, while continuing to meet program and customer milestones.","And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter, despite China sales being down 3%. Also new equipment orders for Otis in China grew 2% year over year on a units basis, something we haven't seen since the end of 2014.","On the innovation front there are now five A320s in revenue service, all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine. And they're providing our customers with better than expected performance. The dispatch reliability across the in-service fleet is over 99%. That's great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program.","And at Carrier Transicold we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated truck\/trailer that operates exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to and investment in sustainable technologies.","On cost reduction, that's a way of life here at UTC. Look at our SG&A in the quarter, down year over year both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best in class versus the peer group.","And as always we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We're proud of that record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years.","We're also executing on the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, that was launched late last year. On top of that we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017.","As always we remain focused on what we can control. And this means driving productivity, while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and of course increase shareowner value.","Across the business we continue to achieve significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the portfolio well. At Pratt as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the neo. And the C-series is on track for entry into service in the middle of the year.","On the military side we're honored to have been selected to supply the engine on the new B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DoD programs for decades to come.","As you know we have strong content on new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well. And these innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace Systems.","Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its Onity DirectKey system for mobile access at Hilton Worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone.","On the Otis side in the quarter we installed the world's largest double-deck elevator at the Lotte World Tower, Korea's tallest building, and announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center (sic) [Central] in Australia, which will be the tallest residential building in Melbourne.","This is just a few examples of many of where our investments in innovations are starting to pay off. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results. And I'll be back with just a few closing comments before we start Q&A. Akhil?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 2. As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, in what continues to be a slow growth and challenging macro environment. Once again it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower than expected pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger second half growth rate.","However, for our commercial businesses the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American commercial HVAC was up 4%, and residential was up 1%. You will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above normal SEER 13 shipments. Excluding that impact, resi sales were up high single-digit in the quarter.","Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid-to high single-digit declines in commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration, and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a double-digit increase in truck\/trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA region.","In China, Otis and commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth across rest of Asia at both Otis and commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8% respectively, partially offset by declines in the refrigerated container business.","Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt, where the aftermarket was strong.","On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.","Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In our commercial businesses we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth.","At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter, driven by lower exports. Domestic commercial equipment orders were flat.","Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was down 13%, driven by primarily by Russia. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%.","As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions, and exports have been better than expected, showing some signs of economic stabilization.","At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had expected coming into the year. And at CCS, commercial HVAC was down 6%, and Fire & Security orders were down slightly.","On the Aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 2015 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.","Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year, as 2% organic growth was offset by 2 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis EPS was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges.","Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to support the Aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of four annual payments. We continue to expect full-year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016.","As Greg said, we are confident in our full-year outlook: Sales of $56 billion to $58 billion, and adjusted EPS range of $6.30 to $6.60. With a solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker than expected U.S. dollar thus far, our contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the rest of the year.","With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?","Paul Lundstrom - VP, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Turning to Otis on Slide 5. In the quarter sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, more than offsetting drop through from stronger volume in other areas. Foreign exchange translation was a 5-point headwind to sales and earnings.","New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA, and mid-teens growth in Asia, outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter.","Otis service sales were up low single-digit overall, as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA.","New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA we saw new equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%. China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis, with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong with orders up 11%. And for the year guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of profit decline for Otis.","Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency, with 1 point of growth from acquisitions offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare. Profits were up 4% at constant currency with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3-point headwind to both sales and profit.","During the quarter we saw continued growth in HVAC sales with both North America residential and global commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the Fire & Security business was down 4% with a high single-digit decline in the global Fire Products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector.","Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter with a nearly 25% decline in the container business, offset by continuing growth in truck\/trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single-digit.","CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last year. Globally, equipment orders at both the Fire & Security and the commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%. While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back-half compares and continued productivity, we are confident in the full-year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low single-digit organic sales growth.","Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%.","Military engines were also up in the quarter with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines.","OEM sales were down 12% and 15% respectively at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the investor meeting in March.","Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix, as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of the fully learned out C-17 engines.","As we expected E&D was also higher in the quarter. And we continue to expect a second half spending decline, as we approach entry into service for the C-series and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan programs.","Partially offsetting these headwinds were drop through from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for a similar amount. For the full year we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.","Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 1% with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs.","In line with our expectations commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% with low single-digit growth in both parts and repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning.","Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly.","Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit, an 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities.","Unfavorable commercial mix, largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop through from lower military sales, were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost reduction actions and pension tailwind.","For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost-reduction actions, we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.","With that let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Paul. I hope you guys got all that. As I said at the beginning of the call, strong start to the year. We're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged on the progress we're making on the strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March.","As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We're confident in our full-year 2016 outlook. And as Akhil said, we've got a pretty significant contingency at the midpoint.","So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macro environment remains uncertain. And like many others we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of 2016. And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS, pricing at Otis in both Europe and China, and of course the aerospace aftermarket trend.","So while we considered bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the guidance range unchanged. You know what our contingency is. But also remember it's our practice that we'll continue to watch these trends. And we'll revisit this at the end of the second quarter. Okay?","We also continue to believe UTC is well positioned for the long term. And that is ultimately our mission. We've got this focused portfolio of industry leading franchises. We've got innovative products in the pipeline. And we also have global scale and a lean cost structure. On top of that solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about.","And these trends are real. That's revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization, and the global expansion of the middle class. All of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth, not just this year, but well into the future. And of course translate into significant long-term shareowner value creation.","So with that let me turn it back to Kali and open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just wondered if you could give us a little color on the order commentary in truck\/trailer versus containers? I know you quoted the revenue, but just wondered if you could tell us how the orders are trending?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, Carter, the orders \u2013 as you know Transicold had a very, very strong orders quarter last year in Q1. It was up 24% organically with truck\/trailer in North America up 73% last year.","So on the back of those compares what we are seeing this year is down 24% in Q1 year over year on orders, with container down a little north of 20% and North America truck\/trailer down a little north of 50%. Europe truck\/trailer continued to be very strong with up double-digit order growth.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I wouldn't read too much into these quarterly order rates, either, Carter. You know this is a lumpy, lumpy business, both truck\/trailer and container. Still feel confident in the full-year guidance. And we still have very, very good market share in both truck\/trailer as well as the container business. So it's lumpy, but it's early. So I don't think there's any real cause of concern here.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Understood. And just as a quick follow-up on the provisioning you mentioned, the down low single digit. Just for clarification, do we lap the fall off in those provisioning sales beginning next quarter?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, there's going to be some improvement as you will expect through the rest of the year. I mean our guidance for the year is to be flat. Little bit of the weakness in the first quarter was also driven by some push out of Airbus 320neo deliveries, as you can imagine, because that caused some of the airlines to delay their uptake of provisioning. But we do expect full year to still be flat and compares to get easier as you pointed out.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And the fundamentals are good, right? You've got A320 deliveries picking up, and neos deliveries picking up. You've got A350 deliveries picking up. You've got C-series coming into service. I mean all of those things would point to a much stronger back half and to Akhil's point, much easier compares.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning, gents.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just maybe, Akhil, you provided a range in mid-March, $1.35 to $1.40 [adjusted EPS] as a placeholder for the quarter. It came in at $1.47. I hate to sort of be counting the pennies here, but what drove the upside? Did you see a better back half of March? Was it some shift on commercial OE? Can you maybe add some color to that upside?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Nigel. I mean it's always good to be on the positive side of a beat, as opposed to the other.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's \u2013 well, the reality is our execution was much better. I mean, as Greg said, UTAS was in the middle of implementing a huge ERP implementation. And we were just a little concerned whether we would be able to catch up with the impact of that. And as Greg said, the team did a fabulous job of making sure we met customer commitments and were able to get past the SAP implementation and still deliver on our commitments. And so that was a better \u2013 slightly better performance at UTAS versus what our internal expectations were.","Pratt executed extremely well. The production output was the best ever for a Q1. Again we had a little contingency against that. And then Otis environment \u2013 from a macro point of view Otis came in better both in China and in North America than we had expected.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful, Akhil. And a quick follow on. Greg, maybe, there's a lot of \u2013 obviously a lot of news and noise about the GTF technical fix. Maybe just bring us up to speed on how that's looking right here?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's all really good news, Nigel. As we look at it today, as I mentioned, we're at 99% plus dispatch reliability. I think importantly, if you talk to the airlines, you talk to Lufthansa, you talk to IndiGo, they are seeing better than the 16% fuel burn that we had been committing to, something like 18% better fuel burn.","So the engines are performing better than expectations. We had a software drop last quarter or last \u2013 yeah, last month. Reduced the nuisance faults in the cockpit by about 80%. All of the other fixes that we've talked about are going to be in production by June.","And the whole fleet- the few engines that we do deliver in the first half will be retrofitted by year end. So everybody feels good about the program on the neo. And I think it would be the same across all of the GTF platforms, at Embraer, at Bombardier, at MRJ. This is a great engine.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jason.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Akhil, I was wondering if you could give us a quick update on your cost structure initiatives? They on track? Both from a timing and financial impact perspective? And maybe some quick comments on whether the political climate today is making things maybe a bit more difficult? Or giving you pause on any of your plans at this point?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jason, let me take \u2013 let me start off. And then Akhil can fill in the details. But we're on track. We're going to spend about $500 million this year on restructuring. First quarter was light, only about $62 million.","But importantly, we announced a couple of big initiatives at the Climate, Controls business. That is the closure of a couple of the big facilities. Those as you can imagine are very, very difficult decisions. We think they're the right thing to do for the business. And we will continue to do the right thing for the business, even as we are perhaps chastised by some of the politicians.","The fact is this is a globally competitive marketplace that we operate in. And we have to do what's right for everyone, shareowners, the employees, the communities that we operate in.","So, look, tough decisions. We have plans in place to help employees through these transitions, through our employee scholar program. We offer people a full 4 years of college education if they're displaced by any of this outsourcing. We provide significant severance and out-placement assistance.","All those things you have to do, keeping in mind you still have to do the tough things. And I give credit to the CCS team. I know they're getting beat up a little bit out there in the media. But we have to do the right thing for the business. And we will continue to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to...","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. I just wanted to start on Otis. I guess one of your peers had talked about Southern Europe stabilizing. Doesn't look like you saw that yet in service. And then also they seemed to find the competitive temperature of the water sort of heating up a lot in Q1. Again, doesn't sound like you saw that in China. So just wanted your thoughts on those two points.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Julian. Look, I think Europe was a better story for us this quarter than we had seen in the past. If you go back and look at our last four quarters, the service in Europe had been down sort of mid-single-digit. And this quarter it's down 1%. So it's a trend in the right direction.","We saw growth in our portfolio and the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from December to March. So that's another good sign.","Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and\/or inflation. And those two are still not there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out.","With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rate in value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we're seeing some traction there with improving sales effectiveness, with improving product positioning. So feel relatively good; it's one quarter, but the trends were encouraging.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think I'd also add there, Julian, Akhil and I just got back from a trip to the Middle East and to Southern Europe. We were visiting with Otis customers and visiting the Otis branch offices. And I think it's clear that the guys running the offices have a good handle on what they need to do to stem the price erosion that we've seen. Again none of these things happen overnight. It is good, as Akhil said, to see some stabilization. We visited both the Otis brand in the offices as well as some of our second tier brands.","I mean they have good strategies. Again I think as we saw in Spain when we were in Madrid, the economy there has bottomed out, unemployment is getting a little bit better. Even in Italy, despite some of the issues around the banking crisis, we still see growth in some of the major cities.","So it's not doom and gloom in Europe. I think it's stabilizing, as we said, and should bode well for the years to come.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then my second question, just on Aero Systems, you had a pretty hefty EBIT drop in Q1. I just wondered if there was a big weighting within that of your \u2013 sort of the comp year on year from the contract and license agreements? You had dialed in $150 million headwind for the year from that item. Is that very sort of Q1 or first half weighted?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I wouldn't call that out specifically, Julian. That was about $40 million of the $150 million was in first quarter year over year. I think the bigger thing is if you go back and look at the quarterly profile of UTAS, Q1 was their strongest quarter. Again organic growth was the strongest in Q1. Profitability was the strongest in Q1. Provisioning was pretty good in Q1 last year. So I think as we go through this year, the compares get a little bit better.","This $68 million change in year-over-year profit was very much in line with our expectations, certainly for first quarter. So no drama there.","What will happen is we'll see better results from cost reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the rest of the year, compared to first quarter. And the mix starts to get a little bit better, especially given what we saw with the decline in the legacy businesses in the first quarter of this year. So it's more I think just again consistent with our expectations. No change, no drama. I would say UTAS came in exactly where we expected it to.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per caller. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much. So, I know that the 19% increase in commercial spares in first quarter at Pratt presumably was the big price hike, plus the V2500 turbine overhaul coming up. But can you give us some color? I mean is 0 to 2 still the right number for spares for the year? And maybe focus both on Pratt and UTAS and what your revised guide assumes for Pratt aftermarket compares in the second half? Thanks.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So, Cai, you've got both the points right. I think we had the benefit of very strong orders in Q4 of 2015. And so some of the sales associated with those orders flew in Q1, which was helpful. We also saw some timing related purchases in Q1 associated with V2500 engine, as you pointed out. So both those factors drove our exceptional 19% in Q1.","Compares will be more difficult in the back half, especially in Q4, which was a decent quarter for Pratt as you know in commercial aftermarket. So while we think there is upward pressure on aftermarket, commercial aftermarket at Pratt, I'd like to wait for one more quarter and see the trends in Q2 before taking \u2013 officially adjusting the guidance, if you will, for aftermarket for Pratt.","UTAS, very much in line with what our expectations were. 1% growth in commercial aftermarket for first quarter. Low single-digit growth for the full year, slightly better in the back half than first quarter, largely on the back of provisioning and spare parts. And I think we have \u2013 all on track.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","So you're still at 0 to 2 at Pratt?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It could be. If there's upward pressure there, clearly. But to give you a more precise number, I think let's wait for one more quarter of trends.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Look, I think obviously we're very encouraged, Cai, as you would expect with 19%. But as Akhil said, the back half, especially fourth quarter compare will be more difficult. But clearly, we think there may be some upside. But we'll see. It is early as I pointed out. It's only April. So just keep those expectations in check here today.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Doug.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On Otis and CC&S in China, when you look at where you stand right now, I know, Greg, you've talked about the need at Otis for additional product development there. It feels that over the last years there's been a real focus on cost reduction, both in CC&S and in Otis, with the goal of getting margins higher.","As you look at your position in products today, particularly with respect to China, both at Otis and CC&S, what do you see in terms of the positioning right now? Investments that may need to be made? Where is this likely to head over the next 2 years?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think both Philippe [Delpech] and Bob McDonough laid it out pretty well. We've had to make some additional investments in the product line, especially if I think about CCS, that's got to be in the big chillers. It's a big market in China. We don't have huge share there. Good share, but not leading share today. And so we have to continue to make investments in products.","It's the same at Otis. Otis has got some again decent share in China. But we need to make investments. We need to continue to drive the innovation theme, as opposed to the margin theme. And as a result you'll see. I mean Otis margins are down this quarter, but that's okay.","I think our focus here is the long term, and that is driving more product into the hands of the customer, so that service can ultimately be the driver of growth.","If you think about service in China today, it was up 15% though the first quarter at Otis. So we're getting momentum. Unit orders as we said were up 2%, even though overall orders were down a little bit in Otis China. So we're getting some traction. But more investment. So we're not done there on the innovation and the investment side.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Does this mean that in both units should we expect to see a little bit of margin headwind, say this year and next? I know that was kind of what it looked like at the Investor Day with the margin expansion really coming farther down the line, so the 2018 to 2020 timeframe.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think \u2013 keep in mind CCS still has some margin runway, as Bob pointed out. 70 basis points this quarter is a little bit more than what we expected. But again organic was down 1%. So I think Bob has got some opportunities on the cost-reduction side as well as the top line. For Otis we are going to see a little bit of contraction, clearly. As we try and regain market share, you're going to see pressure on the margins.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","But as we've talked about many times, I think the focus is on starting to grow operating profit at Otis, not focusing so much on the margin percent by itself. Because ultimately it will be better for the shareholders if we can start growing earnings at Otis, even if it comes with a slightly lower margin percent.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. You can't service elevators you don't sell.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Wanted to focus in on HVAC. And I guess I'll put Transicold and resi aside, because as you said we've can get whipsawed on comps, and Transicold and resi we've got the 13 to 14 SEER noise. It does look and feel like there's some slippage there though in the commercial business. I guess, Greg, you addressed it a little bit on China, just now in chillers.","But can you update us on where you're at on product rollout in that business? Do you think there's some share erosion in North America? And how do you plan to address that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. One quarter does not a trend make, Jeff, as you know. I think last year as we looked at the market share trends improving, that was on the back of I'd say some big new product introductions, especially on the big, big machines, the 3,000 ton chillers.","First quarter was weaker than what we had expected, clearly, on the commercial side, not just in the U.S., but globally. But we have been making investments. We've doubled the R&D spend at Carrier on the \u2013 especially focused on the big machines on the commercial side. So feel pretty good about where we are.","But still a lot of work to do. I think this is the one area where Bob has got the team focused. Because look, the rest of the business, I think the resi business in the U.S. very strong, solid market share, good margins. Refrigeration business, as we said lumpy, but still very, very solid from a market share perspective. Commercial HVAC, there's some work to do here.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And as one of the things, Jeff, Bob talked about at the March meeting, Middle East, we are seeing particular pressure in the commercial HVAC business. I think the orders there were down over 40%. And that shows up in the overall numbers. It's an important area for us for CCS. And that's facing its own challenges right now.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just a quick one on Otis, and I'll pass the baton. Just bridging the gap from units up 2% to dollar revenues down 7%. That 9 points, I assume that's not all price. But can you give us some color on price mix within that spread?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Pricing is a large part of that, but there is some mix element as well. I would say probably 80% of that figure that you quoted would be price, and the rest would be mix. But I don't have the precise data here.","But I think it's not \u2013 pricing was a little worse than what we expected, but not that much worse. I think there is always a concern when the market goes down, price tends to follow that a little bit, as all players start to go off lower market units. But it was good to see that Otis was able to stake its own claim in terms of growing the number of units in the order base. And that was encouraging for us.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think the other thing to think about, Jeff, is China actually looks like it's stabilizing. And we've seen some rebound in the residential housing market. As you know that 60% of what Otis sells there goes into the resi market, residential housing. So that looks like it's stabilized. And we're starting to see an uptick in especially tier 1, tier 2 cities in terms of residential sales again.","So while we had kind of planned for the worst, I don't think it's going to be as bad as what we had thought in China. And we should get a little bit of traction there on the \u2013 as the recovers in the residential market.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ron.","Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch","Just a quick question for you, Greg, on the B-21 engine. Will that be produced on the same line as the F-35 engine and the GTF?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ron, I'd love to be able to talk about it, but I really \u2013 all I can tell you is that yes, we have been selected by Northrop and the DoD to partner on that with an engine. But I really can't talk about anything specifically unfortunately.","But again it just bodes well, if you think about for Pratt's military business, really for decades to come. Now we have the JSF, we've got the Long Range Strike [Bomber]. Clearly, Pratt's got a huge backlog coming.","Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe just one more quick engine question, right? I mean there has been all this press about A320s piling up because of engines and so on and so forth. Can you just give us some color on kind of where we are on that? And what's going on with the fixes to the engine to get everything kind of back to normal?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think \u2013 well, we mentioned it earlier I think. We delivered I think 14 engines in the quarter. We're exactly on plan with Airbus in terms of the ramp up that we had expected.","As I mentioned as well, 99% plus dispatch reliability, getting better fuel burn than what we expected. And we had the latest software drop that Bob Leduc talked about in March that corrected about 80% of the nuisance faults. Everything else by June will be incorporated in the production engines. And by the end of the year we'll have retrofitted all the engines we shipped in the first half of the year with the software and everything else.","So the engine is performing well and couldn't be happier in terms of the dispatch reliability. I think if you talk to the pilots, you talk to the airlines, they like the engine. And no bad news here.","Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Yes, good morning, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Just, Greg, I wanted just to go back to kind of Cai's question on commercial aftermarket within UTAS. Just I get it that the growth is in line with the expectations. And I know predicting after-market growth is more art than science. But what \u2013 this seems to be just trending a little below either \u2013 what we've seen from other companies reported. Maybe you could just give us a little color, kind of specifically what's going on in the UTAS commercial after-market.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Look, it's trending about in line with what we had expected. To your point, Peter, this is more art than science. But we know the fundamentals are still out there. We know that neos deliveries are going to pick up. We know you're going to see C-series enter into service here middle of the year. A350s are going to ramp up.","So we would expect to see a better trend as we go throughout the year. Keep in mind first quarter, a tough compare at UTAS on the initial provisioning. We saw initial provisioning drop off significantly after the first quarter of last year. I think that's right, Akhil?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Uh-huh.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so it should be \u2013 a little easier compare will help. RPMs continue to be strong. Is there upside at UTAS? I don't know. Certainly, Pratt looks more promising today. But it is early in the year. So I don't think there's anything to panic about. It's just a lot of it timing.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Greg, I want to go back to sort of something you talked about at the very beginning and said, the contingency has expanded. And it's now at around $250 million. Can you elaborate a little bit on your thought process in terms of how you might want to use that going forward? Some of it might very well \u2013 well, I'll just stop there. Keep it simple.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","He helped us. Go ahead.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mr. Rubel, how would you like me to use that? Should we pass it through in higher earnings?","No, look, it's as we said, as Akhil said, $250 million of contingency at the midpoint at $6.45, clearly it's early. But what that does is it bodes well. I think we've got a range out there for a reason of $6.30 to $6.60.","I think as we get to the end of this quarter, the second quarter, we'll take another look at the overall results. And if everything is in line, you could expect us to probably take a really hard look at the range again. But it's early, it's April. Could you see higher earnings than the consensus out there, $6.50? Maybe. But, look, let's just wait.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","The other thing, Howard, is as you know FX can change very quickly, right? I mean it's only 6 months ago, people were talking about going to parity for euro and now it is $1.13 and everybody is feeling good. All it would take is for Fed to signal that they are going to take the interest rates up here, and you'll see euro go back down towards that level.","So it's April. It's too early. The CCS order trends is something we need to continue to watch as we have said. And then if the Pratt aftermarket stays at this level, then obviously that's good news. But it could change again. So it's \u2013 I know I have developed an internal nickname here of wet blanket. But I think it's appropriate to kind of use ...","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We like to think his balance works at UTC, right? So Akhil's pessimism, my optimism, which is unusual, it all kind of balances out here. So we like where we are. We like \u2013 we think the consensus is right in line. And I don't think there's much more to say about it, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","No, I appreciate the candor and color. Just as a follow-up a little bit, the benefit of where you have been is that there are some markets where commodity prices have been a little bit better. And there's some other cost benefits that have sort of come out of where you are today.","What are you doing \u2013 or what do you ask some of the operating executives to do to either take advantage of this continued weakness in commodities in other markets to help the business longer term?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So as you know, Howard, on the CCS side we have a program in place to hedge through our copper requirement specifically. And we have through our supply agreements, we have long-term arrangements with suppliers where we have a price fixed for copper for the next several quarters.","And based on that we know that our first half commodity tailwind is slightly greater than what we expect for the second half. We are looking at some of the similar arrangements on the Aerospace side, particularly with regard to a couple of long lead items, like nickel and others. But there's still some work to be done on that. But that's the direction we have with the corporate executives. Peter Longo in his new role as the Ops VP is looking at that hard with the business units.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Howard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. You may have addressed this, but there's a lot going on today. But at Pratt the deliveries in the quarter were 9% or 10% less than what Bob Leduc had shown us in the March slides. So I was wondering what that disconnect was?","And then the second part is that with aftermarket at Pratt as strong as it was, it's probably up $250 million with commensurate aftermarket profits, it seemed like the margin at Pratt was a little bit lower, even after going through your comments about the losses on the new engine. So if you could further explain that? Thanks.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So on the EBIT road map for Pratt, let me answer that first, and then touch back on the quarter question that you asked on the deliveries.","On the EBIT road map I think Paul mentioned we had about $70 million headwind from the commercial OE mix on the OE side, right, for large commercial. That included both large commercial engines and Pratt Canada, $60 million of the $70 million was negative engine margin, up year over year. $50 million, Paul talked about, was the headwind from military mix that was there. And then there was another $25 million higher E&D when you strip out FX and pensions. So that was the net negatives in the Pratt EBIT.","On the positive side you had about $80 million drop through from the higher commercial aftermarket. We had about $40 million good news from pensions, and another $15 million (49:14) from Pratt Canada FX. So when you net all that you're within rounding of $17 million of down year over year profit.","With regard to the deliveries I think we saw some change \u2013 slight change in the V2500 deliveries. Paul, I'm \u2013 is that...","Paul Lundstrom - VP, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. But importantly, GTF was exactly what Bob had laid out and what we had talked about in March.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And, Akhil, so at $80 million aftermarket. I would have thought the aftermarket profit would have been somewhat bigger, given the aftermarket revenue. But maybe some of it...","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Keep in mind, George, that this includes the repair side of it as well. It's not just all spares, right? So it has the overhaul and repairs aspect, the wrench-turning side of it, which comes with much lower margins, as you can imagine.","And then there is always some element of mix that comes in with regard to whether it's more of the IAE deliveries, which come with some kind of an intangible amortization that relates to the Rolls Royce payments, right? So combination of all that is what drives that drop through of $80 million.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Steve.","Operator","If your phone is on mute, please un-mute.","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, maybe Akhil, the \u2013 because you're the pessimist in the family. The cash flow performance in the quarter and the conversion, even if you correct for the settlement charge, it did seem light. And so getting to that 90% to 100% every year seems like a bit of a stretch. But this year you're even more looking like you're down the road to a stretch. Is this a really 4Q-weighted load? Or do you start to see material improvement here in the nearer term?","Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, Myles, first quarter was a little light. But it's not \u2013 again not unexpected. So adjusted for this Pratt Canada, the Canadian royalty settlement, we were about 65%. And if you go back and look at our history, there have been quarters where have been 44% and in fact as low as 34%, because I did look at that just to satisfy myself that we were still on track. And we have hit 100% of net income.","So this year is with the Aero ramp, we obviously do not want to disappoint our customers. And we are making sure that we have inventories and buffer stock and all the things that Bob Leduc talked about ahead of when our needs are to some extent. We do expect still to be able to get to the 90% to 100% level, maybe towards the lower end of the range. But definitely towards the 90% to 100%.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think, Myles, to keep in mind, working capital grew almost $370 million more this year in first quarter than it did last year. And most of that was at the engine company. And that's again the back-end load of the production build on the GTF as we do the ramp.","So naturally you're going to see the liquidation of some of that inventory. Bob is obviously more concerned I think about making deliveries today than he is about inventory. But he understands the need to liquidate that through the course of the year. So better to be safe than sorry I would say at this point.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then the dividend raise yesterday or the day before, obviously in line with your implied EPS growth. Do we expect that to kind of be the go-forward pattern? As you accelerate your earnings into 2017 and 2018, similarly the dividend growth would return?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's \u2013 as we've said we've been \u2013 maybe the thing to focus on here, Myles, is the payout ratio. It's 41% with the last dividend raise. So while it was a modest 3% increase, last year earnings did not go up. In fact they went down. This year a modest growth in earnings, dividend rise in line with that.","But as earnings accelerate through the end of the decade, as the top line grows as we expect, you could expect to see that payout ratio remain in that kind of 35% to 40% range, maybe closer to the 40%.","But clearly, we've got confidence in the future. And we didn't \u2013 as we debated how much to take the dividend up, I think this was the prudent course at 3% with a 41% payout ratio. And we continue to look at it every year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Greg, on first question back on GTF. Recently in the press I saw something saying the ramp is going to be 200, 400, 600 engines per year. Want to make sure that we're still on track for kind of the 200, 400, 800? And that you're still thinking 2018 is the peak loss?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's exactly right. So this year Pratt is committed to just over 200 engines. Again the majority of that's on the neo. Some of those are going to Bombardier on the C-series. That doubles next year. And then it goes up another 200 the following year.","And to your point we'll see maximum negative engine margin in 2018. It's nice to say we're coming down the cost curve as we're delivering these engines. Still a long way to go. But I think Bob would tell you, Bob Leduc that is, got high confidence in hitting target cost here. And seeing those negative engine margins then start to flatten out and then decrease somewhat, as we conclude the decade.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I'm sure you don't want to talk about 2017, but...","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nope.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","But just a quick one there. Well, you previously commented that you would expect Otis EBIT to \u2013 Otis and UTAS EBIT to grow in 2017. I guess now that we're a little bit further in, how do you feel about that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, do I think they should grow? Yes. We're not going to give guidance though, David, today on 2017. There's a lot of moving pieces here.","The Otis part especially, because of some of the continued investments we're going to make in R&D will give them some headwind next year. It's hard to say. We're trying it in Europe. We're going to go. But generally speaking, they're making the decisions today to take cost out to invest. And we feel good about the prospects as we go through these next couple of years for both businesses.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.","Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do. Then company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may also ask further questions by reinserting yourself in the queue and we will answer as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thank you [Shamie] and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, UTC reported first quarter earnings per share of $1.39, that\u2019s up 6% versus 2012 and a little higher than we expected due to a little better than expected execution at Aerospace Systems and our Climate, Controls and Security business, as well at the time with some one-time gains. If you recall back in March, we were talking about a $1.30 number that we\u2019re comfortable with. In fact on that $1.30, we had about $0.05 of gains in excess of restructuring. We ended up with $0.11. So about $0.06 of the $1.39 was a little bit more than we expected at the timing of some gains out of the portfolio that integrate the portfolio at CCS. As far as rest of the business, our integration remains on track and we continue to see strong performance in our two major acquisitions with Goodrich and IAE providing $0.21 of earnings in the quarter.","Organic sales declined 2%, partially due to tough compares in commercial aerospace aftermarket and the Transicold business. But we continue to see signs of economic recovery, especially in North America and emerging markets. Europe, however, continues to be a headwind and the legacy PW4000 commercial spares at Pratt & Whitney have yet to recover. So the past could be a bit even, but we\u2019re confident in our full year outlook.","On slide two, on a positive note, order trends that you see on slide two indicate that the majority of our portfolio is well positioned for a resumption of top-line growth, as we progress through the remainder of the year. Just a reminder, we\u2019ll talk to orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. In our commercial businesses, we see good traction in North America. The housing and commercial construction markets are improving, Americans are investing in their homes again, and our North American Residential HVAC orders were up 11% versus last year. The ABI or the architecture of billing indices has now trended above 50 for the past seven months and we see that coming through in our orders and Otis new equipment orders up 21% in North America.","We did see a 12% decline on our North American Commercial HVAC orders, this is on a tough compare and we continue to expect that business to grow 2% to 4% for the year. As I mentioned, Europe remains a challenge, although we do see some bright spots. CCSs commercial refrigeration business, their orders grew 11% in Europe and Otis new equipment orders grew 21% with Russia, France and the UK more than offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. However CCSs commercial HVAC and Fire & Security products orders were down 14% and 5% respectively, so we\u2019re not quite out of the woods in Europe yet. Otis continues to gain momentum in China, holding on the strength we saw on the fourth quarter, orders were up 27% in Q1, CCS commercial HVAC orders were down slightly, while the fire and security product orders grew 8% in China. Our position in emerging markets continues to pay off with combined BRIC orders for the commercial businesses up 22%, in the quarter.","Turning to aerospace we saw a modest improvement in our commercial aftermarket business at Aerospace Systems', spares orders were up 2% on a pro forma basis would strength primarily from the legacy Goodrich business, however we yet to see a recovery of Pratt & Whitney, legacy commercial spare orders were down 28%, continued declines in wide-body PW4000 orders were partially offset by strong growth in the V2500.","The rate of decline also reflects a tough compare to last year and a strong book-to-bill in the fourth quarter, with increasing airline traffic, record load factors, declining oil prices and airlines projected to earn more than $10 billion this year, we still expect an increase in order rates as we move through the year.","On the military side although we didn\u2019t see a significant impact for the sequestration, we do see the impact of DOD budget cuts and reduction in flying hours, with aggregate pro forma aftermarket sales down 10% in the quarter across the Aero businesses. So we will keep a close eye on the aerospace aftermarket and look for signs of more stabilization in Europe, but order rates and macroeconomic trends broadly support our assumption for growth as we move through the year. We remain confident on our full year guidance of earnings per year of $5.85 to $6.15 and sales of $64 billion to $65 billion, that\u2019s up 3% to 5% organically.","Okay, now onto slide three, taking a closer look at first quarter results, total sales and segment operating profit increased 16% and 15% respectively driven by the Goodrich and IAE acquisitions. Climate, Controls and Securities continues to realize savings from the integration, as they increase profit 8%, out of 3% decline in organic sales. And Otis continues to gain momentum with organic sales growth for the second consecutive quarter.","EPS of $1.39, as I said before, included a $0.11 of gains in excess of restructuring. About $0.15 of combined gains came from the tax adjustments related to the 2012 Tax Extenders, which were passed by Congress in January of 2013, and the ongoing portfolio transformation at CCS. These gains were partially offsets by $0.04 of restructuring. Excluding these items, as well as $0.21 of net gains from last year\u2019s first quarter, an earnings per share increased 16%, again driven by the IAE and Goodrich acquisitions.","Free cash flow in the quarter was 88% of net income. CapEx was $295 million, that\u2019s up nearly 60% versus last year, as we prepare for the ramp in commercial aerospace. We also restarted our share repurchase program in January, acquiring $335 million of our stock and we expect to buyback at similar amount here in the second quarter.","Let me stop there for now and I\u2019ll talk more about the full-year in just a second, but first let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the segment results.","Jay Malave","Thanks, Greg. Turning to page four, Otis sales improved 2% in the quarter led by solid mid-single digit growth in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. Excluding the impact of currency, new equipment sales were up in the Americas, Europe and Asia, with North America, Russia and China leading the way. Operating profit was essentially flat at constant currency. Continued weakness in Southern Europe offset the benefits of volume growth and continued cost reduction in the rest of the world. New equipment order growth was strong, up 24% in the quarter with double-digit growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia led by 27% improvement in China.","Order strength in Russia more than offset weakness in Southern Europe. Thanks to the growing order book and near-term completion of factory transformations around the world. Otis expects to see improving performance as the year progresses. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profit expected to be up $150 million on mid single-digit sales growth.","On slide 5, climate, controls & security increase profits 8% in the quarter and 7% lower sales resulting in another sharp increase in margins, up 170 basis points from prior year to 13.1%. Organic sales were down 3%, driven by a steep decline in container shipments. On a difficult prior year compare complaint with weak European markets, partially offset by high single-digit growth in the Americas residential HVAC business. China was up low single digits, while Asia overall was flattish.","CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth, despite with the decline in order organic sales. Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including continued savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security, lower commodity cost and the absence of ongoing losses from a business we divested in the first quarter last year.","Global commercial HVAC orders were down 8%, following 9% growth last year with double-digit declines in North America and Europe partially offset by low single-digit growth in Asia. Orders for global Fire & Security products were down low single-digit and fuel [premises] were down about 10%.","Transicold orders were up 30% and Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were up a 11%, with solid results in the first quarter and anticipated organic improvement we continue to expect a profit growth of $150 million to $200 million on mid single-digit organic sales growth at CCS.","Turning to aerospace on slide six. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 11% in the first quarter, driven by the consolidation of IAE and the transfer of the AeroPower business. Organic sales were down 2% year-over-year as declines in commercial aftermarket and military businesses were partially offset by higher commercial engine OEM and Power Systems sales. Large commercial spare sales were down 19% organically over last year\u2019s first quarter, which was the strongest of 2012. On a reported basis, large commercial spares were up 23% including consolidated IAE sales.","Operating profit in the quarter was down 3%. The impact from lower organic volume and unfavorable mix along with higher pension costs was partially offset by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, lower E&D and restructuring savings. The quarter also benefited from a partnership settlement and contract closeouts, which more than offset the absence of last year\u2019s contract closeout benefit. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney\u2019s operating profit to be up $100 million to $150 million, a mid to high single digit sales growth.","UTC Aerospace Systems delivered a solid quarter with operating profit of $509 million and sales of $3.3 billion. As Greg mentioned, Goodrich has gotten off to a better than expected start and contributed $0.18 earnings per share in the quarter. On a pro forma year-over-year basis for UTC Aerospace Systems, sales were up low single-digit with commercial OEM up high single-digit, partially offset by weakness in military aftermarket.","Commercial aftermarket sales were up low single-digit. Orders for commercial spares grew 2% on a pro forma year-over-year basis, and commercial spares book-to-bill exceeded 1 for the second straight quarter.","Compared with the fourth quarter which was a first full quarter with Goodrich Aerospace Systems' sales were up 3% and operating profit was up 50%. Operating profit growth was driven by about $90 million, purchase accounting related adjustments, conversion on higher OEM and commercial aftermarket sales volumes as well as lower E&D. With a solid start to the year we remain confident in full-year guidance with the sales of $13.5 billion, $14 billion and operating profit of $2.1 billion.","Turning to Sikorsky on slide 8, sales declined 7% driven by lower military aircraft and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by higher commercial aircraft deliveries. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 40 aircraft including 30 military and 10 commercial. Operating profit declined 32% as a result of the lower overall sales volumes. Headwind from the Multi-Year 8 margin reset and higher pension cost.","During the quarter Sikorsky and Boeing signed a strategic teaming agreement support the U.S. Army\u2019s Joint Multi-Role Future Vertical Lift requirements, the joint effort includes proposal to build a demonstrative aircraft based on Sikorsky\u2019s X2 technology. For the full-year we continued to expect profit to be down $100 million to $150 million on low single-digit sales growth.","With that let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thanks Jay. We are on slide 9 now it\u2019s a good execution at the business units as we look to further end market recovery as the year progresses, the businesses as we said are focused on integration and execution, as we wrap up the final pieces of the portfolio transformation.","In the first quarter we closed on the sale of the two regulatory mandated divestitures from Goodrich along with our fuel cells business. We expect the last two large divestitures that\u2019s Pratt & Whitney Power System and Rocketdyne businesses to close by the middle of the year, and CCS should have their portfolio transformation essentially complete by the end of this year. We also had several notable accomplishments in the first quarter that will drive organic growth well into the future. On our first GTF engine, the Bombardier CSeries, we achieved flight certification, while the first A320neo engine completed ground testing and will begin flight testing here in the second quarter.","We also had significant wins across the Propulsion and Aerospace Systems group in this quarter, most notably at Embraer. With the selection of the GTF to power Embraer\u2019s second generation E-Jet, Pratt & Whitney is well-positioned on the next generation regional jets, a key growth market over the next 20 years. We also want a new position for wheels and brakes at Embraer. The combine wins across the Embraer regional jet show the value we bring to our customers and are early examples of the benefit of the Goodrich acquisition. As Jay mentioned, Sikorsky and Boeing announced the partnership to submit a joint proposal for the Army\u2019s Joint Multi-Role, Technology Demonstrator and that\u2019s going to be based on Sikorsky\u2019s X2 technology, Sikorsky also took orders for 15 commercial helicopters in the quarter.","On the CMH program, we continue to have discussions with our customers, but there is really nothing new to report at this time. We remain committed to the program and are already to begin pilot training and we\u2019re going to maintain our place holder, eight aircraft deliveries for 2013. In the commercial businesses, we continue to win orders in key emerging markets. Otis\u2019s 27% order growth in China, including order for a 151 elevators in a high-end luxury residential complex near Shanghai, and CCS was awarded a contract to provide two datacenters in China with HVAC, fire suppression and chiller control systems. So just as you heard from the presence in March, each of our businesses is well-positioned on our core markets and continued innovation will allow us to drive long-term organic growth.","Okay, taking a look at the rest of 2013, no real changes from what we told you last month. We remain confident in our guidance range of $5.85 to $6.15, despite the potential $0.10 impact for the sequestration. The order rates in our commercial businesses are good leading indicators for resumption of organic growth and we will keep a close eye on commercial spares as well as the European market.","We\u2019ll also see some easier comparison over the course of the year. If you recall that the last year Pratt & Whitney\u2019s organic spare sales were down only 4% in the first quarter versus 19% decline over the rest of the year. And Transicold entered 2012 with a very strong backlog in the container business, which they burn down in last year\u2019s first quarter and this was followed by double-digit sales declines in each of the next three quarters.","So you should see CCS revert to organic growth here in Q2. A, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in restructuring, with visibility, some additional gains and good payback restructuring factors across the business. We now expect to spend about $350 million on restructuring this year, all of which will be offset by one-time gains. We spent $52 million on restructuring in the first quarter and we would expect that to be level loaded with about a $100 million of restructuring in each of the next three quarters. Remaining gains however should come largely in the second quarter, so on top of the $185 million of gains you saw on Q1, we\u2019ll see about a $150 million to $160 million of gains here in the second quarter.","Also strong cash flow remains a hallmark of UTC and we continue to expect free cash flow will equal or exceeds net income for the year. In the first quarter, we paid down almost $400 million of debt and we bought back $335 million of shares on maintaining the cash balance of $4.8 billion. We will continue to delever and we now expect to paid down about $2 billion of debt this year, $1 billion that we will target for here in the second quarter and the other $1 billion which is due in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also going to maintain for the time being our placed order of $1 billion each for share repurchase and M&A, so, no surprises. The UTC portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of the megatrends of urbanization in commercial aerospace growth over the next decade. As always we\u2019re going to remain focused on integration and execution in 2013 and on your strategy to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth.","With that let me stop. We\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Shamie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning guys.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hey, Ron, how are doing?","Jay Malave","Good morning, Ron.","Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Good, quick question on the PW4000. I would say they were down I guess organically a bunch in the quarter. Why would they come back? I mean are the (inaudible)? What do you expect to see to have that actually come back?","Gregory J. Hayes","What, we know you\u2019re going to ask that question, Ron. Yeah, look it\u2019s a complicated story, let me try and take you through some of the pieces as we see it today. Right now, there\u2019s about 2500 PW4000 engines in services. And over the last five years that\u2019s come down in total about 3%. And we expect that that\u2019s going to continue to come down 1% or 2% a year for the next five years. So you\u2019re actually going to see some attrition in the portfolio, but at the same time, the average age of these engines is only 14 years. We fully expect these things to have a normal lifecycle of 25 years to 30 years, so at some point they will come back.","There is some excess material out there in the, of engines obviously from some of the retirements, but just not significant enough, so they will come back for LLCs, we will start to see a more normal run rate here as we go throughout the year, so pretty confident, the other thing just to put it in perspective, so there is 2,500 4000s out there. Today there are 5,000 V2500s out there. We are going to sell another 3,000 engines over the next five years or so. So the Vs are really going to be the story going forward and we saw that in the quarter, if you dissect that 28% down, what you see is that the 4000s were down about just under 40% maybe they were down about 39%, but the Vs on the other hand were up about 34% on the legacy piece. So again I think we\u2019ve made this bet on narrow-body it\u2019s going to pay-off, and again I think it\u2019s all manageable in terms of what we are seeing on the 4000s in over the course of the year.","Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Okay and then maybe if I can just a follow-on that same question. So are you seeing I mean relatively young or engines would not [have] many hours on them, relatively speaking coming off airplanes that are getting retired computing with your own spares, maybe about kind of part of the issue?","Gregory J. Hayes","","Not really. In fact, what we are seeing again, these engines have been out there, I think there is some engines that are 25 years old and the PW4 is in fact more than that, probably from the almost 30 years old, from the early 4000 so, sort of the older engines are coming off which is providing service to the material, we also see the airlines continuing to try and take spare engines and use them and not induct them into the overhaul shaft, so inductions actually on the 4000 are lighter than what we had expected just because the airlines are trying to do what they can to conserve cash, so oil prices at $90 a barrel, I think the airline traffic is still very high, capacity very high, you really think that we are going to see kind of return to normal on the 4000s, it\u2019s just not enough engines out there in the fleet that have been retired to provide enough spares to support the fleet that\u2019s out there.","Ronald Epstein \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Ron thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hi Sam.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","The first thing is can you just quantify the partnership settlement and contract closeouts in Pratt and how much that helped?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah. So, last year, there was a, I guess, some contract closeouts that gave us a benefit of about $0.02. This year, we\u2019ve got contract closeouts and a couple of other things which benefit us between $0.04 and $0.05, let\u2019s say, so kind of a net $0.03 year-over-year benefit at Pratt.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then just talk about lower E&D of Pratt and also UTC Aerospace Systems. E&D is coming down. And so I\u2019m just trying to just understand how come R&D is up year-over-year from $5.44 to $6.10? Where is that additional spending going?","Jay Malave","Well and that\u2019s the just function of Goodrich, I mean, sorry, Sam that\u2019s just the function of the Goodrich acquisition year-over-year, just consolidating the results versus last year they weren\u2019t in the results in the first quarter.","Gregory J. Hayes","And that was about a $100 million of that. So Pratt at least come down, I think $34 million of is well on track, it come down to $75 million to $100 million. The CSeries, as we said that\u2019s certified, in neo is going to flight test here shortly. So, you will see a real ramp down in the E&D and Pratt as we move through the year.","Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","The first question is just back on the Pratt spares. I heard everything you said. Could you quantify, I mean your confidences are going to come back. Are you able to quantify what would you believe is the new normal level for this and where are we relative to that? So how much under the long run level of PW4000 do you think we\u2019re running?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well, obviously, we are down 40% this year in the first quarter to 39% and that will get better. Again we had a very tough compare last year and some strong sales of the 4000 and some LLCs that the drop of last year\u2019s first quarter. I think that rate that we saw its down 15% last year, we think that kind of the normalized rate that we saw in the third and the fourth quarter of last years the same rate that we saw this year in the first quarter and that rate should pick up again, we still have the airlines out differ in maintenance and just not to the indications over the shaft, so at some point these are going to come back.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","And do you think you\u2019re still on track for overall 5% organic growth in Pratt spares?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, but I think the mix is going to be different, I think the 2000s have held up pretty well, we saw good orders there the Vs have been better than what we expected on the legacy side and the 4000s are little weaker, but I still think, with the price increase and everything else that we see out there, we can still get to that 5%, we might be a little late to that if the 4000s don\u2019t come back at all, but if you see strength in the rest of the portfolio there.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay and then just one more Greg, overall organic growth you\u2019re still saying 3% to 5%, you are minus 2% in Q1. What do you think the profile will like over the rest of the year and did you expect Q1 to be minus 2% or are you thinking more like flat before?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think when we were, as we were looking at the year back in December, I think we saw kind of a flattish first quarter came in a little bit late there, again I think CCS we knew that the issues that we\u2019re going to see there because of the big compare issue on container, we knew Sikorsky was going to be down and we didn\u2019t expect spares of Pratt to be down as much as they were in the quarter. So that\u2019s a little bit of it, but again, I think it\u2019s generally you are going to see a gradual recovery, we\u2019ll see organic growth in the second quarter and it will pickup through the course of the year end, again and what I am looking at is order intake, especially at the commercial businesses as we saw very strong growth in China but we also saw a growth in Europe that obviously up 21% and North America is pretty good. So again, there is momentum with a backlog it\u2019s growing and we should see that play out in the higher sales as we move through the year.","Jay Malave","Yeah, Joseph, when we did see sequential growth in the backlog at both CCS and Otis new equipment, so that gives us some confidence as we go throughout the year, besides just the compare is getting easier.","Joseph Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning, Howard.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","Good morning gentlemen.","Jay Malave","Good morning.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","For a moment just to follow a little bit more on Joe\u2019s question with the diversified business the way you have, you always have some puts and takes. Where else did you see some things outside of the 4,000 that surprised you on the downside and where we\u2019re maybe some strength that you hadn\u2019t planned for?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, I think there is a one thing I would say; it\u2019s hard to say it surprises us. We knew Europe was going to be weak. The order rates at CCS on the commercial leaseback side were probably a little weaker and we didn\u2019t see any real traction of a service side of the business from the F&S business in Europe either but I would say that\u2019s a real surprise maybe we have hoped, I think as [Geraud] had talked about kind of 1% to 3% growth in Europe this year has markets. Again, I think we did see good growth in truck trailer in Europe and we\u2019ll saw a good growth in truck trailer in North America. But so there are pockets of goodness in Europe, it\u2019s not as dire as people might think. I mean we\u2019ve get good balance across the portfolio. So even if service of CCS has down, I think with truck trailer up. If there is nothing really out there, then I would say it\u2019s a big, big concern as we move through the year.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","And then you\u2019ve outlined to some degree what you think the gains and also where the restructuring is going to be? Could you provide a little more color on that or a little granularity?","Gregory J. Hayes","","Sure, of the restructuring actions?","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","Yes, please.","Gregory J. Hayes","So, again, we have identified about \u2013 but we probably identified more than $350 million of potential actions. And we\u2019re going to see that as you would expect both at CSS, at Otis, we\u2019re going to see some more at Pratt. In the Aerospace Systems group, we have the Goodrich integration, is going well, but there is a about a $100 million of restructuring we\u2019ll do there, even Sikorsky is, as they see volumes down on military, you\u2019ll see some restructuring. For the most part, the programs that we\u2019re looking at today are paybacks between one and two year. So as they do that, as they take out their restructuring to $350 million that actually gives us a little bit of cushion this year, as well as a runway next year. So, again I think, there will be the typical actions, we\u2019re looking to move to low cost sourcing, we\u2019re looking to make sure that we will right size the business. And we know cuts are coming on the military side, we\u2019ve seen that already in the after market. So we\u2019re going to right size the business for what we see as the market demand, especially on the military aerospace side.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","And then your gains you said, can you just qualify them?","Gregory J. Hayes","The gains, I think we had a $185 million in the first quarter, a biggest piece I think. It\u2019s funny to call it a gain, but that was from the Tax Extenders package, that was the R&D tax credit for 2012 that got passed in 2013. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019s great policy to them, instead of us to spend in 2012 and 2013, that\u2019s another story. The other piece of that was portfolio transformation. We sold the Hong Kong guarding business at CCS. Those are the two gains. And in the second quarter we see gains on the divestitures that we\u2019ve got out there as well as a little bit of additional good news on taxes.","Howard Rubel \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks, Howard. (Inaudible).","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hi, good morning guys.","Jay Malave","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays","","Just a couple quick ones, one, I wondered if you might expand a bit on Europe and maybe quantify how much Europe was down on the quarter in the commercial businesses and just what you saw in terms of the progression of orders over the quarter you know, March relative to February relative to January, this seems to be a pretty significant slowdown there. So, I wondered if you might be able to provide some color on that.","Jay Malave","Sales, I\u2019ll start with sales Carter and I\u2019ll get into orders, sales at Otis were up low single digit, sales at CCS were down high single digit. It was pretty much across the board we had the clients at commercial HVAC, we had the high single digits clients at commercial refrigeration, and we have declines in the fire and security businesses. And the orders as we said Otis was up 20% in the quarter and CCS was a little bit mix as Gregg said or as I said before commercial refrigeration was up 11%. Transport refrigeration in Europe was up over 20% HVAC was down mid teens and F&S that was also down, I think in around mid single digit.","But again, none of this was a surprise we have build this and we\u2019re, we\u2019ve had Europe as pretty much the headwind go for the rest of the year and I think said it already in the guidance.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, and we also said there was no big trend change during the quarter, we\u2019re all of a sudden things just went to hell in a handbasket and we think it was simply kind of a continuation of what we saw throughout all of last year. Southern Europe reaming weaker than Northern Europe and emerging Europe especially Russia, being a lot better in probably the biggest growth opportunity, but we saw growth in the U.K. We saw growth in Germany it was not just across the board bad news.","Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays","","That\u2019s great color, thanks, and just a quick follow up on the Goodrich increase you call about $0.18 in the quarter obviously that tracks to a bigger accretion number than you were outlining for the year at $0.60, you also called out a $90 million in purchase accounting adjustments did that impact Q1 in particular way that may that larger or how should we be thinking about Goodrich accretion over the course of the year relative to what your figures guide towards?","Gregory J. Hayes","","Yeah. I think yeah Goodrich did do a little bit better than what we had expected, and that\u2019s surprising trying to under promising over deliver here on the biggest acquisition we\u2019ve ever done, but Goodrich is been nothing but good news for us. And again I contribute that really to the Aerospace Systems team down they\u2019ve been doing a great job integrating the business and got great people. And again taking care of the problems as they find them and that having any big surprise and so again a little bit better in first quarter and I would hope that trend would continue to again, just thinking about this balance works team here again a little bit of upside on Aerospace Systems this year could offset a little bit weakness on the commercial spares, so on the latest business the Propulsion and Aerospace Systems did pretty good about the guidance we\u2019ve got.","Carter Copeland -- Barclays","That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","","Thank you good morning gents, just\u2026","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning, brother.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","","Couple of other follow ups. Just back to Otis the strength in both Europe and China I guess in both cases do you think there is some share gain going on there or the markets really that strong, and I guess in China. If could provide some color on what\u2019s going on in the pricing environment?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, so in China I think the market is very, very strong I don\u2019t want to think that there is been were actually big gain in share because as we saw Conair reported this morning they\u2019ve also had very good results in China. And the market in China is very strong, I think property transactions in the first quarter we\u2019re up 60% in China. So again the markets are lot better than what we had anticipated. We saw that starting in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re also getting traction I think in China with the new products, we\u2019ve got the new low cost Gen2 for social housing. We\u2019ve tailored the products to that market. So again we\u2019re getting good traction but I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re gaining share necessarily, but it certainly feels pretty good when you have orders up 27%. As for Europe, again, it was a mixed bag against strength in the UK, strength in Russia, I think we\u2019re obviously, we\u2019re probably gaining share there, also strengthen in the Middle East, but Southern Europe continues to be kind of a drag and that\u2019s really more about the service side than it is new equipment. There really isn\u2019t much of a new equipment market in Southern Europe today.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","And I just didn\u2019t totally understand what Jay said, when he was talking about container orders. I wasn\u2019t sure if he said offer up. Were container orders up in the first quarter?","Jay Malave","Container orders were up over 40% in the first quarter.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, so you remember last year in the first quarter, we came in with this big backlog of containers and so sales at CCS were very strong in the first quarter, but the order rates started to decline and then we didn\u2019t really see any orders in container until mostly in about September and then it started to pick up and the trend that we saw in the fourth quarter is just accelerated here in the first quarter. So and containers are short cycle business but the leasing companies are buying and that looks like they\u2019re going to have a pretty good year, I think Jay already talked about 15% for that market for the year.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","And just one last one and then I will pass. That if you can speak to resi HVAC price costs and what\u2019s going on there? Are you feeling cost of lease given what\u2019s going on with raw math so you are getting kind of an associated drag down on selling prices as the raw math come down?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, in fact, I think we feel pretty good about cost price. There was a price increase as obviously drift back in effective January 1 so far so good there. Some of the commodity benefits that we see again, its short cycle, it\u2019s been up and it\u2019s down, it\u2019s been as high as about 390 last year, we are pretty well locked in on copper for the year, little bit of above what the current price is. But again, copper is a commodity that continues to come down, an importance of CCS as we move to, especially on the commercial side, some more of the aluminium plate and heat exchangers. So again, I think generally, we feel pretty good. It\u2019s never an easy pricing environment, but I would tell you that CCS is making some good strides to get a great distribution here in the U.S. and good product innovation and that\u2019s helping a lot.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","","Perfect, thanks a lot.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks so much. So your release refers to defense impact at Sikorsky in the first quarter. Could you kind of explain that and maybe give us some color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of sequester impact on the total business?","Gregory J. Hayes","","Let me have Jay take you through Sikorsky and I\u2019ll take a shot at the sequester question.","Jay Malave","","Cai, Sikorsky, we had lower deliveries on military aircraft. The after market was down \u2013 the military after market was down little bit over 20%. So that\u2019s really where you saw the big impact. The deliveries we knew about, but those were partially offset by some strong growth in commercial aircraft deliveries, and I think this quarter, we have 40 deliveries. We are expecting north of 240 deliveries for the full year. So you would expect that volume to increase on as we go throughout the year. So, partly, it was just timing of deliveries, partly it was particularly in the after market, was due to cuts.","Gregory J. Hayes","","As far as the sequester impact, I\u2019d love to tell you that we can quantify at any better than what we did 30 days ago, but unfortunately the customers aren\u2019t sending us invoices with a 10% reduction for sequester \u2013 sequestration. So, we\u2019re hearing about it, we are starting to see a little bit of it in terms of the order intake. I think, Jay talked about the aftermarket was down 10% across aerospace, commercial aerospace in the quarter. And that\u2019s really just a reflection, again reduced off tempo in Afghanistan, but also reduced flying hours here. We see some of the fighter wings being stood down for the remainder of the year, cancelling some of the exhibitions. And again, all of this is going to have an impact on us. It\u2019s just going to take a while for us to play out. So we continue to say it\u2019s probably about a $0.10 impact, but again, it\u2019s hard to see it beyond that. I think the bigger concern is on these furloughs of the FAA, if they start driving the higher cost on the commercial airlines, but that could do the spares, but again I think that should be a relatively small impact for us.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","You mentioned the military aftermarket down 10% and seeing some cutback in the flying hours. I think in December, you were still kind of asserting at least in March still asserting military aftermarket would be half at Pratt. It looks like it was down. So where do you now expect military aftermarket to be for the year at Pratt?","Jay Malave","At Pratt, we were expecting it to be flat to slightly up, not much growth there. In the quarter, we actually saw growth in military aftermarket at Pratt really on the back of F100, F119 and F135 spares, and that was the F100 and F119 was really more of a reflection of the strong order of sales in 2012, just built a backlog we delivered here in the first quarter. And the F135 was more a pop-up function of disprovisioning and we have over 80 engines that\u2019s been delivered program to date, and so it\u2019s just a matter of provisioning start to accelerate.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","","And so do you expect the military aftermarket still to be flat to up for the year, Pratt?","Gregory J. Hayes","At Pratt, we do. I think we\u2019re talking about that 10% what you really saw was at Sikorsky and at the Aerospace System, we had military aftermarket down about 20%. So good news at Pratt in the quarter but offsets by bad news at Sikorsky and at UTAS. I think again the Sikorsky numbers are little bit worse than what we had expected. On the OEM side, we know exactly what we\u2019re going to be from a military delivery side but spares we\u2019ve got a little worse than what we expected in Sikorsky. So need to keep an eye on that as move through the year.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. And you mentioned you still have the placeholder for CMH deliveries. Could you give us an update on your progress are out there Canadians? And you know I mean if you don\u2019t have, you can\u2019t say when you\u2019re going to have a settlement, I mean I assume that the age is going to be a zero until you have an settlement for us?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, like we\u2019re expecting that we\u2019re going to shift those need in the back half of the year. But I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re not making progress. We continue to have discussions, good discussions with the customer in Canada. Again, this is a very complicated procurement program in Canada with different public works and the department of the defense. We\u2019re working with both sides of the Canadian Government. We\u2019re trying to get through a win-win solution here. And it\u2019s just taking a longer than anybody wants in to and obviously we\u2019re ready to begin pilot training. There is four aircrafts up in Shearwater. I think number 26 of the 28 is on the production line down in the West Palm Beach. So we\u2019re building them and we\u2019re still not done with some of the mission software but we are making very good progress with that. So again we\u2019ll get pass this. I can\u2019t tell you whether its next week or next month or the month after, but I still think we have a pathway to deliver additional helicopters and the key for us is to get the pilots training to begin and we\u2019re pretty close to that.","Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Your line is now open.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Good morning","Gregory J. Hayes","Hi, Dave","Jay Malave","Good morning, Dave","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Greg, just following up on Cai\u2019s question the CMH. The charge that you guys took in the fourth quarter does that reflect delivering the interim configuration aircraft or does it reflect you know not delivering the interim configuration aircraft and waiting till final configuration?","Gregory J. Hayes","","All right, so the charge that we took $157 million I think it was in the fourth quarter that assume that we weren\u2019t going deliver any aircraft until 2015, with all the machine system software would be done. So, it didn\u2019t anticipate a interim solution even though we think ultimately that\u2019s the best for both ourselves as well as for the customer to head start delivering these interim aircraft get them flying, but the charge was a more conservative view of the fact that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver anything until 2015.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Okay. So, if we get to some sort of agreement that reflects the move towards taking the (inaudible) again the interim configuration aircraft potentially it could some good news.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, but I wouldn\u2019t, yeah, there might be a little bit of good news, you are right, again, this is, but again I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a big number.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then China, I know you talked about the strength in China overall in Q1, but can you talk about maybe what you saw as we went through the quarter, it looks like you know, January and February start up very strong but then, else we\u2019ve done in the March and April things might have gone up a little bit. And I think your guidance for China overall reflects about 7.5% to 8% GDP growth this year, you still feel that\u2019s the right place to be?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, we do. In fact, you see it was a weird compare because the Chinese New Year was in January last year, February this year, so January start about game busters, then February was slow and then March was even better than I think would anybody had expected, again, we\u2019re, you know, the units were up significantly, good order intake and even in April, I think we continue to see a solid order intake, we just did the operating review last week with Otis they were very confident in the China story for the year.","David Strauss \u2013 UBS","Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to go back to the aero systems margins for a second, the implied guidance I think it\u2019s around 15.6% or even slightly below. So, I\u2019m curious is there, usually that, historically both Goodrich legacy and Hamilton legacy got better the year progress on the margin side and I guess that 90 million purchase accounting that\u2019s something that hit you in the first quarter or to your early point Gregg, how much conservatives in this way to the aerospace systems?","Jay Malave","Myles, the 90 million is simply, charge that was taking in the fourth quarter related to the inventory step-up it just, it doesn\u2019t repeat because it got the inventories that have got fully liquidated in the fourth quarter. So, what we are dealing here, now we just, it is recurring earnings, which is consistent with our guidance of $2.1 billion. We based some of what we forecast, we expect it to be fairly flat level loaded as far as operating margins throughout the year, but as Gregg said, it\u2019s possibly could be some upside it\u2019s a little early to make that call.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah, as you think\u2026","Gregory J. Hayes","We had about just under $50 million of net synergy benefit in the first quarter, when talking about $200 million for the year obviously those synergy benefits continue to pick up that\u2019s going to accretive to margins and again I think there\u2019s probably a little bit of good news, but it\u2019s just, it\u2019s April so we are going to wait another quarter here before we decided that it\u2019s actually that what the upside might be","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, I mean, it just seems like the aftermarket we get better historically those margins expand through the course of the year so I\u2019m just trying get out\u2026","Gregory J. Hayes","","Yeah.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Anything in the first quarter but it sounds like there wasn\u2019t?","Gregory J. Hayes","","No I don\u2019t disagree with your [thesis] still Myles.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay and the other question kind of clean up, it\u2019s on discontinued operations cash, it looks like there was a big use in the quarter and I guess I don\u2019t know what the cause of that was?","Gregory J. Hayes","Unfortunately the Federal government requires us to pay taxes when we make the gain, so the gain on the sale of the industrials which closed in December 15 as we paid the taxes here on the first quarter, so that was the big cash outflow.","Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Yes. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes","Good morning.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Greg, Hamilton Sundstrand had no organic growth in the quarter, is that a combination of OE growth, after market growth offset by military being down?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, I think the commercial after market was essentially flat at the legacy Hamilton business. Military, as I said, was down significantly. And then commercial OE was up, I think 8% to 9% in the quarter.","Jay Malave","Yeah","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Okay. And then at Otis, the margin this quarter was a little bit less than I thought. Is that still a mix issue and where OE was a little bit worse than service and is that change going forward or we still seeing a lot of pressure from the after market renegotiations?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think, yeah. We have \u2013 margins were down. This actually should be the low-point for the year in terms of Otis margins, but a big chunk of this was as we \u2013 we picked up about a point of mix in the new equipment versus service. So that\u2019s actually detrimental, as you know service margins are obviously better than the OE side. So that was a piece of it. Again, pricing tough around the world, tough in China, but we\u2019re holding the margins, I think and we should continue to see benefits. The other thing to keep in mind at Otis or the process is some of this plant transformation. We\u2019re closing our Nogales plant and opening up the facility in Florence, South Carolina. We\u2019ve got the new Chongqing plant and there are some expenses in the first half of the year, which were actually holding margins down a little bit. It should get better as we complete those transfers.","George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research","Okay. Thanks, very much.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, gents.","Gregory J. Hayes","","Nigel.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","So, I hate to ask you this question but where is the contingency now at the midpoint, given the sequester et cetera?","Gregory J. Hayes","","Well, it\u2019s actually \u2013 if you remember back in March, we said that we were comfortable with analyst\u2019s consensus, which at the time was 610 with about a $0.10 impact from sequestration. So, again, there was no contingency at 610. Again, if you go back down to the midpoint to $6, obviously we\u2019ve got a little bit of good news. And again, as a closeout to quarter \u2013 again no surprises here, so, really there is some puts and takes, may be (inaudible) a little better, try it a little worse in terms of spares. But, I think overall, feel pretty good. We got benefit from the euro. Again, we\u2019re seeing that a 128 it\u2019s been 132, 133. So, right now, I would just tell you in around 610, there is no contingency, but that includes an impact from sequestration. And we will expect, we\u2019ll see over the course of the year.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, no change, that\u2019s great. And then switching to Otis, obviously, you have great backlog performance this quarter, but how does margin look on that backlog?","Gregory J. Hayes","Actually, margin doesn\u2019t look bad. I mean here, again, pricing is tough in China, so the margins there are going to be a little bit under pressure. But, again, as we fill up the factories with all of these orders going through that\u2019s going to help overall margins there. So, even though new equipment, the sold margins are a little late, I think we can pick that up. And then in North America, we\u2019re actually seeing much stronger, better, stronger margins in the new equipment. Pricing has stabilized. We\u2019re not seeing, again, all of the, say, cuts or competition that we had. And again, the market is picking up. So that\u2019s good news on new equipment margins.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Otis continues to take out cost, they\u2019ve done a great job of taking out cost of the elevator unit cost, sorry, page will show that in the March meeting and that\u2019s going to continue. So feel confident that margins will remain and we\u2019ll leverage the volume going forward.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And then just going back to Jeff\u2019s question on the CCS, copper prices, obviously down, that\u2019s similar pricing holds on the equipments, why won\u2019t steel or copper price benefit the second half of the year, as you go through this own hedges?","Gregory J. Hayes","","Mostly because we\u2019ve got the year locked in at a price of little bit above what the current market is so the market is I think around 320 today, because of concerns over China, we could see that $320 moved to $360 or $370 I think pretty quickly, but we are locked in for the year so the CCS guidance as soon as locked in copper, no real benefits from further commodity cost reductions, again that benefit, again we\u2019ll see it, next year, as we will start to lock in buys for next year in today\u2019s lower prices.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","I see. And then just one quick one, obviously container was down this quarter, but orders suggest that\u2019s going to come back strongly in 2Q and beyond, how much mix headwind did you have from container this quarter?","Gregory J. Hayes","","Well, in terms of\u2026","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","On CCS margins?","Gregory J. Hayes","","I don\u2019t know whether I got that number off to the top of my head.","Jay Malave","","Yeah, we don\u2019t I mean again one thing I would say about CCS is there, operating margins across the board are fairly even so we got much more balanced, and I am not sure, that it had a huge impact, we will take a double to look at it again and I think we will get back to you on that.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay, that would be great. Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. Our final question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks a lot. Yeah, so I guess my first question is within CCS. You\u2019ve had a bunch of companies Ingersoll, Schneider and so on complaining about how weak foreign security is as an end market right now. Could you just remind us how much of CCS post all these divestments is foreign security and what your sort of expectations off for the year in that business?","Gregory J. Hayes","Just one second, Julian and I will give it that for you. So I think, see here, as I would think about Fire & Security, again, the products piece of the Fire & Security business has actually done quite well. You see pretty good strength here in North America. It\u2019s been a little bit weaker in Europe. We\u2019re really seeing kind of the headwind has been on the service side in Europe and that\u2019s been really a result of just what\u2019s going on economically here in some of the services businesses, but margins have not been very good. We\u2019re trying to be a little bit more selective there. But in China for instance, I think securities are up very strong. We had a good traction with the GSP business. Correct, I don\u2019t know Jay do you have the exact...","Jay Malave","Just rough order of magnitude here Julian out of the $17 billion portfolio about $6 billion is Fire & Security.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. And you\u2019re expecting that to be kind of flattish or up inline with CCS overall for the year?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah I think on the product side, you\u2019d expected to be up inline and then on the service side a little bit light to that overall kind of 5% growth.","Jay Malave","It varies regionally, in Europe the expectation again were flattish and maybe up slightly.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Sure, thanks. And then just my follow up would be, again just circling back to the Otis margins. As you said Q1 you had, you didn\u2019t have sort of the operational leverage showing up because of the mix of OE versus services. I guess it\u2019s likely that European service stays weak and the Otis suggests the OE growth in terms of revenue should accelerate. So you\u2019re probably dealing with that mix hit for the balance of the year. Do you therefore expecting an offset to come from a lot more restructuring savings coming through already, just the falling out of those costs around the plants transformation?","Gregory J. Hayes","It\u2019s obviously a combination of both. Otis is pretty aggressive with restructuring last year. They\u2019ve got more restructuring to do this year. We should be accretive to margins and then you got the factory transformation, which get done really by mid-year. So, that\u2019s all going to be help I think on the margin mix side.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. The Q2, you already see the margins going up sequentially and may be year-on-year?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yeah, they\u2019re positioned\u2026","Jay Malave","Yes.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, absolutely.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes","All right, Julian. Thank you, much.","I will thank everyone for listening today. We look forward to seeing you on the road this quarter and the Investor Relations team is standing by to take your questions. So, thanks very much and have a wonderful day.","","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program.

On the call today are Louis Chenevert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and onetime items as they usually do.","The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","[Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Chenevert.","Louis R. Chenevert","Well, thank you very much, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be part of the call on this historic moment for our company. We've had a full week with many exciting developments. Greg will take you through the quarter results in just a moment. But first, let me start with an update on our major acquisitions and on our business transformation strategy.","Late last month, we closed on the IAE transaction and this morning we received the final regulatory approvals for the Goodrich acquisition. We anticipate closing later today or early tomorrow morning. These are transformational deals for UTC, setting the stage for strong earnings momentum. IAE brings tremendous aftermarket runway with the V2500, which now represents Pratt & Whitney's largest install fleet. There are over 4,500 V2500 engines in service with an average age of only 7 years, and we expect to deliver another 3,000 engines in the future. The IAE transaction further validates our game-changing GTF technology and strengthens our relationship with nearly 200 airline customers around the world, ensuring a seamless transition from the V2500 to the GTF-powered A320neo.","Turning to Goodrich. I'm very pleased we will close such a large transaction in just 10 months with limited required divestitures. Goodrich adds a very strong portfolio of complementary products and is a great fit with Hamilton Sundstrand. Bringing these 2 companies together will significantly strengthen our position in the growing aerospace segment and will allow us to develop more integrated systems for our customers and win greater content on next-generation aircraft. Since announcing the agreement, we have done significant integration planning. So we are ready to begin integrating Goodrich into our Propulsion and Aerospace systems organization. A team of more than 50 employees has worked relentlessly on integration planning with hundreds of employees lending additional support. The leadership team is in place and our extensive planning activities will make for a smooth transition for our customers, suppliers and employees.","Our large transactions, culture and people are key to success and I'm very happy with everything I see at this point. We have already identified all of the $400 million of run rate synergies that we expect to achieve by year 5, and leadership is looking up more. I am confident that Alain and the team will identify additional synergies as they work through the integration process.","We've completed the financing for Goodrich with a structure that was much better than originally expected. We issued the largest U.S. corporate bond offering since 2009, $9.8 billion at an average interest rate of less than 3%. We listen to our shareholders and we reduced our original need for equity issuance from $4 billion down to $1.1 billion of mandatory convertible units. We expect to pay down about 1\/3 of the total [ph] purchase price by the end of 2012, using that proceeds from previously announced divestitures and cash from operations.","We have made great progress on the divestitures. We reached agreement to sell both Hamilton Sundstrand Industrial's business and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne this week. These are strong profitable businesses but we are streamlining the UTC portfolio to focus on our core of commercial building systems and aerospace.","In the second quarter, we classified another non-core asset, our fuel cell business, as held up for sale. And we continue to expect to complete the divestiture of Clipper imminently. As expected, during the regulatory process for Goodrich, we agreed to divest businesses totaling about $250 million of annual sales, including Goodrich's electric power systems business, pumps and engine control business. These are attractive businesses with great employees so we expect a robust auction process. We also agreed to sell Goodrich interest into the air engine control original equipment joint venture for Rolls Royce.","Let me sum up by saying, great progress on transformational changes that will generate real-long term value for our shareholders. This team is executing in a superb way.","Before I turn it over to Greg to take you through the second-quarter results, just a few comments on the year. It is certainly a challenging environment out there, with a slowing global economy, the euro trading near 1.2 and the late July close for Goodrich. Therefore, we are rebaselining our expectations for the year. We now expect sales of $58 billion to $59 billion, $3 billion lower than our prior expectation and earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 versus our prior expectation of $5.30 to $5.50 with FX and the late July close of Goodrich accounting for about $0.15 of additional headwind.","Now we know how to operate in a tough macroeconomic environment at UTC, and we are increasing our investment in restructuring this year to $500 million, up from $450 million. As always, we'll remain focused on what we control in the back half of the year, cost reductions, strong execution, investment in game-changing technology and the seamless integration of Goodrich and IAE into the UTC portfolio.","With that, let me turn it over to Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thanks, Louis. We're now on Slide 2 on the webcast. As you saw on the press release this morning, second-quarter earnings per share was up 15% year-over-year to $1.62. That included a benefit from a lower tax rate. Our tax rate in the quarter came in at 22.5%, primarily due to the timing of some legal entity reorganizations. Before one-timers, the tax rate contributed a $0.13 benefit versus our full-year expected tax rate of 29.5%.","In the quarter, we also faced $0.11 per share of headwind from higher pension costs, E&D investment and FX. But despite these headwinds, segment operating margin expanded 80 basis points, with Climate, Controls & Security leading the way with 230 basis points of margin expansion, evidence that we continue to focus on execution and cost control in this difficult economic environment.","UTC's organic sales growth of 1% reflects slowing sales in Europe, China and the commercial Aerospace aftermarket. There's clearly uncertainty out there. Europe continues to struggle with the debt crisis with no clear solution in place. Most indicators now point to a very modest growth in the U.S. this year with this looming fiscal cliff at the end of this year, which could further dampen growth prospects for next year. As we all know, China and India are also faced with slowing growth. China's reported second-quarter GDP slowed to 7.6%. That's still of course pretty strong but the lowest level we've seen since early 2009. We do know that the Chinese government is taking steps to stimulate the economy, including a second interest rate cut, but the government remains concerned about high property prices.","And despite this near-term slowdown, the urbanization trends and the long-term fundamentals are still in place in the emerging markets, and especially in China and in the central and western provinces. We have confidence in the long-term growth prospects of all these emerging markets.","Against this economic backdrop, though, we are lowering our second-half growth expectations for Otis, CCS and Pratt & Whitney. We're also lowering our expectations for the euro to a new U.S. dollar to euro rate of 1.20. This represents an additional $135 million of earnings headwind to our original guidance where we pegged the euro at 1.35 to the dollar. As Louis said, we continue to focus on what we control in the face of these challenges. So in the first half of the year, we invested $204 million in restructuring, with $93 million in the second quarter. The businesses continue to find way to reduce structural costs and we're once again taking up our estimates for restructuring for the year to $500 million, which will include Goodrich-related actions. That's up $50 million from our previous guidance.","As a result of the headwinds and changes we've discussed, we now expect sales of $58 billion to $59 billion, as Louis said, with organic growth of 0% to 2% versus our prior expectation of organic growth of 2% to 4%. We expect earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35, of course, it's down from our previous guidance of $5.30 to $5.50. This guidance includes $3.6 billion of sales and a net $0.30 EPS dilution from the Goodrich acquisition. That's lower than our previous guidance of $4.5 billion of sales and $0.25 of net dilution, respectively. These changes are simply due to the late July close, which is a month later than we originally built into our plan.","So still a lot of moving parts, such as accounting conformity and amortization around the Goodrich deal and we'll be back to update you if necessary later in the quarter, but we don't anticipate any big changes at this point.","On Slide 3 now. Few more points in the quarter. Total sales were down 5% due to the impact of FX and net divestitures. Of note, Hamilton Sundstrand delivered another strong quarter with 9% organic growth on strength of both commercial and military aerospace. Earnings per share of $1.62 include $0.10 of net one-time gains, that's from the ongoing transformation at CCS. That was more than offset $0.06 of restructuring. Excluding restructuring and net one-time items in both years, EPS increased 13%. FX had a negative impact for the quarter of $0.05. As you know, we completed most of the financing for the Goodrich acquisition in early June. Interest expense and transaction costs related to the acquisition were $0.04 in the quarter. And free cash flow was 99% of net income. UTC continues to deliver strong, consistent cash flow and we're confident we'll deliver free cash flow equal to or in excess of net income for the year.","Order trends, now on Slide 4. As you can see, in this chart, CCS's North American Residential HVAC orders were up 4% in the quarter, which is in line with our full-year expectations. At Otis, new equipment orders were down 4% at constant currency, including China, which contracted 13%. But we did see improving trends late in the quarter as the initiatives the Otis team implemented have started to gain traction.","Pratt & Whitney's large commercial engine spare orders were down 15% for the quarter and Hamilton Sundstrand's commercial spares were down 10%. Although RPM's [indiscernible] passenger miles are increasing and load factors remain high, airlines continue to conserve cash and limit their spending on spares. Average sales per shop visit versus the prior year have dropped about $300,000 or $400,000 and we now expect Pratt & Whitney's commercial spares to be down about 10% organically this year versus our prior expectation of 5% growth.","So a solid second quarter with good execution in the business in a tough macro economic environment. I'll come back and talk a little bit more about the full year at the end, but let me turn it over to Jay to take you to the business unit results.","Jesus Malave","Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 5. At Otis, operating profit was down 8% in the quarter and a 5% decline at sales with foreign currency translation, reducing both sales and profit growth by 5 percentage points. Operating margin was 22.7%, 70 basis points lower than prior year. At constant currency, new equipment sales were down low single digit with high single-digit sales growth in North America, more than offset by declines in Europe and China. Although China new equipment sales were down low single digit in the quarter, the rate of decline improved from the previous quarter.","Overall service sales were up, led by growth in modernization and contractual maintenance. Aggressive cost reduction actions partially offset the impact of higher commodity costs and continued pricing pressure mostly in Europe. At constant currency, new equipment orders were down 4%, with North America up double digits, Europe flattish and China down 13%. Thanks to enhanced communication and brand awareness efforts in China, Otis is beginning to stem the decline in new equipment orders and saw a solid growth in June. A much weaker euro, combined with the continued economic slowdown in Europe and soft new equipment volumes in China are putting pressure on Otis' profit growth. For the year, we now expect Otis sales to be down mid-single digit from up mid-single digit and profits to be down $175 million to $225 million compared to the previous guidance of up $50 million to $75 million. This guidance includes $175 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation versus $75 million previously, assuming a euro average of 1.20 for the balance of the year. Otis increased its restructuring efforts to reduce costs and continue making structural changes to position the business for future profit growth.","On Slide 6. UTC Climate, Controls & Security margins were up sharply to 15.7%, an increase of 230 basis points from prior year as profits increased 4% in the quarter on 11% lower sales. Organic sales were flat following 9% growth in the second quarter of last year. Organic growth was up mid-single digit in each of the America's residential and commercial HVAC businesses and flattish in Europe, Asia and the automation and controls businesses. Transicold was down double digits organically.","Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digit overall but down low double digits in Europe. Transicold orders were down around 25% and Global Fire & Security products were down low single digit.","While CCS first-half earnings were in line with expectations, full-year guidance is being revised to growth of about $150 million from up $225 million to reflect increased FX headwind and weaker organic growth of around 2% due to softer end markets. When combined with the impact of divestitures and FX headwind, we expect reported sales to be down about 7%. Margin expansion will be strong, up about 180 basis points from productivity, cost reduction and the benefit from portfolio transformation.","Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 5% in the second quarter including one point of unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Higher sales were driven by growth in the military and Pratt Canada businesses, partially offset by lower commercial aftermarket and lower industrial shipments at Power Systems. Large commercial spares were down 13% year-over-year, including the benefit from sales to third-party aftermarket parts companies.","Operating profit in the quarter was down 1%. Higher E&D, pension costs and lower commercial spares were partially offset by the benefit of higher military and Pratt Canada sales, restructuring savings and a gain from the sale of equity position in a commercial aftermarket venture of about $0.02 per share.","Commercial spares book-to-bill for the quarter was slightly below 1. As Greg stated, craft's conservation at airlines has impacted order rates and we now expect commercial spares to be down 10% organically versus up mid-single digits previously. As a result of the lower commercial spares outlook, Pratt's operating profit is now likely to be down $100 million to $125 million for the year as compared with down $25 million to $50 million previously. We now expect sales to be up mid-single digits versus prior expectations of about high single digits.","Hamilton Sundstrand delivered a solid quarter with profit growth of 14% on 7% higher sales. OEM sales were up mid-teens while aftermarket was flattish. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by a strong conversion and OEM growth and favorable mix. Operating margin was up 110 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%. Overall, commercial spares sales orders were down 10% year-over-year with declines in both parts and provisioning. Book-to-bill was below 1. For the full year, we continue to expect operating profit for the base business to be up $75 million to $100 million and sales up high single digit. We'll provide an update later in the year on total UTC aerospace systems guidance.","Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9. Operating profit grew 5% on 9% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 51 aircraft, 44 aircraft were based on military platforms and 7 commercial. Lower sales were driven by 19 fewer aircraft deliveries, primarily lower U.S. government and international military deliveries. Mid-teens growth in aftermarket sales partially offset the impact of lower aircraft volumes. On profit, strong performance in aftermarket, favorable mix of commercial aircraft deliveries, including the absence of 1 Canadian Maritime Helicopter, offset the impact of the lower military aircraft deliveries. Productivity and restructuring benefits across the enterprise also contributed towards our second-quarter operating profit growth. For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of $50 million to $75 million on a mid-single-digit sales decline.","With that, let me turn it back to Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks, Jay. As I said earlier, these are really solid results in a very, very tough economic environment. Let me just talk about a few highlights in the quarter, just to add to some of the others we've already talked about. Pratt & Whitney secured an additional 410 orders for our GTF engine family at the Farnborough Air Show, including a SkyWest order for 200 Mitsubishi Regional Jet Engines. And we now have over 2,900 firm and option engine orders across the 4 GTF platforms.","We've also completed over 3,000 hours of testing and concluded the flight test program for the both CSeries and MRJ engine. We continue to expect the CSeries engine will achieve certification in the fourth quarter of this year.","Sikorsky signed a Multi-Year 8 contract in early July with the U.S. government. The contract calls for the production approximately 650 Blackhawk and Seahawk helicopters, including foreign military sales, and that is valued at about $8.5 billion through 2017.","On the commercial side of the business, Geraud and the team are progressing well with the integration of our new CCS organization. The combined impact of portfolio and operational transformation, along with the synergies from the integration, contributed to a record operating margin of 15.7% in the second quarter.","As far as the 2012 outlook, as we mentioned before, we're going to see earnings this year somewhere between $5.25 and $5.35 on sales of $58 billion to $59 billion. As for other elements of the guidance, while the timing of certain transactions reduced the effect of tax rate in the first half of the year, we continue to expect an operational tax rate of 29.5% for the base business for the full year 2012. And what that means is in the third and fourth quarter, we'll see an effective tax rate of about 32%. As I mentioned, we expect to invest about $500 million in restructuring, including Goodrich. That'll be more than offset by about $600 million of gains and other onetime items.","We'll come back and update you once we have more access to Goodrich, including our expectations for the new United Technologies aerospace systems segment.","And with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you -- just going up to 30,000 feet here, take us maybe on a -- from a walk -- from your old EPS guidance to your new. Middle of the range, you've gone from $5.40 to $5.30, but the operational things you're laying out there, it's looks like around $400 million of pressure in the segments and then the higher restructuring looks like a bigger impact. So could you give us a bridge and then where you are in terms of a contingency at your new number.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, okay, Joe. There are a lot of moving pieces here. So I'll try and go through this as succinctly as possible. So you think about -- we had a prior guidance of $5.40 and that concluded a contingency of about $200 million or $0.15. As we look at what's happened in the business is, we've taken about $0.20 of operating segment profit away. About half of that's at Otis as we've reduced new equipment and service sales down about $600 million of sales. The other half of the operational downward pressure is at Pratt and CCS. Pratt's down about $0.06 and CCS is down about $0.04. This is just the operational piece. The next piece, of course, is FX, which is another $0.10 of the takedown. On top of that now, you add in Goodrich about a $0.05 impact from the 1-month delay in closing, about $0.04 from additional restructuring. We also picked up about $0.04 as we moved UT Power to discontinued ops. We picked up another $0.10 with eliminations and other and some minority interest changes down below the line, so we've used up the contingency and at the midpoint of the new guidance, I would say, we don't have any contingency. That's why we really have the lower end at $5.25. Now we think again, we properly calibrated each of the businesses with these new guides, but there still is risk out there in the back half of the year. And again, I think we've also been conservative on the year at 1.20 -- and it's at 1.22, 1.23 today, hopefully, we'll get some lift out of that, which might add some contingency. But it's a little early to tell.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you walk through the pluses are, the $0.04 and the $0.10, because that's where I was really getting at -- was -- what's the kind of offsetting all this other pressure?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, so if you think about CCS, I mean, we're taking sales down about $400 million operationally and earnings down about $100 million. You've got a benefit though offsetting that of about $50 million related to commodities and really that's just a takedown in sales in Asia where we used to think we'd see about mid-single-digit growth -- I'm sorry, high-single digit, now it's mid-single digit. Transicold, because of the order rates we've seen in the second quarter, has gone from down high-single digits to probably down near 10% and the F&S product lines are going to be up low single from mid single. So you add all that up, you'll get about $400 million of takedown in sales and $100 million of EBIT and then there's $50 million of offset for the net commodities. On the Pratt side, it's a little bit more complicated, but really it's about -- spares are going to be down about $350 million from what we've previously estimated. There's a couple of -- and on top of that, service will be down a little bit, so Pratt's sales will actually be down about $500 million, and there is about $200 million of earnings associated with that. Offsetting that, you've got restructuring savings of about $25 million. IAE will add about $50 million, it's a little better than what we had expected just because of some of the timing. And also E&D will be down about $50 million. Now some of these programs have moved to the right. So net-net, about $75 million of takedown at Pratt and about $50 million of takedown at CCS.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just -- second question, just digging into Otis. The margins took a -- improved a bit since some of the trends improved a bit sequentially from Q1 to Q2. What's -- as we look towards the rest of the year and into the margin pressure we really saw on Q1, do you feel like you've really gotten your arms around, I guess, the pricing pressure you are facing in Europe? I don't know if this labor inflation played a role in the service business? What can we expect there going forward?","Gregory J. Hayes","So yes, on top of the -- just the overall weakness that we've seen in sales, we have -- we are seeing some continued pricing pressure. If you think about the margin, it was down 70 basis points in the second quarter after being down 100 basis points in the first quarter, about 30 basis points of that takedown was related to the pricing, another 40 basis points was related to commodity. It's mostly rare earth. Going forward to the back half of the year we've got about $75 million of additional headwind from pricing in the current guidance. So on top of sales being down about $500 million, you've got another $75 million of bad news from pricing. And commodities give you a little bit of a benefit. Restructuring gives you a little bit of benefit. But overall, you're going to be down somewhere around $260 million or so from previous guidance with FX of $100 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Your Carrier and old Fire & Security business delivered terrific numbers in the quarter, Greg. Could you for a moment sort of talk about some of the successes that Geraud has been able to accomplish. It looks like some of them are coming through a little quicker than I would've anticipated.","Gregory J. Hayes","I think the integration of the CCS -- I'm sorry, CCS between Carrier and Fire & Security is going probably better than what we had originally anticipated. It's really just a tribute  to Geraud and the team. They've been able to take out a lot more cost, a lot more quickly than what we had anticipated. But I think more importantly, they've been able to stabilize some of the other businesses at F&S where we saw issues last year, especially in Europe. We're not getting much traction on the top line with the F&S businesses. But the bottom line is getting better as there's more discipline around pricing, more discipline around the contracts that we're taking. So a lot of the bad news that we saw last year, bad news, surprises coming out of the U.K., for instance, again, sales aren't up in the U.K. but profits are now on the legacy F&S business just because of the discipline I think that Geraud and the management team has brought to the pricing process there.","Louis R. Chenevert","Maybe, Howard, if I could add, I think we're seeing the benefits of a very seasoned team that did profound transformation at Carrier before that, exercising their leadership skills with the F&S business and like the backlog in the U.K. is getting much better, I mean, much better margin on that backlog as we go forward. So Geraud is doing a superb job at leveraging all the best practices and implementing quickly across the board and he knows how to do transformation and he's executing very well.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up one -- I can't resist on Sikorsky a little bit and talk a little bit about the Canadian Maritime helicopter. Sorry to do that. But it does look like it slipped again to the right. And how are you sort of accommodating or coming up with a solution that will, maybe, help out your numbers?","Louis R. Chenevert","Yes. Well, let me take that, Howard. First of all, the CMH program, I have to say, is the best maritime helicopter in the world. And it's basically ready to fly and we have made incredible progress. We're also working very closely with the customer to make sure that they get the product they're looking for, that it's a win-win. And I would say Mick Maurer and the team have at Sikorsky are aggressively working to make sure we deliver these helicopters and minimizing the impact of the business. Now what's very encouraging, just a heads up, is we saw some high interest at the Farnborough Air Show this year. This is the second air show, Paris was the same last year. We saw outside customers show interest in the platform as is. And we saw this interest renewed again this year by a couple countries. And in my view, while it's been a painful experience to this point, as we move forward and deliver these 28 helicopters. In my view, there's potential to deliver basically many, many new helicopters of the same configuration that we've now developed, we have. And it's all about working with the Canadian government now to make sure that we close on all the issues. So you need both parties, basically, to agree on tackling the issues. And I would say we're making substantial progress. Obviously, there's been some key deadlines that we had hoped meet and basically, at this point in time, both sides are working to make sure they ultimately get the helicopter that they badly need to replace their aging fleet.","Gregory J. Hayes","Just a follow-up to Louis's comments. We are still -- we have in the forecast this year for Sikorsky to ship 5 CMH. Right now, as Louis said, we're still negotiating with the Canadians around the final configuration of what those aircraft are going to be and we still plan to ship those 5 this year. But obviously, if those slip into next year, it gives us a little more headwind. I think there's nothing to do in terms of next year's issue around delivering the 19 helicopters financially until we resolve the contractual and configuration issues. But we clearly have an eye towards that, Howard, to see what we can do to help offset some of that what will be a pretty big headwind at Sikorsky next year.","Louis R. Chenevert","Just to close on this, Howard. We have, I think, a path to success that's developing. And in the upcoming webcast in the month of September, we should be able to give better color and update as to the progress we are making there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to go back to CC&S. If you could describe a little bit more about the actions that have been taken. You talked about more discipline with respect to pricing in Fire & Security. But I'm trying to understand, the margins were very impressive. If you go across the subsegments within CC&S, where you saw the most success and what steps were taken? Were these organizational changes? Were there headcount reductions, facilities consolidation? What actions are taking place there?","Gregory J. Hayes","We talk a lot about CCS and the Carrier portfolio rationalization or reorganization that Geraud and team have been undertaking in the last few years. And some of that same magic I think you see that happening with the F&S portfolio. We did divest a couple of F&S businesses in the quarter, which helped margin a little bit. But I think importantly, at Carrier, CCS has been the operational transformation. What they've been able to do in the factories, continuing to implement the ACE operating systems, taking overhead out. And we've talked about what a great work they've done in Collierville, Tennessee with the lines there to reduce overhead, the breakeven point in the factory. But also, think about all the restructuring that's been done. We've moved a lot of work down to Monterey, and that's been very, very successful, transforming the commercial product lines. We've invested a lot in R&D. Again, I think we've got better products today, we're much more energy efficient and we're getting good pricing in the market for these new products. So I'd say it's a combination of portfolio, cost discipline, factory performance and product investment, all those things together have really contributed to this margin expansion that we're seeing. And, yet, for the full year, and Jay mentioned it earlier, we're probably going to get 180 basis points of margin expansion. We're talking about close to 14% margins this year, which was Geraud's goal for a year from now. So again, I think they're making great progress and a doing lot faster than any of us anticipated.","Louis R. Chenevert","And remember, the skill set was much more advanced at Carrier on the ACE discipline supply chain development. And by creating CCS, they've been able to leverage that skill set into what's the old Fire & Security that was really the last one to make progress on ACE and supply chain. So we've kind of jump-started these initiatives and we're seeing the good impact of the leadership being focused but also having done it before.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, if I think back a few years ago, George David often talked about a goal of 15% margins at Carrier and that seemed far off. I mean, are you -- is that a possibility here in the reasonable future?","Louis R. Chenevert","Well, as you know, it's my job always to stretch with big goals and impose on BUs, basically stretch targets and then they happily go deliver. And that culture is untouched at UTC. That's the way I run the business. And I think we're well on track with proving, basically, that we're going to deliver on these big goals.","Gregory J. Hayes","I think that what you may be -- you might think of, Doug, is, from a top-line standpoint, Geraud and team are going to deliver what will be close to 14% margins at organic growth of only about 2% this year. I think once we start to see some traction in the end markets, I think, obviously, there's got to be upside and Carrier demonstrated that back in 2010 when the markets came back and we got great operating leverage. So again, I think there is runway here at the end of the day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just wondering on a couple of things on Goodrich. How much of the incremental restructuring is at Goodrich? And does the timing change or business trends that you're seeing in aero aftermarket kind of change your view on what the accretion outlook is for 2013?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think, again, as we look at the combined Hamilton and Goodrich businesses, we're really pretty much on track to what we had expected for the full year this year. Nothing really out there that would tell us that there's going to be any the big impact or longer-term impact on the commercial aftermarket. I think Goodrich's second quarter, their aftermarket was up a little bit, which is better than what we even saw at Hamilton. So financially, I don't see an issue there. The restructuring, it's about $150 million roughly of restructuring we'll do this year. And that's -- some at legacy Goodrich and some at the legacy Hamilton businesses. So as we combine the headquarters down in Charlotte, there'll be some costs we'll be incurring up here in Connecticut. We're also, of course, looking at some rationalization. We'll take out the public company costs and all that. But I think Alain and the team have a clear line of sight to that $150 million this year and there will be more next year as we get into this. But I think the accretion number that we laid out, which is $0.50 to $0.55 next year from the Goodrich acquisition is still right about what we expected it. Again, I think interest costs are a little bit better. Obviously, you don't have any issue. A lot less equity makes that number a little bit better as well. So we're really on track, I think, financially on the Goodrich transaction as we enter day 1 here.","Louis R. Chenevert","And maybe to add, everything I thought this deal was when I announced it last September, I would say it's all of that or better today. I mean, the talent that's in there, the opportunities, the synergies, the customer response, the partner response, all good. So I'm very, very happy with closing such a large transaction in such a short period, and everything we mapped out up front got better.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And I was wondering, just changing gears in the second question, the comment on Otis, June, China looked better, maybe not trying to overanalyze a month. But do you, in fact, kind of see and feel a real inflection and just kind of the tone of business there, whether it's -- what's going on competitively or how the government relations and the like are playing out and what do you think about the back half? Obviously, you gave your guidance, but just kind of the commercial success of Otis looking into the back half.","Louis R. Chenevert","Well, first of all, Otis a very strong franchise, as you know, with a great brand recognition. And I would say that the profound changes we have done in China, as far as leadership structure, reporting line, have had a good impact with the customer base and with the results. Certainly, as we went through the second quarter, we made a change with the President of Otis China now reporting to the President of Otis, Pedro Baranda. We also created a business development office that's now located in Shanghai. And remember, about a year ago, we had announced also the high-rise center of excellence was now in Shanghai. So there's a great team now in China that's complete, that is driving momentum, with the dealers, driving momentum with -- we adjusted the price as we declared earlier to reflect the realities of the competitive landscape, that's after the rare earth increase we did last year. And obviously, as the months have gone by, we're starting to see that the penalty that was in front of us with government opportunities has disappeared and basically, we are now bidding on the opportunities like the next tranche, [ph] Beijing Metro, et cetera. So I would say Pedro and the team -- Pedro has been to China twice in the last 6 weeks. I'm going to be with him at the September Chongqing's Mayor's Conference. We're going to opening the new factory in Chongqing that is going to be serving the Central and West regions. As you know, there's also been a big shift in mix from the basically traditional mix to more low-cost housing, where perhaps Otis had a bit of weakness. But now with the new factory, with the new product line and everything we put in place, basically, we feel very good that we have a guidance that Pedro can achieve going forward and more importantly resume our share position in that market. I think it's all coming together. And as a matter of fact, as we said, I mean, it's 1 month, but I would say, we continue to see similar momentum. June was a record month of sales for Otis in China, following a couple of very difficult months. July is off to a reasonable start. So I mean, it's early in Q3 and I'm not going to give details. But I would say, everything we've done as we monitor, and I'll be there personally later on in September, I would say it's coming together and Otis is a strong franchise and will deliver on its promises to its customer and shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question on the aftermarket. Greg, I wondered if you might speak to differences in trends you might be seeing in wide-body versus narrow-body or even in spares versus MRO at Pratt.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think it's very platform-specific as we look at the Pratt issues in the aftermarket. I think what we have seen is -- actually, shop visits are now look to be coming down in the back half of the year from what we expected. And that's really primarily related to some of the actions that Delta and some of the others are taking at the legacy 757 fleet, where we're seeing planes parked and their engines parted out. So again, I think airlines are very focused on cost containment and the 757 fleet obviously is Pratt-powered primarily, we're seeing a bigger impact from that. The other piece that I guess catches us a little by surprise but probably shouldn't have is on the V2500. Again, to Louis's point, we've got 4,500 engines out there in service today. About 5 years ago, we put in an upgrade called the select program. And that's actually extended the time on wing about 2,000 to 3,000 hours. So some of the V2500 overhauls that we had expected this year are getting pushed into next year. So it's not just one thing. I think you've got a few retirements of 757s. You got better on-wing performance on the Vs and then you've got the 4000, which again we did a lot of work a couple of years ago, and they're also staying on-wing longer. So cash conservation by the airlines, better on-wing performances and some retirements, all that kind of added up to what we see for the aftermarket this year at Pratt now.","Louis R. Chenevert","And Carter, a little -- other comment, which is showing the signs of the airline are cautious as they shop content per visit perhaps reflect some of that. They don't book the full content that we would expect them to book, which means there's going to be shop visit sooner in the future because of that. And overall, I'm very pleased, as you know, with the IAE transaction. While it doesn't always get the spotlight, I think, as much as it should, it's a huge transformational deal. It's a large install base for Pratt with a big backlog. And those planes are flying. It's a young fleet. It's going to be around for a long time. And I think that has a very positive impact on Pratt aftermarket business for a long time to come.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just as a second question, like Jeff, I don't want to get too hung up on single months. But you called out that the residential HVAC orders were up 4, how did that trend over the quarter and can you speak to what you're seeing in June?","Gregory J. Hayes","June or July?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","July, excuse me.","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think -- as you think about it, it's been very lumpy year on the resi side here in the U.S. We started out and had a very slow first 2 months of the year and then a very, very strong March. And we ended March with great momentum. We saw orders up and then slowed down again in April, slowed down in May. And then with all of the heat across the U.S., we had a very, very strong June. And that continued into the first part of July here. Again, not surprising, when you look at the temperatures across the U.S., we've had a very, very good cooling season from that respect. So again, I think we're still expecting kind of 4% to 5% growth in res for the year. Could it be better? I think it will depend really upon the weather and restocking. Right now, channel inventories look to be about normal for this time of year. We're seeing good sellthrough from distribution. So I think it's -- there might be upside, but it's really too early to call on, and I think we're properly calibrated on that. And the other thing, of course, you've got to remember there's still the heating season in front of us when last year at the legacy Carrier business, there really was no heating business because of the very, very warm weather we had throughout the fall and early winter last year. So it's too early to call, but I'd say right now, we're cautiously optimistic on the market for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just probably a couple of follow-ups here. First, on the aftermarket, I'm wondering, from a timing perspective, number of the items that you called out here sort of seem transient in nature but could continue for a couple of quarters, obviously reflected in your guidance. Thinking about 2013, do you see bounce back there? Is it just purely contingent on where the demand in the market is, or how do you think about the aftermarket growth as you move into 2013?","Louis R. Chenevert","Terry, I guess it's way too early to give guidance on 2013. But let me give you just maybe a bit of color. Our goal is to grow earnings double digit year after year and we know the formula. I mean, it's probably a third organic growth, it's a third margin expansion and I think the track record of this team on margin expansion speaks for itself. And then the other third is how we deploy capital. So I mean, there's no doubt that with the changes we've done, with the transformational acquisition, we have some good momentum. And we will expect solid accretion from the Goodrich and IAE transaction next year and I think the game plan is in place. We're working to mitigate some of the headwinds like CMH but at the same time we have a great backlog, for example, on S-92, the backlog is at a record of $1.4 billion. So there's a lot of moving parts. This team is enthused, energized and stay tuned and I think we'll deliver UTC stellar results as we go forward.","Gregory J. Hayes","I'll just add. In terms of the aftermarket, one of the things that obviously drives airline behavior is oil prices. We have seen oil prices come down about 20% in the last 3 months. That takes about 6 months to find its way through in terms of ordering patterns at the airlines. The shop business, which were light -- we saw this back in 2010. Louis has always talked about the walls, [ph] spares, and spares over time are going to be there. I guess it's just a question of timing. So I can't tell you whether that's third or fourth quarter this year. Obviously, we think it's not going to happen. We'll see it at some point, but it is -- to Louis's point, way too early to think about what spares outlook is going to look like. The world is pretty dynamic given everything that's going on. But again, I think airlines are flying, flying the planes full. We've got a big fleet of V2500s out there. We've got a good fleet of legacy Pratt products, so spares will come back. I think it's just a matter of timing to your first point.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I appreciate we are a long way away from 2013 guidance. But Louis, it doesn't sound like you see anything out there with regards to the ability to grow double digit at this point that you'd want to highlight for us. I guess the question is, in that context, 1\/3 from capital allocation, are you thinking the Goodrich accretion, in that mix, in other words, do you think that organically, double-digit growth is possible?","Louis R. Chenevert","Well, you heard what I said before, and it's way too early to give guidance, but this is the culture of this company, to drive double-digit earnings growth and that's what we're focused on, I think we have the pieces coming together. Stay tuned.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then maybe just lastly, non-res construction in the U.S. doesn't sound like you really changed your outlook there, bunch of data points on both the positive and the negative side from other players. How are you seeing that market at this point in and around that mid-single digit kind of longer term outlook?","Gregory J. Hayes","It's surprisingly strong. And I think again, to some of the early discussions, it's really -- we're still seeing the benefit from new product introduction and this pushed towards energy efficiency. So while there isn't much new construction going on, there remains a very robust retrofit market. And I think with the line of products that Carrier has in terms of the very, very energy-efficient chillers, they're gaining traction in that market. And that's really what I would attribute the results of this quarter and our outlook for the year to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First one, just clarification on net proceeds from the divestitures, now that you've kind of come to consummation on the major ones, is it still net about $3 billion or plus or minus?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes. Probably $3 billion plus. Again, I think we've still got a couple of pieces to go here yet. I think Louis mentioned, we work very, very close on the Clipper divestiture. I think you'll see that in the next, I don't know, couple of days, couple of weeks. But net-net, I think that $3 billion plus is still very good number. That's of course after tax. There's a little bit of tax leakage on the industrials.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then the real question is on cash flow for the year. Just looking at the generation you had in the first half, which is great, and looking at the second half, which should have in absence of pension contributions that have been there in prior years. I'm just at a loss as to why cash won't be as good if not better than -- significantly better than the last couple of years' back halves because of the absence of that pension contribution.","Gregory J. Hayes","We're not going to change the guidance on cash flow but let me tell you...","Louis R. Chenevert","I thought you said better or equal.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes. The cash flow is going to be very strong in the back half. And to your point -- there's no cash pension contributions. You also have the benefit in the back half of the year of the Goodrich amortization as we  write up some of their inventory and other assets and take some charges around -- some amortization charges. So yes, cash will be very strong in the back half of the year and I think once we get the Goodrich deal consummated later today, we'll come back in September with either Louis or one of us will probably update you on cash flow and I would expect it to be better than what we are currently guiding to.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And you mentioned the 1\/3 of the deal price will be paid for from the assets or the divestitures plus cash from the cash flow. What's the pro forma cash position at the consummation?","Gregory J. Hayes","We've got about $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet today. And I think there's -- we've got another $16 billion of restricted cash out there, which will go to pay off the owners. What we're really going to do is you'll close most of these deals at the end of the year. I think debt to cap of the end of the year will go down to about 48% and we'll continue to pay down even into next year. But I think again there's plenty of cash both from Goodrich operations as well as the UTC operations this year. We've got some cash on the balance sheet. I think paying down 1\/3 of this, this year is not going to be an issue. With Rocketdyne closing probably early next year as opposed to late this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to just get a quick update on how it's going with the GTF, where we are in the development program and you've got multiple engines, right, or multiple platforms and maybe Louis could talk about that, what's going on with the GTF.","Louis R. Chenevert","Well, first of all, we're very happy with the traction of GTF in the market. And at this point in time, what we have seen is that the engine development is coming together nicely. All the advanced engineering we did and the technology readiness is paying off with, I would say, better than expected first time tests for all the engines we've got about, I think, it's 3,000 hours, we have even more cycles. We just did 2 very important tests. We did the flocking bird test on the GTF, which is the 5 1.5 pound bird and 1 2.5 pound, and we passed that with flying colors, maintained the performance required. We also did a large bird test. Those are all of the new FAA-required testing and that is basically passed very well. The large bird test. So there's only 1 test left, which is the blade-out test. All our modeling suggests we're on track. We're geared up to deliver this engine at the end of the year for the Bombardier application and every program behind. I would say, I always challenge the team because this program has gone remarkably well. And all the expertise we have in Pratt has come together to deliver what's been so far a very flawless program execution. So we're buttoned up, lined up on all the different platform. Everything is on track and you see it through the R&D investment. Obviously, it's a very intense period for R&D. And my commitment earlier was that 2012 was going to be the peak on R&D. And I would say that Dave and the team are holding to that commitment, that 2012 will be the peak on R&D. So everything is on track and I would say the customers, as we've won the different competition, the customers truly value the technology advantage of GTF and not only fuel burn, but noise reduction, emissions reduction and they feel very comfortable that our engine is coming together and we'll deliver on the promises. And every transaction, I would say, that Dave and the team have done, I have reviewed them with Greg and we're proud of wins we've got. We won on the merits of our technology and the platform and it's doing very well.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Now, maybe just 1 follow-on onto that. So far, everything's now about in [ph]. I mean, what -- how should we think about the potential investment and the whatever, a 90,000-pound-plus class engine for a wide-body. I mean, is this technology that can be moved up to that level? Is the company thinking about that?","Louis R. Chenevert","Well, I think what we have found out with the GTF architecture now is that it's also scalable. And I think that there's no doubt that the Pratt team has had discussions with some of the key players in the market that see the value of the technology. But you can expect that obviously, the operating discipline and the UTC discipline on program will apply. All this has to come together where it makes sense for the customers and the shareholders. And obviously even the GTF, and we have big partner content. Partners have been superb, by the way, whether it's the Japanese or MTU. And there's big appetite. As people see the success of our platform, there's big appetite to take on, basically, the portion of the program as a partner. And then that's something that's a big change over the last couple of years as people recognize we have a superior technology advantage in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Schapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Louis, a kind of a long-term question. If I go back and look at Otis' history, you had 1 year of downturn, the last time being in '97 and the time before that, in '90, and then following that, a sharp snapback to record profits. My question is the difference is that you only made 10% margins then, and you're making over 20% today. So what is the risk to any steady margin degradation at Otis that would make this time kind of look like different than the 2 downturns we saw before?","Louis R. Chenevert","I've said that before as far as Otis margin, there's no doubt, Otis is a 20 plus percent return business. And I think nothing has changed. Obviously, we've had a soft patch in China over the last couple of months, I explained earlier on the queue that I think we have taken the right measures from a leadership structure, from the action with the dealer and it's starting to recover. I have high confidence in Otis' future results. I will also remind you that a big portion of the results always come from the aftermarket fees, which is paramount to Otis' base success. And that -- the install base has grown, by the way -- continues to be a huge opportunity and Pedro's hired recently 600 new mechanics that we are training to deliver the highest-value service to our customers. The unexplored territory is still the China aftermarket and I would say we're all over it at this point in time with the change in leadership we have done. Those guys are in the same time zone, they're there every day, they know the market. The nice thing about Otis is we're 95% localized in China. We are also a local leadership that understands the dynamic of our market. I think the changes we did allow to make decision on the spot, and I think that's going to start to create a lot of good momentum for aftermarket. So I think there's always pluses and minuses but nothing has changed as far as the fundamental of Otis being the leader in its segment and as you said before, there have been glitches before. We have another one. But I think Pedro's leadership is making a huge difference.","George Shapiro","I guess the thing I'm concerned about is the aftermarket, I'm sure, has been a big part of why the margins have gotten so high. And now you're talking about the pricing pressure. I mean, is that -- it would seem to be self-limiting, but can you provide some more color on how much down that might take the margins?","Gregory J. Hayes","George, I think the issue here is the aftermarket is very profitable. But we also make money on the OE side through all the factory cost reductions. And it's really been the balance between OE and the aftermarket that's been a success story of Otis over the last 7 or 8 years as they've driven these margins up, so -- and we've got this huge install aftermarket -- or install base of about 1.8 million elevators that we service around the world. And we also make money out of the OE side because we've been able to leverage the global scale of Otis. And even with sales which really haven't gone anywhere in 3 years, the margins have remained very strong, north of 20%. And I think if we get a little bit of growth, you're going to see the margins even improve further at Otis. So I'm not worried about a big long-term downturn in Otis margins. I think they have a focus on cost in everything that they do, they leverage global scale better than any other business that I'm aware of. And they've got their eye squarely on the goal of maintaining this industry-leading margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question was just -- in CCS, was that $112 million of favorable adjustments expected when you gave your original year-over-year changes?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, it was.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, related to George's question just on the Otis, you've highlighted, I guess, 3 different things in terms of the pricing issue, the brand issue and then the actual high-end residential pieces in China, and then I guess some of the pricing pressure and services in Europe. Could you just talk about what your assumptions are as you go through the remainder of the year in those different buckets? And really, is there any reason to think those trends continue into next year as well? Just trying to think about how much we can see Otis growing into the future periods.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think if you think about new equipment, we now think on a constant currency basis, sales will probably be flat for the year and service is only going to be up about 2 points. I think there is opportunity, obviously beyond that. I think one of the focus that Pedro and team have is reigniting top-line growth. Flat sales with China down is still pretty good, I think, and as China recovers, as the property market there recovers, there is upside in those markets. There's still long-term growth prospects in all these emerging markets. We talk about the 600 cities that are out there by 2025 that will more have more than 3 million people, and those are big opportunities for Otis in the next 15 years. And I think we're well positioned to capitalize on that. So I think it's a tough year this year. It's really a tough year because of the situation in Europe and some of the missteps we've had in China. To Louis' point, we've, I think, corrected those missteps in China, we're getting traction there, we'll recover our share, and Europe will get better eventually, whether that happens this year, next year, who knows. But I think we've got high confidence in Pedro and the team in terms of driving top-line growth, which we really haven't seen in 3 years.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a final question, just on Goodrich. Once that closes, really when will you be in a better position to talk about how we should think about the accretion into next year, the restructuring opportunities once you can get your hands on the books? Is that something September, October or is it going to wait until the December typical guidance?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think we'll have a pretty handle on September. We've got a couple of webcasts. Louis got one, I've got one and then we're going to have a -- we're going to host a half-day session up in Montreal at the end of September with all of the business units. And at that point I think Alain and team will be prepared to talk about next year. But I think again, we still feel good about this $0.50 to $0.55 that we've laid out for Goodrich accretion next year. And I don't think we've seen anything that would indicate that, that's going to be off by any order of magnitude. But again, I think by the end of September, we'll have our arms clearly around that.","Operator","Our final question comes from Deane Dray from Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just want to make sure I calibrated correctly on the guidance change. And so it's $500 million of restructuring and $600 million in gains, does that mean $100 million will be falling through to EPS?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, we really got $100 million out there that could fall through to EPS. Obviously, if we decide to spend that on restructuring, that would take you from kind of that midpoint down to the lower end of the guidance range. But right now, we're keeping that $100 million as kind of our back-ocket contingency.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you have a backlog of restructuring that you could implement? And what would you trigger you to add? You're seeing a number of companies this quarter increasing restructuring pretty aggressively.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, we've done -- by the end of this year, we will have done $2.5 billion of restructuring in the last 3.5 years. So it always amazes me that the units come up with new and good payback ideas. So right now, that $500 million that we have is fully subscribed and as we get closer towards '13 and then we kind of understand where the markets are going, there may be further call for additional restructuring. But again, I think the guys have been pretty aggressive in taking out structural cost to deal with the markets and that's why the margins are up this quarter, just continued cost [indisernible] and that's the formula until markets recover, we're going to focus on cost and restructuring and do what we do best.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And anything else on the divestiture side? We know Clippers soon to have an announcement, fuel cell and then these required Goodrich divestitures. Anything else that you're contemplating?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, we're always looking at the portfolio, Deane. But I would think these are probably the biggest pieces. But as the year goes on, I think I would like to get a lot of -- any of the clean up of the portfolio behind us, so I'd say we're never done but we're certainly getting close to done.","Louis R. Chenevert","But the big elements of transformation will wrap up this year, it's that simple. That's where we'll leave it.","Well, thanks, everyone. The UTC strategy of delivering top-line growth through innovative products, global market reach is solidly in place. We'll keep investing in our game-changing technologies and emerging markets and we always maintained our focus on cost reduction and productivity through the ACE operating system. As end markets recover, we will capitalize on our operating leverage and deliver a solid earnings growth. We'll continue to generate strong sustainable cash flow and effectively deploy that cash through dividend, share repurchase and M&A. Goodrich and IAE transactions are historic, transformational changes to the UTC portfolio that I am proud of and confident we'll generate superior shareholder value for years to come.","Thank you for listening and we look forward to updating you on even more progress at the upcoming webcast through September. Thank you very much.","Gregory J. Hayes","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.","Please note, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.","The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permit.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Thank you, Stephanie and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release, UTC reported 2013 earnings per share of $6.21. Our integration of the transformational deals and solid execution drove 16% earnings growth despite a slower than expected recovery in our end markets.","For the full year of Goodrich, UTC Aerospace Systems generated over $2.1 billion of operating profit. The addition of IAE or International Aero Engines along with aggressive cost reduction helped Pratt & Whitney grow earnings by a $177 million and Climate, Controls and Security, also delivered a strong 2013 with 9% earnings growth and 15.7% operating margins.","Even with the investments we\u2019re making for the ramp in aero, we delivered strong free cash flow at a 102% of net income for the year. Gross sales for the year were $63 billion, that\u2019s up 1% organically, and as you see on Slide 2, strong momentum as we exit the year.","Organic sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter after being flat through the first three quarters. In the commercial businesses we saw 7% growth on the Americas, driven by a continued U.S economic recovery. Europe was flat and Asia grew about 4% with ongoing strength in China, where sales were up 9% more than offsetting weaknesses in the other Asian countries.","In aerospace, continued weakness in defense was more than offset by a very strong growth in our commercial OE and aftermarket, where overall sales increased 14%. So it\u2019s an accelerating top line to go along with improving economic environments.","In the U.S., consumer sentiment and spending continue to improve on strength in the equity and housing markets. Europe is also seeing moderate improvement with the PMI expanding for six consecutive months and return to modest economic growth. And in China construction starts and property transactions were strong for the year, giving rise to solid backlogs across our commercial businesses.","Okay, Slide 3. In addition to the accelerated organic sales growth and an improving economic outlook continued strength in orders decision us well as we enter 2014. At Otis, new equipment orders were up 8% with broad based strength around the world and the Controls and Securities global equipment orders grew 5% with double-digit growth in the Americas. In the aerospace business, commercial spare orders were up 20% in Pratt & Whitney and 19% at UTC Aerospace Systems.","Okay, taking a look at fourth quarter earnings on Slide 4 now. As always a few puts and takes as we close out the year. Earnings per share of $1.58 included a $0.11 of restructuring charges, partially offset by $0.02 of gains from tax settlements and the ongoing portfolio transformation CCS.","Absent restructuring and one-time items in both years, earnings per share increased 29% versus prior years and that was driven by a few different items. First of all, very strong performance at CCS and Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems which all delivered profits in excess of our guidance to you.","We also had the absence of a $100 million of inventory step-up cost that we recorded in the fourth quarter of last year related to the Goodrich acquisition. We also saw a lower tax rate this quarter. It was $0.06 better than last year and $0.04 better than what we had expected back in December. And of course lower Canadian Maritime helicopter program charges this year.","On Sikorsky, operating profit grew 10% including the absence of the 2012 charge related to the CMHP. Sikorsky shipped 77 large helicopters in the quarter and 240 for the year with 100% on time delivery to the U.S government. As we said in the press release we did not recognize revenue on any of the CMHP helicopters in 2013 resulting in a net $0.06 benefit versus our expectations. That\u2019s $0.08 from the lack of deliveries, partially offset by a $0.02 charge for cost growth associated with the delay.","As we reported in the press, Sikorsky concluded a principles of agreement with the government of Canada on December 31. This is a positive step towards replacing the aging Sea King fleet. Preliminary pilot training is ongoing in Shearwater, Canada and it will be completed as planned this month, which will allow for the start of operational testing by the Canadian forces shortly thereafter.","The $89 million of liquidated damages associated with late deliveries were fully reserved in prior years. We continue to work with the Canadian government on a final contract amendment and we\u2019re going to maintain our place holder of eight aircraft for 2014.","Okay, enough on Sikorsky. Let\u2019s go back to the fourth quarter. All sales increased 2% and as I mentioned there was 4% organic growth, which is offset by two points of headwind from ongoing divestitures at CCS as well as Pratt & Whitney\u2019s Power Systems business which was divested earlier in the year.","Free cash flow of 136% of net income in the quarter and we paid down an additional $1 billion of debt. It\u2019s important to note in the last 18 months we\u2019ve now paid out approximately half of the debt associated with the Goodrich acquisition. We also bought back an additional 200 million of shares in the quarter, which brought us to a $1.2 billion total for the year.","We remain confident in our growth outlook and we announced a dividend increase of 10.3% in October. The businesses continue to reduce their cost structure in 2013 and identified solid payback restructuring projects, totaling almost $500 million for the year. Restructuring was offset by one-time gains and spread across the business units. Pratt & Whitney led the way with over $150 million of restructuring. UTC Aerospace Systems, CCS and Otis each spent close to $100 million. And we continue to see pull from the businesses for additional restructuring as we entered 2014.","So strong close to what was a good year at UTC. I will be back to talk about 2014 in a few minutes, but first let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the segment results. Jay?","Jay Malave","Thanks Greg. Turning to Page 5, Otis sales improved 4% organically in the quarter with new equipment sales up 10%, including double-digit growth in China and the Americas and modest growth in service. Operating profit was flat to constant currency with profit growth in Asia led by China is largely offset by continued factory transition costs in North America.","Profit in Europe is stabilizing. New equipment order growth remains robust, up 8% to constant currency with mid teens growth in China and the Americas and strength in the Middle East. New equipment backlog ended the year up double digit versus the prior year. For the full year, operating profit was flat at 4% higher sales.","On Slide 6; climate, controls and security increased profits 12% in the quarter and a 1% increase in sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins of 150 basis points from prior year of 15.2%. Organic sales continue to steadily improve and were up 4% in the quarter.","The geographic mix was consistent with recent trends. Europe was flat, China was up high single digit while Asia overall was flat though mainly by a decline in Australia. Americas was up mid single digit driven by 18% growth in the residential HVAC business. Transicold was up 22% with solid growth in Eastern European truck and trailer business and a robust recovery in the container market after a weak quarter last year.","Profit growth in the quarter was driven by strong conversion on organic sales, restructuring savings and net productivity, which more than offset headwind from divested earnings. Orders for global commercial HVAC equipment were up low single digit in the quarter. Orders for global fire and security products were up 10%, although that was largely offset by a decline in the fire and security field businesses.","Global commercial refrigeration orders were flattish while Transicold was down mid single digit following a 70% increase in the third quarter. For the full year, CCS grew earnings by 221 million or 9% and a 1% organic sales increase. Operating margin of 15.7% was up 160 basis points from the prior year and comfortably above the 50% margin target set for 2015.","Turning to aerospace on Slide 7, Pratt & Whitney delivered strong results with 23% profit growth and 5% higher sales, resulting in margin expansion of 170 basis points. Organically, sales were up 14% reflecting growth across the businesses led by high teens growth in the large commercial engine business where aftermarket was up over 20%. The military engine business was up low double digits driven by a higher JSF program sales while Pratt & Whitney Canada was up mid single digits.","On a reported basis, sales were up 5% as the organic sales growth was partially offset by the power systems business divestiture. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by the benefits from higher organic sales and restructuring savings as well as lower E&D which more than offset headwinds and adverse large commercial OE mix, power systems divestiture and higher pension costs.","For the year, Pratt & Whitney delivered profit growth of 177 million exceeding its prior expectation of 150 million based on a seamless integration of IAE, solid execution of cost reduction and restructuring and improvement in the commercial aftermarket.","On Slide 8, UTC Aerospace Systems delivered a strongest quarter of the year with operating profit of 544 million and sales of 3.5 billion. Sales were up high single digit with commercial aftermarket up high teens and commercial OEM up 10%. Overall, military sales were flat to the prior year with mid single digit growth in military aftermarket, offset by a low single digit decline in military OEM.","Year-on-year profit growth was driven by the absence of last year's inventory step-up costs, higher aftermarket volume and continued synergy traction. As Greg mentioned, orders for commercial spares grew 19% on a year-over-year basis.","UTC Aerospace Systems delivered strong results in its first full year with operating profit slightly above to 2.1 billion and integration remains on track towards delivering solid growth in 2014 and beyond.","Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 9, operating profit increased 10% and 13% lower sales. The sales decline was driven by lower international military OEM, the military aftermarket volumes, which were partially offset by higher commercial shipments. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 77 aircraft including 58 based on military platforms and 19 commercial.","On profit; lower overall sales volumes, the unfavorable mix of aircraft and headwind from higher pension and compliance costs were more than offset by lower year-over-year CMHP charges. During the quarter, Sikorsky delivered its first fully configured S-76D aircraft into service. Customer interest in the S-76D is strong with backlog in access of 600 million.","For the full year, Sikorsky delivered 240 aircraft. Operating profit of 644 million was down 16% and 8% lower sales. Based on 2013 results, we are updating our 2014 expectations to flattish operating profit and high single digit sales growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks, Jay. So a good year for UTC. In aggregate, the business units delivered solid margin expansions of 15.7% and EPS grew 16% despite a slower than expected global economic recovery. On top of the solid financial results, we continue to achieve significant milestones on development programs and security wins for the future.","At Pratt, 31 GTF engines have now completed more than 7,000 hours and 16,000 cycles of full engine testing including 750 hours of flight time. The C Series engine achieved certification in February of 2013 and successfully powered the maiden flight of the C Series aircraft this past September. The A320neo engine is on track for certification at the back half of 2014 and our customers recognize the value of the GTF and have now ordered over 5,000 engines including options.","We also quickly realized the benefits of the Goodrich acquisition. In our Propulsion & Aerospace Systems organizational structure in 2013 when Embraer selected UTC to derive a fully integrated propulsion system, that is the engine and the cell and the controls along with the electric system and wheels and brakes for its second-generation E-Jets. These combined wins highlight our ability to leverage our technology across our aerospace businesses to win more content on new aircraft while providing greater customer value with more integrated systems.","Sikorsky continues to see strong civil demand from deepwater oil and gas exploration around the world and has a total commercial backload now of nearly $3 billion. And the investment in X2 Technology has paved the way for our agreement with Boeing to co-develop a demonstrator for the next generation of multi-role helicopters.","New three and four-year labor contracts were also ratified by the union membership at Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky, respectively, and these agreements had a good result for both the company and our employees.","On the commercial side of the business, climate, controls and security continued to see successful leveraging in combination of our carrier and fire and security businesses and delivered a record 15.7% operating margin. Going forward, we'll leverage the combined capability of CCS and Otis in the new building and industrial systems organization to accelerate top line growth.","Otis had several key wins in 2013 including the Tianjin 117 and the Abu Dhabi Airport. Worldwide, Otis new equipment orders were up 14% from 2013 including 22% growth in China. It's a good momentum that will allow us to deliver solid growth in 2014, and really no changes to the expectations that we laid out in December.","The solid organic growth in backlog exiting the year gives us confidence in our sales assumption of 3% to 4% organic growth in 2014 and we expect continued recovery in our North American markets, slight growth in Europe and solid growth in China.","Okay, looking at the DoD budget, the developments in Washington are encouraging but it's still a little early to determine the impact on our businesses for 2014. We're still planning for a 3% to 5% decline on our U.S. government aerospace sales which we mentioned in December, but that will be more than offset by strong growth in our commercial aerospace businesses.","Overall, we continue to respect total sales of around $64 billion this year including almost $1 billion of headwind from divestitures. As always, we remain relentlessly focused on cost reduction on leveraging our global scale. Last year we invested nearly $500 million in restructuring and for this year we expect about 300 million, all offset by one-time gains.","Restructuring spending in 2014 should be evenly distributed across the quarter, so expect about $75 million of restructuring charges each quarter, while the gains are probably going to some in the middle of the year. Strong operating leverage across the business should allow us to deliver earnings of 655 to 685 this year.","We remain confident in that guidance range with earnings growth accelerating during the year. Specifically in the first quarter, we had about $0.22 of headwind year-over-year. We recall that last year's first quarter had $0.11 of net gains while this year we expect $0.06 of net restructuring. We also had about $0.05 of good news at Pratt & Whitney last year which is not going to repeat in this year\u2019s first quarter.","So wrapping up with cash flow we expect to invest about $2 billion in CapEx this year after investing $1.7 billion in 2013, and that $2 billion should be the peak. The timing of course will be dictated by program schedules. These are critical investments for our commercial aerospace business as we prepare for an unprecedented ramp in production. And while these investments of the non-cash pension tailwind creates some pressure on cash flow we continue to target free cash flow equal to net income for the year.","So in conclusion solid year for UTC and the momentum we have actually in the year gives us confidence in 2014. We got the right strategy and the right portfolio in both the developing growth markets along with an organizational structure and experienced management team that will capitalize on the continued global economic recovery and deliver sustainable earnings growth both in 2014 and into the future.","So with that, Stephanie, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hey, good morning guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Carter.","Jay Malave","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Just I wondered if you could give us a little bit more granularity on the commercial aftermarket order numbers and kind of parse that out maybe at Pratt what you\u2019re seeing, on the large commercial side for the PW4000s versus the V\u2019s; any differences in the trends there. And then broadly speaking maybe UTAS differences in military versus commercial and the outlook there?","Greg Hayes","Sure. That\u2019s all pretty good news as you would expect on the commercial side. And spares orders were up at Pratt about 20% beside a UTAS or Aerospace just improved 19%. But I think what was most encouraging for us is what we saw on the services side. This is in our shops around the world where we saw sales up over 40% in the quarter and we then finally started to see the airline switch from these light overhauls we\u2019ve been talking about for the last couple of years to more heavy overhauls and that really drove the tremendous amount of volume in the shops and then drove the order rates as well. So airlines are making money, and things look pretty good that we saw the delinquency and the receivables down because the airlines are making money. We saw spares, we saw heavy overhauls. It was all pretty good on the commercial side of the business. As far as the split, Jay in terms of the Vs and the\u2026","Jay Malave","Sure the -- Carter, the V2500 was up high single-digits in the quarter, PW4000 was up high teens, and the PW2000 was very, very strong and there was an order there for delivery in 2014, but our models did pretty well in the quarter. On the aerospace system side, the provisioning was strong in the quarter and again that was narrow body growth as well as some 787 provisioning. Again as Greg mentioned we\u2019re seeing these higher or stronger overhauls, heavy overhauls with profitability getting better, traffic continuing to grow, cycles in the hours with air sort of trends all the fundamentals as we\u2019ve been saying all along really we\u2019ve seen that in the quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","And what about on the Sikorsky side in terms of the orders there, I mean obviously the spares were off a lot, the orders were off a lot. Have you seen any reversal in that trend?","Jay Malave","We saw just on the sales, military aftermarket was a little bit better, it was down low teens. However that was on an easier compare. Last year military was down high single digits in the after market. So not all that much better.","Greg Hayes","Yeah, I mean I would just tell you, we think we\u2019ve kind of bottomed out from the impacts of sequestration at Sikorsky in terms of the aftermarket. As you guys have, that we\u2019ve all seen, it looks like the defense budget for \u201914 will be the same as it was for \u201913 when they restore that $20 billion of cut. So, we don't expect much further deterioration at Sikorsky in terms of the order rates, but clearly the backlog is going to be down going into \u201914 which is why we think military spares or sales will be down again about 3% to 5%.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","All right. Thanks guys.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning.","Jay Malave","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Can you share a little bit more about the Canadian helicopter in terms of this potential agreement? You said you\u2019re still going to assume eight deliveries this year; is this going to give you any ability to treat the production and service differently and maybe be able to write off any of the production cost. Anything else you can share along the lines of that agreement?","Greg Hayes","Yeah, I think -- again as POA or this principles of agreement that was signed on December 31 really is a milestone for us. I think we had a path forward with the customer to deliver aircraft now. We got a lot of the bad news behind us I think on the program. We weren\u2019t able to revenue recognize any of the helicopters, but again I think as we go forward we\u2019ve got a clear path this year to revenue recognize eight the contract or the amendment should be finalized by the 31st of March and hopefully by the time we stand up in front of investors in March we\u2019ll have some more details in terms of that contract amendment. But right now it looks like we\u2019ve got the ability to deliver out through \u201918. Our goal is to get those things delivered all by 2016. So we think eight this year, eight next year, and eight the following year. And I think importantly the customer recognizes the value of the aircraft. There was talk in the Canadian press about termination of all that. They need these helicopters; these are the best damn military helicopters out there. So, I think it's all very positive for Sikorsky. As for the accounting, while I wish we could get this behind us, Sam I just -- I don\u2019t see a way based upon the structure of the contract that we\u2019re negotiating today to do that. So, again I don\u2019t see any more bad news beyond that which we\u2019ve expected today. We\u2019re going to lose about $14 million of helicopter going forward. So unfortunately I can\u2019t get that behind us. If I had a way to do it I would but, at least for right now we\u2019ll just assume that\u2019s the plan.","Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, and then the change in the segments for Sikorsky is not going to be flat in terms of the profit year-over-year instead of up 0 to 50. It doesn\u2019t look like the other segments change, so really where is the offset if the tax rate interest share count, where do you offset that?","Jay Malave","If you look at -- it's just a change from where they ended, Sam. If you look at based on our guidance the absolute number for Sikorsky\u2019s expectation is the same, and so at our midpoint the bottom line number for Sikorsky is really the same number it was before. It's just the change is different.","Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, and if I could squeeze one more in; Greg back at the third quarter call I think you talked about, I thought a tax rate somewhere close to 29%, that would seem like a little bit more than the few cents you mentioned in terms of the variants. What was in this quarter that was different in terms of the tax rate?","Greg Hayes","There was couple of different pieces in here. There was a small settlement with the IRS which gave us a couple of pennies of benefit which we hadn\u2019t expected in the rate. I think we call that out as part of the gains math. And then we had a little bit better year end rate because of some planning that we had put in place earlier in the year. I think the operational rate would have been about $28.6 million, so we picked up about $40 million or $0.04 operationally because of the tax rate benefit in the quarter.","Samuel Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. I had a couple of questions on Otis. First of all looking at your China OE business there; based on the order backlog and the order trends you had through 2013, I guess is it fair to assume that your OE deliveries in China, the growth rate should be pretty similar this year as what you had in \u201913?","Greg Hayes","Yeah, we\u2019re expecting about 15% sales growth there this year based upon the backlog.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. And then within the U.S. part of Otis; do you still have a drag in the first half of the year from the factory relocation, so that\u2019s mostly finished in Q4?","Greg Hayes","No, there\u2019ll still be a little bit of a drag probably through the middle of the year. I think we had on a little less than $20 million of headwind in Q4. That will step down a little bit each in the next two quarters and I think the plan right now is by the third quarter that should be generating tailwind as opposed to headwind. So, a little bit of drag here in the first few quarters.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then lastly just within Pratt; you\u2019re getting close enough just starting to ship for commercial use the GTF, any change in your thoughts on the kind of headwind within Pratt that you\u2019ll see to earnings from that ramp up?","Greg Hayes","Well, I think it's the same thing we talked about in December. We will be losing money especially on the early delivery. So there will be a headwind from negative engine margin and that\u2019s going to accelerate as the ramp goes. So you\u2019re going to see, we got a little bit of headwind this year, little more in \u201915 and then \u201916, \u201917 some significant negative engine margin. Obviously we\u2019re working the product cost, piece of that equation. It's a great engine and this is a headwind that we\u2019re going to have to deal with which offsets of course. I think we\u2019ve got E&D should be coming down and you\u2019ve got the rest of the business which we expect to recover. The Vs, of course, as those go away, so will the negative engine margin on the Vs which will help offset a little bit of this and the aftermarket should also continue to grow. So, it's headwinds but we know about it, we're working it and we'll tell you more about it as we go through the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","All right, thanks.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein","On Otis, you said that new equipment was up 10% but sales were only up 4%. Can you talk about what came down? Is this repairs and modifications or contract services, what happened there in the quarter?","Greg Hayes","It really is just mix service revenue. We're only up about 1%. That's 60% of the business. That's what got the overall sales only up 4%.","Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein","And then on Pratt, the C Series Bombardier is now talking about this being delayed going into service until the back half of '15. What's the impact of that on you all?","Greg Hayes","Well, it's good news in terms of we had talked about some negative engine margin and both that Pratt is the negative margin that you test for the year on deliveries that we're starting to ramp, and it wasn't a big number. But fortunately, the good news associated with not shipping is it's mostly going to be offset by the fact that the program is going to be out there longer, so the R&D build is going to go up. It was a small net benefit but not big.","Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein","And then just on the other side of that, now that you're starting to see the F-35 growth beginning to kick in, how do you see that going forward in terms of margins? I mean it's a good thing that you're seeing this grow but I would assume there should be some dilution on margin as it becomes bigger?","Greg Hayes","Yes, again those are \u2013 now I think we're in Lot 6. Those were all firm fixed price at this point. So as we go forward here, I think, and we will take cost out. We're still coming down the learning curve pretty rapidly on that but it will be slightly dilutive to margin but not a huge impact really across Pratt. The fact is the demand for these engines in these aircraft are much stronger internationally than we expected, so we expect this ramp to be pretty strong over the next two years.","Doug Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Greg Hayes","Morning, Jeff.","Jay Malave","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","I was wondering if we could just drill into Otis service a little bit, the 1% growth kind of geographically where you're seeing pressure maybe just kind of what's going on in Europe in particular, I guess, and maybe that ties to your stabilization comment.","Greg Hayes","Yes. I think again in the Americas we saw modest growth. I think it was up about 4% service overall and Europe was down about 1%. So the good news here is in China, service is actually up 10%. Again, it's off of a low base. The good news in Europe, if you will, is we have not seen the big continued deterioration that we had been seeing for the last couple of years, so while it's not exactly stabilized since it's still down 1%, at least there's some \u2013 there's some light at the end of the tunnel as the economy has improved. I'll tell you this is probably the biggest focus of Geraud Darnis and the whole team at BIS organization today is making sure that the risk portfolio in Europe continues to returns to growth and profitable growth.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","On China, as you said, it's a low base but is there a visible turn in your service capture in that business? Is that on a clear upward trajectory?","Greg Hayes","It is going up. I think, again, we're seeing \u2013 I think OCL, the Otis China Limited brand where conversions are right around 60% on all of our direct sales, overall still about 25%. Obviously that's a big focus that we have going forward as we grow that business. The new equipment business is wonderful today, but we all know the ultimate price in China will be service and we're focused on it. The whole team really is in China.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And then just finally from me and I'll move on, pension, how did that actually end? Did you pick up a little bit of cushion relative to your guide in the year relative to where discount rates ended?","Greg Hayes","Yes, we did. It was \u2013 the discount rate I think when Louis stood up, we had expected a 4.8% discount rate and I think that's exactly where it ended up for us. But I think overall, the plan was up about 10.8% in terms of performance for the year, really solid performance. Right now, the U.S. plan is about 98% funded on a PBO basis where we were short $4 billion three years ago, today the shortfall is only about 500 million in the pension plan. So we'll see probably about $100 million of additional good news on pension this year beyond that which Louis had talked about in December. So it adds to that cushion that we talked about at the midpoint. You're also getting a little bit of benefit on the currencies, where I think we had forecast the euro at 1.33 for the year, today it's 1.36-ish. So you pick up three pennies there. So, we feel pretty good about the midpoint as compared to where we were just six weeks ago.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","All right, thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Yes, thanks so much. So the very, very strong commercial spares orders and the MRO activity in the fourth quarter, any sense whether that might have been driven by your relatively large price hike announcements for 2014? What are you seeing in terms of color in those areas in the early weeks of January?","Greg Hayes","Well, I might push back a little, Cai, on your characterization of unusually high price increases. I think this is typical normal increases that we see almost every year. I think what was important is we didn't see a lot of discounting in the fourth quarter this year. We saw really solid order intake. And was there a little bit of beat the price? There may have been, but quite frankly that wasn't a big driver of the increase. I think it really is just pent-up demand. And again as we've talked about more heavy overhauls in the shop which drive a tremendous amount of spare parts.","Jay Malave","Yes, Cai, remember the fourth quarter is typically the highest. It's seasonally that beat the price activity occurs. So the compares are pretty clean. It's not like this year is much greater than last year.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Right. And so was the activity flow over end of the first quarter, so what you've seen in January looks about what it looked like last year in terms of percentage changes?","Jay Malave","Yes, well, book to bill is above 1, Cai, so there will be \u2013 some of that flows over into the first quarter.","Greg Hayes","Yes, the fundamentals haven't really changed. I think the airlines are still flying these planes full. They're still flying a lot of hours. Some of this pent-up demand that we've been talking about is continuing to play out, we expect here in the first half. Obviously, we're not going to get 20% aftermarket growth for the full year at Pratt this year. We're thinking it's going to be\u2026","Jay Malave","Mid single digits in the\u2026","Greg Hayes","Mid single digits. So if we hit 20%, things will be really good but it will slow down a little bit again as the compares get tougher in the back half of the year, but I think so far so good.","Jay Malave","Yes. As I've said, Cai, there was one large order in PW2000 that was for delivery in 2014. So the 20% was a little high related to that one order.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Got it. And then we now know that the FY '14 DoD appropriation. You're still looking for down 3 to 5, and then kind of when you take together the budget agreement plus the DoD, is there any potential for favorable results relative to your expectation?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think they are, Cai. But again, most of that benefit is probably going to flow to next year. But if you think about it, the CRH, the combat rescue helicopter was fully funded. The VXX, the Presidential was fully funded. If we're fortunate and get awarded those two contracts, you would expect to see some additional revenues this year, not much on the bottom line obviously because they are developing contracts in the first couple of years, but I would expect a bigger impact to be next year. I think the good news on sequestration is at least everybody knows what it is now. So we have a baseline. So people aren't scrambling and moving money around in a dis-economic fashion. I think the DoD has been building out a plan for next fiscal year. It was a two-year budget deal. And so we expect some stability and not as many surprises going into the year on the downside as we saw last year on the military.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay. And last one, you had mentioned in response to Doug's question that a little more E&D as a result of the C Series, but what are we looking for, for E&D now for the year?","Jay Malave","Cai, we're still flattish. It may go up \u2013 a little uptick from here but generally flattish is still the expectation.","Greg Hayes","And you're probably talking about $10 million of pressure on E&D from the C Series delay at Pratt, and that's a little bit smaller number at the Aerospace Systems business. So we're not talking huge numbers here.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Great. Thanks so much.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. I might pick up a little bit where Cai left off on the military. If I recall correctly last year you were down over 20% military spares in the first quarter or so. Do you see that sort of playing out or do you see something better there, Greg?","Greg Hayes","Are you talking specifically at Sikorsky, Howard or you\u2019re talking\u2026","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","No, I believe it was at Pratt.","Greg Hayes","No, I think again Pratt, we saw actually I think spares at Pratt, let me just take a look here.","Jay Malave","Pratt were up in the first quarter.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","So you\u2019re going to have some positive comparisons there right?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. Should be positive, yeah.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","So how else do you, you kind of are saying to us be careful in the first quarter because of the gains and some of the other items. What else on an operating basis might help you lift the number?","Greg Hayes","Well, I think\u2026","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","I mean, we\u2019re thinking at a bottom line that going to be a tough compare, but I am sure there\u2019s operating performance that will make a difference.","Greg Hayes","Yeah, I think again what you\u2019re going to see because of the accelerating organic growth is coming out of the fourth quarter backlogs were up. So I think you\u2019re going to see a good top line growth and I would expect decent conversion out of that top line growth. The thing about it for the year we\u2019re forecasting organic growth of 3% to 4% that will give us $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We should see some organic growth here in the first quarter which is going to help, gain you\u2019ll see it in Otis because of the backlog I think is seen at CCS, and you\u2019ll certainly see that in the Aerospace OEM side. The only weak point you\u2019ll probably see in the first quarter is Sikorsky which again is still looking at reduced Black Hawk production this year. Recall we\u2019ve been talking about a 20% reduction of Black Hawk sales year-over-year, so that\u2019s probably the biggest pressure point in the first quarter.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","And so a tax rate normalized going forward is like 28.5% Greg, is that sort of where you\u2019re thinking about in\u2026","Greg Hayes","Yeah, I wish it were 28.5%. I think again we had some employment opportunities in the fourth quarter and last years rate you\u2019ll recall benefited from the tax extenders which got fast back in January of \u201913. So, we loose that benefit which was a full point on the rate. So from a planning standpoint we\u2019re expecting about a 30% rate going into the year now. If that gets better because of extenders getting past, again there\u2019s about a point of good news there and we\u2019ll look for some planning opportunities, but right now we\u2019ve got visibility to a 30% rate and that\u2019s the planning assumption at least going in.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","I mean then just two more items, one of CCS. Can you -- have you gone to the point where you feel very comfortable with the portfolio or are there still some other divestitures that are teed up and does that reflect part of what you think will be the gains?","Greg Hayes","Yeah, probably not gains associated with the portfolio transformation. If you think about as Geraud has been talking about $850 million of portfolio reductions or transformation at the legacy F&S business. As we sit here today, I think he would tell you, it's more like about $1.2 billion. So, if you think about the revenues this year, I think CCS is going to see about $500 million of headwinds between divestitures we did during last year including like the Australia cash-in-transit business and some of the other businesses we\u2019ve divested and what's on the block still for 2014.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","And you had a very nice call on saying at the bottom that Carrier was going to show some leverage and that housing wasn\u2019t going to go to zero. Can you put on your forecast thought for a moment and sort of tell us how you continue to see residential and do we see any commercial improvement at Carrier to share.","Greg Hayes","Yeah, in fact I think that\u2019s -- the resi story I think is pretty well known, I mean we finished the year very strong with sales up about 18% in the residential. We saw that in heating, we saw it in small package; we saw it in cooling as well. So I\u2019d expect that that momentum continues. But I think the better news if you will really goes on the non-resi side. We saw Otis orders in North America up almost 13% in the fourth quarter and the CCS, the commercial business orders were up about 5% even though sales were down 5%. So we\u2019re starting to see that recovery that we have been talking about in non-res and again -- and we\u2019d always say Otis is the leader and then CCS is a little bit later in the cycle. But it feels pretty good on the non-resi side as we exit the year in the U.S.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies & Co. Inc.","Okay.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi, yes thanks. Good morning Greg and Jay. If I can just circle back quickly on the aftermarket; Greg you talked a lot about the heavy overhauls for a while and it's nice to start seeing that. What\u2019s the expectations on how long this can persist or the pent-up demand, is this a six months phenomenon or is this something we could see throughout the year?","Greg Hayes","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Peter. I think again it caught us a little bit by surprise in terms of how strong the services business or the MRO business was at Pratt in the fourth quarter. But clearly if you think about it, over time with the airlines flying the hours that they\u2019ve been flying and the dip that we\u2019ve seen in spares over the last couple of years, you would expect this recovery to last at least go into the first half of this year. But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves either I think, you\u2019re going to -- we still think 5% is probably a reasonable expectation for the aftermarket to grow at Pratt & Whitney this year. Could it be better? It could, but I would actually like to see another quarter or so of this under our belt before we declare victory.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. And Jay just could you remind us what\u2019s the aftermarket assumption for the year for UTAS?","Jay Malave","UTAS, its high single-digit.","Peter Arment - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning. I just had two quick ones. One on the EPS guidance for \u201914, I think you had negative contingency at the high end and I think Greg you mentioned a couple of things on pension currency. Maybe a little bit benefit from the $100 million high restructuring. Have you now established some positive contingency at the high end of the EPS guidance?","Greg Hayes","Well let me -- let\u2019s talk at the midpoint and you can do the math. We think there is probably about 200 million to 250 million of contingency at the midpoint at 6.70. So there is a path to that high end today, that\u2019s a little bit more certain than it was six weeks ago really because of pension and currency here. So the restructuring gives us a little bit of opportunity, but it is January. So let\u2019s not get too excited about it. Bad things can and will happen.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","I will restrain myself, Greg. The 15% China Otis growth, you\u2019ve baked into the guidance. Can you remind us the dynamics of backlog visibility for China versus the rest of Otis; is it kind of six months that you kind of have a 90% certainty on and then tails off in the second half?","Greg Hayes","Yes, Peter six to nine months is a typical rule of thumb that we use. Some do go longer, but six to nine months is a typical visibility.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","In similar in China to the rest of the business?","Greg Hayes","The rest of the business will be longer than China.","Jay Malave","Yes, the longer cycle projects, talking more like 12 to 18 months Myles.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. Good morning,","Greg Hayes","Hi, Joe.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","So organic growth perked up finally in Q4 to the 4% level and just wondering as you look to\u2026","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","[Technical Difficulty] to be specific.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","I'm sorry?","Greg Hayes","4.5% if you want to be specific. Go ahead.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Right, okay. Well, as we look into 2014, just thinking through the quarters here, is this level sustainable in the early part of the year or how do you see that playing out?","Greg Hayes","Yes. I think again, the order rate that we saw exiting the year gives us confidence in the organic growth. Obviously, backlog at Otis gives you -- I'm very confident Otis we\u2019ve got 6% growth forecast for Otis this year. I think that\u2019s almost like in the bag, because you still have to deliver it and you still have to see service recover a little bit, but high confidence there. I think on the CCS side, we are forecasting 4% organic growth for the year. Again, good backlog around the business on the non-resi side. The resi business looks to be good. Transicold looks to be okay and as long as Europe remains stable and does not surprise us on the downside, I feel pretty good about that as well. So again, commercial OE, that all looks pretty solid for the year. So I\u2019m expecting a pretty good growth throughout the year.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","The challenges you are facing on the EPS line in Q1 are pretty much all restructuring and earnings related, EBIT related, but not really sales related at all?","Greg Hayes","Exactly. It really just is one-time. Pratt had a little bit of good news last year; $0.05 (indiscernible) quarter from a couple of contracts and then you had, of course, the gains last year versus the restructuring headwind this year. So I just want to give you guys a heads up and it makes, personally the IR team to rest easy when we got that out there, they can talk about it. But there is $0.20 plus of headwind going into the first quarter.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Okay. And then just, my other question is on Goodrich. Could you give us an update on how you finished the year in terms of synergies and what you\u2019re seeing, I guess, in real-time on the deal? What you\u2019re expecting now in terms of the trajectory in 2014 and 2015 in terms of an update?","Greg Hayes","Yes, so synergies, we're well on track. I think we ended the year, cumulative synergies at about $270 million I think. So about $20 million ahead of what we had expected even in the middle of the year when we updated it last; so a good synergy traction. We'll see another $100 million or so this year. I'll just remind you the next tranche of synergies becomes more difficult because it relates to moving facilities, product cost reduction and all of those things. So, Alain and team have got their arms around this and I'm pretty confident we're going to see another $100 million. And then you'll see another almost $100 million in the next couple of years beyond that.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","On the growth you've seen in Otis China on the original equipment side, is it possible to parse out how much of that is market share gain versus just the underlying market?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I don't know that I have that breakdown, Noah. I think clearly the market share in China has stabilized through the course of the year. We think our share is somewhere around 15% or so, maybe 16%. But the market grew a lot stronger than what we had expected in 2013. So a lot of that growth is just the market acceleration.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one follow-up on cash deployment. I know there are placeholders, but the placeholders you have would generate a pretty large increase in the cash balance through the year. And Greg, you mentioned in the prepared remarks how much you've paid down debt since Goodrich. Can you just sort of update us all on which buckets are most likely to see upside in terms of cash deployment this year?","Greg Hayes","I think, again, you got the placeholder for $1 billion of share buyback and placeholder of $1 billion for M&A, placeholder of $1 billion for debt pay down, dividends will be another call, about $2 billion. As we see it today, I would tell you the $1 billion of M&A is probably the squishiest number we have out there just because the pipeline today is not terribly robust. But that can change. I think again, you never know what opportunity might avail itself during the course of the year. So we'll see what happens there. I'd just remind you that the color of money for M&A is primarily outside of the U.S. because of the $2 billion CapEx spend this year, a big chunk of which is here in the U.S. That's a big consumer of U.S. cash. Again, the opportunity for us is working capital reduction. If we see a turn in inventory starting to come down, we generate a little more cash. Clearly, we'd like to see that share buyback number go north of $1 billion again, and we'll just have to see how that plays out during the year. But we don't want to see share growth again this year, although there is a little tiny bit forecast just with the $1 billion of share buyback and the stock price where it is. We're still going to get a little dilution from higher shares.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Is that less robust M&A pipeline, just plain old lack of availability of assets or is it more a \u2013 that the assets are there and there is an issue with pricing expectations?","Greg Hayes","There are lots of things out there for sale. But again, the focus really for this year from last year has been on execution. So we haven't been really, I'd say, pushing very hard on the M&A front. Obviously, we're always looking but the focus is going to be again on execution this year. So if something comes up, I would tell you. Prices have obviously accelerated dramatically in the M&A space. And we're going to focus in the core here. So if something avails itself to us, we'll certainly be in a position to do something. But I'm not hopeful you're going to see a big M&A number this year. Not to say we're not looking though.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. So obviously we've covered a lot of ground already but just going back to the 2014 bridge, you've got $0.08 for commercial OE mix. I'm just wondering does the Bombardier C Series push out. Does that make like $0.08 a bit more \u2013 maybe you do it squishy?","Greg Hayes","Squishy? I guess I did use that word. Obviously, it gives you a little bit of upside. I think we talked about, as we said $0.08 or about $100 million of negative engine margin. We'll pick up a little bit of that. Again, it just adds to that contingency that we talked about at the midpoint, but it's not 100 million. It might be a couple of pennies as we're going to pick up. We're still going to be shipping hardware this year. I think the Bombardier continues to build aircraft. We're just not going to be shipping at the same rate that we had expected.","Jay Malave","Yes, both UTC Aerospace Systems and Pratt, both have upticks in commercial OE. UTC Aerospace Systems has higher volume on 787 as well as A350. They're going to delivering and that's still going to drive some negative margin and Pratt just has higher commercial shipments. It really doesn't change that number meaningfully at all.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, got it. That's clear. And then the 80 bips at Otis, I'm assuming 50 bips on mix and up 30 bips for the factory transition, but I'm just wondering are the service margins pretty stable year-over-year?","Greg Hayes","I think we would say they're down slightly for the year and that's again pricing pressure that we saw in Europe.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just finally you mentioned 2 billion on the CapEx is the peak for 2014. Beyond 2014 Greg, do you think it sort of stabilizes at this level or do we come back down to a more normalized 1.6, 1.7?","Greg Hayes","No, it should come down. This is really the year of the ramp. If you think about it, we have to have the CapEx in place, the facilities in place this year because we start delivering neo engines next year. So this is really the biggest year and we should see it, I would hope, come down $300 million, $400 million next year although, don't \u2013 I guess, you can quote me at it, but we'll see what happens.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our final question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks so much. Good morning. ","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Greg, just on your Aerospace Systems looking at Aerospace OEM, that wasn't bowing [ph] out pretty much at full rate on everything really this quarter with only the A350 yet to go. Is there an opportunity to take out some of your inventory or working capital here now that we know with at a fairly stable rate?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think it's probably \u2013 as you look back on 2013, one of the \u2013 I would say disappointments is the inventory turns did not increase. As production rates ramp up, we would certainly expect to see the velocity, if not the actual amount of inventory increase. So that's one of the focuses that Louis has this year is inventory \u2013 again not reduction, but turn rate improvement.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Okay. And then maybe just secondly on the engine side of things, you commented about the technological progress on the geared turbofan, but I was wondering if you can comment on the market share in the competitive situation of how it's held in versus the alternative engine on the A320?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think across the A320 family, I think its a little bit north of 15%. On the A321s, I think the market share is much better than that; a little less on the A321 and \u2013 I'm sorry the A319 family. So it really varies by thrust class. But I think the GTF clearly has been the winner on the longer range, higher thrust variance.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","All right, thanks, Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay. So I think we'll end it there as we approach the top of the hour. Just to remind everybody, a good year, 16% EPS growth, good fourth quarter organic growth; 4% and strong cash. So making great investments in E&D. We've got a great backlog going into the year and it should be a very solid year for UTC. I want to thank everyone for listening. We look forward to seeing you at our Annual Investor Analyst Meeting, and we're going to do it here at Hartford this year. So we look forward to seeing you on March 13. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relation. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC's Web site at www.utc.com.","Please note, except or otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-reoccurring and\/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its Forms 10-Q and 10-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","In addition, in connection with the pending Rockwell Collins acquisition, UTC has filed with the SEC a registration statement that includes a prospectus from UTC and a proxy statement from Rockwell Collins, which is effective, and which contains important information about UTC, Rockwell Collins, the transaction and related matters.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Kristy, and good morning everyone. As you all saw from our press release this morning, Q3 was another really solid quarter for UTC. EPS was $1.93. That's up 12% versus last year, and that's continuing the strong performance we saw in the first-half of 2018.","I think importantly, organic sales were up 8%. That's our best quarter since 2011. We're clearly seeing the results from our investments and innovation that we've made across the business and from our leading positions in very strong end markets. So, based on our year-to-date performance and the continued strength in aerospace, we're getting to raise our outlook for 2018, and we now expect EPS in the range of $7.20 to $7.30. That's versus our prior outlook of $7.10 to $7.25. We're also improving the low-end of the sales outlook by about $0.5 billion. We now expect revenues of 64% to 64.5%, and that would take organic growth to 6%, that's up from our prior expectation of 5% to 6%. So, again, really strong top-line as the markets continue to show further growth.","Before we go any further, just a couple of comments on Rockwell Collins; regarding the timing of the close of the transaction, as you know, we received the Department of Justice approval, a U.S. DOJ approval on about October 1. That's later than what we had anticipated. If you'll recall, we had hoped to see that some time early to mid-September, it was a little bit later, and as a result, it has pushed out the Chinese approval date. We'd always expected, and I think I said this back in September, that it'll be a few weeks after the U.S. DOJ approval that we would expect China to also grant their approval. So, bottom line, we're still within our expected timing range for China. We don't see any drama here, and we continue to expect this to happen shortly.","As far as the portfolio discussions, as I've said before, the Board has continued its deliberations on the strategic questions regarding the portfolio, and I mentioned back in September, probably within about 60 days, which would be mid-November, and I still think we're right along that timeline that we had talked about, about a month or so ago.","Okay, back to the business results and some outlook. We're keeping a close eye on the global economy in light of -- well, it's the geopolitical environment that is our biggest concern. To date, our end markets of course continue to be very strong, and growth forecasts for the global economy remain strong through next year. On the aerospace side, we're seeing particular strength. Military programs continue to ramp up, we're also seeing signs of recovery in the bizjet segments. On the commercial side, global air traffic remains robust. Year-to-date, revenue passenger miles are up about 6.8% globally, and in July, the global passenger load factor reached an all-time high of 85.2%. We're seeing these aerospace fundamentals translate of course into continued strong demand at both Pratt & Whitney and our Aerospace Systems business.","On our commercial building side, construction activity in the U.S. remained strong, as does infrastructure activity in China. And driving the strength in our orders is, of course, the growing economy and the urbanization rates, which continue to be strong throughout Asia. As always, of course, there're some things that we're monitoring; tariffs, logistics costs, exchange rates, those all remain watch items. Specifically on tariffs, no change to our previously-discussed expectation of about a $0.05 headwind in 2018. As we look to 2019, if the tariffs remain in place, we see about a $0.15 incremental headwind. However, it's still early in the process. We continue to look for ways to mitigate the impact of the tariffs as we move forward. And as you see, we've been able to offset most of the tariff impact this year. We'll work to do the same next year. As always, we stay focused on what we can control, and we're confident in the investments that we've made that'll position each business for a sustainable long-term growth. And that positions us to remain a leader in each of our end markets.","With that, let me turn it over to Akhil, and Caroll to take you through the results, and I'll be back to wrap it up, and then we'll take the Q&A. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thank you, Greg. So I'm on slide two. Our reported sales in the quarter of $16.5 billion were up 10% with 8% organic growth. Three points of benefit came from the absence of last year's nonrecurring charge at Pratt & Whitney, and for the first time this year, foreign exchange translation was a headwind in the quarter, about a point.","Adjusted EPS was $1.93, up $0.20 or 12% versus prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.54, down 8% versus prior year, and included $0.36 of nonrecurring charges relating to Pratt & Whitney's restructuring of a contract with Gulfstream, and costs related to both the pending Rockwell Collins transactions and the ongoing UTC portfolio review. In addition, restructuring was a $0.03 charge in the quarter.","Consistent with our expectations, free cash flow was $1.3 billion in the quarter, and for the year there is no change to our outlook of $4.5 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow, though likely towards the low end of the range. Two exceptional items driving that, one, $200 million of tax payment associated with the gain on the sale of the Taylor Company, we talked about this in Q2. Again, the proceeds from that go through investing, but the tax outflow goes through our free cash flow. And then secondly, approximately $300 million of net cash impact for the Pratt & Whitney contract matter I talked about earlier.","Turning to slide three, you will see the components of our strong organic growth. Overall, we continue to see good fundamentals across our two end markets. Looking at our commercial businesses first, in the Americas sales were up 10% with solid growth at both Otis and CCS. End market activity continues to remain robust and new construction and consumer sentiment remains strong. Within EMEA, sales were up 1%. Europe was up slightly at CCS, and up 4% at Otis. Order rates for Europe were mixed in the quarter. Otis new equipment orders were down 10% on tough compares, while at CCS Europe equipment orders were up low single digits. Middle East continues to be a watch item.","In Asia, sales were up 3%. In China, Otis sales were up slightly, the first time we have seen growth there since Q1 of 2015. More importantly, we continue to see price stabilization in new equipment orders there. At CCS, sales in China were down low single-digit, with growth in commercial HVAC offset by declines in Fire and Security products. Rest of Asia we up mid single-digit at both segments.","On the Aerospace side, commercial sales were up 10% organically in the quarter. OE growth was driven by strong GTF shipments at Pratt, and increasing next generation product sales at Aerospace Systems. And on the aftermarket side, our strong OE positions coupled with continued high traffic demand and strong utilization of in-service products drove 10% organic growth in the quarter. Organically, military sales were up 15% at Pratt & Whitney, and up 10% at Aerospace Systems. Now, before I turn it over to Carroll, just a few comments on our improved 2018 outlook and some early thoughts on 2019. As always, we have a few moving pieces.","First the bad news, Otis continues to see higher-than-expected material costs as well as increased labor costs, including in Europe. In addition, the business has seen further deterioration in Korea, the third largest new equipment market for Otis. On a global basis, pricing, both in new equipment and service, while showing signs of improvement, is not providing any near-term offset to cost pressures. And the stronger U.S. dollar has created additional headwind. As a result, we now expect Otis operating profit to be down approximately $75 million year-over-year, roughly $15 million lower than before. To address these headwinds, Otis continues to invest in digital tools to improve service productivity on a sustainable basis.","In addition, Otis is looking at structural cost reduction actions relating to its footprint and G&A. We expect Otis to show some earnings growth in the fourth quarter, and get back on the path of sustainable and consistent earnings growth starting in 2019. However, given its updated 2018 outlook, it is clear that Otis will not be able to make the 2020 operating profit growth range we had laid out in 2016.","On the good news side, our Aerospace businesses continue to perform well, and should more than offset the 2018 Otis shortfall from higher than expected profits at Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney. Overall, we feel highly confident in our increased adjusted 2018 EPS outlook of $7.20 to $7.30. This is, of course, before any impact from Rockwell Collins. Looking to 2019, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be around 25.5%, as Greg referenced last month. Also, as we have said before, we will be focused on de-leveraging for the next two, three years, and do not anticipate any significant share buyback in 2019. Our weighted average diluted share count should be around 808 million shares for 2019. This is again before any impact from the pending Rockwell Collins acquisition.","With regard to FX, if exchange rates were to stay where they are today, we would have about $100 million of translational FX headwind to segment operating profits in 2019. This would be principally from Europe and the Chinese Yuan. As it relates to our operating performance, we expect solid growth continuing into 2019 in our end markets particularly aerospace. We still expect Rockwell Collins to be accretive to the adjusted EPS in 2019. We are in the early stages of our planning process. And just like this year, we will provide specific guidance with regard to 2019 in January at our Q4 earnings call.","With that, let me turn it over to Carroll to take us through the business unit details. Carroll?","Carroll Lane","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I am on slide four and I'll be speaking of the segment at constant currency as we usually do. And with the exception of organic data points, all results include the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. And as a reminder, there is an appendix on slide 12 you can use as a reference with additional segment data.","Otis sales of $3.2 billion in the quarter were up 4% organically. On a constant currency basis, new equipment sales grew 4%. Low double-digit growth in Europe and mid single-digit growth in both the Americas and Asia excluding China were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Service sales were up 5% in the quarter with high single-digit growth in modernization and mid single-digit growth in both maintenance and repair sales.","New equipment orders were up 9% organically largely driven by major projects booked in the quarter in North America and China. Orders in the Americas were up 25%, partially offset by declines in Europe which was down low double-digits after growing 25% in the third quarter last year. Similar to last quarter, we saw a value growth of China orders outpace unit growth with unit orders up 4% and their corresponding value growing 14%.","Major projects drove almost all the value growth. The combination of pricing mix was slightly favorable. Otis operating profit declined 10%. Contribution from higher volume was more than offset by higher material and labor cost as well as pricing and mix pressure from the backlog. In addition, profitability was impacted by year-over-year headwind from transactional mark-to-market currency adjustments.","Foreign exchange translation was a 2 point headwind to sales and earnings. As Akhil mentioned earlier, we have lowered outlook for Otis full-year operating profit based on operational challenges and the outlook for our end markets. We now expect to range it down $75 to down $25 million and likely toward the low end of the range at actual currency with operating profit growth returning in Q4. The full-year outlook for organic sales at Otis remains unchanged at low single-digit growth.","Turning to slide five, climate controls and security sales are up 7% organically. Continued growth in refrigeration and HVAC end markets contributed to the strong performance. Refrigeration sales were up 11% in the quarter driven by 39% growth in container sales.","North America residential HVAC was up 9% and global commercial HVAC grew 8% in the quarter. Fire and security sales were up slightly. Year-to-date CCS sales are up 6% organically. CCS also continued to see strong equipment orders, up 13% in the quarter. Transport refrigeration orders grew 91% driven by the North American truck trailer business.","Fire and security product orders were up 8% while North America residential and global commercial HVAC were both up low single digits. CCS operating profit grew 5% excluding the impact of the Taylor divestiture. Growth was driven by a higher volume and the favorable year-over-year impact of a contract adjustment in the quarter.","Benefits from improved pricing realization largely offset increases in commodities and logistics cost in the quarter. Looking at the remainder of the year, volume growth and improved pricing should continue and expected to more than offset increases in input cost which include the recently imposed tariffs. For the full year, we continue to expect CCS operating profit to grow by $75 million to $125 million at actual FX.","Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on slide six, sales of $4.8 billion were up 13% on both organic and adjusted basis. Commercial OEM sales were up 18% driven by 27% growth in large commercial engines. Total Geared Turbofans shipments including those to the spare engine pool continued to increase sequentially and grew significantly over the prior year at third quarter. Pratt & Whitney remains on track to meet its full-year customer delivery commitments and to approximately double GTF production from 2017. Pratt & Whitney Canada OEM sales were up 9% with shipments growing year-over-year and sequentially. Military OEM sales were up 33% driven by F135.","Commercial aftermarket sales were up 9% as the large engine aftermarket continues to benefit from strength in the V2500. Military aftermarket was up 7% driven by the F135 and F119 programs. Adjusted operating profit of $409 million was up 7%. Higher negative engine margin was more than offset by drop through from higher commercial aftermarket and military sales. Negative engine margin was primarily driven by higher GTF deliveries as well as delayed product cost reduction initiatives.","Based on year-to-date performance including continued strength in the aftermarket, and despite the anticipation of negative engine margin increasing with deliveries in the remainder of the year, we now expect Pratt & Whitney to grow operating profit towards the high end of the previously communicated range of $25 million to $75 million.","Turning to slide seven, Aerospace Systems delivered another strong quarter with 7% profit growth on 9% higher organic sales. Sales growth was strong across both commercial and military aerospace. Commercial aftermarket was up 12%. Parts in repair were up 11% and 13% respectively and provisioning grew by 13%. While compares to be tougher in Q4, leading indicators remain positive and we now expect full-year commercial aftermarket sales to be up high single-digits. Commercial OEM sales grew 6% driven by new production programs primarily the A320neo partially offset by declines in legacy programs. Military sales were up 10% driven by higher F-35 volume and international awards.","Operating profit growth of 7% was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales and continued product costs reduction. These benefits were partially offset by OE mixed headwind, higher SG&A spend, unfavorable warranty expense and the absence of a favorable contract settlement recorded last year.","Operating profit margin of 15.9% in the quarter was down 20 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable warranty expense in Q3, and the favorable settlement in the prior period last year, margins expanded 140 basis points. Based on the strong year-to-date results, we now expect full-year sales to be up mid single-digits. That compares to our prior outlook of low to mid single-digits. And we now expect operating profit to be up $200 million to $250 million and likely towards the higher end of the range. That's an improvement over our prior outlook of $175 million to $225 million in growth.","And with that I'll hand it back over to Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks, Carroll. So overall UTC's performance during the quarter, I think, was very strong, you'd agree. Obviously, we've got some work to do with Otis, but I'll tell you that Judy and her team are actively working to overcome the cost issues that we'd encountered in Europe as well as some of the market difficulties in Korea.","We would fully expect Otis to return to operating profit growth in 2019 as the benefits from the productivity and other cost initiatives actually start to yield some positive momentum next year. But looking at UTC overall, we're really pleased with our results and of course the improved outlook for this year. With organic sales growth of 8% across the board, we see strength at each of our businesses, and the lead indicator for each businesses are positive. Orders are strong, backlogs continue to grow.","On the execution side, we're well on-track to our GTF production ramp targets and UTC Aerospace systems continues to deliver and has cost reduction targets and CCS continues to invest in new products and drive growth and find ways to offset increasing costs. Bottom line, we're confident in the improved outlook for 2018 and we seek continued progress next year. We see solid long-term fundamentals across all of our businesses, and the investments we've made give us confidence about the future. As always, we're going to stay laser-focused on delivering and to our commitments and to our customers, and of course executing on our strategic priorities.","With that, let's go ahead, Christie, and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just a quick clarification question, the customer contract settlement, Akhil, that you mentioned, I assume that relates to Gulfstream, I wondered if you could just verify that for us. And then Greg, I know your comments on the Chinese approval on Rockwell Collins and waiting for that, I realized these things can somehow -- or sometimes have a bit of a political aspect and drag on. How are you thinking about how that impacts the portfolio decision, and what should we be thinking about how that timeline is being affected.","Akhil Johri","You're right, Carter, the charge we talked about is entirely related to the Gulfstream, and the NORDAM discussion that we've had in the past.","Carter Copeland","Yes.","Greg Hayes","All right, let me try this one more time on the Chinese approval, just to be very clear. We have heard nothing from the folks at SAMR, which is the regulatory agency that approves these transactions. That would cause us to believe there's any political issue that's holding up the approval of our deal. We had at a remedy's package agreed to with SAMR back in August. It was all contingent upon DOJ approval of the transaction, which didn't happen till October. So, I know are excited. There's a lot going on geopolitically, there's a lot of tension between the U.S. and China. We just don't see that as impacting the deal. Again, we've got a very large presence in China; we've been investing there for years and years. We're a key part of the aerospace industry, we've got 24,000 employees. We just don't see the UTC as being caught up in the Sino-U.S. political issue.","So, again, we're still on track, but again, whether this takes another week or two weeks, I'm not all that concerned. I think you're right there, Carter, as far as the portfolio discussions, A has to happen before B, all right. So we've always said that the Rockwell Collins transaction has to close before the Board will make a final decision on the portfolio. You'll recall a year ago, in September, that when we announced the Rockwell transaction, that was really the impetus to start taking a look at the UTC portfolio, obviously having a very, very strong impact. The number one aerospace supplier, with the addition of Rockwell Collins gives the Board I think comfort that the aerospace business can in deed stand on its own going forward. But we've got to close Rockwell first. And so I think it's out there, we expect it to happen. I can't give you the date, other than the fact that we know it'll happen probably in the next, let's call it, two to six weeks.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks for the color.","Greg Hayes","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Maybe just a question on the commercial businesses specifically, how comfortable are you with the outlook in Europe at Otis and CCNS given the comments from Lennox and Assa Abloy and so forth have been pretty tempered in the past few days. And tied to that, do you think you need to see much more of a restructuring step-up in those businesses. I think year-to-date restructuring costs are about $100 million collectively in both. You talked a little bit about Otis charges going up, should we see the same at CCNS?","Greg Hayes","Julian, those are all good questions. I think as we think about the business in Europe, for a number of years we've always been concerned about service portfolio deterioration or pricing in Europe as it relates to the Otis business. We've actually seen that turn the corner, and so one of our biggest concerns has always been the portfolio. We've seen positive momentum on the portfolio. We continue to see solid orders for both businesses in Europe. This quarter is a little bit off. I mean, I think Otis is down like 10%, but that's off of a tough compare where they were up 25% last year in the third quarter. So orders remain strong. The backlog remains strong. I think the two watch items that I would tell you, one, are labor availability.","We have continued to see shortages in skilled labor, specifically in the U.K. and in France, which has caused some contract cost re-estimates. Again, those things are difficult to overcome in the short-term. We've also seen some other input costs that have gone up in Europe. Now, Otis, again, long-term contracts, one, two, three years to execute, hard to pass on pricing in the near-term. CCS has done a much better job because of the short-cycle nature of their business and passing on some of those cost increases. But I think both businesses have their eye on the cost lever as well. I know both Bob and Judy are continuing to look for structural cost reduction and opportunities. There will be, I believe, probably more restructuring dollars spent here in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year.","So it's clearly something we have our eyes on. But again, I think that overall the markets are not as awful as people might expect. And Aerospace, again, completely different, I think again, across the globe, aerospace remains strong. The U.S., again, commercial businesses did very well. I think we saw 9% growth in residential in the U.S. in the quarter. And we saw like 25% growth in North American new equipment orders. So, again, Otis, overall, I think doing very well. And Europe is just -- it's going to be a question-mark.","Akhil Johri","One additional data point, Julian, that might be helpful on the Otis story is that we are still in our early stages of digital deployment of all the tools that we have been talking about. And there is about 20,000 technicians who now have the digital devices. But the data point that is encouraging is that we are seeing some early impact on productivity. The hours per unit on the service side, right, if you think about service, it's a composition of how much time you spend in servicing a unit and what is the labor cost, that's actually down 2% year-over-year. So we are seeing some sign of improvement from a productivity point of view. It's just not enough to offset the higher increases we have seen on labor side and the material side, so the cost increases are greater. We do believe that as these tools gain traction and as we continue to deploy a global service system in Otis, the productivity number will continue to rise. There is significant opportunity there. But that is still to come.","Greg Hayes","So keep in mind, we spend about $3 billion a year on service technicians, 33,000 service technicians. You get a 1% improvement in productivity, that Akhil was talking about, that translates into $30 million in profit on an annual basis. Now, we're not quite there. We've only got 20,000 of the mechanics equipped with these digital devices, but as I talked in my closing comments, we start to think next year the investments in digital will in deed pay off, we'll see that in bottom line.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Greg, just wanted to come back just to China again. Perfunctory is probably too strong a word, right, but it kind of sounded like the Chinese approval was viewed as relatively perfunctory once the U.S. kind of signed off. I'm just curious though, have they actually asked for anything else? Is there additional discussions, are there remedies that they are looking for beyond what the U.S., sort of last year?","Greg Hayes","No. And I don't mean to be flippant, but the answer is no. I think we had a complete package shipped for them, back in August, a complete remedies package. Right now it's just -- they told us it was going to be put on hold, and so we saw DOJ approval. That happened on the first of October. Of course, they had the Golden Week, so they were off for a week. So we're really -- this is just the second week that they've been back since the holiday. And again, I don't want every want to see anything as perfunctory because you never know. But there has been no additional discussions, no additional requests. This is simply an administrator process that SAMR has to go through.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thanks got that. And then just back to Otis, so I think I heard that Europe service margins are stabilizing. Is that correct, and the bigger question now is just, now as you look out to 2020, how do you see the margin trajectory of Otis playing out, and kind of what are the big moving pieces to get there?","Akhil Johri","Yes, just to clarify, Jeff, the revenue per unit on Otis service in Europe is stabilizing. That's the point that Greg made earlier. Margins are still trending down, although at a lower rate than before, and that's just because the cost increases have been greater than the productivity offsets, right. So revenue stabilizing, good sign, after many, many years of decline, revenue per unit is now starting to stabilize in Europe, that's a very positive sign. As our productivity initiatives take hold and start to more than offset the cost, that's when you'll see the margin expansion, right, so not yet there.","With regard to 2020, obviously we've got to go through our planning process for '19. That'll inform the expectations or outlook for 2020, so we'll give you an updated look at that in January.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ron Epstein","Yes, good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Ron.","Ron Epstein","Greg, can you just walk us through Otis in China, because it seemed -- Akhil's remarks that you're starting to see a little bit of a turnaround there. Where are you seeing that strength, and kind of what's going on there? And then the second question would be the middle of the market airplane. Do you look at is as an opportunity for both Pratt & Whitney and UTAS or you're kind of more focused on just UTAS?","Greg Hayes","Like I said with Otis, China first just to get maybe the numbers for the quarter just to remind you. We saw 14% growth in orders in China on a dollar basis, only 4% on a unit basis, so clearly bigger projects. And where we're seeing the strength is in the infrastructure side and the infrastructure spending that the Chinese have been doing to try and offset some of the other headwinds that they have in the economy. So, clearly, Otis is benefiting from that. I think service was up big as well in China in the quarter, so we're starting to see some momentum on service. Margins still aren't great, but at least we're starting to see growth in service, which is, I think, something we had been expecting for, for quite some time. So still view China as a very, very strong long-term market.","Again, the fundamentals remain strong. There's still a big push in urbanization, and to the extent that you're not going to see growth in residential construction, the Chinese are showing a willingness to spend on infrastructure. So I think that's the story at Otis. Obviously the quarter, there's still some hangover from the backlog that we're playing out as the earnings were down in the quarter a little bit in China, but - flat rather. But it's a good news story I think.","On the middle-of-the-market aircraft, again, we see this as a -- it's a viable aircraft we believe.","I think the Boeing Company is continuing to work with customers. I know there's a lot of demand from, especially, some U.S. carriers for this aircraft. We've had some conversations with those customers as well. And we obviously would like to have a position on the aircraft going forward, but it has to make sense. And I think the investments have to have a payoff, and based upon what we think the market size is. And so we're continuing to work with the Boeing Company both on the engine side as well as on the system side. They've got some pretty tough cost targets out there. But they're optimistic about the market size, so continuing to work there. I don't think we see any announcement from us this year, probably not until the first part of next year.","Ron Epstein","Okay. And may be just one quick follow-on, if I may, can you dig deeper into the Otis operating outlook in 2019? I mean is there something structurally wrong with the business? Has the competitive environment just changed? I guess I was kind of surprised at the outlook for 2019.","Akhil Johri","Yes, the only new thing, Ron, that we may not have talked about before was Korea. It just happens to be a large market for Otis, third-largest new equipment market. And that's seen a significant deterioration, both in price as well as from a volume perspective. So that's probably, I would say, $25 million change in our outlook versus what we were thinking in January. The other parts have been essentially increases in cost, which have been much greater than what we had anticipated coming into the year. So I won't say necessarily that there is something fundamentally wrong. The business still remains a very, very solid business with a great cash profile. It's just that some circumstances have created greater headwinds, particularly when you add on the FX headwinds as well that have come on top of that, that have made the trajectory worse. We were [technical difficulty] profit growth this year; unfortunately it's not likely to happen. But we do feel that Otis is on the right track, with stabilization in China that Greg talked about, the service revenue per unit starting to stabilize in Europe. Those are the two big drivers, that'll help.","And then the structural cost actions that Otis and Judy and team are looking at to relook at how the digital tools may change the nature of how we go to market, in terms of whether we need all the branches that we have today, we need the manufacturing footprint that we have today. So continuing to valuate the structural cost from that perspective, and seeing whether the use of digital tools and the digital age can actually help us take our cost down in a more fundamental manner than what have traditionally done at Otis is what the next step is going to be, right. But I think that's -- we are on the right track. The two big-problem areas are stabilizing. And we are seeing some traction from our tools, early stages, but some traction for the tools.","Greg Hayes","Yes, I'd also just remind you while there are some issues, short-term, at Otis. Otis, because again the long-term nature of those contracts, they just don't have the ability to increase prices to cover costs in the short run. That's not to say they're not taking prices up on the long-term. So I would expect, again, some of these cost increases that were seen this year, we'll start to see some recovery next year, and even more the following year. You juxtapose the efforts of CCS where we saw very strong pricing recovery, even with logistics cost up and with tariff costs, pricing pretty much offset those increased costs, again, just the nature of the short-cycle versus the long-cycle nature of the business.","So this is not a structural issue at Otis, to Akhil's point. We'll deal with structural cost to the extent that we can or we need to. But I just think it's just a short-term perturbation associated with the fact you got long-term contracts and short-term cost pressure, specifically around labor.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question per caller. Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Steve.","Steve Tusa","I have one question in five parts, just kidding; you mentioned the spares impact for GTF, what was kind of the percentage of your kind of total GTF deliveries that were spares. And when you get into kind of a more of a normal run rate on that, what percentage is kind of a normal percentage in any given quarter of engines going into kind of the spares pool?","Greg Hayes","Steve, we're not getting into the breakdown on installs versus spares in too much detail. But obviously last year we pulled forward a good number of spare engines on GTF. When you look at a normalized fleet, you might have spare ratios around 10% to the installed fleet, but we're a ways off from that. On a ramping program you clearly need to have more spares delivered as a percentage of fleet just so there's really liquidity in that marketplace. And engines, you can move those engines around. So we'll do, certainly, fewer spares as a percentage of total this year than last. And I expect that to decline as we go forward.","Steve Tusa","Yes, but -- and those are relatively higher margin, right, engines than just on a booking basis than the new ones, than the kind of ones that are going straight to the OE?","Greg Hayes","Well, keep in mind that the spare engines -- the GTF spares that we're building these days, we're keeping in the spare engine pool, so those are capitalized. At some point in time you may have the option to transact those engines. You're right; the pricing dynamics on those sales are different than on OEM installation.","Steve Tusa","Right.","Akhil Johri","Yes, that's a great question, Steve, from a B2500 perspective, but really at GTF, it's more of a lease pool asset buildup as opposed to a sale of spares with a high margin.","Steve Tusa","Okay, and then one last one -- or follow-up on that. What do you expect for kind of Pratt aftermarket in 4Q, you said something about the annual number being up high single-digit, what does that kind of imply for the fourth quarter?","Akhil Johri","Probably still in the sort of high single-digit range -- mid to high single-digit range, because the underlying fundamentals are still pretty strong, there is increasing shop visits happening with the B2500s, there is still demand for [technical difficulty] legacy spare parts. We've been pleasantly surprised on the PW4000, for example, as opposed to the decline that we had been expecting there. And then the Pratt Canada aftermarket remains reasonably robust as well. So I think overall, no change in trends there. I think the aftermarket will be lower in the case of UTAS in the fourth quarter relative to what they have seen earlier, and that's a function of the timing of some provisioning items that we know of.","Steve Tusa","Yes, but Pratt is slower is what you're saying, it's just a little bit slower than the annual -- slows down in the fourth quarter?","Akhil Johri","Just slightly slower, but I think it's more in line with our total -- our annual growth rate of 10% still feels pretty good.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hi, good morning everyone. Just following up on the pricing question earlier, maybe you could talk about pricing across the portfolio given tariffs or a $0.15 incremental headwind I think you mentioned, Greg, in your prepared remarks. How are you thinking about mitigating that headwind across the board and as it relates to maybe pricing step-ups in '19 or productivity?","Greg Hayes","Well, let me start and I'll let Akhil kind of fill in the blanks, but if you think about $0.15 of headwind next year after $0.05 of headwind this year, we have been able to more than offset the tariff impact through pricing this year. I would expect the pricing will also have to increase next year if these tariffs remain in place. There is a limit however in terms of how far pricing can go. Keep in mind we've had, I think, three price increases so far this year in the U.S. resi business. Ultimately these tariffs, it all gets passed on to the consumer in one form or another. It's just a tax on the consumer in another way to think about it.","So, to the extent that the pricing is not going to be adequate, I know Bob is thinking about ways to take come costs out and do some additional restructuring this year or early next year to try and mitigate a piece of this. But, again, at $0.15 it's not a huge number, but it is something that we're going to have to deal with primarily through pricing.","Akhil Johri","Yes, just to add a little bit more to that. Sheila, as you know, CCS has the biggest burden of our tariff increases, so of the total roughly $200 million of tariffs we're talking about for next year, 60% of that is at CCS, and some of that relates to really life-saving products, such as carbon monoxide alarms, et cetera. And one of the mitigation actions that Greg didn't talk about is also our trying to look at and see if we can get exclusion to those products which are lifesaving devices from the list from the administration so we can avoid the tariffs on that. So there is obviously actions on the price side, there's actions on exclusion -- trying to get exclusion, there is also actions on looking at supply chain and trying to see if we can in the short-term, without having major disruptions, look at alternate sources to extent we can.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Sheila.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","Thanks, good morning. Akhil, I know you heard you say that you expect UTAS to slowdown on the aftermarket side in the fourth quarter, but obviously they're kind of beating expectations through the course of the year. And it sounds like you're talking about provisioning. Is it kind of one-off provisioning that you're just not expecting to repeat, or is this plain vanilla strength that you don't expect to remain as strong. So I think the fourth quarter implied would be like no growth year-on-year?","Akhil Johri","Yes, it's a combination, Myles. I think if you go back and look at our data for last year, fourth quarter was significantly stronger for provisioning. It was almost 20% more than the best quarter before that last year. So it's a very, very tough compare. Part of that is just the engine build unit that they supply to Pratt, but there is also timing of some parts associated with the 787 and other legacy provisioning that we have seen early take-up from airlines. And while it's still -- demand, excluding the EBUs, is going to be up, but it's at a much slower rate than what we have seen earlier in the year.","Myles Walton","Would you subscribe to the -- you started the year the up low single digits, you now at up high single-digit. So it is because of provisioning or is it because of plain vanilla that you've seen kind of the upsides to the year?","Akhil Johri","It's both, Myles. So provisioning is up. I think at this point we are thinking provisioning will probably be high single-digit up for the year, which as opposed to are flat to maybe slightly down when we came into the year. So that's certainly been a big help. But we've also seen good strength out of just the plain vanilla parts. And the most encouraging part, from my perspective, has been the good growth that UTAS has seen on the repair side of the equation there. And to me that is actually a sign of our lean initiatives and all the work for Dave and his team have been doing in the repair shops, in the MRO shops, which are allowing them to improve their turnaround times and satisfy the customers faster, as a result probably gaining a little bit of market share in that space. So that's been also an encouraging part which is largely driven by our own execution and the capabilities in our MRO shops.","Myles Walton","All right. I'll leave it at one. Thanks.","Akhil Johri","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.","Peter Arment","Yes, good morning, Greg, Akhil.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Peter Arment","Akhil, maybe just a modeling question, what are some of the bigger puts and takes implied for 4Q just given the range for the annual EPS? If we look at that for 4Q, it looks like it's the lowest for the year? Thanks.","Akhil Johri","Yes, I think partly it is because of the GTF, the profile of the negative engine margin that's generally -- we expect that to be the highest year-over-year headwind in the fourth quarter based on the delivery profile. That's number one. Number two is, as you know, carrier is generally CCS seasonality-wise is the one of the weaker quarters, and last year we had a very significant growth in the container business, which is one of our weakened margin businesses in that portfolio. So, tougher compares inside that on the CCS side. And then there are some nitty-gritties below the line as well. The tax rate for it to be 24.5% for the full-year would suggest that the rate would be closer to 26% for the fourth quarter. It's just the timing of how some of the items play out there. Our corporate expenses typically are highest in the fourth quarter. So it's a combination of things, but it's not inconsistent with the way we were expecting the year to play out, and that's just more or less matched as opposed to a hidden agenda here.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the color. And I'll leave it with one.","Akhil Johri","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Can you talk a little bit more about the GTF and just the supply chain and how it's executing today, and maybe what's inside Pratt versus outside Pratt in terms of your ability to just deliver engine?","Greg Hayes","I think, Sam, the good news is we have got pretty good visibility into the supply chain for full 24 months. And we have -- while there're still, I would say, a handful of parts that causes some consternation on a regular basis. For the most part of those, you know, of 8,000 parts of the engine, 1,100 of them are highly engineered. Of those highly engineered parts, there are really no hiccups in the supply chain that we can see today. In fact, as I said, we are on track to just about double production of GTF this year. It will be up nearly 50% again next year. And so far, the supply chain has been able to keep up with this.","I think the difference between today and 10 years ago is we actually have visibility into the supply chain. So we can see when the parts are getting started, what the yields are, what the quality escapes might be, all of that visibility on a real-time basis, and we've got folks at all the key suppliers today. So while it's -- there is always a watch at them, there can always be an escape, there can always be an issue, I think today we got a lot more visibility, and keep in mind, we have dual sourcing for almost part out there. Most ponderous of the volume goes to the lowest cost supplier, but we keep the second source there just in case. So I think that's a good strategy that Pratt's employed of this.","So think about, you know, 75%-80% of this engine is actually produced in the supply chain. So, it's imperative that we have our arms around this, and I think Ledu and team have done a great job and really shot up to the -- the team back there in operations have done a great job of the supply chain monitoring.","Sam Pearlstein","And presuming you actually stay on schedule through next year, is the new engine margin loss flat next year, does it actually start to go down next year?","Akhil Johri","I think because of the volume increases, it's probably in absolute terms, it will be flattish, but on a per unit basis, obviously it will be coming down the learning curve that we have talked about.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning, gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Akhil Johri","Good morning, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani","Greg, I wanted to come back to some of the comments you made around strategic review and so on, can you just walk us through just so that we've got the right expectation as to what are the parameters for what we are going to hear in November, obviously assuming Rockwell Collins? And then just can you remind us your approach for just entertaining a third-party interest in assets and that sort of thing, and how that relates to what you may or may not see in November?","Greg Hayes","Look, I think what we will see in November will not surprise anyone, but having said that, there is always the ability of the Board to make a different decision, but right now we are on track. We've looked at this question for well over a year. I mean I have made my views pretty clear. I think focus businesses do better over the long-term. But the Board has an obligation to evaluate all of the issues regarding of the potential separation of these businesses, and there are a lot of questions that we continue to answer with the Board, but I would tell you, I feel confident that the Board will come to a final decision shortly.","And that decision will simply be to probably explore all of these options. I think as you think about potential M&A opportunities, value-creating M&A, there is always that possibility although I would tell you both the CCS business and Otis business, business combinations are hard to do, because of antitrust. When you have market-leading positions like we do in HVAC, market-leading positions like we have in elevators, it's hard to think about big, big transactions that would pass antitrust scrutiny today. But having said that, I think we will, the Board will be open to all potential opportunities along those lines, and we will continue to work that.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you. I'll leave it at one.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Raviv from Citi. Your line is open.","Jon Raviv","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Greg, just philosophically I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how does a company as large and as buried as yours adjust to with the higher cost, higher rate and potentially higher growth in environment? Is there some sort of playbook that you can reach back to? The last time we saw inflation on pick up and rates pick up as well. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Yes, it's a good question. And I think each of the businesses has their own methodology for coping with cost increases. If you think about the aerospace side, we have -- most of the products that we buy are under long-term agreements that provide some level of price adjustment based upon inflationary index. Again, not in that big price increases; the beautiful thing about the aerospace business is you have the ability to pass those increases on as part of the annual catalog increase and the aftermarket. And many of our OEM contracts have the same type of cost adjustment for inflation or increases in these indices. So that's the aerospace side. Again, continues to -- we'll look for ways to pass along these cost increases as well as the ability to look for second sources and to move to lower cost supplies to the extent that inflation becomes unmanageable.","On the commercial side, the playbook is pretty simple, it's constantly keeping an eye on structure overhead costs, but it's also using the pricing lever where we do see inflation, using the inflation as a method to increase pricing. And that's not a bad answer; little bit of inflation is not bad. I think it's just a question of being able to manage and being able to forecast accurately where your cost increases are coming. So you don't get surprised.","Akhil Johri","Yes. And just to -- I mean give further data point, if you look at the number of facilities that UTAS has structurally addressed, since the acquisition of Goodrich, it's almost 40 facilities that they have closed or consolidated. And that's the type of playbook that they have used historically, where the number of factories have come down significantly. So it's about scale, it's about trying to make sure that you're constantly looking at structural cost; this is something that UTC is very good at. And that's also a part of the playbook in addition to looking at pricing and strategically positioning ourselves in high-growth markets such as aerospace.","Greg Hayes","And I would tell you that, I mean, the playbook here really evolves around the operating system. That's the ace, and implementing ace in each one of the factories and pushing that down into the supply chain such that everything we do is focused on process excellence, and how do you reduce costs in every step of the production, every step of the supply chain? So again, the playbook is pretty well understood, and I think to the most part, the guys have been executing on that.","Jon Raviv","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Deane.","Operator","Please check your mute button.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Well, I guess Deane is not on the call, but with that, let me take the afternoon and thank everybody for listening in today. We are at the bottom of the hour. Just to remind everybody, Carroll and team are available all day today, as they always are to answer any further questions. And we appreciate you guys listening in. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"21057":["United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) Q3 2016 Earnings Call October 25, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory J.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.","Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-reoccurring and\/or non-operational nature often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in good times as well as tough times.","So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76, that's up 5% year over year and $14.4 billion dollars of sales, and that includes 5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the aerospace units. So year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3% organic sales growth.","With three strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10, that's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom end last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion.","We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals.","Once again, had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the aerospace ramp to support future growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income, with strong cash generation at each of our business units.","These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation, and of course, innovation. And there's no better example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan Engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well on the field. We now have eight operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe.","As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours and more than 20,000 takeoff and landings. The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets.","VivaAerobus, which a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance.","The good news, of course, is the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400 engines, positioning us for top and bottom-line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively adding capacity, we're improving yields and perfecting processes.","We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market, which is down more than 5%. I would remind you though, the pricing pressure remains intense, so despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to come.","We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies that Philippe discussed in March. We're increasing our sales force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering spend. And we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. But as always, more to do with Otis and across UTC.","We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than our overall SG&A rate, which at 9.7% of sales remains the lowest in the peer group. On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion dollars in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. While big acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployment will consistently grow shareowner value for the long term.","Okay. Let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter and largely in line what we had planned for the year. While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to see strength in most of our U.S. end markets.","In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K.","Middle East projects remain under pressure as you would expect, but Asia excluding China continues to see robust growth.","Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas driven by Otis, which was up 9%, which is consistent with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%.","For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China.","Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their 6th consecutive year of profitability, and traffic growth remains ahead of long-term trends, and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new, more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space, where we have great content.","In the third quarter, our aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that's partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt & Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter.","With that, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the details.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Greg. Before I start, just a quick note. I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently a vice president at the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC.","Moving to slide 3, total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic growth, offset by 1 point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up 8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items.","As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract negotiations at Pratt, largely offset by a benefit from the conclusion of a tax settlement. As Greg mentioned, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year.","We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With three quarters of strong performance behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20 million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations will be offset by Pratt & Whitney, where we expect full-year earnings to be between $1.715 billion and a $1.775 billion. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by higher E&D spend and lower margins on legacy engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transaction aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin.","We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017 and will give specific guidance later. However, there are two points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements at current discount rates, pension looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017; about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in 2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial engines.","But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margins through 2020 are still intact. E&D will come down. Pratt Canada and military engine business will grow. And net commercial aftermarket will increase.","However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year. We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter.","We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017 net of higher interest expense and CCS should deliver solid earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However, net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017.","As we have consistently said, our aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms, which results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time, and cost reduction will improve margins on new products sequentially year-after-year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the long term.","With that, let me go through the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. Turning to Otis on slide 4, I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there is an appendix on slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. In the quarter, Otis sales were $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contributions from higher service volume, improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and EMEA, additional E&D investments, and the absence of prior-year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange adjustments.","Foreign exchange translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales were down 2% driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new corporate sales up 21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015.","Service sales were up 3%, with continued solid growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up slightly.","New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20% with broad-based growth. In Asia outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits while orders in North America were up slightly, even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. So, with three quarters behind us, we feel comfortable raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million.","On slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 7% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter, primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year over year. North America Residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digit.","CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating profit growth at CCS.","Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and a declining North America truck trailer refrigeration market after several years of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were down low single digit, driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high-single-digit growth the prior year.","Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously.","Turning to aerospace on slide 6, Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially driven by a year-over-year increase in large engine deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistic center.","Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 150 engines this year. Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models.","Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada OE drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100 million.","At Aerospace Systems, on slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment which was up 17%, off of an easy compare and accelerating growth on next generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%.","The military business was down 6%. The low-teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of C-5 nacelle retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE sales were impacted by lower legacy programs.","Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a non-core asset. This was partially offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior year's contract adjustments and license agreements. With solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now expect full-year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Akhil. So overall, very good performance in the quarter and a strong year so far. And while we're addressing some near-term challenges with the GTF production ramp up, our Pratt Canada and Pratt Military businesses continue to perform well.","We've also seen solid performance out of our UTC Aerospace Systems business, Otis and CCS; all of these guys picking up the slack. In the end, balance still works at UTC. I'm very confident about our updated guidance of $6.55 to $6.60 as well as UTC's long-term outlook. We've got a growing aero backlog and we continue to invest in all of our businesses. And the entire organization remains focused on our four key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation.","We've got a great portfolio of four franchises with global scale and resilient business models. And all these businesses are supported by solid market fundamentals, growing revenue passenger miles, continued urbanization and a middle-class expansion globally. All of these things position UTC to deliver earnings growth well into the future and to create significant shareowner value.","With that, let me go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","The color on the OE losses at Pratt is very helpful. A topic comes up a lot with investors is the market is not doing a very good job of valuing these initial losses. The billion dollars is probably carrying a negative value right now. So, I know you've addressed this in the past, Greg, but how long are you prepared to carry this kind of multiple given that the market can't value the Pratt losses? It doesn't seem to do a very good job valuing its losses. I mean, how long are you prepared to suffer a discount before you think about maybe something structural on the portfolio?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Well, let's not go there quite so quickly, Nigel. Let me say, look, the negative engine margin is not a new issue with Pratt & Whitney. We've been talking about this kind of billion-dollar peak of negative engine margin in 2018. And clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly, even from this year's level. So, as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there.","I think once we start delivering at a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show-me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed this year as well as I would've liked to have seen in terms of deliveries, but it's going to get fixed and it's going to be fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better.","And so, I think, I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF truly is game-changing technology. And if you talk to the customers, what you're going to see is they love this engine. They love the take-off power. They love the noise. And it's environmentally friendly. All the things that we set out to do with this engine are on track.","As far as portfolio, look, we will always look at what's best for the shareowners over the long term. I would tell you right now, keeping the businesses together makes a lot of sense in terms of supporting some of these losses on the aerospace side with some of the \u2013 the goodness out of the commercial is certainly helpful. But portfolio is always something we look at. Right now, we're focused on continuing to buy back shares. It's the right thing to do. We're trading significantly below intrinsic value as I'm sure you guys know. So a little frustrating, but its okay. It's a long-term story here.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","We have $22 billion that we're returning to shareholders over three years, Nigel. I think that clearly says a lot about us putting our money where our mouth is and believing fully in the intrinsic value of the company. $16 billion of share buyback over three years, that's a lot for a company our size.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Absolutely. And the point I was trying to make was the \u2013 some of the parts' discounts is the widest that we see across our coverage. So, it's more of a friendly question than anything else.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","It just means a lots more opportunity for growth at UTX, right? That's what it says.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Absolutely.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","That sooner or later, the market catches up with reality.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Let's hope so. But the math you just gave, Akhil, and this is my last question, how does that change under IFRS 15, the new revenue accounting standards?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Well, I think the change \u2013 there will be a little bit of impact from that as we go through the adoption of the new revenue standard. The biggest impact would probably be in the form of \u2013 as you know, we are doing excess over average over a contract value of the engines, which means there is a little bit of the cost which is being put on the balance sheet, that will probably get flushed out on 1\/1\/18. Beyond that, we don't expect a huge amount of change because our accounting, as we have discussed before, on negative engine margin does not change under the new rules. We also have a little bit of adjustment from the POC adoption of the \u2013 the percentage of completion as opposed to completed contracts. We'll give you an update on all that as we go through the next year and come up with more precise numbers.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah, there will be some E&D that might get capitalized as well. I would just say, there's generally \u2013 there's not going to be a big, big impact from the rev rec standard. Although there will be a lot of work to do, not a huge impact. And we'll lay all that out when we put the K out early next year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","A quick clarification on something you said Akhil and a question. The first on the \u2013 I think you said lower margins on legacy fleet management contracts. Did you \u2013 do you lower the profit rates on a particular program due to experience on the overhaul costs or any of that? I just wanted to clarify that. And then I wondered if you could help us a little bit with the EBIT bridge at Pratt in terms of \u2013 it looks like there's probably $100 million, $150 million of kind of holistic GTF year-over-year headwind there. How much of that would you say is real negative engine margin versus maybe sort of extra cost that we might call one-time versus E&D? Any color you can give us there?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Sure. So two separate questions. On the second one first, the bridge for full-year guidance for Pratt is as follows: The changes that we made to the latest guidance had two elements of good news.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, no, I was talking about the quarter.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Oh, just for the quarter? Okay. So there also, there is a couple of pieces, things moving. We had good news in the form of higher commercial aftermarket. So that was about $70 million year-over-year, which was offset partly about $50 million from the contract settlements that we had last year, so net benefit in commercial aftermarket of about $20 million. We had good news on pension and FX. That's about $60 million year-over-year, good news. So that's together, $80 million. And then on the negative side, E&D was up about $30 million, and then Pratt Canada and the GTF startup costs were about $80 million. So that's the net math, Carter, to explain the quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And on the booking rates on the legacy FMPs?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So on the FMPs, the change is essentially with regard to our V2500 engine program, and that's the good news that we are seeing on the transactional side. To some extent, its being driven by the service bulletin that had come out, which was on the hub deck we had talked about before. That unfortunately has a negative impact on our \u2013 on the engines under fleet management program. So it's just the other side of the good news that we are seeing on transaction spares, and that's basically what is being deflected in the full-year guidance.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So, slight reduction there. Not much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You're talking about delivering 350 to 400 of your Turbofans next year. Can you talk a little about the approach you're taking to improve the yield and speed the blade production process? And how do you expect the cadence of the deliveries to move as you address the fan blade production issues?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Doug, it's a great question, and it's probably the key to fourth quarter, as well as the key to next year, is to improve fan blade production. Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year, the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 days to 105 days, that is from the time we would start it to the time we got it all the way through the test process, it was taking more than three months. And frankly, our first pass test yield, that is from the number of units or fan blades that were coming out of the end of the process that were acceptable, was about 30%. Today, that 100 days to 105 days is down to 55 days with lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us in terms of throughput in the factories.","We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve the processes out in Lansing. The team has done a great job. This is a brand new, as you guys know, it's a titanium aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there.","I think two things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity. One of our partners, IHI, will be coming online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we think, in January.","We're also standing up a brand new factory about four miles away from the current factory in Lansing, which will be mostly automated processes. That will start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade deliveries early through the first half of next year.","And just, again, to put this in perspective, this is a \u2013 the first time that anyone has ever built one of these ti-aluminum blades, and it was a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of you that have been following the company for a long time, you will remember we had the same issue when we built the hollow titanium fan blade for the PW4000. And we had the same yield issues. We had the same producibility issues. And today, it's not an issue at all. We stamp them out, I wouldn't say on a regular basis, but we still make them much more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there. We're on top of this. We're following production yields on a, I hate to say this, a daily basis, but we're following it. And I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then earlier, about a month ago, you had said that you had five critical parts that you were concerned about in the supply chain. When you look at those, are those things that when the blade issue is resolved, would you expect those to have any additional impact on delivery timing?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","So we have line of sight to complete engine builds for this year, well beyond the 150. The pacing item this year is going to be fan blades. There is a couple of other critical parts that we continue to work with the suppliers on, where we have seen yields improving. We've seen added capacity, and we're out adding additional capacity to try and make up some of the slack. So I would think we have the right processes in place in the supply chain to ensure we've got all those parts. It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at a supplier, we're going to be just fine. But as you know, we've also put in place, a strategy where we have no single point of failure in the supply chain. So we've got two key suppliers for each of the key parts of the GTF.","I also talked about we have added capacity. We're perfecting processes. We also brought back Shane Eddy, who'll be leading the operations at Pratt. Shane joins us from GE, but more recently, he was at Sikorsky as Head of Operations. So I think Shane and the whole team over at Pratt will get their arms around this, and we're highly confident in the outlook for next year.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I just wanted to ask what impact you guys are expecting from the recently passed Montreal Protocol amendment in relation to refrigerants. And, for example, like any products redesigns that could happen as a result of this and when they might go to market? Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah, Andrew, I think it's \u2013 we have been obviously working with the regulatory authorities on the changes required by the Montreal Protocol. We are in the process of redesigning several of the systems. I think the good news is we're actually ahead of the curve on our commercial refrigeration systems, on our transport refrigeration systems. We actually offer a CO2 based coolant solution, which has got a zero-goal global warming potential. So we're on top of this.","I think the one issue that you've got with this additional or some of these new refrigerants will be cost, which is always a challenge in terms of trying to pass that on. But from a design standpoint, from a market standpoint, I would say that the team \u2013 and we just completed a technology review with the Carrier folks a couple of weeks ago \u2013 they are on top of this from what needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just as my quick follow-up, do you \u2013 can you update on the contingency that's in the guidance? I think as of last quarter, you guys sized it at $75 million?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Now that we've raised the bottom end of the range by $0.10, Andrew, the contingency is about $25 million essentially because the business units' net-net are about the same.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So Akhil indicated the large uptick in Pratt's new engine loss next year and kind of reiterated \u2013 you've made this point, Greg, of the challenging EBIT outlook. But a two-part question, A, with the lower share count and other factors, do you foresee any EPS growth next year with those pluses offsetting the challenges to EBIT? And secondly, given it looks like you're going to have much less uptick in GTF losses in 2018, should we also anticipate a much stronger snap back in 2018?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Let me start, and I'll let Akhil bail me out at the end. Right now, as we look at Pratt, we want to be very specific. There's $300 million of additional negative engine margin on top of probably $100 million or half of that pension headwind that Akhil mentioned. So a $400 million headwind. It's just hard to see even with better after market next year and better military, hard to see how Pratt's going to grow earnings. So we actually expect them to be down.","E&D, I think, is the other challenge at Pratt, where we had expected it to be down next year. With the timing of all these programs moving to the left a little bit, we're continuing to see pressure on E&D. So that's one of the offsets that we're just not going to see until probably 2018 and 2019 is E&D.","As far as overall UTC, again, this is \u2013 we're not quite ready to give guidance. As you can imagine, we're still going through the detail of the plans from all of the units and there's a lot of moving pieces. Clearly, we're going to get a benefit from share buyback, but it's probably not going to offset the negative margin, the negative engine margin and the big pension headwind that we have. And I think that's why as we look at it today, it's hard to paint a picture where we can see earnings growth at UTC next year.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Right. And my comment, Cai, was about EPS, not so much just about segment EBIT, because obviously, with the pension of $200 million, the negative engine margin Greg talked about, keep in mind, the interest expense will be higher next year by about $100 million as well just based on the fact that we need to be in the market to borrow money to fund the share buyback. So even the share buyback will be a significant benefit year-over-year. In terms of lower share count, we will lose some of that through higher interest expense.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then the second part of the question, 2018?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","My crystal ball gets really cloudy beyond about six months. I would tell you, Cai, we're on track for what we laid out for the 2020 goals, which would show profitability starting to improve in 2018 and 2019. And as you know, the first aftermarket or first big overhauls on the GTF around 2020. So this \u2013 we expect earnings growth to pick up in 2018. I'm not going to give you a number here, but clearly, with the Aerospace ramp continuing, there's going to be some challenges, negative engine margin and the mix at UTAS, but those things should be overcome by lower E&D and higher aftermarket, as well as growth on the commercial side.","Keep in mind, on the Otis side, we're also going to be investing for the next couple of years. Philippe has laid out a plan to restore some growth to Otis' top-line growth. That's going to require some investment in the sales force. It's going to require some significant investment in E&D to refresh the product line. And from a systems standpoint, we need to spend money on these digital initiatives. So there is going to be headwind next year beyond just what we've laid out. All of those things would start to pay off in 2018 and 2019. So again, not trying to surprise anybody with a 2017 outlook, but we are on track to exactly what we talked about back in March about the 2020 outlook.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","If I could throw a two-parter out there also. Just back to GTF, just a little bit of pause on my part, just thinking about only $100 million delta in the headwind in 2018 relative to 2017, given the further volume ramp that you have. So if you could address that, must be around learning curve and other things, but anything you could provide there? And I was also just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on working capital and cash flow into next year. It sounds look you might be building engines in front of fan blade deliveries, et cetera. Just wondering if that puts any inordinate pressure on the cash flows.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Great questions, Jeff. So on the first one, the math for 2018 is there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that they will benefit from us coming down the cost curve. But the fact which you may not be thinking is that the CEO engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from 2017 to 2018, as will be the GP7000s. And both of those carry negative engine margin as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will come down. And that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the incremental GTF negative engine \u2013 incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is probably a year or two years more as we ramp up, as we take the engine productions up at Pratt net-net. There is going to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement as the supply chain stabilizes and inventory turns, but in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that as there will be demand on CapEx for another year or two years, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're back to the 100% of net income or more.","The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver 100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to meet production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good shape. I mean 90% are closed there about this year, about 100% last year in face of these investments is not a bad number.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","No, indeed. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. I'll try the same two-part. One on North American Residential, you had very solid numbers. Could you talk about some of the characteristics and what you think you in terms of is driving the market and the sustainability of that demand?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","You had a second part too, Howard, or are we just...","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Oh, yeah, the second part \u2013 and the second part. Yeah, thanks. Greg, it's a little bit more structural cost reduction that you're talking about. And could you \u2013 you talked about it philosophically, could you provide some other examples of it and how you think about that?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah. Sure. Well, let me start out with the North American Residential, obviously, it was a good year. It's interesting, the weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction in Residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think there's still some concern out there about the legs lefts in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation continues to be very, very strong at about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million housing starts, 20%, 25% of the Resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track.","I think more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S., the average life is somewhere between 10 years and 15 years, depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment. And that is, again, the big increases that we saw back in the early 2004\/2005 when we were selling \u2013 the market was 7.5 million units a year. Those units are approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in Resi for a couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged there. I think it's just \u2013 it's a really \u2013 a very good place. We've got great products, very high efficiencies systems, and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there.","As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte have been focused on it. Yeah, I'm reminded, since we acquired Goodrich back in 2012, four years ago, we've realized about 600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There are still more factory consolidations to come.","I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities there. So more to do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob McDonough and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce cost in the very competitive markets that we are. Probably no more big plank closings there, but still executing on what they've got out there already.","And the same is true on Otis. There's \u2013 I think they consolidated their engineering footprint to three major engineering centers from over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network. And there's a huge opportunity there to reduce costs structurally.","So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. They've done a heck of a job over the last six years or seven years taking overhead costs out. Their SG&A is like 5%. So right now, for Pratt, it's about probably adding capacity. But we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere, from the corporate office, to the aftermarket, to the supply chain.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much, Greg.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Noah.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Morning","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Could you guys provide a little bit more detail on what you saw in the aerospace aftermarket in the quarter? It seems like the discussion around airline inventory pulling and used parts sales that had been headwinds has kind of faded. Curious if that's actually faded in your business. And any ability to sort of speak to what the growth rates were excluding anything you'd consider to be kind of non-reoccurring, whether it's provisioning or year-over-year comps or anything like that?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Sure, Noah. So I think the reported numbers would say UTAS commercial aftermarket grew by about 2%. But we had the benefit of four points from last year's contract closeouts. So I think the trend rate would be about 6%, which seems more in line with the normal world. We have always said that the long-term growth rate for commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single digit, and this quarter felt like that. There was some benefits in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of a point or so. So I think I would say a very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good. Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low-single-digit growth at UTAS, and we still feel comfortable with that.","On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are two factors driving it, one is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for the V2500 select five engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about eight years, and 50% of those engines had not come for overhaul, so they are starting to come into the shops now, which is helping on the commercial aftermarket there. I think overall, I would say it's sort of a normal, what you would expect kind of a trend in commercial aftermarket.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Noah.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So it basically sounds like Pratt is essentially down $400 million kind of full stop. And I guess if that's the case, and you have a little bit of extra pension going against you, will you guys kind of do your normal contingency and stuff like that? I mean, why wouldn't the high end of \u2013 it's kind of \u2013 with that profile, it's kind of tough to get to even a high end of the range in EPS that's above flat. I'm just trying \u2013 it just seems like there's the magnitude of headwinds now is you know pretty dramatic to overcome even at the high end of range.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Well, let's start with Pratt, Steve. And again, not to be more specific than we already have been, there is $400 million of headwind, but there will be growth in some of the other parts of the business to offset some of that for \u2013 at Pratt specifically. So we're not just going to mail in Pratt and say they're going to be down $400 million to start. We've got work to do there, and we'll continue to work through the end of the year to make sure we've wrung out every penny we can in terms of their forecast for next year.","The other headwind, the pension headwind is real, but it's real today. We'll have to see where rates are at the end of the year. It moves us around a lot, as you can imagine. Obviously, this pension transaction that we did earlier this quarter is just our way to start trying to reduce that big liability that we got out there. We've got $1.7 billion off the books. But as I say, there's more to come there. I think we're going to continue to look for ways to immunize the plan to try to avoid some of the pressure that the interest rates put on us.","And interest rates is not just pension. It's all the other long-term liabilities also and costs. So we've got a long way to go on the plan. Clearly, we're going to see \u2013 we should see growth at CCS. We're pushing, obviously, the Aerospace Systems business to grow. They're going to have pension headwind though as well. And Otis, again, probably a tough year next year as we continue to invest in E&D and systems and all that, but we'll see. We're going to get benefits out of share count. We'll see. I think there's just a lot of moving pieces yet.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","And, Steve, we generally have this specific discussion later in the year, and we will still have that. We are in the middle of our planning process right now. So I won't necessarily make a comment on where the high end of the range would be, but I can tell you that definitely, we would like to have a contingency because I think that plays well for us. Bad things do happen in the year, and we just want to make sure we don't surprise the investors in any way.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, no. I think that's smart, too, obviously. I'm just kind of like adding up all these \u2013 you've kind of highlighted $700 million of \u2013 or $0.70 of kind of year-over-year headwinds, and it just doesn't seem like there's a lot of good guys out there. So just wanted to make sure that I was kind of not missing any kind of major good guy moving parts. What was the revenue adjustment at Pratt & Whitney in the quarter? Some contract \u2013 customer contract adjustments or something?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","It's also part of that ongoing customer contract negotiations, Steve. So that's pretty normal for us to see that, where the sales adjustment comes as part of the collaboration accounting that happens on the risk revenue sharing partners.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question. Just what's the delivery forecast for GTF next year? Units?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","So, I won't give you a specific number. I will tell you that we expect more than double. So probably north of 300 units, 350 units.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, I was wondering if I could follow up on Pratt for a second. So the implied margin rebound in the fourth quarter, a couple hundred basis points plus given you'll be delivering more GTFs. Just kind of what's giving you confidence that you can get out of the 11s you've been putting up for the last few?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Well, I think you're right about the negative engine margin. I'm not sure how you are calculating the fourth quarter margin rate.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Down low-single digits \u2013 I'm sorry, up low-single digits for sales?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then fourth quarter implied, $470 million of EBIT?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Right. Right.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","There is \u2013 yeah, we can talk more offline, Myles, on that one, but I think there is \u2013 I mean, I \u2013 you know the factors which are going to impact Pratt in the fourth quarter. The negative engine margin is one. We don't see E&D coming down that much in the fourth quarter. There is obviously some benefit at Pratt Canada. We continue to see FX good news, pension good news. Net-net, the math would get you to the fourth quarter number, which is easy to calculate now.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. And then the only other one, Akhil, a clarification on the pension. So $200 million of a headwind, is that a headwind net of the $150 million that pension was supposed to decline in 2017, so it's only a...","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Right. No, it is net, Myles. It was supposed to decline by $100 million, not $150 million. I think we talked about that before. So this is the net because just the discount rate change in U.K. and U.S. is pretty significant, as you know, right? It's not just U.S., the U.K. has seen significant reduction in discount rates as well, and we have a pretty significant pension liability in U.K. markets as well. So it's a combination of that. The $200 million is the net number based on discount rates today. As Greg said, that can change again depending on what happens with the Fed and what happens on December 31.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","Hi, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, Akhil. I was looking for a bit of an update at Otis on the price actions you've taken, where you think we are, how more there is to go, and what impact, Greg, you think you've seen on market share as a result. Thanks.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So in terms of market share, the key thing, David, there is \u2013 the biggest market, as you know, is China. We see China has about 50% of the new equipment market still. In terms of units, it's even larger. And there \u2013 based on the data that we have talked about for the three quarters, our unit orders have been up 3%, where we firmly believe the market has been down 5% or more. So clearly, we're seeing some benefits in the market share on \u2013 in the China business.","I would say even though the data is not quite there from industry overall, but given the strength we have been seeing in our orders in Americas, we have been doing extremely well there, and I would venture that we are gaining significant share in Americas. And then in Europe, the order rates of up 21% this quarter would suggest that, again, we are probably doing better than market. So net-net, the initiatives that Philippe has laid out, particularly on the new equipment side, are starting to show up this year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","And just to follow up, in terms of further price actions, how much more do you think there is to go, I guess, thinking about 2017 relative to 2016?","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Yeah, I think pricing has been very, very difficult for the last couple of years in China. We've been talking about that. We actually started to see some stability here in the third quarter on pricing as the market continues to be relatively robust, especially in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.","Pricing is an issue really across the Otis portfolio, but is obviously most acute in China. U.S., I think we get \u2013 we're doing a little bit better. Pricing in Europe continues to be tough, and I think we continue to lose a little bit of pricing on the service portfolio every quarter.","So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness so we see the cancellation rates come down, and we also improve the productivity of the field workforce. So there's a lot to do at Otis. It's not just about pricing. There are some structural things we need to do, but I think Philippe and team are on the right track.","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","And keep in mind, David, that the China team for Otis particularly is very good at taking costs out from the supply chain as well. While we see pricing pressure every year, they've also been able to extract cost reductions from supply chain. So they will continue to do that. They continue to push productivity in the factories there, and they will offset at least part of the pricing pressure that we have seen.","Q3 pricing was not any worse than what we had seen year-to-date, so it seems to be stabilizing a little bit. Still much higher than what we saw last year, but down 7% to 9% as opposed to the 4% to 5% that we used to see before.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. I guess one of my questions would be around Aerospace Systems. You gave a lot of color obviously on Pratt, the commercial OE headwind there for next year. How are you thinking about Aero Systems, particularly around the nacelle side?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","So I think great question, Julian. We've got \u2013 we've always said that for Aerospace Systems, the adverse mix would be the most \u2013 the biggest headwind in 2017. It starts to become better from 2018 onwards. But the UTAS team is also working very aggressively on cost reductions. You can see it from this year's performance, they're doing extremely well with regard to the plan that they briefly (58:37) laid out. They're very much on track with it. And I think the same thing will hold for next year.","They will be offsetting a large part of this adverse mix issue that they have with the changeover from legacy platforms to the new generation aircraft with the sort of lower margin products replacing high margin legacy products. But we do expect UTAS to do very well in terms of being able to offset a large part of that mix in 2017.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. And then just my last one as I know it's running late. It's just around Otis again. The implied guidance for Q4, you've got much less of a decline in EBIT than what you've seen so far this year. Is that just a result of the easy comp because the margin last Q4 was so weak? Or do you feel that you're getting sort of around the bulk of headwinds now on E&D and re-investment in that business?","Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.","No. I think it's more of what you said first, which is easier comps in fourth quarter. If you remember, this quarter, we had the negative adverse impact of the FX mark-to-market adjustments. Last year in fourth quarter, it had gone the other way. So therefore, we get some easier compares, which are relatively easy to forecast, and that's why we feel comfortable with the Otis guidance for the year.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","And I think just to add just a bit of color there, Julian, the fact is these fixes that we're talking about at Otis, this is nothing you're going to see come through in the P&L right away. I mean even if we improve on the new equipment side, we will put those \u2013 it takes us 18 months to install the elevators. We give free service for a year. You're really talking two years to three years out before you really start to see big traction on the new equipment side.","Service and productivity would be a little bit faster. But again, we're making more investments than we're seeing on the productivity side initially. So a little bit of patience on the Otis side I think, but on the right track.","Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.","All right. I want to thank everybody for listening in today. I appreciate that. As always, Akhil and the Investor Relations team will be available all day to answer your calls. I'd ask that you go easy on our new guy, Caroll Lane, as he comes up to speed, but I'm sure he's looking forward to meeting with each and every one of you.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carroll Lane, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. ","Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and\/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. ","The company also reminds the listeners that their earnings and cash flow expectations and other -- any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its Forms 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions].","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. As you probably saw in the press release this morning, I think the numbers pretty well speak for themselves, a really, really good quarter and a really solid 2018. So we're all happy, I think, of the way the year ended. This morning, I'd like to cover 4 different things. Of course, we'll go through 2018, and I'll start and have Akhil take you through some of the business unit detail. After that, we're going to talk a little bit about 2019, our guidance for the year. Akhil will go through the detail on that. Let me come back at the end and talk about the portfolio separation activities to give you really an update on where we are from both a schedule and a cost standpoint. And then lastly, a few words on the integration of Rockwell Collins. ","So let's start on 2018. Obviously, sales and earnings, significantly above our expectations that we had going into the year and even above what our expectations were in November when we last updated guidance. The beat, of course, was driven in large part by a lower effective tax rate. And those were really the results of the finalization of some rulings -- rules from Treasury that happened late in the year. And I think, importantly, the beat was also driven by a much better Rockwell Collins performance after the acquisition. ","So we reported adjusted EPS of $7.61. That's up 14% versus last year. I think, most importantly, the organic sales was 8 -- up 8% for 2018. That's our best year over a decade for organic growth. Importantly, of course, each of the businesses reported accelerated organic growth versus 2017, with Pratt & Whitney leading the way, up 14%. ","Free cash flow, just essentially in line with our forecast at $4.4 billion, and it sets us up for a very strong cash performance in 2019, which Akhil will take you through in just a minute. So again, across the board, good results. Following along on the webcast on Slide 2. A lot happened in 2018, I want to tell everyone listening here. It was really a transformational year for us at UTC. First of all, with the completion of the Rockwell Collins acquisition. And this will position our Collins Aerospace Systems business to be the premier systems supplier in the aerospace industry for years to come. ","In our commercial businesses, we continued to invest in innovation. And for the fourth year in a row, Carrier introduced more than 100 new products, and that contributed to their 6% organic revenue growth. Otis, of course, continued to invest in service transformation, which will enable efficiency gains as you think about the management of those 2 million units that we have on our service portfolio. And at Pratt, GTF production continued to ramp up successfully, nearly doubled GTF production from our 2017 levels. And I think, most significantly, we announced our intention to separate the UTC portfolio with the 3 industry-leading companies. We'll talk more about that at the end after Akhil takes you through the numbers. ","Moving on to Slide 3. We're clearly pleased with the results in 2018, but quite frankly, the focus right now is about 2019. The priorities, of course, in addition to the integration of Rockwell Collins into our Aerospace Systems business and the separation activities, has really not changed from the prior years. We're going to continue to focus on growth through innovation. We're going to take a hard look at costs. And I guess, most importantly, we're going to be executing on our commitments to customers, and we'll remain disciplined in our allocation of capital. At the same time, of course, we continue to monitor the macro environment. ","As you'll see and think about the aerospace business, this year will represent almost 60% of UTC's revenues. Really solid trends in aerospace across the board, continued RPM growth, production increases are coming at both Boeing and Airbus. So in the aerospace side, we feel really good. On the commercial side, it's more of a macro story. With North America, the U.S. again, really, really pretty good outlook for this year off the back of some strong orders that we saw in 2018. ","Europe, it's a watch item. They have been saying that for about 15 years. We still expect it to grow modestly. But again, I think there's always a question in Europe in terms of overall growth, certainly not as strong as the U.S. In China and Asia, again, continued growth. In China, probably on the back of additional infrastructure spending. But again, growth in China and Asia. So in total, for 2019, we expect sales growth -- organic sales growth of 3% to 5%, on top of the 8% that we saw in 2018. We also expect continued earnings growth, with adjusted earnings per share of $7.70 to $8. Importantly, we expect each of our 4 businesses to grow operating profit, continuing the momentum from 2018. ","As you saw, Otis did grow our profits in the fourth quarter, which is a solid starting point for continued growth in 2019. At Carrier, Pratt and Collins Aerospace, they're all well positioned to continued operating profit growth, adding to their gains in '18. ","Akhil will take you through more detail on 2019 in just a few slides, but let me hand it over to Carroll to talk about the fourth quarter results. Carroll?","Carroll Lane","Okay. Thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 4. Q4 was another solid quarter for UTC. Reported sales of $18 billion were up 15%, including 11% organic growth and 4 points of acquisition benefit. Foreign exchange was a 1 point headwind in the quarter. That follows tailwinds earlier in the year. Adjusted EPS of $1.95, up $0.35, were 22% versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.83, up 66% versus prior year. Restructuring was an $0.11 charge, and we had $1.01 of nonrecurring charges in the quarter, including a $692 million tax charge, primarily related to undistributed foreign earnings. ","As you saw on our press release table, the Q4 adjusted effective tax rate was 15.9%. Note, this reflects a true-up to the full year adjusted effective tax rate, which ended at 22.1%. That's significantly favorable to our lowered expectation of 24.5% for 2018, and the favorability was largely driven by U.S. tax reform-related updates issued throughout the year, including clarifications from the U.S. Treasury in the last quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion, taking our full year cash generation to $4.4 billion. ","Now with that, I'll move on to the segment results. I'll be speaking to those results at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there's an appendix on Slide 19 with additional segment data as a reference. Starting with Otis on Slide 5. Sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, up 5% organically. On a constant-currency basis, new equipment sales grew 4%. Mid-teen growth in Asia, excluding China, and mid-single-digit growth in Europe were partially offset by low single-digit declines in both North America and China. Service sales were up mid-single digits, with growth in repair, modernization and maintenance. ","Organic new equipment orders were flat in the quarter. Orders in North America grew 10%, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Europe and a high single-digit decline in Asia, excluding China. In China, orders were up 2%, with the market stabilizing from a price and mix standpoint. So that continues the trend we've seen throughout 2018. Operating profit at Otis was up 7% at constant currency, marking the first quarter of earnings growth since Q3 2015. The benefit from higher new equipment and service sales volume more than offset higher input costs as well as unfavorable pricing and mix, largely from China. Foreign exchange translation was a 3-point headwind to sales and earnings. For the full year, Otis' operating profit declined $64 million at actual FX on 3% higher organic sales. ","Turning to Slide 6. Carrier sales were up 6% organically. The growth was across the board. Strong demand in HVAC and transport refrigeration end markets continued in the fourth quarter. North America residential HVAC was up 12%, and global refrigeration was up 7%. Carrier equipment orders grew 3% organically in the quarter. North America HVAC continued to be strong, with residential orders up mid-teens and commercial orders up 6%. Transport refrigeration orders grew 12%, with over 50% growth in the North America truck trailer business, partially offset by contraction in container after being up 48% in the fourth quarter of last year. Fire and security product orders were up 4%. ","Europe commercial HVAC was down 23% in the quarter. That's after being up 20% last year. For the first time this year, pricing more than offset input cost headwinds. Margin contribution from organic volume and the restructuring benefits was partially offset by the divestiture of Taylor and unfavorable mix. Carrier grew profit 3% in the quarter, excluding the impact of the Taylor divestiture. ","Looking at the full year, Carrier saw a 6% organic sales growth. That's the best year of organic growth since 2011. Carrier's operating profit grew $65 million at actual FX. ","Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 7. Sales of $5.5 billion were up 24% and up 22% organically, driven primarily by higher GTF and F135 shipments and commercial aftermarket growth. Commercial OEM sales were up 74%, driven by 165% growth in large commercial engines. Total Geared Turbofan shipments, including those at the spare engine pool, continued to increase sequentially and nearly doubled over the prior year fourth quarter. ","Pratt & Whitney Canada OEM sales were up 14%, with shipments growing year-over-year and sequentially. Military sales were up 17%, driven by F135 production and higher aftermarket. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11%, as the large engine aftermarket continues to benefit from strength in the V2500. ","Adjusted operating profit of $340 million was down 13%. Strong commercial and military aftermarket were more than offset by higher GTF negative engine margin on favorable OEM mix and FX at Pratt Canada, higher E&D and SG&A. For the full year, organic sales were up 14%, with $61 million in operating profit growth. Higher commercial aftermarket as well as drop-through from growth in military OEM and aftermarket sales were partially offset by higher negative engine margin and ramp-related investments. ","Turning to Slide 8, our new segment, Collins Aerospace. These results include legacy Aerospace Systems and 5 weeks of legacy Rockwell Collins. Sales in the quarter were $4.9 billion, including 9% organic growth, with operating profit of $721 million. ","Within legacy Aerospace Systems, organic commercial aftermarket sales were up 8%. Parts and repair were up 10% and 14%, respectively. And provisioning declined by 2%, as expected, due to lower intercompany sales to Pratt & Whitney. ","Commercial OEM sales grew 9% organically, driven by new production programs, primarily the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs. Military sales were up 12% organically, driven by strong aftermarket and higher F-35 volume. Legacy Aerospace Systems operating profit grew 6%. Drop-through on the higher organic sales and benefits from product cost reduction more than offset mix headwind and SG&A spend. Legacy Rockwell Collins contributed $778 million of sales in the quarter, with better-than-expected profit and cash flow. As a result of the better business performance as well as lower amortization and other expenses, dilution to UTC earnings in the quarter was approximately $0.03 of EPS versus our prior expectation of $0.10. ","On a full year basis, legacy Aerospace Systems delivered 8% organic sales growth and 10% operating profit growth, driven by strong execution on product cost reduction and a growing aftermarket business. ","With that, I'll hand it over to Akhil, who will provide more detail on the 2019 outlook. Akhil?","Akhil Johri","Thanks, Carroll. So I'm on Slide 9. As Greg said, the economic environment looks good from our perspective, certainly on the aerospace side of the business. On the macroeconomic side, for the commercial businesses, we expect the economies to continue to grow though at a slightly moderating rate versus 2018. U.S. growth remains strong. Housing starts and commercial construction are projected to be up again in 2019. Inflation remains under check, and consumer spending is still robust. ","In China, GDP growth is projected to again exceed 6%, including continued infrastructure spending, which is good news for both Otis and Carrier. Europe, on the other hand, we have seen lower order rates recently for our commercial businesses, and we continue to watch that region carefully. ","End markets in aerospace remain solid. Revenue passenger miles are projected to grow about 6% in 2019, on top of 6.5% in '18. Once again, these are all above the long-term growth trajectory of 5%. We expect the 2019 narrowbody aircraft deliveries to increase versus the 2018 levels, and global airline profitability outlook remains healthy. These trends, coupled with strong defense spending, should drive good organic top line growth once again at both Pratt and Collins Aerospace. On the other hand, the stronger U.S. dollar will be a headwind in 2019. Our assumptions for 2 of the key FX rates are in the box on the lower left-hand side of the chart. In total, we have around $550 million of sales and $75 million of operating profit headwind from FX translation included in our 2019 outlook. ","On Slide 10, you see the 2019 segment outlooks. As Greg highlighted, all 4 businesses are expected to grow operating profit in 2019 on a constant-currency basis. As usual, the appendix has detailed sales and EBIT walks for the segment outlooks, which you might find useful. Let's start with Otis. We expect low to mid-single-digit organic growth in 2019 for both new equipment and service. China new equipment is projected to be up high single digit as the higher 2018 year-end backlog converts to sales. We also expect a stable new equipment market in China in 2019 and a faster conversion of new orders into sales. ","North America new equipment sales will also benefit from strong 2018 orders. And the Europe service business is expected to grow low single digits, slightly better than the 1% growth we saw in 2018. On profit, we anticipate Otis to be up $25 million to $75 million at constant currency, driven by significantly lower price\/mix headwind and the benefits from volume and productivity. Translational FX will be a headwind of $300 million to sales and $50 million to operating profit. Keep in mind, this will be a disproportionate impact in the first half. Also, favorable mark-to-market adjustments in Q1 last year will be a headwind for Otis this quarter. At Carrier, organic sales are expected to grow low to mid-single digit. We expect continued growth in North America residential and global commercial HVAC and strong backlog conversion in transport refrigeration. Our outlook is for operating profit to be up $125 million to $175 million at constant currency. Volume-related drop-through, pricing and productivity should more than offset input cost headwinds, which include an incremental $65 million of net tariff impact. ","At Pratt & Whitney, sales are expected to be up high single digits. GTF volumes will continue to ramp in 2019, and we expect to see higher Pratt Canada shipments as well. Commercial aftermarket should grow mid-single digits, primarily driven by continuing V2500 growth and GTF activity, partially offset by declines related to the legacy engines. The military business will see benefits from higher Joint Strike Fighter engine shipments and strong aftermarket. On the profit side, we expect Pratt operating profit to increase $200 million to $250 million, driven by growth in commercial aftermarket and military. Negative engine margin is expected to be flattish compared to 2018 as we have previously discussed. ","Collins Aerospace is expected to grow reported sales by more than 50%, with the acquisition of Rockwell contributing over $8 million -- $8 billion to the year. On an organic basis, sales are expected to be up mid-single digit in commercial OE and military and low to mid-single digit in commercial aftermarket, in spite of tough compares on provisioning, which was up mid-teens in 2018. Operating profit is expected to be in the range of $4.2 billion, up $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion versus the prior year. Legacy Rockwell Collins is expected to contribute nearly $1.35 billion of the year-over-year operating profit growth. Remember, this is incremental to the over $100 million profit contribution for 1 month in 2018. ","And as you will see from the operating profit walk in the appendix, synergy savings in the year are expected to contribute around $150 million to the bottom line, a solid start to our goal of achieving $500 million over four years. So overall, a solid segment outlook for 2019 with all segments contributing. ","On Slide 11, you'll see our EPS walk for 2019. The segments are expected to add $1.85 of EPS at the midpoint of their outlook range. Pension will be an $0.08 tailwind. That's driven by $0.14 from Rockwell Collins. Tax and minority interest will be a $0.17 headwind. Our adjusted effective tax rate in 2019 is expected to be between 23% and 24% versus the 22.1% we got in 2018. This is primarily driven by the full phase-in of the U.S. tax reform for our international entities, specifically the impact of the duty provisions. Interest expense will be a $0.68 headwind, largely driven by nearly 11 months of incremental expense on the $11 billion of debt incurred for the Rockwell Collins acquisition and the $8 billion of debt acquired as part of the transaction. ","In terms of other big items below the segment profit level, corporate expense, elims and other will be a $0.15 headwind, largely due to a few onetime gains in 2018 and continued investments in our digital capabilities. Higher share count, driven by Rockwell Collins' acquisition, will be a $0.58 headwind in 2019. We now expect our weighted average diluted share count to be around 870 million shares based on our final 2018 ending share count. ","Finally, as usual, our EPS range of $7.70 to $8 includes contingency to account for the unexpected. It is about $110 million at the midpoint. As you can see on the chart, we now expect Rockwell Collins accretion to be approximately $0.35 in 2019. The improvements on the $0.15 to $0.20 we discussed in November is driven by two items, one, synergies are higher in 2019; and two, intangible amortization is approximately $100 million less than the anticipated at the time of the close. You would also note, our 2019 EPS range includes approximately $0.50 of expense from Rockwell Collins-related intangible amortization. ","So overall, we feel very good about the 2019 EPS outlook with significant segment operating profit growth and solid accretion from Rockwell Collins, partially offset by higher tax rate and interest expense, FX headwind and absence of some onetime gains. With regard to calendarization, we expect segment operating profits in Q1 to be around 22% of full year, similar to what we saw last year. However, primarily due to the absence of a few onetime gains below the line, specifically the $0.05 of gain we had in Q1 last year in the elims, 2019 first quarter adjusted EPS will be slightly below 2018. ","Moving to Slide 12. Just a few comments on our cash outlook before I turn it back over to Greg. As we have said previously, we fully expect to see acceleration on our cash generation going forward. For the legacy UTC business, we expect our 2019 free cash flow to grow by 24% at the midpoint of our outlook range, up from $4.3 billion in 2018, excluding Rockwell Collins. ","Now I know several of you have questions regarding legacy Rockwell's cash performance in 2018. As you can see, the legacy Rockwell Collins business is expected to generate a solid and above-normal $1.4 billion of free cash flow in 2019. That is on top of the roughly $300 million cash inflow in December 2018, which historically, as you will see if you study Rockwell Collins, was a period of cash outflow for the legacy business. So bottom line, heritage Rockwell Collins businesses are performing very well on all of the key financial metrics. ","So all this gets us to a free cash flow of $6 billion to $6.5 billion before the onetime cash payments associated with portfolio separation activities. We expect these to be around $1.5 billion in 2019. ","With that, let me hand it back over to Greg. Greg?","Gregory Hayes","Great. Thanks, Akhil. Hope you guys got all that. Obviously, a lot to digest. I think -- again, the 2 key takeaways though. '18, really solid performance, better than what we expected. But really, it's the culmination of the investments that we've been making, especially on the aerospace side. And what we expect in '19 is a continuation of the same. So again, really, really solid performance. Let me just add a couple of comments about the portfolio separation and then Rockwell Collins. So as you think about it today, we currently have about 15 separate teams with about 330 people working the separation process. That number is going to ramp up to about 500 people in the next few months. ","Based on the work we've done over the last 2 months, we now see a path to achieve the separation in no more than about 18 months. The focus of the team, though, is to be operationally ready for separation by the end of this year. That means all the systems are in place and all the process is in place to actually be able to run separate companies at both Otis and Carrier and the remaining UTC. ","Unfortunately, the ultimate timing of the spin will be subject to tax rulings. We've talked about this before. There's a couple of jurisdictions that have some relatively significant tax costs, absent favorable tax rulings. So we're going to work through those things, but we really need to get those tax rulings to minimize the onetime costs. And that's why -- what really drives the 18-month kind of time line. So if you think about this, we announced late last year, November, this would push the time line. So it plays out to around May or so of 2020 to be complete. Obviously, we're pushing to get it done a lot faster or released by the end of the year. I think that's not likely, but we're going to keep pushing. ","With regard to separation costs, there has been a lot of concern about that, $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Let me give you a little color on where that is going to come from. First of all, 3 big categories of costs. The largest, of course, is the tax cost of the whole separation activity, paying transfer tax and other types of taxes in a number of jurisdictions around the world. We think that, that could amount to almost $2 billion. Obviously, we're going to work to minimize that. But for today, we've got a placeholder of $2 billion. Transaction costs, about $500 million. Again, that's all of the people working on these teams. That's the outside folks that are giving us a hand as well as all the internal resources to restructure about 1,200 legal entities that we have within UTC, put the IT systems in place, to put the treasury systems in place, et cetera. So that's about $500 million. ","And the last big chunk of cost will be debt refinancing. We think that's about $300 million. It will depend, of course, about what the markets look like at the end of this year, given what the interest rate differential is. But for today, we've got a placeholder of $3 million. Obviously, the focus is to minimize all of these costs. ","We're also trying to minimize the recurring cost that Otis and Carrier will incur as stand-alone entities. You remember we talked about that being a $350 million to $400 million negative synergies associated with the separation. I would tell you that both Judy at Otis and her team and Bob at Carrier and his team are focused on how we can minimize those costs, how we can actually not see that type of cost growth there, looking at the structural cost-reduction activities to minimize these costs, but also to give themselves cost runway going forward. ","Obviously, we're also going to look to reduce cost at what's the remaining UTC. As I said before, about 40% of UTC's current revenue goes away, meaning that we're going to have to be doing -- taking reductions along those lines here at the corporate office as well. As we move through the year, we'll provide additional detail on both the separation costs as well as the onetime costs as we get some more clarity there. ","Finally, of course, I think this is a concern back in November. We do remain open to strategic alternatives on the commercial businesses should there be a real value-enhancing opportunity out there that's going to create long-term shareholder value above that which the separation was going to provide. So we're still out there. We're still listening. And at the same time, we're working very hard to get the separation done. ","On Rockwell Collins integration, let me just say 2 things. First of all, we are on track, and there are no surprises. And the operating unit management teams under Kelly Ortberg and Dave Gitlin, which we announced late last year, are working well together. I think, again, you saw that in the better-than-expected Collins performance in December, but the teams really are focused. We've been out having customer visits, conversations with all the major OEMs and airline customers. And we've had clear alignment on the actions and the opportunities. ","And now that the teams from both businesses have been able to work on the cost synergy, we're even more confident in our ability to deliver $500 million in cost synergies as a result of the combination in the first 4 years. As with everything else at UTC, we're going to push harder on that number. We'll come back as we did with Goodrich. We started at $350 million and ended at $600 million. We're going to continue to look for additional opportunities beyond that $500 million. ","We're also looking at revenue synergies. The team has identified some revenue synergies already. They're really focused on those key trends around autonomy, a more electric aircraft and a more connected aircraft. I think, just as importantly though, we expect very strong cash flows out of the legacy Rockwell Collins business -- the Rockwell or the Collins Aerospace business going forward. As Akhil mentioned, about $1.3 billion better than this year, which means about $1.4 billion of cash coming out of Rockwell Collins this year. So I know there were some concerns a couple of months ago, let me just tell you, we are on track. There is no surprise here. We have a great property and a great group of people that have joined us with Rockwell Collins. ","Of course, as we work through the separation process, our focus is still on delivering to our customers first and foremost and executing on all the other priorities that we have talked about. ","So with that, I think the filibuster has ended. Why don't we open up the call to your questions? Amanda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just two quick things from me. First, on separation. I totally get everything you just said. It sounds though, guiding $1.5 billion here in 2019, that you actually are going to get some of the bigger, stickier tax things done this year. Is that a correct way to interpret that? And then separately, just kind of on the whole strategic discussion on the commercial businesses. Does the retention of Chubb, in your view, in any way complicate doing something strategic with Carrier, maybe preclude a permutation or 2? Or you don't see that as kind of relevant to kind of the potential chess moves that could happen?","Gregory Hayes","Well, you didn't follow the rules, Jeff. That's 2 questions, but we're going to answer both of them. First of all, on the $1.5 billion of onetime cash cost this year, I would tell you that's a placeholder. I can't -- and Akhil and I have been back and forth with the tax folks as we look at this and some of the others. Obviously, the separation cost for the teams, that's pretty well known, we'll incur a big chunk of that this year. That might be $300 million out of that $500 million. But as far as the debt refinancing, that will be a part of wherever we actually go to market. And then the other piece on the tax will depend really on getting these tax rulings. I would tell you we'll give you visibility every quarter to what we're doing here. But again, it's a placeholder. Whether it happens all this year or some of that spills into next year, I don't know. Akhil, any other...","Akhil Johri","No. I think you're exactly right. If anything, Jeff, the tax cost and some of the other costs will probably be later in the year. The transaction costs are happening every day. Everyday, we've got -- perhaps sometimes I feel there are more consultants around in this building than there are actual employees. But still, it's -- we are moving at a very fast pace and hope to get as much done as possible, at least operationally. And then some of the tax stuff will happen when it happens, unfortunately, a little outside of our control.","Gregory Hayes","Yes. Let me just make a comment on the Chubb potential divestiture. We saw an opportunity last year where the market's relatively frothy to take a look at a potential divestiture of the Chubb field business. And keep in mind, this is a business of roughly $2.5 billion in sales about a -- with a roughly 10% operating margin. This business was not broken. This business, we thought, perhaps would benefit from a different ownership in terms of the ability to consolidate more of the space. We went through the process. I think everybody knows the markets got really choppy in November and December. And quite frankly, we weren't going to give the business away. We've got new management in place with the Chubb business today. I talked to Bob yesterday about it. We're going to keep the business. And I don't think it really impacts anything from a strategic standpoint. Again, it is a solid business. It's not going to present any challenges if there is a consolidation opportunity out there later on. So we like the fundamentals of the business. We've probably under-invested in it though over time, so there will be a little bit more incremental investment. But we've got a good team, and it's got a good footprint, and we're going to run it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald Epstein","Greg, if you could speak to -- you mentioned, just kind of going back to one of your comments, that you met with customers and the OE. Specifically with the OEs, to get them to kind of fall in line with you guys or in Collins, how did you get them to do that? Like, an investor question -- I guess, another way to say it, a question we've been getting is what did UTC have to give up to get Boeing to sign this deal? I know you can't specifically answer that, but can you broadly speak to what you had to do to kind of get everybody in line and say \"Yes, this is a good idea\"?","Gregory Hayes","So let me be clear, UTC didn't have to do anything at the end of the day in terms of getting Boeing or Airbus to do the deal. Rockwell Collins, prior to the completion of the acquisition, they did enter into an arrangement with Boeing. But really, it was more tied up in PFS and some longer-term incentives to Boeing to select more Rockwell Collins product. At the end of the day, I think both Boeing and Airbus understand that we, as systems suppliers to those 2 big companies, can really provide benefits to them long term in terms of the innovation, the technology that we bring to bear. But they weren't easy discussions. I think, obviously, when your supplier gets to be really big, people always get concerned. But the fact is, we still compete every single day at every single system that we provide to both Boeing and Airbus. And our goal, as we told both Tom Enders and Dennis Muilenburg, is to be the best Aerospace Systems supplier we can possibly be. So those conversations aren't always easy, and it's a little bit of show me out there. But I would tell you, Kelly Ortberg understands, Dave Gitlin understands, that whole organization understands that they need to deliver other commitments. And if we do that, I don't think there's going to be a lot of noise in the system.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Tusa","Can you maybe just provide a little bit more around the components of the Collins accretion? And then one last one, on free cash flow. Just a little bit of guidance on some of the below the operating line stuff, like customer financing activities, collaborations, intangibles, that kind of stuff.","Akhil Johri","Sure. So I think if you look at the appendix, Steve, you'll see the Collins operational profit incrementally is about $1.35 billion or so, roughly. Then you adjust against that the intangibles amortization, the interest costs associated with the debt, the integration cost, et cetera, and that's how we get to the $0.35. So it's essentially looking at what we would have -- what we have got from Rockwell Collins incrementally after allowing for the interest, after allowing for the intangibles amortization, about $0.50, as I said, and after allowing for all the synergies and integration costs. So that's the net math. The difference between the $0.15 to $0.20 we were expecting and the $0.35, as I said earlier, largely came from a little better operating performance, a little better synergies and largely from the lower intangibles, which have been finalized over purchase accounting as we went through. Now that number could change a little bit, but I think we are pretty much done with purchase accounting. With regard to your question on customers financing and intangibles -- not intangibles, but other items below the line, below free cash flow, it's generally in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. I think it'll probably be somewhere in that range again this year. You'll see that in our K, which will come out, I think, this year. That number was more like $800 million, so somewhere in that range, the 2 together is what you should take into account in your cash models.","Charles Tusa","Okay. One last question for you. What are you seeing in Carrier in China compared with Otis?","Akhil Johri","Yes. Carrier was also good growth. Actually, it was double-digit growth in the fourth quarter for the commercial HVAC business. The fire and security products business in Carrier had struggled a little bit earlier in the year, but I think the comps got a little easier by fourth quarter. So our outlook is to grow probably low to mid-single digits again next year. There has been good growth on the commercial HVAC side, a lot of it is infrastructure-related. But also, there, Carrier is seeing some strength in the other segments as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","Akhil, I wonder if you would dial a little bit more to the Otis margin and where you think it goes next. It looks like if I use the sort of FX normalized or FX adjusted, I guess, revenue and segment EBIT guidance, it looks like you're expecting the core margin to be flat to maybe even down a little bit. And I think you stated a lower price\/mix headwind, which sounds like still a price\/mix headwind. I would have thought that your comments on China OE price and Europe service since the last few quarters would suggest a better book translating to the P&L at this point. So maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what you're expecting there and how that progresses going forward.","Akhil Johri","Sure. So let's first talk about the price\/mix thing. I think again, in the appendix, you'll see we've got a price\/mix headwind of about $25 million in 2019. That compares to about $150 million that we saw in 2018. And in that number -- obviously, that's a composite number of a lot of the geographies. China, we believe, is flattish for 2019 from a price\/mix perspective. And we have seen that trend sort of in our orders this year, so that's consistent. We still have a little bit of negative pricing baked in for Europe service business because while that trend has been improving, it is not back to neutral yet. We still have slight -- we still saw a slight decline in Europe service pricing for Otis in 2018 on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that trend to improve but maybe a little bit less. So that's kind of the makeup of that. Overall, margins for Otis, I think we believe it's sort of flattens -- it troughs around 2018 level. We think '19 should be flattish. Our focus at Otis, as we have said many times, is on operating margin dollar growth, not the margin percent so much. Because the first step is to start growing earnings on a consistent basis. And then the next step will be to start growing earnings faster than sales. We do believe, longer term, Otis should look at mid- to high teen margins possibly again because that's the business which has the scale advantage related to its competitors. And if you have 2 million-plus units under maintenance, you have the benefit of density. You have the benefit of productivity that you can get. That all should drive higher margin differential versus competitors in Otis. So we still feel good. I know that it's still a long way to go. Otis, in our mind, is still work in progress. We still are in early stages of productivity from the investments we are making in the tools, but we do believe we are on the right track. And over time, we will see those benefits come through.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","So maybe sticking to the one-topic rule, really focused on Collins. You clarified the EBIT and EBITDA moving parts, but I wondered what your updated thoughts were on its organic sales growth for calendar '19. I think you talked about some issues in interiors last call. And also on the free cash flow bridge for Collins. If I look at Slide 12, it looks like it's about $1 billion of free cash after acquisition integration. Is that like-for-like versus the $500 million to $750 million that you talked about in November? And if so, what's the big step up outside of the extra synergies?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So second question first. I think that's exactly right. The $1 billion that you see now is actually compared to the $500 million to $750 million, and part of it is just the timing thing. Remember, you all were very concerned about the 2018 negative cash flow out of Rockwell Collins. Well, some of that was just goodness that came into as we finalized our plans for 2019, plus the goodness that you saw in the 1 month of $300 million positive cash flow in 2018 December, right? That traditionally, Julian, as you know very well, is a negative outflow quarter or a cash outflow quarter for Collins. So that's just a little bit of correction of some of the issues that you saw in 2018 10-K for Rockwell Collins. So fundamentally, all good there. No problems. We said that at that time, but nobody believed it. Hopefully, you do now. So that's all good there. The first question was about organic growth on Rockwell Collins. We believe the avionics business and the mission systems business should continue to grow, hopefully, around the mid- to high single-digit levels, so somewhere between what UTAS and what Pratt are experiencing -- are going to experience. The interiors business would be probably low to mid-single-digit type of growth there. Again, we expect some recovery in that business as well. Overall, business should be somewhere in the mid- to high single digit type of growth for Rockwell Collins on an organic basis.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Just following up on Julian, though. I think there was a piece there that's still missing on the 2019 Collins Bridge. I mean, obviously, you had a big benefit that you highlighted, Akhil, on the '18 recapture. But for your '19, clearly, that cash flow number sounds a little bit better and at least the EBIT delta came from amort, so that shouldn't have an impact on cash. So just wondering if there's any particular working capital items there worth noting. And then with respect to the outlook, I just wondered, across the aerospace portfolio, what's embedded in your assumptions around business aviation next year.","Akhil Johri","Sure, Carter. So again, look at the -- you would normally have expected about $1 billion from Rockwell Collins in '19, right? So that $1 billion is $1.4 billion, that shows the improvement. Plus the $300 million that you see in 2018, would have probably been negative 1 50 over the quarter. What you also don't see here is some goodness that we saw in the period, which is not included, which is the October-November time period. Cash in that period benefit from the early payment of the incentives in September that you saw in the 10-K, right? So you had the benefit in sort of the period which is not included in any results. You have the $300 million in the December period, positive as compared to the negative historically. And then you have $1.4 billion compared to what would otherwise have been a normal $1 billion or so. The sort of makes up for some of the weakness that you saw in 2018 10-K. So we feel pretty good. I think if there's some upside opportunity, I think Collins is going to continue to look for additional opportunities to see if they can do better in 2019. But clearly, we're on the right track. We don't see any issues, Carter, with cash generation at Rockwell Collins.","Carter Copeland","Great. And on bizav?","Akhil Johri","Yes. Bizav, we expect growth there. So Pratt Canada shipments are looking to grow again. We saw some level of growth this year. The markets that were weak within the Pratt Canada portfolio were the general -- the regional markets, to some extent. But the business jet market grew this year. Plus, keep in mind that we will benefit next year from big market share gain at Pratt Canada from the PW800 on the Gulfstream side, right, which is a platform where we never had an engine large business jets and now -- and particularly with Gulfstream, and now we have that. So I think the benefit of market share gain, along with improving sentiment, should be a positive number for our business jets.","Carter Copeland","Does that get you high singles kind of growth?","Akhil Johri","Yes, it does. For us. For us, yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on the -- Akhil, on the free cash flow for overall, I was hoping we could dig into it a little bit better of the underlying businesses. I think you said legacy UTX should be up double digits. What's really improving in 2019? And how do we think about working capital and any other moving pieces?","Akhil Johri","Sure. So some of the improvements, Sheila, are coming. As you see, capital expenditure is not really coming down, right? So a lot of this is coming from improvement in our working capital. I've been saying for many years now that as we get through some of this ramp up-related challenges, the inventory turns for the businesses should improve. We saw some improvement in the inventory turns for both Otis -- for all of UTC, but specifically for the aerospace companies in 2018. We expect that trend to continue in 2019. So even though there is good organic growth in '19, the call on inventory or the call on cash from inventory is not as high as it has been in the last few years. We should see improvements there. Carrier is focused on ensuring that their receivable days are improving. They have had an issue with overdues for a period of time that they are working on and are focused on. So they continue to work on that. And then Otis, as always -- I mean, Otis is a business where we don't talk much about working capital, but their turns are like 60 turns. And they continue to benefit from that strong cash profile that they have. So overall, I think it's more a function of the working capital improvement that we have been talking about for a while. And I think capital expenditures, hopefully, should start to decrease a little from 2020 onwards. So we're on a good trajectory here. And hopefully, you all can see that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Myles Walton of UBS.","Myles Walton","One clarification on Collins, if I could, Akhil. Maybe I misheard it. I thought you said $8 billion sales contribution in '19. And then in response to Julian's question, it was mid-single-digit kind of organic growth. And so just kind of curious, was there a rev rec that comes into play that kind of works against you in '19? Because I think they did $8.7 billion in fiscal '18.","Akhil Johri","Yes. So the $8 billion was incremental, right? So I think it's like $8 billion, $9 billion, roughly in that range. 8 was the -- I was rounding 8, and 8 is in incremental, not absolute numbers.","Myles Walton","Yes. Helpful. And then the other one, on -- I think you said that you're assuming a faster conversion rate for orders in China. I'm just curious how sensitive your assumptions are to that assumption, why you're assuming it. And then conversely, the assumption on low single-digit organic growth in aftermarket UTAS seems a bit conservative. And I was curious if you're seeing slowing book-to-bill trends there.","Akhil Johri","Sure. So on Otis first, Myles. Typically, about 60% of our current year sales come out of backlog. So that part is clearly there. So in terms of sensitivity, somewhere around 40% of the next year's sales are based on orders that Otis will be receiving that year. And based on some of the liquidity concerns that the market had overall seen in 2018, our expectation is that those conditions will improve a little bit, which will allow for a slightly better conversion. And this conversion rate is time between the booking of the order and the sale. So that's the belief there. Now could that be subject to some risk? Possibly. We do believe that the government's focus on infrastructure spending is going to help the market overall. It's in their interest to try and keep the GDP growth above 6%. So we don't feel that, that should be something that will come to fruition, but the range of risk would be on that 40%, to some extent, as I talked about. On the UTAS side, look, you were with us in 2015. And what we do not want to do is build a plan which again relies on a very strong provisioning in 2019 on top of very strong year in 2018. We had 14% growth, low-teens growth in 2018. So in our plan right now, what we assumed is that provisioning will be flattish for 2019. If that number turns out to be better than that, that will be good news. But at this point, we do feel that given the 787 maturity that's happening, even though the rates are increasing, but the provisioning for operator does tend to go down as more provisioning stock is accumulated as well as on the legacy platform, we see some pressure. No other change. The parts business and the repairs business should grow consistent with traffic, somewhere in the mid-single-digit range. So it's all about provisioning, Myles.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Just a quick clarification and then my question. On the breakup time line, does that apply to both spins? Or could one happen before the other? And therefore, that May deadline for 2020, is that the deadline for both spins or one could be done sooner? Just to clarify that. And then on the negative $25 million of price\/mix in Otis next year, can you just break that out between China and Europe?","Gregory Hayes","I will start out with the separation. Right now, the plan is to separate both Carrier and Otis at the same time. So the time line assumes that they both occur sometime end of the first and end of the second quarter. Unlikely, you would see a divergence from there. I think it's just much cleaner as we think about this to do everything at once in terms of the Forms 10s that have to filed, the roadshows, all of the activity around on the planning side, everything really needs to be done once and -- as opposed to trying to stagger these things. So our goal, get them both done at the same time.","Akhil Johri","And as early as possible because it's in everybody's interest to do it sooner rather than later. On the question about the price\/mix for Otis, the $25 million negative. China is flattish. So essentially, all of the $25 million is Europe service. There is some small noise in other quarters, but I would say, broadly speaking, that's probably what it is.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I don't know if this is going to be a quick question -- or a quick answer, but any comments on how the shutdown has been affecting the company broadly?","Gregory Hayes","That is a pretty quick answer. The fact is we have not seen any impact. And keep in mind, while we talk about a shutdown, it's a partially government shutdown. And the fact is the DoD budget is fully funded. So that means we're still shipping on parts to the DoD. We still have DCMA and all the other folks from the government in, inspecting products and all that stuff on a regular basis. So we have not seen an impact per se. Whether or not we get our 10-K review timing, that's something else. But at least for the business, really no impact from the shutdown.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.","Peter Arment","Greg, just why don't we finish on a real high note? It seems like you're making a lot of progress on the GTF and seeing -- maybe you could just give us an update on what we should expect in 2019. Obviously, a big step up in production in Q4.","Gregory Hayes","Yes, Peter. Thanks. It's interesting. We got all the way through the conference call with the final or near the final, ask the GTF question. I would tell you, the GTF, the durability continues to improve. The on-time perform -- or the performance of the engine, it's still like 99.89% or 99.88%. So a really good dispatch reliability. We continue to work through the teasing problems that we had talked about a year ago. There's still some aircraft out there that need to be retrofit. And there's always little niggling things that come up that affect a couple of engines, and we are always working through that. But that's the same on the V2500 that's been out there for 30 years. So we feel good. I think what's really important and you pointed it out is the production ramp increased. What we saw in the fourth quarter will continue. We're essentially on rate 65, I think, for Airbus this year. Whether or not we deliver all those engines, that will be determined by Airbus. But we feel good there. We've got engines going down in Embraer. We've got Mitsubishi out there still doing flight testing. But engine continues to progress, and we feel good about it. We took about 15% of the cost out last year, we'll take another 15% out this year. We're coming down the curve as we had expected. So good news is you shouldn't see a big jump in negative engine margin even though the production rate continues to increase.","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Greg Hayes for the closing remarks.","Gregory Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Amanda. Thank you, everyone, for listening. As always, of course, Carroll and team are here to answer all your questions. And look forward to seeing you folks, I guess, it will be in -- at Barclays in Miami in about another month or so. Have a great day. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"21360":["United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) Q3 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call October 21, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Greg Hayes - Senior Vice President and CFO","Jay Malave - Director, IR","Analysts","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Operator","Good morning and welcome to the United Technologies\u2019 Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.","Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items, as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thank you, Stephanie and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release today, UTC reported solid third quarter earnings per share of $2.04 and 5% organic sales growth. Gains, net of restructuring was $0.22 in the quarter, which is higher than previously expected largely due to the timing of some tax settlements in the third versus fourth quarter.","Excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items, earnings per share was up 12% and segment operating margins expanded by 60 basis points to 17.2% in the quarter, that\u2019s a record for UTC. With three quarters of the year now in the books, we can look back at a pretty good start, 4% organic growth and earnings per share up 11% year-to-date excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. As a result, we remained confident in our 2014 EPS expectation of 675 to 685 as earnings growth of 9% to 10% on sales of about $65 billion.","Okay. Turning to slide two, organic sales. You can see organic sales grew 5% in the quarter with solid growth across all five of our businesses. In the commercial businesses we saw 5% growth in the Americas led by 9% growth in North American residential HVAC as the U.S. economy continues to improve. In Europe, where the economic recovery is uncertain, organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. The commercial businesses also saw 7% growth in Asia. In China specifically sales were up 9% led by Otis, which was up 12%.","Shifting to Aerospace, for the first time this year, we did see growth in the military business which was up 3% led by development programs at Sikorsky and solid growth in commercial OE and aftermarket continued where overall sales increased by 9%.","Okay. Slide three. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our end markets. Overall trends remained positive for a majority of our portfolio. And just a reminder, we\u2019re going to talk to the commercial businesses on a constant currency basis as we typically do. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see momentum in North America. U.S. consumer sentiment reached to 14 months high in September on employment gains and optimism over wage growth.","As I mentioned before, North American residential HVAC sales were up 9% in the quarter and orders were up a multiple of that, very strong, but driven primarily by early order activity ahead of the [014] standard change that goes into reflected January 2015 for the southern and western regions of the U.S. Positive ABI trends continue and the outlook for commercial construction remains encouraging. And we saw proof of that in Otis where the North American new equipment orders were up almost 60% in the quarter. In Europe, a little different story, Europe zone PMI was 14-month low, although it did remain in modest expansion territory. And economic sentiment fell to a 10 month low in September as concerns over the economy increased. We\u2019re obviously keeping a close eye on the economic situation in Europe and we saw mixed orders there in the quarter. Commercial HVAC orders were actually down 11%, although we did see 15% growth in commercial refrigeration, and fire and security product orders grew by 12%.","Shifting to China and Otis, new equipment orders were flattish versus the prior year, reflecting the lower conversion of pipeline opportunities to book orders. However, new equipment backlog continues to remain strong at Otis and up 14% versus the prior year. Orders for CCS commercial HVAC and fire products were both down slightly in the quarter.","Earlier this month in a move to bolster the housing market, the Chinese government cut mortgage rates for second home buyers and lowered down payment rates to 30% from 60% to 70% previously. This actually marked the first time since the 2008, 2009 financial crisis that mortgage rates were reduced in China and signals the government\u2019s continued willingness to use fiscal policy to support growth. While we continue to expect growth in China will moderate, it should continue to outpace global GDP. And our Building and Industrial Systems businesses remain well positioned in the region.","Moving to Aerospace, with robust airline profits and ongoing growth in air traffic, we continue to see solid conversions of our original equipment backlogs and growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 7% in the quarter and large commercial engine spare orders were up 1%.","In our Aerospace Systems business, commercial aftermarket sales were up 10% and commercial spares orders were up 11%, reflecting strength in both parts and provisioning.","You\u2019ll notice on that chart that we\u2019re highlighting the new metric beginning this quarter that is commercial aftermarket sales for both Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems to better reflect the evolving business model from a transactional parts sales business to a comprehensive service business. We\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that on slide four and you can see that illustrated for Pratt.","Ten years ago only 10% of our engines were covered under our fleet management program or an FMP. As you can see we\u2019ve migrated, last year about 50% of the Pratt fleet was under an FMP. And this is going to continue to increase with time. The next generating engines, the GTFs were up about 80% of those engines covered under FMP or fleet management program. This creates value for our customers, the airlines as well as Pratt & Whitney. We\u2019re incentivized with the airlines to keep the engine on wing as long as possible and to improve reliability. As we\u2019ve entered into these FMPs, our customers have seen a significant improvement in reliability of the engines, because we were able to maintain those engines at an OEM standard.","So, over time we\u2019ll see a gradual decline in the transactional spare parts business, as the legacy fleet starts to retire. The good news is that you\u2019ve got the V2500 fleet and the new GTF fleet replacing those spare part sales with FMP sales. So, again, a changing business model and we\u2019ll continue talking about aftermarket sales growth going forward for both Pratt and Aerospace Systems, as it\u2019s a more meaningful metric.","Taking a closer look at the third quarter results, total sales reported increased 5% that\u2019s all organic, segment operating profit was up 8% and operating margins increased by 60 basis points including the benefit from pension. CCS saw the benefit from organic growth and cost reduction initiatives, where operating profit grew 9% leading to margin expansion of 110 basis points. Pratt & Whitney Aerospace Systems each expanded margins by 130 and 110 basis points respectively.","Earnings per share of $2.04, that\u2019s up 32% and of course that benefits of a $0.22 of favorable one-time items net of restructuring cost in the quarter. Recall the third quarter 2013 have $0.08 of net restructuring charges. So absent o the impact of these items of both 2013 and 2014, earnings per share were up 12%.","Free cash flow in the quarter was 83% of net income. Capital expenditures were $415 million and that\u2019s up 8% versus last year as we continue to invest for the ramp up in commercial aero. And investment and working capital grew in the quarter as well. We acquired $425 million of our stock under our share repurchase program and we now expect to buyback another $400 million in the fourth quarter and that will bring share repurchase to a total of about $1.5 billion for the year.","Let\u2019s stop there now. I\u2019ll be back to talk more about the full year and provide a glimpse of how we\u2019re thinking about 2015. But first, let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the segments.","Jay Malave","Thanks Greg. Turning to page 6, order sales improved 4% in the quarter led by a high single-digit new equipment sales growth most notably in China in the Middle East. Service sales were up low single-digit overall with solid mid single-digit growth in our businesses outside of Europe where we saw a slight decline in service sales in the quarter.","Operating profit was up 3% at constant currency. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contribution from volume and net productivity offset by continued pricing pressure. New equipment orders were up 4% in the quarter. New equipment orders in China were flattish reflecting a slower conversion of jobs in the pipeline to actual book business. We were encouraged by results in other areas especially the Americas where orders were up sharply for both the quarter and year-to-date, whereas new equipment orders in developed Europe were up mid single-digit in the quarter.","The recent strengthening of the dollar is creating headwind on Otis profit and we now expect profit to be up $50 million compared with previous earnings growth guidance of $100 million to $125 million. On a constant currency basis, we still expect Otis to grow profit by about $100 million for the year.","On slide 7, Climate Controls and Security increased profit 9% in the quarter and 3% higher sales. Margin expanded by 110 basis points from prior year to 18.2% continuing the CCS momentum and margin expansion.","Organic sales were up 4% with growth reported by all regions. We saw strength in the Americas with the residential HVAC business reporting 9% growth and commercial HVAC up mid single-digit. Outside of the U.S. both EMEA and Asia reported low single-digit growth. Commercial refrigeration was up mid single-digit, while Transicold was up slightly.","Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contribution from organic volume, as well as benefits from restructuring and integration savings. CCS global equipment orders were up 5% excluding the impact of the shift in order timing driven by the pending U.S. regional cooling efficiency standard change.","Orders for global fire and security products were up high single-digits more than offsetting flattish fire and security field businesses. Transicold orders were up low single-digit. Based on year-to-date results, we continued to expect profit growth of $225 million to $250 million for the full year at CCS on low single-digit organic sales growth.","Turning to Aerospace on Slide 8; Pratt & Whitney delivered solid results with 15% operating profit growth and 5% higher organic sales resulting in a 130 basis points of margin expansion. Higher aftermarket sales across the businesses including 7% combined growth in large commercial and Pratt Canada aftermarket more than offset declines in military OE.","Operating profit was driven by higher commercial aftermarket sales, favorable pension and restructuring benefits which more than offset higher E&D. The quarter also benefited from favorable aftermarket contract performance and licensing agreements which exceeded similar benefits from 2013. Large commercial spares orders were up 1% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially, building up the 7% sequential improvement in the second quarter. Year-to-date overall commercial aftermarket sales are up high single-digit, as industry fundamentals and demand remained solid. This supports our full year sales growth expectation for the commercial aftermarket business of up mid single-digit despite more difficult year-on-year compares as we close the year.","Given the strong year-to-date performance, we now expect Pratt & Whitney\u2019s operating profit growth to come in at the high-end of the previous guidance range of $175 million to $200 million on low single-digit sales growth.","UTC Aerospace Systems recently celebrated the second anniversary of its formation following the July 2012 acquisition of Goodrich. We are proud of the way that teams come together to integrate the businesses, while improving on our already high level of customer service, as well as delivering over 350 million in run rate synergies in just over two years.","In the quarter, aerospace systems continued to deliver strong results with operating profit up 14% on 7% higher sales. Commercial OEM sales were up 8% as we continue to benefit from growth in new programs such as 787 and A350. And commercial aftermarket increased 10% while military sales improved for the first time this year, up 2% versus 2013.","Profit growth was driven by higher commercial volume, continued synergy traction and the benefit of lower pension expense. Operating margins increased 110 basis points to 17%. Commercial spares orders increased 11% in the quarter with strength in both parts and provisioning. Overall commercial aftermarket sales are up 10% year-to-date.","For the year, UTC Aerospace Systems now expects profits of $325 million to $350 million from our previous expectation of $300 million to $350 million on mid to high single-digit sales growth.","Turning to Sikorsky on slide 10, operating profit decreased by 11% and 5% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 54 aircraft, including 39 based on military platforms and 15 commercial. The sales increase was driven primarily by development programs as well as higher international military and commercial OE volumes, partially offset by lower aftermarket and U.S. government OE volumes. The operating profit decrease was driven by unfavorable mix in our military business, the impact of lower aftermarket volumes and the absence of prior year favorable contract adjustments which more than offset benefits from pension, lower engineering spend, and cost reduction actions.","For the balance of the year, we anticipate stronger profit growth from higher volume and continue to expect operating profit growth of about $25 million on low single-digit sales growth.","Earlier this month, Sikorsky unveiled the S-97 Raider prototype featuring X2 technology. And we are pleased to announce that the Sikorsky Boeing team was selected to continue development of the Sikorsky Boeing Defiant Demonstrator aircraft with first flight expected in 2017. We believe our technology is well positioned for the next generation future vertical lift program.","With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Jay. So in summary, I think all we can say is that really solid quarter for UTC and what the difference a quarter mix. You\u2019ll recall the second quarter there were some concerns around organic growth and development program execution. I hope that we put all that to rest with our performance this quarter, where we saw solid organic growth across each of the businesses with good bottom-line conversion and key development programs on track as well as major program awards which will drive top-line growth in our businesses four years to come.","Just take a minute and highlight a couple of the big wins in the quarter. As you know of course Pratt & Whitney and our Aerospace Systems business supported the maiden flight of the Airbus A320neo aircraft now on September 25th in Toulouse. All of our systems including the geared turbofan engine performed well on this historic flight. We\u2019re confident that the plane test program will further validate the performance characteristics for reduced noise, lower emissions, and significantly higher fuel efficiency; and we look forward to the continuation of that successful test program.","I\u2019m sure you also all saw the announcement from Gulfstream last week. We\u2019re delighted to see the introduction of the PW800 engine for the new Gulfstream G500 and G600 long-range business jets and yet another platform for our engine business. The PW800 engine is optimized for long-range business jets ensures the same proven vigorously tested core technology used in Pratt & Whitney\u2019s award winning pure power family of commercial engines. We\u2019re equally pleased with the Aerospace Systems content. We\u2019ll provide several critical systems for these new business jets. The Building and Industrial Systems businesses also had a solid third quarter with Otis and CCS delivering 5% and 4% organic sales growth respectively.","As you know the third quarter marked the one year anniversary of the formation of our Building and Industrial Systems business and integration activities continue to progress well. In the quarter, we saw another example of revenue synergies in Australia to Sydney Airport. At Sydney Airport, Otis has had a long-term maintenance contract which allowed CCS to win a contract covering the installation of detectors, fire indicator panels, and emergency warning systems across one domestic and one international terminal in a five year service contract for maintenance and repair work across the airport site. BIS does work. As you can see each of the businesses is well positioned in our core markets, we\u2019re delivering real value to our customers and securing key orders that will drive top-line growth well into the future.","All right. Take a look at the rest of the year. As you know, the compares will get tougher in the fourth quarter but order and end market trends through Q3 continued to support our expectation, a 4% organic sales growth for the full year. As I mentioned in the start of the call, Q3 gains were stronger than previously anticipated and this was driven mainly by U.S. tax settlement that closed a few weeks earlier than expected, moving gain from Q4 to Q3. We continue to anticipate that net one-time gains or restructuring costs will offset for the year. And we see the path to the high end of the range of 675 to 685 although there is some pressure given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar.","For the year, we continue to anticipate debt pay-down of $1 billion and we now expect share repurchase of $1.5 billion, up from our prior expectation of $1.35 billion. And we expect the M&A spend will be a little less than $1 billion. Year-to-date free cash flow is 82% of net income and cash is generally strongest in Q4 as you know. We expect free cash flow of about 90% of net income for the full year of 2014.","Okay. Moving on to slide 12, let\u2019s take a look at 2015 briefly. As we move to any year, of course there is some positives out there, there is some headwinds and a lot of question marks, but let me touch on a few of the big ones here.","A couple of things that we know are going to be headwinds next year, commercial, aero, OE margins both at Pratt & Whitney, as well as in aerospace systems business. As we ramp up production on the GTF, we\u2019ll see some margin headwind at Pratt. We\u2019ll also see a little bit at aerospace systems as production rates increase on the new platforms. And as you would expect, the margins on early units going out the door are pressured with the learning curve. These are great long-term programs and point to a bright future for both Pratt and our aerospace systems business and are key building blocks for our long-term strategic plan.","On the military side, the biggest issue here is the C-17 program. Pratt, as you know supplies the engines of the C-17 for Embraer aircraft. Volume that will decline this production ends next year. So that will be a headwind as the F135 Engine production has not yet ramped up.","Looking at the middle column here, some questions; first of all, what happens in Europe? When do we see a sustainable recovery there? Emerging markets, now we put China in that category. You know they will grow, the question is how much will they grow? Pension as you know was also a big driver of UTC and if we were to snap the line at the end of September, the discount rate was 4.2% and it will give us a headwind of about a $160 million next year. As you know every 10 basis points of discount rate change there is nearly $30 million of earnings impact year-over-year.","On the positive side the pension portfolio has performed well and should offset the discount headwind of 4.2. I put it in the question mark column because it\u2019s too tough to call when rates will be when you snap the line on December 31st. We also expect the new mortality rate tables to be introduced in the coming months. While it\u2019s great that we\u2019re all living longer, this does increase pension expense by about $180 million a year. Just not clear yet whether this starts next year or the year after. So we\u2019ve got a question market as we sit here today.","In the plus column, first of all we think the U.S. economy will continue to recover, even if the phase is slightly rising interest rates. And our businesses have good, solid momentum here. Commercial aero aftermarkets, as well as the business of general aviation should continue to benefit from solid fundamentals and of course cost reduction.","Since 2009 and through the end of the last year, we\u2019ve done some $2.6 billion of restructuring. We\u2019ve got another $375 million this year, which will give us a couple of $100 million of tailwind into 2015. So as always, some pluses some minuses and a few question marks as we look towards next year.","As we see here today in this challenging and uncertain macro environment, earnings for next year look to be around the mid single-digit mark, but it\u2019s still early and we continue to work on the plan for next year.","We\u2019re executing the long-term strategy that we presented earlier this year at our March Investor day. The portfolio is well positioned to take advantage of the urbanization and commercial aerospace megatrends through the end of the decade and beyond.","The investments that we\u2019re making today position us for sustainable earnings growth well into the future. We\u2019ll continue to leverage our industry leading franchises in global sales and we believe we\u2019ve got the right strategy, right portfolio and we\u2019ve made the right investments to continue to drive sustainable long-term earnings growth.","With that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Hi Carter.","Jay Malave","Good morning","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Just a couple quick ones. First with the decline in the service sales in Europe at Otis. Was that related to pricing or something else? I think you\u2019d said previously that the pricing had kind of stabilized there; did that change given the change in the macro environment there?","Greg Hayes","Yes Carter, we still continue to see some pricing pressure there; it\u2019s moderated from what we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years, but there is still a little pricing pressure on the portfolio. I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in terms of stemming the tide there; we\u2019ve got some new programs out there trying to be a little more aggressive in terms of the retention of the portfolio, but still a pretty tough environment on the service side.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Can you characterize the magnitude of the pressure relative to what you\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years?","Greg Hayes","Yes, you\u2019re talking less than a penny in the quarter of pressure from pricing.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Okay, great. And then with respect to SEER-14 transition and the order trends that you talked about, can you help us think through beyond the order trends in terms of production and shipments, and how that impacts Q4 versus Q1? My collection was that you -- this was whenever -- they could be manufactured in Q4, but shipped in Q1. How are you thinking that that\u2019s going to work out as the year-end purchase?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly right. I think we saw a really, really strong order growth on the resi side and we don\u2019t actually think that that\u2019s indicative of what\u2019s going on in the market; it\u2019s probably closer to the 9% growth that we saw on the sales for the quarter. The plan as we see here today of course is to manufacture all of these SEER-13 units that have been ordered and most of them will sit in inventory through year-end and we\u2019ll ship them into the first and second quarter of next year. So, you\u2019ll have a more, I\u2019ll say steady state in terms of what the market really looks like as opposed to 2005, where we had the big like 1 million unit pre-order across the industry and there was huge shipments in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re not planning to do that. That obviously has an impact on inventory of probably 150 million or so of additional inventory that we\u2019ll see on the books at year end. But the fact is we don\u2019t want to push this out to the distribution if the ruling that it\u2019s just going to sit on the shelf. So again, good solid order growth rate. We think again share is with the remaining work that we expected to be. So, there is no big bump this year in the fourth quarter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Okay, great. Thanks Greg. I\u2019ll pass the mike.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Carter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you. Just on the aerospace businesses, I think R&D had been up; company funded about 4% in the first half, a lot of that was in UTAS. And you talked before about flat R&D for the year as a whole. So I just wondered how is R&D in UTAS in Q3 and how are you thinking about it for the next sort of 12 months.","Greg Hayes","Yes. In fact if you think about the plan going into the year was that E&D was going to be relatively flat. I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s probably going to be up about $100 million across all of UTC and really that\u2019s the aero units. The big increase in the quarter that we saw I think was about almost 50 million. That\u2019s all Pratt & Whitney. UTAS was relatively flat year-over-year in the quarter but we\u2019re going to continue to see a little of additional E&D into the fourth quarter but I think about that as 100 million or so year-over-year. And then again benefit next year as we expected that to go back down to prior year\u2019s level.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then at Pratt restructuring the last six months has been very low even though the two minus points you call out in the 2015 outlook, both pertain to Pratt.","Greg Hayes","Again, keep in mind, Pratt has done a significant amount of restructuring in the last three years. It did a 20% across the board reduction on SG&A at the beginning of last year. We continue to take cost out closing for space both in Canada and here in the U.S. So I think they have done what they needed to do from a cost reduction standpoint in terms of the back office and the factory footprint. The cost reduction focus today at Pratt is all on the new products going out the door. So again, I think you won\u2019t see big restructuring dollars but what we\u2019re doing is obviously focusing on GTF cost reduction to hit those target costs that we have out there as the production ramps.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And just very quickly, you don\u2019t call out anything on the balance sheet in the 2015 outlook, but I guess share count is a small tailwind exiting this year. Anything else you\u2019d like to say on the balance sheet for \u201815?","Greg Hayes","That\u2019s a little early; I think Louis will probably talk about it. The only thing I would point out that is obviously, share count will probably increase a little next year, absent share buyback because of the -- what we call those? The convertibles, MSUs that are out there, so we\u2019ll issue I think 11 million shares 1st of July. Obviously we\u2019re going to probably have share buyback that will try and offset that but full year share count might creep up a little bit next year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","All right, thanks.","Greg Hayes","","Thanks Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. ","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks guys. Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Rob.","Jay Malave","Good morning Rob.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Greg, I was wondering if you could carry on the previous thing, wondered if you could talk about your plans of debt retirement and any sort of impact that could have on the income statement next year.","Greg Hayes","So again, we have some debt that\u2019s coming due I think in May that\u2019s of 6%, no doubt there. The thought is that again we probably just refinance that on the short-end with commercial paper. So again, we\u2019ll pay down a $1 billion of debt this year just exactly as we had expected to do. But next year, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see further debt reduction.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Okay. And then on the commercial aerospace aftermarket, in the past you\u2019ve given us a little bit of a breakdown of Pratt in terms of the trends you\u2019ve seen in the B2500s versus the wide body engine, I was wondering if you can give us that again? And also at UTAS, I was wondering if you could break out how much the provisioning might have added in the quarter? Thank you.","Jay Malave","Sure Rob. On for spares in terms of the orders, the B2500 was up, the PW-2000 was up and the PW-4000 was down. As far as you can see aerospace systems as far as orders both the parts and provisioning were up around the same amount of the overall order rate. And on the sales basis, parts were up mid-teens, were up high single-digits and provisioning was up over 20%.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Great. Thanks Jay.","Greg Hayes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Greg, if I heard you correctly so basically you are pointing us towards kind of mid single-digit EPS growth in 2015, obviously there is long list of pluses and minuses. Just on the ones that you do have dialed in a little bit better, I just wanted to make sure I was clear. On pension are you telling us that asset issues offset discount rate and therefore the head one, if there is one is simply on mortality table?","Greg Hayes","That\u2019s exactly right. I think if we snap the line at the end of the September despite a lousy September in the market, the pension performance is going to trump the discount rate down at 42, but snap the line today, of course the discount rate is 4%. So that\u2019s, I\u2019m just going to ignore that for now. The real issue is whether we adopt mortality tables; we\u2019re waiting for them to be published. If they get published this year, we\u2019ll probably adopt them. If they get publish early next year, we\u2019ll wait and adopt them in \u201816.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And your comment about earnings growth next year assumes the mortality tables adopted?","Greg Hayes","It assumes that the mortality tables adopted, yes. So right now it would be a headwind, but I put it in question column because again it\u2019s middle of October as opposed to middle of December. So whenever we stand up we\u2019ll obviously have some clarity there.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And it sounds like you\u2019ve got a pretty good dial on Pratt margins or headwinds next year, obviously unforeseen challenges on ramps can occur. But can you give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re pointing us to there, kind of what the ramp pressures look like, I don\u2019t know if you can express it in dollars or margin points or what?","Greg Hayes","Maybe the best way to think of that, Jeff is, you\u2019ve got a couple of big known headwinds that is negative engine margin, that\u2019s on the V2500, as well as the GTF primarily the Neo is that inner service at the end of next year. And so we know that\u2019s out there and it\u2019s a pretty good size number and as well as the U.S. military, if the C-17 production stops, we make good money out of that both on the OE and on the support side of that.","So that kind of goes way next year, but you do have some offsets, I think obviously the commercial aero aftermarket will be better, Pratt Canada continues to get better, you got good news probably on the E&D front.","I think right now I would tell you that if Pratt will struggle to grow earnings if at all and that\u2019s really the challenge that we have in the next couple of months is to understand. Pratt right now is certainly there is no growth there and I think that is probably our biggest challenge for next year because of these big headwinds.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And just one more and I\u2019ll move on. So it had the questions in the discussions about aero ramp CapEx and working capital and you have some working capital noise in carrier here at quarter-end, would you foresee conversion actually moving back above net income next year or what kind of net income be the reasonable bogie?","Greg Hayes","I think net income is a reasonable bogie. I think obviously like even this quarter, we had 83% of free cash flow to net income, we had about 400 million of gains or one-time items that flow through that had no cash impact. So, there is a little bit of noise outside of just the pension. Obviously pension becomes less of a tailwind next year but also from a cash standpoint, there is no cash coming in from pension good news anyway. So CapEx going to come down a little bit next year. So all in all I would say, I think we ought to be targeting as we typically do free cash flow equal to net income, always bumps in the road as we put the plan together. But I\u2019m pretty confident when Louis stands up, he\u2019ll be guiding towards that 100%.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next quarter comes from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Greg Hayes","Hey Joe.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Just a couple on Otis to start. So the guidance for profit growth is lower exclusively because of currency or is there anything else in there?","Greg Hayes","Currency is the biggest driver; it\u2019s about $50 million year-over-year of headwind. I think again, the pricing pressure that we talked about in Europe earlier continues to be a bit of a headwind but it\u2019s not the big driver, really it\u2019s primarily FX. Again, I would say Otis is recovering, the Florence factory is doing much, much better still some room to go there but there is no big operational misses here. It\u2019s really just pricing in Europe I would say in FX.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","","Okay. And then on China, on Otis China, can you tell us about that unit orders year-on-year? Was that also flat or was there a change there? And maybe just provide some color on what you\u2019re seeing more qualitatively as we head into Q4 and into next year of course.","Jay Malave","","So the units were up in the range of mid single digit. So, we continue to see growth in units year-over-year. The other piece of it is, we still see strong award activity and just as a reminder, we do not record orders until receive a deposit. So there has been a little bit slower converting the awards into booked orders from a cash conversion and deposit perspective but the activity still remains pretty solid.","Greg Hayes","I think keep in mind Joe, the backlog still up 14% year-over-year, so I think the sales forecast that we have for the year is solid. And we should continue to see solid growth next year despite what is we all recognize a very or slowing housing market there. The Chinese government is taking some steps here with reducing down-payments on second homes to try and stimulate some growth there. But it will be challenging. It is a 600,000 unit elevator market though, just keep in mind it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest bio-factory or probably five. So it\u2019s a huge market and the opportunity there as you know is going to be on the service side long-term and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re focused. And I think service will probably grow 20% or so again this year, after growing 20% in each of the last two years. So, the team is focused on service and delivering service across the entire region which is again a big challenge but that\u2019s where the growth is going to come from.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Okay. And then Greg, I just wanted to clarify one item which is the Pratt guidance, I don\u2019t think I heard you say this specifically but are you guys going to stop providing guidance or color on spares specifically and just move to aftermarket because I understand longer run, as you\u2019ve moved to 80% type of pick up on service contracts that\u2019s going to be maybe the more relevant benchmark, but in the near-term the next couple of years just one-off spare sales are still going to be extremely important?","Greg Hayes","We will be transparent on the spares order; we put it out there in the press release, not trying to obfuscate anything but the fact is we know spares will continue to be growing or declining as the retirements kick in on the 4000 and the 2000. So, we wanted to put both metrics out there. The point of this is that longer term, we really need to start thinking about commercial aftermarket as opposed to just the spares, because as you know the fewer spares we sell, the better we are on the FMP contract.","So, during the -- for the next couple of years, we\u2019ll continue to report both spares and commercial aftermarket; just understand, again the point here is there is a transition here in the business model of Pratt that is significant. And we think again an opportunity for Pratt long-term on the margin side.","Joe Nadol - JP Morgan","Okay, very good. That makes sense. Thanks.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hi, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Just wanted to go back to one question, you mentioned about China and the elevator mark, and you talked about some of the stimulus. I thought there are also some movement towards changing some of the world\u2019s in terms of the aftermarket contract that might help the OEM do a little bit more. So, can you talk a little bit about where that stands and what your attachment rate has been in terms of some of the more recent selling there?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think again, this is a regulatory change that had started to get rolled out last year, it\u2019s been rolling out province by province. This is a requirement that the OEMs actually do service on the elevators. And as a result again, you are seeing that the increase that we\u2019re seeing in our aftermarket attachment. I think we\u2019ve got about a 135,000 elevators under service contract in China today versus 110,000 last year. So, we\u2019re gaining good traction. The regulatory change that will be slow to be adopted, I would say across the country, but it is a net positive trend for us.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then just on Sikorsky, I was wondering if you could clarify something, if you are going to generate $25 million growth in terms of adjusted profits this year, it seem to imply a very strong fourth quarter. I just want to make sure I understand that. And related, just want to -- if you could talk a little bit about the energy market, the commercial helicopter demand right now?","Greg Hayes","Yes. That\u2019s -- okay. Well, let\u2019s just talk about Sikorsky; they\u2019ve got a big fourth quarter as they typically do. I mean we have about $2 billion of sales at Sikorsky in the fourth quarter. So, growing -- I don\u2019t know they\u2019re down a little bit year-to-date but the $25 million will be well within the reasonable range of what they can deliver for the full year again on a strong fourth quarter delivery.","As far as offshore oil, we actually had a conversation with them yesterday about this. They are seeing some pressure because of offshore oil and with fracking in the U.S. growing so significantly, we\u2019re seeing less of the oil and gas exploration expansion. We should drill in the big ramp up in commercial helicopters. We\u2019re going to deliver 40 S92s this year; we\u2019ll probably deliver a couple of more than that next year. Is there still a market for the helicopters, it\u2019s just we\u2019re not seeing quite the same growth because of the prevalence of fracking here in the U.S.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning.","Jay Malave","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Just Greg, I wanted just to go back to the \u201815 I guess framework and obviously a big question mark around the magnitude of the OE mix headwind. And I\u2019m wondering can you just put -- give us some sort of working range on that because it is a key to take. And I\u2019m wondering around that, will there be an impact from the collaboration of accounting orders primarily just UTS. And is there a second chance in \u201815 where you get the OE ramp up and the headwind, but not a corresponding reduction in R&D?","Greg Hayes","Well, I think again the R&D is almost a natural reduction if you think about it. We\u2019re going to be done on C series flight tests, we\u2019ve got the engine certified, the Neo engine certified, you\u2019ve got MRJ right, we just rolled that out. You\u2019re going to see just a natural progression of E&D coming down over the next few years. Still have some spending out there, you\u2019ve got the Embraer E2 jets, you\u2019ve got your jet. But should just be a natural roll down in E&D to a more I\u2019d say normal level. As far as the commercial OE, the headwind, I guess the way to think of that is probably somewhere around $0.10 to $0.12 a share for next year maybe a little more than that, but kind of in that range.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And is that just key example or is that also including some collaboration accounting?","Greg Hayes","It\u2019s not collaboration. There is some additional [Vs] some new [Vs] out there that weren\u2019t included in the contract when we bought the shares so those new engines will go out with some negative margin as well.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just quick one on pension, Greg, you mentioned possibly adopting the new timetables this year, but does that put any incremental funding pressure for the next year if it does get adopted?","Greg Hayes","No, I think with the new pension rules that our friends in Congress passed, we don\u2019t actually have to fund until sometime in 2020. I would tell you though we\u2019ll probably fund its service cost level for the next few years. As you know, we have sunset the plan, the old FAE plan and we took that really tough action back in 2009. And that\u2019s been paying off. But as we switch to the newer pension scheme, the cash balance then probably funding that at a normal more service level going forward. So you think about $300 million or so of cash next year for pension funding in the U.S and probably a couple of $100 million for international.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Great. A quick one on the euro rate for [4Q], what\u2019s the euro rate you\u2019re using for Otis in \u201815?","Greg Hayes","Well, I think we\u2019re 127 in our current forecast which is right about where we are today. It can drop a little with 128 yesterday; it came down a little today. So, and I think we\u2019re in kind of in the ballpark now. Recall last year going into the year we\u2019re kind of in the 130 range and for the full year we were at 133 this year. So, there is some certain FX headwind year-over-year going into the fourth quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks Greg.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Nigel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. Greg, one of the things you talked about was the opening or the difference between restructuring and gains; could you refresh us on where you are then for the fourth quarter?","Greg Hayes","Yes. So, we spent in restructuring $243 million, not to be terribly precise; $375 million forecast for the year, maybe we\u2019ve got about a $132 million of additional restructuring teed up in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s all subscribed; we\u2019ve got plans in place to spend all of that. And in fact there could be some additional gains in the fourth quarter; we\u2019ll see what happens with the taxes. We also got tax expenditures out there that could happen in the fourth quarter which might allow us to do some additional restructuring. So, as we talked about the plan for next year, one of the keys is one additional cost reduction, restructuring actions can we take to help ensure we have a decent plan going into next year. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to focus on in the next couple of months is looking for additional restructuring opportunities. And don\u2019t be surprised if that 375 goes up a little.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Yes, because the reality -- sorry the reality is that without that you\u2019d actually do a little bit better than the high-end of your range for the year.","Greg Hayes","Yes. So again, I don\u2019t think there is any -- look, we\u2019re going to stay within the range as I said before, we have a path to 685, it\u2019s a little tougher with this big currency headwind we\u2019ve got in the fourth quarter but there is still a path out there. But I would not look for us to significantly over deliver on the basis of additional gains.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","No, it wasn\u2019t gain so much but the absence of -- I get it. Just to stay for a moment on restructuring, could you provide some indication of the successes you\u2019ve had combining CCS and Otis internationally?","Greg Hayes","I think the biggest -- from a restructuring standpoint, the biggest success is, I think about Otis has 2,500 branch offices out there. And the ability to consolidate offices, I mean it saves a lot of money. I think Geraud\u2019s got a target about of $300 million of savings from the synergy of collapsing the offices and running the business as not just Otis, not fire and security and carrier, but as BIS.","So, you have one back office, you have one management team. Again sales forces are all different, field service is different, but you are getting synergies out of the consolidation of the offices.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And then just one last if I may, when I look at your tax rate, we call it 30% versus your peer, there are other large multinationals, they all have something that begins with high 20s. Going forward, is it possible that we could see a tax rate in the -- I\u2019ll use 28% plus range.","Greg Hayes","Yes, it\u2019s hard to imagine us absent of course with tax reform power, anything is possible. And again, I think that\u2019s the real issue. Our tax rate normally wants to be about 32%. We do some tax planning that allows us get it to down to around 30% that\u2019s primarily reinvesting foreign earnings. But the fact is the rate wants to probably be around 30 absent to tax extenders. You get the R&D tax credit and the CSC it looks it will drop the rate about a point. We\u2019re obviously hopeful we\u2019re going to see something in December from Congress on that to hopefully make permanent the R&D credit, because it\u2019s crazy the way to spend money in anticipation of a tax law change.","So, that\u2019s an opportunity. But again as the tax rules become more and more difficult and you\u2019ve heard of this BEPS project out there where everybody is looking for additional tax revenue, the tax authorities around the world are becoming more aggressive. We\u2019ve taken a relatively conservative view on the tax rate, we can certainly drive it down for a year two, but we\u2019re viewing this it a little long-term; it probably wants to be 29% to 30%.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you, Greg very much for your time.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Howard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Hi Greg. There was a comment in the press release on increased revenue synergies realized in building industrial systems. I wonder if you can give a little bit of color behind that, kind of substantiate the rational of the combination and also give us some color on the hunt for larger industrial M&A. Thanks.","Greg Hayes","","Yes, I think on the BIS revenue synergies, obviously really the business has been together exactly a year here as of September 30th. And we highlighted, we had this project in Australia that would be bringing in some fire and security products, some CCS product. Last quarter, we talked about project in Hong Kong, we were able to bring Otis elevator contract. In the Middle East, we\u2019ve seen some good pull through where the legacy carrier business has a very good relationship in the Middle East, were able to bring in some the Otis elevators and win some relatively larger awards.","But these are all kind of one-off today. I think the whole focus here of managing this as a BIS organization is to make that more routine as opposed to one-off. And I think that will take some time, we\u2019re certainly getting some market acceptance today. And as we talk to developers, we\u2019ve talked to the building owners; they see the benefit of BIS versus the individual businesses going to market. So, we\u2019ve got a key accounts leader in place today for the U.S. we\u2019re working that internationally.","So again, there is momentum building here. I think when Geraud stands up in March next year; he can share some more of the wins with you then.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Are you looking at something like combined capture rates or buying bid rates, I mean is that the way you\u2019re internally looking at the metrics?","Greg Hayes","Well, the metric, I actually have seen the exact business review tomorrow with BIS. I\u2019m going to actually see the new metrics that we -- and obviously we\u2019re looking at this more holistically as opposed to just order rates at Otis or order rates at fire and security or carrier. Again, we\u2019re trying to protect this from a top down level with the customer. So I\u2019m going to actually see what the new metric is going to be, we can come back to you with that.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","M&A, the hunt for the big fish.","Greg Hayes","We\u2019re still fishing. Like I said, I think back a couple of months ago; the pipeline is not terribly robust. There are opportunities out there obviously on the commercial side. We\u2019re focused on building out the building side and the system side; continue to look for opportunities there. But the market has been tough. As you know equities have grown up quite a bit. Prices are very difficult. And even with the recent price correction if you will, we haven\u2019t seen M&A prices correct along with the rest of the equity market.","So we\u2019re going be disciplined. We\u2019re going to be patient; we\u2019re going to look for properties in the core. Obviously the focus is on the commercial side, not to say we wouldn\u2019t do an aero deal if one came along. But the pipeline is not terribly full, but we continue to spend a lot of time looking at various opportunities.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks.","Jay Malave","Thank you.","Operator","Our next quarter comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Yes. A couple of quick questions Greg. Pension income I assume was about $0.09 a share this quarter $125 million or so?","Greg Hayes","Yes, it sounds about right.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","And then I want to follow-up a little bit with Pratt because if Pratt cuts like maybe $50 million of the pension income, you still had profits at Pratt up 20 plus million year-over-year despite R&D up $50 million and spares up $7 million, I mean that obviously offset some of it. But it still seems like there had to be some strong performance elsewhere to get the number as good as it was. So I just wonder if you could provide a little bit of color, I mean D2500 engine deliveries are probably a little higher this year than last year so?","Greg Hayes","George, we saw a nice growth in Canada, I mean that was up low double-digits both in OE, as well as the aftermarket, so against and also strong with the spare parts business. So Canada contributed, as we saw as I said, we also had strong performance under our contracts and we saw a benefit there in the range of about couple of pennies and so those contributed. And again, as we talked about, we think it\u2019s -- we cannot see some benefit from cost reduction and restructuring.","So all that taken together, this helps really offset that higher E&D in the quarter, as well as margin pressure. The OE business was up a little bit and the large commercial business, but really not a significant factor.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","And Jay you said that spares were up combined 7%, Pratt Canada and large Pratt was it about equal or both?","Jay Malave","That was the total aftermarket was up 7% not just the spares, but on a sales basis, Pratt\u2019s the large commercial spares were pretty much flat and the spares at Canada were up high-teens.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. Okay, thanks a lot.","Greg Hayes","Hey George, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning Doug.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Greg on Otis China, you talked about services and that\u2019s clearly long-term the target here, but as services grow, how should we think about margins on that given that in the early couple of years these elevators are under warranty and you don\u2019t have the scale you have in Europe or in the U.S.","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think Doug, you hit on a key issue with service. Today the margins on service are not much higher than what they are on the OE side, although they\u2019re still very good. The opportunity obviously long-term as you get root density across China as we build out all of these branch offices and add all these service technicians, margins should continue to improve. It\u2019s not clear we\u2019ll ever get to develop country type margins and service, but there is still opportunity here.","Again I think the idea here today is to focus more on getting the contracts and servicing the customers as opposed to margin expansion. That will come naturally over time as we get more productivity from the sales for the field force. Keep in mind; we\u2019re adding 1,000 people a year to the service network in China. And we\u2019ve got to bring them in, we\u2019ve got to train them, we\u2019ve got to teach them how to service elevators and we\u2019ve got deploy them out to the field, all that is holding down margins in the near-term. But again still a profitable business in China, still good margins, just not the kind of margins that we would expect long-term.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","And then on Pratt, when you look at 2015 and clearly for the geared turbofan, the A320neo is the really big deal here. But when you look at the CSeries, how are you looking at in 2015, what are you looking at in terms of the trajectory of deliveries? And if that were to get delayed, is that something that would have any kind of a material impact on your either revenues or margins at Pratt?","Greg Hayes","In fact, we\u2019re delivering some engines this year; I think we\u2019ll probably deliver the same number of engines roughly, maybe a few more next year. So, it\u2019s not a big driver of year-over-year margin degradation at Pratt. And again, we had some recent wins, we feel pretty good about it, the planes up and flying again. And they should be on track to get this thing in service by the end of next year. The bigger ramp will obviously come on the Airbus A320neo. Again there will be huge volumes by 2017 where we could be delivering 500 plus engines a year from zero today.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","So the CSeries itself, you\u2019re not -- that\u2019s probably not -- the timing on that is probably not much of an issue for next year?","Greg Hayes","We don\u2019t see it as a big year-over-year driver as we sit here today.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks Doug.","Operator","Our final question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Yes. Good morning Greg, Jay.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Just a quick one regarding update on the synergies, you mentioned back to Howard\u2019s question. The Goodrich synergy, if you remind us where they\u2019re tracking to is in the number still I think $500 million that you had previously indicated and also if you could also give us an update on CCS synergies too?","Greg Hayes","Yes. So if you think about the synergies, I think through last year we\u2019d recognized about $270 million or so, synergies is another $100 million plus this year. We\u2019re on track probably next year to deliver close to another $100 million of synergies. And I\u2019m sure there are more synergies beyond the $500 million, but again I think talking about synergies versus typical normal cost reduction and other restructuring activities, it\u2019s very difficult as we get passed about the third or fourth year of the acquisition. So we\u2019ll talk about it this year, and we\u2019ll give -- we\u2019ll talk about the tailwind next year. And I think again, we\u2019ll hit that $500 million by the end of next year and then we are just going to keep going and continue to drive margins up. You can call it synergies, you can call cost reduction, you can call it just what we do at UTC, but we\u2019re going to continue to drive margins up beyond that what\u2019s the benefit we\u2019re going to get from the $500 million of synergies.","In terms of the BIS synergy, we talked about $300 million number, not a big number this year, maybe $50 million of savings between what we\u2019re seeing in the segments. And again, the part of the issue where we still keep Otis and CCS separate from a reporting standpoint, so when we close a CCS office that restructuring savings may show up there, if we close an Otis office, it shows up in that segment. But again that will accelerate in the coming years as we continue with the consolidation process.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks everyone for listening today. We look forward to seeing you at our Annual Investor and Analyst meeting on December 11th in New York where Louis will give guidance, complete guidance for 2015. The IR team will be around throughout the rest of the day to take your questions. So thank you very much and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may all disconnect. And everyone have a great day."],"21053":["United Technologies Corp.

(Broker)","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Akhil Johri, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer; and Paul Lundstrom, Director, Investor Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download on the UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note, the company will speak to results from continued operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.","UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide detail on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate.","","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the webcast slides, I just want to make a few comments. I'm sure many of you saw yesterday's announcement that UTC has reached an agreement to sell Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin for $9 billion. That of course, is subject to regulatory approvals and the customary closing conditions. We'll be moving Sikorsky to discontinued operations in Q3 and we would expect to close the transaction around year-end, either by December 31 or shortly thereafter in the first quarter of 2016.","This is a very good deal all around. It's good for Sikorsky's employees and customers, as well as for UTC shareholders. At UTC, we now see a portfolio that's more focused on the core, and that is supplying systems and technologies for commercial buildings and aerospace, and we're better positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders. The balance of our portfolio will continue to deliver over the long-term with clear line of sight to mid-single-digit organic top line growth based on the success of the Geared Turbofan engine at Pratt and higher shipset values on new platforms at our UTC Aerospace Systems business, and of course, a more focused innovative product portfolio in our Commercial businesses. The sale is expected to generate approximately $6.2 billion of available cash. We plan to use the proceeds to repurchase UTX shares, and we would expect to offset the EPS dilution from the loss of Sikorsky earnings through the share buyback program.","Now coming back to 2015, top line growth remains solid in Q2 with 3% organic growth in a continuing slow global economy. However, as you saw in the press release this morning, we are lowering expectations for the year for EPS. After a half a year of actual results, it's clear that the Commercial aftermarket assumptions that our Aerospace Systems business used were overly optimistic, and this along with continuing weakness in Otis Europe and a significant slowdown of construction markets in China have caused us to reevaluate our outlook for these two segments.","Needless to say, we're not happy with this performance, and we'll take decisive action in response, including accelerating cost reduction action across the businesses, and aggressively identifying additional structural actions focused on product cost and productivity that can drive earnings growth well into the future.","We also intend to explore additional benefits from capital deployment, both M&A and share buybacks. Let me assure you while we see near-term weakness in some end markets, the long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products, global scale, and strong market fundamentals, that is RPM growth and urbanization, will allow UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future.","Akhil and Paul will take you through the Q2 results and revised expectations in more detail in just a second, and I'll be back with some closing comments before we get into the Q&A. Akhil?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Greg. Before I talk about the full year, let's look at Q2 results and end market trends for a little more context. UTC reported Q2 earnings per share of $1.73, down 6% versus the prior year and in line with the expectations that we discussed last month in Paris. Excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items, EPS was down 2% in the quarter but up 2% for the first half of the year. The stronger dollar was a headwind of $0.13 in the first half, which equates to about 4 points on prior year earnings. Organic sales grew 3% in the quarter, same as the first quarter, and that marks the eighth consecutive quarter of top line organic growth.","In the Commercial businesses, we saw continuing growth in the Americas, which were up 8%. Asia grew slightly, reflecting the slowing environment in China, which was down low-single digit. And sales in EMEA were flattish in the quarter.","On the Aerospace side, Commercial grew by 3% as high single-digit original equipment growth was partially offset by the aftermarket, which was flattish. Defense sales were up 5% mainly on higher military engine deliveries at Pratt.","Taking a closer look at our end markets on Slide 3, and just a reminder, we'll talk to the Commercial business orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. For our Building Systems businesses, construction markets in the U.S. remain a positive. And we continue to see that at Otis, where North America new equipment orders were up 10%. At CCS, Americas Commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 10%, and Residential HVAC equipment sales grew 7% in the quarter.","Turning to EMEA, the overall environment remains mixed, and our BIS order activity reflects that. Transport refrigeration orders in EMEA were a bright spot, up over 25%, while after adjusting for a large order in Saudi Arabia, Otis new equipment orders were up 3%. This was driven by solid growth in Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and Spain, with France and Russia down. Orders for Commercial HVAC in EMEA were flattish.","In Asia, the China market has clearly slowed. Real estate investment, new construction starts, and floor space sold are all under pressure. Otis new equipment orders in China were down 10% in the quarter, and we also saw a slowdown in the rate of backlog conversion.","Excluding China, the rest of Asia continues to do well at Otis. At CCS, China orders were down 15% driven by Commercial HVAC. Shifting to Commercial Aerospace aftermarket, at Pratt & Whitney, sales were up slightly with mid-single-digit growth in both Pratt Canada and Large Commercial Engine Transactional Services. Shop visits for engines under fleet management program were lower in the quarter, reflecting our strategy to improve time on-wing.","UTC Aerospace Systems commercial aftermarket sales were down slightly, largely driven by the ongoing weakness in provisioning and repair. New test parts sales continued to be strong and were up 8% in the quarter, consistent with Q1. Taking a closer look at the second quarter results on Slide 4, total reported sales decreased by 5% as 3% organic growth and a point from acquisitions were more than offset by 4 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar and 5 points from the absence of the prior-year CMHP adjustment.","Segment operating profit was down 3% in the quarter and operating margins were 16.6%. Earnings per share of $1.73 were down 6% in the quarter. Recall that restructuring and gains were balanced in the second quarter of 2014 while we saw $0.08 cents of net restructuring and one-time items in the second quarter of 2015.","Absent the impact of gains and restructuring, earnings per share were down 2% while in constant currency, earnings per share were up 2%. Free cash flow was 76% of net income and was adversely impacted by a payment of about $250 million for the previously discussed German tax matter. Excluding this payment, free cash flow would have been a little over 90% of net income.","For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to net income of 90% to 100% in 2015, and we are maintaining our placeholder of $1 billion for M&A. On Slide 5, as Greg mentioned, we are lowering our expectations for the year. On a continuing operations basis excluding Sikorsky, we now expect earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.30 on sales of $57 billion to $58 billion, reflecting roughly 3% organic sales growth. That's down from our prior continuing ops expectation of $6.35 to $6.55 EPS on sales of $58 billion to $59 billion.","So looking at the changes on the right-hand side of the page, UTC Aerospace Systems profit expectations are lower by about $300 million and Otis by about $200 million. So total segment profit growth expectations are down around $0.38 versus our prior forecast. There are no changes to the earnings expectations at CCS or Pratt. We'll offset about $0.15 through lower minority interest, some FX forecast contingency, and lower incentive compensation, among other things.","Now let's walk through what's driving these changes at UTAS and Otis. So I'm on Slide 6. For UTAS, commercial aftermarket sales look to be down slightly in 2015 now. Our prior expectations included high single-digit sales growth in the commercial aftermarket. We continue to see good demand for parts based on solid airline industry fundamentals. However, after a very strong 2013 and 2014, provisioning now looks to be down about 10% versus our prior expectation of up 10%.","Repair volumes have also been weaker than expected. In addition, the military Aerospace business is slightly lower both for the OE and the aftermarket segments. So, for UTAS overall, we now expect low single digit organic sales growth for the year, down from the previous expectation of up mid-single digit. Primarily due to this shortfall in high margin aftermarket sales, we are changing UTAS profit expectation to down $25 million to $75 million from up to $25 million to $75 million previously.","At Otis on slide seven, we haven't yet seen an improvement in the European service business and are adjusting up our expectation of a second-half recovery. We now believe that consistent with first half, EMEA service sales for 2015 will be down mid-single digit as compared with prior expectation of up low single digit. China has also slowed. Overall, we now anticipate Otis organic sales growth to be up low single digit for the year as compared to our prior expectation of up mid-single digit. With this change in the growth outlook, we now expect Otis profit to be down $25 million to $75 million at constant currency compared with our original expectation of up $100 million to $150 million. Including the adverse impact of FX, we expect operating profit at Otis to be down $300 million to $350 million, assuming euro at $1.10 for the balance of the year.","Let me stop there and turn it over to Paul to take you through the business unit results for the quarter in more detail.","Paul Lundstrom - Vice President of Finance, CFO -- UTC Climate, Controls & Security - Asia, United Technologies","Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So, turning to page eight, Otis second quarter sales were $3.1 billion and up 1% organically. Profits were $635 million and down 1% at constant currency. Operating profit margins remains strong at 20.5%. Foreign exchange translation was a nine-point sales headwind and an 11-point earnings headwind. Profit was down in the quarter as the unfavorable impact of price and mix more than offset contributions from volume and productivity initiatives.","New equipment sales grew by 4% in the quarter, with solid double-digit growth in the Americas. EMEA new equipment sales were essentially flat and we saw 4% decline in China driven by weaker orders and a slower conversion of new equipment backlog to sales. Otis service sales were flat overall as a 4% decline in EMEA was offset by mid-single digit growth in Asia. Service sales in the Americas were flat.","New equipment orders were up 5% in the quarter driven by a large project in the Middle East. New equipment orders in North America were again strong, up 10%; and orders in EMEA were up 32%. Excluding the large Abraj Kudai hotel project in Saudi Arabia, EMEA orders were up 3%. Asia orders were down mid-single digit from weaker demand in China which saw a 10% decline. Outside of China, orders in Asia were up mid-single digit.","As Akhil mentioned, we now expect Otis profit to be down $25 million to $75 million at constant currency. Including the negative impact of foreign exchange, we expect profit to be down $300 million to $350 million.","On slide nine, we saw continued momentum at Climate, Controls & Security in the second quarter. Sales grew 8% at constant currency with five points of organic growth and another three points from net acquisitions. Profits were up 6% at constant currency. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a five-point headwind, earnings headwind, and a seven-point sales headwind.","CCS organic sales growth was led by the Americas where residential HVAC grew 7% and commercial HVAC was up in the low teens. Transicold saw continued strength with sales up low teens. EMEA was essentially flat with growth in F&S products offsetting a decline in commercial HVAC. Asia was also flat in the quarter with declines in China offset by growth elsewhere in the region. Operating profit growth of 6% was primarily driven by a drop-through on organic volume growth and cost benefits, including favorable commodity prices.","CCS equipment orders were up 4% in the quarter. Transicold was up nearly 30% with broad-based strength across the business. Global commercial HVAC orders were down 5% in the quarter led by a sharp decline in China. CCS continues to expect profit growth of $200 million to $250 million on a constant currency basis on mid-single digit organic sales growth for the full year.","Solid results in the first half along with better than expected commodities and some favorable non-recurring items mentioned in Q1 helped mitigate pressure from a slowing China and a softer Europe.","Turning to Aerospace on slide ten, Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 2% in the quarter, largely driven by double-digit growth in military engines. The commercial aftermarket business was up 1%. Within that, large commercial engine transactional sales including both parts and repair were up 4% in the quarter. That was with a V2500 spares increase of nearly 30%, partially offset by declines in legacy platforms.","Aftermarket shop visits for our fleet management programs were down, which again means engines were on-wing longer, benefiting both customers and Pratt. Pratt operating profit was $489 million, which was down 6%. Headwinds from higher negative engine margin and pension were partially offset by lower E&D spend and a drop-through from higher volume in the military engines business. The absence of last year's gain on the sale of a product line was a headwind, but it was more than offset by another noncore product line sale and a contract closeout.","Looking at our 2015 full-year expectations, we now expect commercial aftermarket sales to be up low single digit; that's down from our prior expectations of up high single digit. Higher military engine sales, better commercial aftermarket margins, and lower E&D spending will offset the impact from the lower commercial aftermarket volume, and so we still feel comfortable with the full-year guidance at Pratt.","Turning to slide 11, UTC Aerospace Systems profits were $580 million in the quarter, which was down 4%. Sales of $3.6 billion grew 2% organically in the quarter. Similar to what we mentioned last quarter, sales include the benefit from a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass-through sales with no margin.","Commercial aftermarket sales were flattish and continue to be below expectations with lower provisioning and maintenance sales in our repair shops, offset by high single digit growth in parts volume. We've seen a 10% decline in provisioning so far this year. That's very different than the 10% growth we envisioned for 2015, driven by lower 787 activity, as well as the impact of higher surplus equipment availability for legacy fleets. The lower repair activity reflects better reliability, the impact of competitive pricing pressure, and airline maintenance efficiencies.","On profit, the year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE mix, and higher pension expense, partially offset by continued cost reduction. In addition, the absence of last year's customer contract settlement benefit was partially offset by other favorable contract settlements this quarter. As Akhil mentioned, we are lowering our profit expectations for UTC Aerospace Systems to be down $25 million to $75 million.","Turning to Sikorsky on slide 12, operating profit increased 26% on a 6% organic sales improvement in the quarter. Organic sales growth was driven by higher development program sales led by the ramp-up of the U.S. Presidential and Combat Rescue Helicopter programs. Overall aircraft shipment volumes were down compared to the prior year, but aircraft completion \u2013 again, that's the aircraft customization that occurs following baseline delivery, those completions were up significantly over the prior year.","So overall, growth from development programs and aircraft completions were partially offset by lower military and commercial aftermarket volumes. The operating profit improvement was driven by favorable year-over-year contract adjustments and drop-through from higher development volume, offset by lower commercial aftermarket volume.","With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Paul. So, disappointing news on the Otis guidance, on the UTAS guidance; but there are still positives, and I think we need to reflect on that as we think about the quarter. These positives actually support the long-term investment thesis of UTC.","First of all, we continue to achieve significant milestones on our programs. We secured key wins, and we've positioned the portfolio now to drive long-term shareholder value. As you know, we announced significant wins across our Aerospace business at the Paris Air Show last month. Pratt & Whitney announced additional orders for over 600 Geared Turbofan engines including options reflecting continued strong customer demand. Turkish Airlines and the Korean Air both selected the GTF for the A321neo aircraft at the Air Show. Customers can see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option orders for about 7,000 engines.","And in our commercial businesses, we also continue to secure key wins. As Paul mentioned earlier, Otis secured an order worth more than $100 million for the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. The win includes 370 elevators and 104 escalators for what will be the world's largest hotel when it opens in 2017.","So again, the long-term growth story hasn't changed. Our businesses continue to be well-positioned in our core markets, and this, along with ongoing product innovation will allow us to drive sustainable organic growth. As I said at the beginning of the call, with the divestiture of Sikorsky, our portfolio is more focused on the core, that is, Aerospace and Commercial Buildings, and we're better positioned to drive long-term shareholder value.","Finally, before we wrap up, I would like to thank the many folks from Sikorsky and the corporate office who have worked tirelessly over the last couple of months to complete the Sikorsky transaction, and while we're not quite done, I think it's been great work by the entire team and just want to thank them publicly for that.","So with that, let me stop and let's see what's on everybody's mind. Questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mr. Sprague.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Two questions, Greg. The first one actually, much bigger-picture. With Sikorsky out of the way obviously, and the redeployment can roughly replace that, but you also alluded to other actions. And just thinking about your flexibility here and how you might push things, right, Sikorsky might be actually a little bit credit-negative. Therefore, if you do something else, you need to be more aggressive with the balance sheet or use equity or some combination thereof. Just, where is your head on that and where is the pipeline on what might be the next step once we get past Sikorsky?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a good question, Jeff. But, we have been focused for the last three months as you can imagine on the divestiture of Sikorsky. I think we're done with the big divestitures. We've done $15 billion now, including Sikorsky in the last five years, so we like the portfolio that we have as a base off which to grow. And so the question is with capital deployment, where are we going to grow? Are we going to do more share buyback? Are we going to go to M&A? Obviously the preference is M&A. You alluded to the credit metrics, Jeff. I think obviously, the spin versus the sale to Lockheed Martin, that doesn't really change the credit metrics that much. And I still think we have flexibility on the balance sheet to do things. And so the team is focused right now on M&A. We've got some things in our sights that hopefully can come to fruition this year, but we're going to be more aggressive. I think we have to continue to use the balance sheet to grow the portfolio.","Absent that, there is share buyback, and I think we're never going to say no to more share buyback. I recognize that puts stress on the debt rating, but we're going to do what's right for shareholders to make sure that we're driving long-term sustainable growth.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just thinking about the outlook, Greg, I don't know if you can hear it from your seat, but certainly there's a lot of murmuring out there that something isn't quite right, and this just doesn't feel like the UTX we've come to know with kind of the water torture on the guidance. What is your confidence level now on where you cut things? How aggressive is the forecast as it stands today, and where is kind of the soft spot in the guide still in your view?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question, Jeff. Look, to say that I'm disappointed would be a significant understatement. We're all disappointed in having to take the guidance down. We talked back in June about softness in Aerospace aftermarket at UTAS, and we talked about Europe. What we have tried to do today is to put a stop on the downside. And I think the guidance that we've given for both Otis and for the Aerospace Systems group is guidance we feel confident that we can hit. And I'm tired of delivering bad news. And so, we've probably been more aggressive on the downside because we don't want to overpromise and underdeliver.","And it's tough to do. It's tough to get this bad news out, but quite frankly, as we closed out the second quarter and we met with the folks at UTAS and we met with the Otis team with Geraud and company, it became apparent that we weren't going to be able to hit the guidance numbers that we had laid out. Europe, we had expected a recovery there kind of up low-single digits. It's going to be down low-single digits. We continue to see pricing pressure in the Otis aftermarket in Europe. The slowdown in China is worse than what we had expected. And on the Aerospace Systems side, we were way too aggressive in terms of our assumptions for the provisioning of spare items.","The spare parts are fine at UTAS. There's some other things that are moving around, but ultimately it's the provisioning orders from airlines which, as Akhil said had been up nicely in 2013 and 2014 and we expected them to be up another 10% this year. This forecast assumes we're going to be down 10%, which I think is probably, we hope worst-case.","So I think we've bounded the guidance on the downside. And the whole idea here is, let's not deliver more bad news, and let's position the company to grow earnings next year. And as I said, some of the headwinds that we're seeing this year, they're going to continue into next year. I think the negative engine margin at Pratt doesn't go away. The China slowness doesn't go away, and the European economy doesn't miraculously recover. But there are bright spots, and I think the U.S. economy is a lot better than what we had expected this year, and that should continue. The Aerospace aftermarket will continue to grow.","And I think we're trying to do is the right thing long-term for the business in terms of making these tough decisions today, and we're going to take another hard look at restructuring. I think there's more to do from a cost takeout standpoint. There's more to do that we can position ourselves to make sure we're not going to disappoint into the future. So, look, we're beyond disappointed about this, but we're going to fix it. And we're going to get back to the UTC mantra of underpromise and overdeliver.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Greg, when I look at the, kind of the underlying expectation for EPS for this year of $6.30, is it \u2013 is the right way to think about it to add back the Sikorsky and then, that's the base from which to grow? Or are we really talking about inclusive of the repurchase effort on Sikorsky, that that's what we're growing to \u2013 so you're pretty using the $6.15 to $6.30 base and a target of 10% on that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think the key there, Myles, is \u2013 well, the Sikorsky transaction will close, let's call it January 1. We'll take the net proceeds and we'll start buying back stock. You're not going to get the full benefit of the stock buyback next year. You'll probably get 80% of it. So if you think about it, we'll replace 80% of Sikorsky's earnings next year and the remaining 20% the following year, just because it takes us a while to buy back what will probably be somewhere between 55 million shares and 60 million shares of UTX stock. So you just don't do that overnight unfortunately.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, Akhil, the $0.15, it sounded pretty temporary. So is that permanent cost takeout or business improvement, or is that going to be headwind to 2016?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Some of it is going to be headwind, Myles, because as I said, it's incentive comp coming down this year. We hope that we will do better next year then \u2013 in which case, the incentive comp will have to go back up. Some of it is just, it was a release of contingency that we had. You recall, the Otis guidance previously was at $1.13\/Euro, and we had a slight contingency at the UTC level at $1.10\/Euro, Otis and CCS both. So that's just the math of contingency release, if you will. So I would say they are not necessarily permanent. On the other hand, we do have more permanent cost reduction actions coming out of the corporate office which we should see the benefit for in next year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I'll stick to two questions. Thanks.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Myles.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. I want to go to Pratt for a moment. At the Air Show, you talked about GTF getting up and flying again early this month. And I think the last reported news is that that's not happened. How are you thinking about the risk there, Greg?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we've been working closely with Airbus, and do I think \u2013 they've got the flight test engines back in Toulouse right now. We expect to be up in the air I think early next week. And right now, it looks like we'll complete the flight test program in the September timeframe, certification of the aircraft in November, and entry into service in December. So, still targeting year-end entry in the service. I think we'll probably ship about 36 engines or so to Airbus this year, and that we're still on schedule to do that. So, yeah, it's a little bit of a delay. As you know, these things just always take more time. But it's not like their guys have been sitting there doing nothing. They've been doing a lot of ground test runs and the other testing that they can do before return to flight. So we feel pretty good about this schedule right now.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","And then, second is I'm sure you have never seen a gain that you didn't want to take advantage of in some fashion. How are you going to think about this? I mean, some of it obviously, will flow to the bottom line, but some of it can really change the nature of how you think about yourself and where you want to go in the future. Can you \u2013 I know it's premature to some degree, but it's been there for a while. So maybe if you could give us some general constructs on what you're thinking about?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's a very good question, Howard. I think the fact that we will have a very large gain on Sikorsky and passing through the gain in terms of EPS has never been something we thought we got paid for from the share owners. So I think this will be thought of very similar, and that's why I've asked the guys to take a very hard look at big structural cost reductions that can help us better position the business longer-term. And again, I don't have a plan today of what we're going to do. We've got in my view, six months while we're working on closing the Sikorsky transaction to figure out what all of those actions are. But my goal would be to use the gain and do significant additional restructuring.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. I just wondered within Aerospace Systems if you can maybe split out within that Commercial aftermarket, volume cut of $250 million, how much is competition, which I think you talked about in Paris as well, versus just kind of provisioning and repair top-line weakness, and whether you think those issues at Aero Systems could persist through into next year as well?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Julian. So if you think about what makes up the Commercial aftermarket at UTAS, roughly $4.5 billion as Gitlin mentioned in Paris, that's made up of spare parts about $1.5 billion or so, provisioning of a little over $1 billion, and $1.8 billion or so of the repair business. The biggest change actually is in the provisioning part of it as Greg said, which was expected to be up 10% on the back of \u2013 up 12% in (34:10), and up 19% in 2014, so very strong provisioning growth in 2012 \u2013 in 2013 and 2014. We had expectations for a 10% increase assuming that some of that strength which we saw through Boeing 787 would continue. We had assumed that in spite of fewer operators taking new aircraft in 2015, we would see almost similar level of Boeing 787 activity in 2015 as we saw in 2014. That's obviously not happened at this point. It's looking more like we will probably be down roughly 40% on the Boeing 787 portion of the provisioning. And then, on the legacy side also, we had seen slower take-up than we had seen in 2013 and 2014, partly due to maybe high level of inventory of provisioning parts at the airlines.","And I think that's been the biggest change. So that's not really competition. It's probably more a function of the inventory at the airlines and the resetting of the expectations on Boeing 787. The provisioning associated with new aircraft A350 and the A320neo that David talked about, we still expect that to happen, and that should come through in the second half.","On the repairs side which is where the competition part is, as you said, again, there we have seen the better reliability of the products translating into lower activity, lower repair activity, which is creating some pricing pressure. And that, we do feel that with the surplus part availability and the airlines using green time, specifically for out-of-production aircraft, has had some impact on our expectation on the repair side as well. That phenomena might continue for a little longer, but we do think provisioning should come back. The piece parts business has \u2013 is \u2013 continues to do well, maybe just a little bit lower, but still up high-single digits as compared to our prior expectation of 10%. So hopefully that gives you color on UTAS.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's very helpful. And then my second question would just be on Otis. Not so much the sort of end market trends because you laid those out very clearly, but more in terms of Otis' own kind of strategy, how you look at the competitive landscape. I mean, are there things you think you can do differently? Because at the moment, it feels like market share may be going down, margins going down as well. So is there any kind of rethink about what Otis needs to do from here to reverse those things?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Julian, I think the \u2013 Otis \u2013 the key for Otis really, is to regain market share. Over the last 10 years or 15 years, we've seen a continued erosion of Otis market share as we have pursued margin expansion, and I think we have taken margin expansion to the point now where we're not terribly competitive based on new equipment pricing. And quite frankly, you've got to feed the service business with new equipment orders. And so, we're starting to see a pick-up in new equipment in the U.S. We've started to see a little bit in Europe, but we've seen a big slowdown in China.","And I think we need to fundamentally think about how we're going to grow top-line new equipment and regain market share, and so Jerome and the team are laser-focused on coming up with strategies to regain share. There's also the issue of course, of service in Europe, and that is probably the biggest issue. Otis has 1.9 million elevators under service, about 1.1 million of those are in Europe. And that's where we've seen the biggest pricing pressure, and we've seen no growth in that market for the last couple of years. So we've got to return to growth on new equipment, and we've got to stem the service degradation and pricing that we've seen in Europe as well.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So one of the things which the team is focused on, Julian, is to try and address the attrition of the service contracts that happens in the business on a normal course, and Jerome has put a lot of focus on making sure that our attrition rates, particularly in Europe come down from what we have seen over the last few years. Secondly, we need to continue to work on developing the technology base differentiation in our service offering. That can then allow us to command the price premium that we've always had in the service markets in Europe as well. And finally, we're going to continue to look for a little bit more of acquisition of service portfolios to help density which is the name of the game, as you know on the service side.","So I think those are some of the things that are being worked on to improve the service situation in Europe faster. Ultimately, we do believe as the new equipment market improves in Europe \u2013 which there are some early signs of, still mixed, but certain markets like Spain is showing signs of improvement, which has been down for a long time, that will certainly reduce a little bit of pressure on the service side as more activity starts to happen on new equipment.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quick question \u2013 first one on China. How much, when you look at the revision to the full-year plan, how much sequentially are you planning on China revenues at Otis being down in the second half? And if you can break that up, residential versus the service and infrastructure pieces, it would look like that's \u2013 you're expecting declines there in the sort of 30% in the year-on-year comparisons in Residential. Is that about right, or how should we think about the exit rate in the back half of the year?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","For the \u2013 I'm not sure I understand the 30% comment, Carter, but overall, I would say for Otis new equipment, we expect China to be down probably low-single digit in the back half of this year in terms of sales, and order rates obviously, could be \u2013 that's the more uncertain part, but that, as you know very well, it doesn't necessarily impact the current year as much.","The positive think on Otis in China is that the service market continues to grow. We all know it's a small base, but in spite of all the turmoil in the construction industry there, the service business in China for Otis grew again, 15% in the current quarter, which was encouraging. And then, with regard to the breakup between, say, Residential and Commercial, if that's what you were asking on the Otis side, I can tell you from a brand perspective, certainly the Otis brand which is more on the large commercial prestigious jobs did a lot better both in terms of new equipment orders and in terms of new equipment sales in the quarter than the Xizi brand which is more at the residential and the lower end of the segment.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And can you quantify the magnitude of OCL and how much it was up versus Xizi and how much it was down?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So in terms of new equipment orders, 10%, I think OCL was flattish, maybe just down slightly, while Xizi orders was down in teens.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just...","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","(41:23) 10%.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just kind of a bigger-picture question on the just the planning process, Greg, when you look at the \u2013 Akhil's comments about the expectations for 10% growth in provisioning on the back of a 12% year and on the back of a 19% year the year before that, I guess when you look at that plan and say, what was missed or what was it about the specific parts that are being procured or the planning function that drove that kind of outcome that can be so far off, and when you look back on that, any color about how a miss like that can be that far off in what we think of as a pretty stable aftermarket business?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think to Akhil's earlier point, when we came off of two very, very strong years of provisioning growth, I think we just assumed that we were going to continue to see that kind of growth. And even \u2013 like Akhil said, it was 19% last year, so we thought it would slow down to 10% this year. There were plans by airline where that provisioning was going to come from. But the fact is they didn't \u2013 the airlines, for various reasons, didn't take the provisioning. The rollout of the neo and the CSeries has been slower than what we expected, so we haven't seen provisioning there.","But I'll tell you that probably the root cause is we pushed the Aerospace Systems guys to have a plan that was going to be up roughly $300 million for the year. And in order to do that, they had to push the aftermarket guys to deliver a much bigger number. And at the end of the day, I don't think there was a strong basis in that aftermarket assumption around how we were going to get there. They \u2013 again, they were looking at trends, but I don't think we delved deep enough into \u2013 or we didn't question enough the assumptions underlying how they were going to get there.","And so I would tell you that's a miss on my part, that's a miss on our part from a planning perspective that we didn't dig deep enough last year when these plans were getting put together. And we have obviously spent a lot of time in the last month, Akhil and myself, with the team \u2013 with Dave Gitlin's team, and we've done the same thing with Geraud on the Otis side.","We have dug deep into this in terms of the planning assumptions. And I think on the Otis, it's actually easier to understand, because there we'd expected a recovery in Europe, like Akhil said; kind of up low single digits, and it's not there. In fact, it's still going to be down. But the aftermarket assumption at UTAS, that's just a miss.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. And Greg, the comments about the desire not to deliver any more bad news is well taken. The question we're getting is why didn't you opt to do this at the Paris Air Show when you adjusted Sikorsky? And did you not have enough information at that point? Because it seems pretty clear that you were going to fall far short on both Otis China and the UTAS aftermarket.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Nigel, we \u2013 obviously we had expected some pressure on the UTAS guidance. I think Dave signaled that. Had we taken the number down in early June, I would tell you we wouldn't have taken it down enough though. And our concern was let's make sure we really understand how bad this is. Dave had some plans in the back half of June in terms of orders that he expected to get that he didn't get; and quite frankly, it was a lot worse than I think Dave or anybody else expected when he stood up in June. So, in that respect, we could have taken it down a little bit, but it wouldn't have been enough.","On the Otis side, again, I think that we were still hoping for some recovery, better news out of China in June. It's a big month for orders. And we're also expecting to hopefully see a reversal of trend in the European market that we have not seen. Again, the Europe stuff, easier for me to understand in terms of from a forecast standpoint, we had a big assumption, we were wrong. Okay. But on the Aerospace Systems side, that was just, again, a big miss.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And, I mean, obviously there was a lot of transition going on at the end of last year. But it did feel like the plan was a little bit too blue sky, not just on the provision side but Otis China and one or two other areas. Is that recognized and are you putting in steps to cure that problem?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, just on Otis China, we entered the year with a 13% increase in backlog, and we had expected orders to be only up about 5% for the year. The fact is orders are down 10%. So, yeah, maybe we were too aggressive there. But a 5% increase didn't seem like overly aggressive from a new equipment standpoint. Property market's come down a lot faster in China than we expected. We've seen a lot of pressure there. And I think, the other planning assumptions, did we push hard? Yeah, we did.","To your point, there was a lot of transition last year. Obviously been a lot of changes since we put these plans together. But, again, I'll tell you, it all ultimately falls on me; and it's my responsibility to make sure that the forecasts we put together are the right forecasts. And I think we just got way too aggressive on the aftermarket at UTAS and the European recovery. And it hasn't happened.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just finally, Greg, on the Sikorsky, the buyback from the proceeds, do you intend to get a little bit ahead of the closure on Sikorsky with that buyback or do we have to wait until we get the cash in before we can do the bulk of that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think, Nigel, we'll have to see is what happens with the stock price here over the next couple of months. Obviously, as we get certainty of close and we'll see, I would think in the next three or four months, I think we'll have an indication from the Department of Defense and from Justice and from the other regulatory authorities about certainty of close. And whether we wait 'til the day I see the $9 billion clear or we do it a month or so early, I think that'll just be determined upon the market and what we see with the stock price","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Your line is now open.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Greg, I want to follow up on your market share comments on Otis. Was that comment specifically addressed to the China market where it appears that your competitors are doing a little bit better than you are? Because it looks like in North America, you've done pretty well. Can you just give a little bit more color around your comment on Otis market share?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think, overall, Otis has lost share really across most markets except North America. I think the North American market has actually remained relatively robust for us from a market share standpoint; but clearly, we've lost share in China. You recall seven or eight years ago, we thought we had roughly 25% market share; today, that number is probably less than 15%. And I think, again, some of the competitors have come in under us from a pricing standpoint, probably been more aggressive, and we have lost share. It's not just in China; but obviously, China is the biggest market by a factor of, I don't know, three or four or more. So, that's really where the lion's share of where the market share loss has been.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","And then thinking about Otis in the 2016, obviously, given the lead times on new equipment. We already have a bit of a clue what 2016 is going to look like. Can you help us in terms of thinking about 2016 for Otis? I mean, at this point, should we expect China to be down next year on the new equipment side in terms of sales?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It's a little early to talk about 2016 in specifics, but I think it's not too difficult to project that China is likely to be down next year, right, in terms of new equipment. So, you'd see pressure in China by far, even in dollar terms, it's more than 40% of Otis new equipment sales. So, therefore, that market is going to be under pressure.","The question is \u2013 and that's a determination we all have to make together over the next three, four, five months as we come close to giving guidance for 2016, what happens in Europe? Because if the European service market starts to recover and the European economy start to get better, that can, because it's such a large business and it's profitable business, can offset some of the issues that we might see in China. We do expect U.S. to continue to be strong, but the real question mark is what happens to Europe and whether it is enough to offset China or not.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. Greg, if you could maybe walk us through how are you thinking about the portfolio now? I mean, there are some quotes that you may be made this morning in the press that you were saying that UTC is done getting smaller. Can you elaborate on that? And then part of that is what do you see now as the long-term organic growth of the company? I mean, is UTC just sort of fixed now (50:46) forever being sort of like a global GDP grower, or how do you think about that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let's talk about first of all the portfolio. And as I said last year when I took over, we were going to take a hard look at the portfolio. I think we have done that for all of the major pieces of the portfolio. Obviously, shedding Sikorsky was a big decision. But for the most part, I would tell you \u2013 and as I think I said this morning when we were talking to some reporters, is we're done getting smaller at UTC. We've shed $15 billion in sales since 2010; and again, most end markets where we didn't see great growth or we saw a lot of uncertainty or very low margin business. So, I think the portfolio that we have today is positioned to grow a heck of a lot faster than any of those businesses that we left.","And you think about Pratt, again, this quarter sales growth, okay, nothing to write home about; but the fact is, we'll be shipping 7,000 GTF engines over the next ten years. Pratt's top line is going to go from $15 billion to $25 billion. You're going to see very solid organic growth there. The same on the Aerospace Systems side, as you get through all of these new programs. We've got more than 50 new systems on these new aircraft that are going to be delivered. So, the long-term organic growth story on the Aerospace side I think is solid. It remains solid I would tell you on the CCS side.","Over in BIS, we've seen very good continued growth there. The Otis business is a challenge, and I think we had expected kind of mid-single digit growth. It's probably only going to be 2% for this year. We've got to, again, get \u2013 return to market share growth in order to make sure that we're driving more than GDP growth in the Otis business. So, there's work to do there.","But I would tell you, the portfolio as far as the platforms that we want to be in, is exactly right. I think, again, we've got a good balance between commercial and Aerospace, and I don't see any more big divestitures. I think instead what we're trying to do is we're going to build this business and we're going to build it through M&A. And to the extent that we can't find M&A that creates value, we're going to return the capital to you guys, and let you guys invest it. But right now, our goal is to grow UTC and I think we can grow organically even without big M&A. But we're going to look to find ways where we can add M&A that makes a lot of sense and that creates value.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And if I can, just one follow-on on one of your earlier comments. You talked about pushing the plan in UTAS and that the aftermarket guys came back. I mean, Culturally, does bad news flow up at UTC or is that something within the culture of the company that has to change?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It does now. Look, I think there was a reluctance from people to flow bad news up. And I think if (53:39) people took the challenges and they tried to figure out a way to do that. And for the most part, the Aerospace Systems guys have done a good job over the last three years since the acquisition of delivering on their commitments; and so, I can't fault them for one awful year.","The business is still going to generate $2.5 billion of profit this year. It's just not going to grow. And shame on us on the forecast side, but the fact is we need to make sure that when there is bad news, it does flow up and we understand what the issues and challenges are. And so, Akhil and I have put that in process. We're out; we're doing more business reviews; we're spending more time on the road to make sure that we truly understand what's going on in these individual businesses. And again, I think that was a discipline that we had lost over the last few years and we've got to put back in place.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Greg, I just want to go back on a comment you just made about if you can't find high return M&A, you would return the capital. Can you just kind of talk through how selling Sikorsky and paying on the order of 31% taxes, makes \u2013 that tax leakage makes more sense than just having spun it out, and how you thought about that?","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Okay. Let's walk through that. So, when we looked at Sikorsky as a stand-alone business, we'll do about $600 million in EBIT this year. However, when we did the spin, we were going to add about $100 million dollars of cost to the Sikorsky business, or it could be stand-alone business; that's IT, that's finance, treasury. All those things that UTC provides have to be done on a stand-alone basis. And so, when we looked at Sikorsky stand-alone, we thought about our business was worth \u2013 did about $500 million of EBIT, and we figured it would trade for around 10 times EBIT as a defense contractor, which is kind of a market multiple.","That gave you a $5 billion valuation for Sikorsky if we spun it out. Even if you got a 10% or 15% premium on that $5 billion for a potential takeout, you're still looking at less than $6 billion of value in terms of what is Sikorsky worth as a stand-alone business. I think of the fact that we're going to net over $6 billion on this deal and the fact that it's certain, it's today, it's cash, made a heck of a lot more sense than the risk associated with a spin, the cost, and how the market reacts.","And I think Sikorsky will have a tough couple of years in front of it. They've got some big development issues and programs they've got to get past. It's a very solid company long-term with great technology, but that $5 billion valuation wasn't even certain. So, when I got an offer that I considered to be compelling with a company that I thought was the perfect fit for Sikorsky, we did the math and it came out to be pretty simple in the end.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then also this year, you had been talking about $300 million worth of gains in restructuring. I imagine some portion of that was going to Sikorsky in terms of the actions. Do you slow those down or stop those? And does that give you any sort of net gain over restructuring, or how do you think about that?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Not materially, Sam. I think there was some amount of restructuring that you saw in the second quarter at Sikorsky; it's in $25 million range if I recall or somewhere in that range. I think we continue to do the right think for Sikorsky, and that's why Bob Leduc launched the action early as the volume fell off. But I wouldn't expect for that to have a material impact in the back half.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted...","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","...to go back to Otis for one second. You mentioned the backlog conversion in China is slowing. I was wondering if you could offer just a little bit more color on that. How bad is it getting, the conversion? And if you could reflect on maybe some prior cycles, maybe in other geographies, maybe we can learn a bit from what we've seen in other geographies in different time periods to get an understanding of how bad that backlog conversion can get and whether there's still further risk there.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Jason. I think typically what we find at Otis is that you see a 60% conversion of the opening backlog, and then the rest of the sales essentially comes from current-year orders. What we've seen is a couple, two to three points slowdown in that conversion rate from the backlog this year, and that's largely due to the credit availability issues in the China market.","We typically like to have \u2013 to make sure that we get our money before we release equipment, and that's where we have seen some of the slowdown in the conversion. So, at this point, the team believes it's appropriately sized, two to three points and maybe there could be a point or two to go which is what we have factored in to our back half forecast here for China right now. So, between 55% to 60% conversion should still be possible and doable.","Obviously, as you know, the Chinese government is doing everything it can to try and help the economy improve the credit availability in the marketplace at some of what they can do and to prop up the real estate markets again. So, we'll see where it all ends up but I think we are appropriately sized at this point.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then one question on the commercial aftermarket. There were two phrases that you used there that I found interesting: pricing pressure and part availability. Obviously, it sounds like we've got quite a bit of inventory out there. I was wondering if you could make some attribution as to where that part availability or inventory is coming from. Are we seeing more parked aircraft of where (59:51) your installed base is shrinking perhaps a little bit for the aircraft? Yeah.","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would say it's not so much about retirements or part availability. I would attribute it more to airline efficiency in the sense that there is greater \u2013 in the marketplace, there is more efficiency in terms of either pulling up parts, surplus parts, are easier identification of where the parts are.","So, when an airline is looking for a particular item for repair, it almost feels like it's a little easier these days to find that part in the surplus market as opposed to necessarily going for the new one. That's probably the change that is there of the airline efficiency part, I would call it. It's not that the retirements are going up. It is just that the market is a little more efficient now.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And no pricing pressure from P&A (1:00:42) or any other issues? You think that encapsulates all of the pricing pressure?","Akhil Johri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, and I think there our strategy of going for more FMPs in the parts (1:00:55) situation where we are getting more than 80% of our engines now under fleet management program and improving that rate to over 60% in the case of the C.A.R.E. program for UTAS is the right strategy to address that part of the issue.","It's more about making sure we have a larger part of the service activity under our management and under our control, which helps the airlines as well, because we do a much better job of maintaining the aircraft and our parts for them and they're under our program, in the fleet management program.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. Like to hand the call back over to Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you very much. And thanks, everyone, for listening today. Not the results that you would come to expect from UTC, but you can be assured that we are working it diligently. The IR team with Paul and company will be available throughout the day to take your questions, and have a great day.

On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC\u2019s website at www.utc.com.","Please note, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.","The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC\u2019s SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.","Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself to the queue and we will answer as time permit.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning a solid finish to the first quarter with earnings per share of $1.32 and 5% organic sales growth. Earnings were little bit better than what we expected driven by the higher organic sales.","Segment operating profit was up 9%, reflecting improvement in all five segments and operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 15.4%. So a good start to the year, which gives us confidence to increase the bottom end of our EPS guidance range. We now expect 2014 earnings per share of $6.65 to $6.85 that\u2019s growth of 7% to 10% and an increase from our prior guidance of $6.55 to $6.85.","Okay, turning to slide two, organic sales grew 5% in the quarter with growth in all five segments. As the momentum coming out of the fourth quarter of 2013 continued and the commercial businesses we saw 7% growth in the Americas helped by the ongoing U.S. economic recovery and we continue to see signs of improvement in Europe organic, sales were up 3% in the quarter. The commercial businesses also saw 7% growth in Asia led by China where sales were up 14% more than offsetting some softness in other parts of the region.","Looking at aerospace, continued weakness in defense where sales were down 2% was more than offset by strong growth in commercial OE and aftermarket where overall sales increased 8%.","Let\u2019s look at orders now on page three, overall order trends remained positive for the majority of the portfolio. Just a reminder, we will talk orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do.","First, in our commercial businesses, we continue to see traction in North America. Despite some weather related impacts at the beginning of the year, the outlook for housing and commercial construction markets remained encouraging.","North America residential HVAC orders were up 19% versus last year, as the housing market continues to improve and distributors stocks for the summer season. The Architectural Billing Index or the ABI trends are positive and we see that coming through in our order in August, where new equipment was up 39%.","North American commercial HVAC orders were down 4% in the quarter, reflecting an uneven demand for large engineered systems, although, we continue to expect that business to grow for the full year 2014.","In Europe, the economic environment is trending positively, albeit slowly. Eurozone PMI expanded for the nine consecutive month and economic sentiment is at the highest levels since about mid 2011. Unemployment continues to be near all-time highs, the deflation remains a concern.","At UTC, CCS commercial HVAC equipment and fire and security product orders grew 15% and 10%, respectively. While Otis new equipment and CCS commercial refrigeration orders were each down about 2%.","Okay, on China, while reports recently suggested property markets slowdown in parts of the country, we continue to see solid demand in housing and infrastructure in the first quarter. Otis new equipment orders were up 25% in the first quarter, with several large infrastructure project orders coming in the quarter.","CCS commercial HVAC was up 10% and fire product orders were up mid single digits. So our building and industrial systems businesses continue to be well-positioned building on the strength we saw in 2013.","Moving to aerospace, with increasing air traffic and airline profit projected to almost $19 billion this year. We continue to see solid conversions of OE backlogs and good growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses. At Pratt & Whitney commercial spare orders were up 11%, while UTC aerospace systems spares orders were up 9%. So, good broad base orders growth across the portfolio.","We will keep a close eye on China and the other emerging markets, and continue to look for signs of further progress in Europe. The order rates and microeconomic trends broadly support our assumption to organic growth as we move through the year.","Okay, let\u2019s go take a look at the first quarter specifically now on slide four. Full reported sales increased 2%, as 5% organic growth was partially offset by headwinds from net divestitures and FX. On the FX side, the benefits from the year were more than offset by headwinds and other currencies.","Segment operating profit grew 9%, operating margins increased 90 basis points, including the benefit, of course, from pensions. CCS saw solid drop through and continues to drive cost reduction, where operating profit grew 15% with margin expansion of 200 basis points.","Aerospace systems at Pratt & Whitney expanded margins by 170 and 80 basis points, respectively, each on the higher commercial aftermarket benefits from cost reduction actions, as well as pension.","Earning per share $1.32 that\u2019s down 5%, a segment operating profit growth of 9% was more than offset by $0.20 of net restructuring headwinds in the quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2013 we had $0.11 sense of net gains, while we saw $0.09 of net restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2014 as we invested in cost reduction initiatives ahead of some expected gains around the middle of year. Absent the impact of gains and restructuring in both this years and last year earning per share were up 10%.","Free cash flow in the quarter was 83% of net income, capital expenditure was $333 million that\u2019s up 13% versus last years as we continue to invest for ramp-up in commercial aerospace and working capital grew by $521 million in the quarter, driven primarily by an inventory build to support sales growth in the year.","We also acquired $335 million stock under share repurchase program and we expect buyback at similar out here in the second quarter. Let me stop there for now, I\u2019d like to talk more about the full year but first let me turn over Jay who will walk you through the business unit results.","Jay Malave","Thanks, Greg. Turning to page five, Otis sales improved 7% at constant currency in the quarter with new equipment sales up mid-teens including solid growth form all areas, most notably double-digit growth in China, the Americas, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, service sales were up slightly.","Operating profit was up 1% at constant currency. The positive impact from higher sales volume was partially offset by continued pricing pressure and carryover cost associated with the North America factory transformation.","New equipment orders were up 11% with double-digit growth in China and North America. EMEA orders were down low single-digit. For the strong order book and near-term completion of the factory transformation in North America, Otis expects to see improving performance as the year progresses. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profit expected to increase $100 million to $150 million and mid single-digit sales growth.","On slide six, climate controls and security increase the profits 15% in the quarter on flat sales, resulting in another sharp increase in margins up 200 basis points from prior year to 15.1%.","Organic sales were up 3% in the quarter benefiting from product and marketing investments. On a regional basis, the Americas business was up mid single-digit, driven by 21% growth in the residential HVAC business, some of which was due to earlier stocking by distributors for the cooling season from what we experienced last years.","Europe is turning the corner and was up slightly led by growth in commercial HVAC. China was up high single-digit, while Asia overall was flat driven by softness in other Asian countries and Transicold was up 7%.","Profit growth in the quarter was driven by strong conversion on organic sales, as well as restructuring and net productivity gains driven by ACE and operational excellence. Orders for global commercial HVAC equipment were up low single-digit.","Order for global fire and security products were up high single-digit, partially offset by a decline in the fire and security field businesses. Transicold orders which tend to be more choppy were down high teens. With solid results in the first quarter, we continue to expect profit growth of $225 million to $250 million on mid-single digit organic sales growth at CCS.","Turning to aerospace on slide seven. At Pratt & Whitney, organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter as commercial sales growth across the businesses more than offset declines in military. Including the divestiture of power systems, sales were down 2%. Large commercial after market sales were up 10% over last year\u2019s first quarter which was the weakest of 2013.","Operating profit was up 4% driven by higher organic sales, lower pension cost and restructuring savings which more than offset headwinds from adverse large commercial OE mix, the power systems divestiture in the absence of last year\u2019s contract close out at partnership settlement benefits.","For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney\u2019s operating profit to be up $175 million to $200 million on most single digit sales growth. UTC Aerospace Systems delivered a solid quarter with 17% profit growth on 6% higher sales. Sales growth was driven by higher commercial volumes, with OEM up high single digit and aftermarket up 10%.","Overall, military sales were down low single digit with military OEM flattish and military aftermarket down mid-single digit. Year-on-year profit growth was driven by higher commercial aftermarket volumes, continued synergy traction, pension tailwind and higher income from licensing agreements, partially offset by headwinds from higher engineering spend and new program OE growth. Operating margins expanded 170 basis points to 17.3%.","Orders for commercial spares grew 9% on a year-over-year basis with strength in both parts and provisioning. For the year, we continue to expect profit growth of $300 million to $350 million on mid-to-high single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.","Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine. Operating profit grew 8% on 9% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 48 aircraft including 36 based on military platforms and 12 commercial. The sales increase was driven by higher international military and commercial OE volumes.","Operating profit growth was driven by higher sales volume and net favorable contract performance adjustments in our military business partially offset by unfavorable aircraft and aftermarket mix. During the first quarter, Sikorsky, the Turkish government and key Turkish aerospace suppliers signed a licensing and manufacturing agreement for 109 multimission aircraft to be used by the Turkish government. For the full year, we continue to expect flattish operating profit and high single-digit organic sales growth.","With that, let met turn it over to Greg for wrap up.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks Jay. So solid start to the year. We continue to achieve significant milestones in our programs and secure key wins for the future. At Pratt & Whitney, IAE reached a new production milestone in February when it shipped its 6000 V2500 engines.","We also continue to see strong demand for the GTF engine with new engine offerings wins at ANA and Tiger Air in additional orders at the regional jet market on both the Embraer E2 and the C-Series platform. Customers clearly see the advantage of our engine and have placed firm and option orders for over 5300 engines to date.","On the military side, Republic of Korea announced its selection of the JSF as its next generation fighter jet. Korea\u2019s commitment to purchase 40 F-35A conventional take-off and landing aircraft will bring expected international deliveries to over 700 aircrafts.","At aerospace systems, the segment recently announced a long-term agreement with Lufthansa Technique, maintenance repair, overhaul services for aircraft interiors, products, sensors and integrated systems on the Boeing 787 aircraft. We also recently extended our care program Singapore Airlines which provides repair services, asset management. The airlines expanded fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft.","Also in the quarter, Sikorsky announced the entry into the service of the S-76D. As Jay mentioned, Sikorsky also signed agreements with the Turkish government to supply 109 T-70 helicopters, which are variants of Sikorsky\u2019s S-70i International Black Hawk.","On U.S. government side, prospects for the Combat Rescue Helicopter, VXX Presidential Helicopter program remains positive. The firm decision is expected around the middle of this year.","Okay. Let\u2019s talk about CMH for just a second. We continue to make progress on the CMH program and we\u2019ve recently executed the second Principles of Agreement with the Canadian government which now defines a final configuration for the aircraft as well as the phase delivery schedule which allows for the retirement of the Canadian seeking helicopters beginning in 2015.","We also now expect that the final cost of the aircraft will be significantly higher than previously estimated as a result of additional requirements, retrofit costs and expansion of the program schedule. We continue to negotiate the financial impact of these program changes for the Canadian government but we would expect to record a charge this year associated with the acquisition contract upon the completion of the definitive agreements.","We expect the charge will be largely offset by other one-time gains, beneficial items during the year. We\u2019ll provide an update later in the quarter as we work to finalize the agreements and complete our analysis of total program cost.","BIS or Building & Industrial Systems had a very strong first quarter with combined organic sales growth of 5%. Integration activities continue to progress well and the CCS and the Otis team continue to look for ways to serve our customers more efficiently and offer integrated high value systems.","We\u2019re pleased with the continued CCS momentum, the return of profit growth at Otis and the overall growth prospects for the business. And we continue to win orders in key emerging markets.","Now, this is 25% order growth in China included large orders for the Shenzhen and Chengdu metros. And CCS was awarded major maintenance contracts for the fire safety and HVAC systems of the New Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal in Hong Kong.","We continue to expect the combined capability of CCS and Otis and the new Building and Industrial System organization to further accelerate top line growth. So, just as you heard from the presidents in March, each of the businesses is well-positioned in our core markets and continued innovation will allow us to drive long-term organic growth.","Okay. Taking a look at the rest of 2014, no real changes when we told you last month. The compares get tougher as you move through the order trends and end markets are essentially in line with our expectations so far. First as we\u2019ve seen with recent development in the Ukraine, things can change quickly. But as I sit here today, we remain confident in our updated guidance range at $665 million to $685 million with the path towards the high end and sales were about $64 billion.","And we continue to expect quarterly earnings per share growth of about 9% to 10% per quarter, absent the impact of gains in restructuring will remain throughout the year. We continue to invest in restructuring. With visibilities to some additional gains and good payback restructuring projects across the business, we now expect to spend about $375 million on restructuring this year, all offset by one-time gains.","In the first quarter, we spend $125 million. We would expect to spend to be relatively level loaded for the rest of the year. Gains however should come largely in the second quarter. Strong cash generation remains a hallmark of UTC. Although pressured by the increase in CapEx and working capital in 2014, we continue to target free cash flow equal to net income for the year. We\u2019re going to maintain our placeholders of $1 billion for each of share repurchase, debt paydown and M&A activities.","Looking ahead, we remained focused on growth and execution in 2014. We\u2019re well positioned in our end markets and we\u2019ll continue to leverage our industry leading franchises in global scale. UTC portfolio is poised to take advantage of the commercial aerospace growth and organization megatrends over the next decade.","So with that, I will stop and open up the call for questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Good morning Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Good morning. I just had a question on Otis. Because I guess in Q1, you had organic sales growth in line with the full-year target of 6%. The EBIT was flat, though. So I guess what's giving you the confidence that, with a given organic growth run rate the rest of the year, you can get the EBIT up? Is it just that the U.S. factory relocation costs were again a very big headwind in Q1 and that drops out or is there something in the mix that you're expecting?","Greg Hayes","There\u2019s a couple of pieces here, Julian. I think the Florence factory transformation. It was a headwind but a small, small headwind this quarter. I think less than $10 million so, drove a little bit of headwind. Really the biggest issue was continued pricing pressures that we saw around the portfolio and you think about it, where the growth came in the quarter, we had 16% growth in OE and only 1% growth in the service business.","So it is the pricing pressure around OE that is pushing margins down a little bit and causing us to see, I would say tepid growth on the op profit side here in the first quarter. But it will get better during the course of the year and we expect service to improve, to come down the cost curve and the equipment will get cost reduction in the factories. We will see some of the benefits from the integration of BIS, so all those things give us confidence. We are still on track from $125 million to $150 million of profit growth for the year.","Jay Malave","$100 to $150 million.","Greg Hayes","$100 to $150 million, correct.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. And then within I guess, BIS overall, you were targeting, I think around mid-single digit growth for the year. You did 7% growth in Q1. What\u2019s your sense on the sort of non-residential markets in North America specifically? Is that trending in line or you\u2019ve seen kind of choppiness there through last year?","Greg Hayes","Well, there was really, I would say two different stories in North American non-res. Clearly on the OE side, we are seeing very, very solid growth in the commercial construction side of the business. Again, that\u2019s been driven by again the ABI above 50 here for most of the last year and really solid momentum in the commercial building space.","On the CCS side, specifically on the carrier side I think Jay mentioned a little tougher compare there on the orders for the carrier commercial business and down about 4%. But keep in mind, little different business there, that is primarily 80% of retrofit business and only about 20% relates to new building construction. So we are seeing traction, I think our new buildings. I would also point out that the OTIS new equipment business fell much more dramatically than the carrier commercial business during the last downturn. So, I still think we will see growth in commercial business in carrier for the year, slight growth and we expect the order trend momentum at OTIS to continue as well.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Just a couple of quick ones. One, with respect to the pricing pressure at Otis, I wondered if you might kind of give us some color there. Has that intensified or eased at all, what\u2019s been your sense on that this quarter versus what you talked about last year?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t tell you there is any trend change there. We continue to see pricing pressure in most of the markets for new equipment as you can imagine. But China remains the most competitive of all of the new markets. We continue to see pricing pressure there. North America, a little bit better. Again, we\u2019ve got new products that have come out and we\u2019ve done very well in terms of market penetration and pricing looks to have stabilized at least in North America. In Europe -- well, it is Europe. I mean, it\u2019s a tough, tough market. So, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen an inflection here but I don\u2019t think we have seen any improvement in pricing.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Okay. Great. And on the military front with respect to the down 2% number, you quantified the numbers in UTAS, but I wondered if you might speak to the declines you called out in Pratt and then at Sikorsky, given obviously what should be a pretty tough aftermarket compare there?","Jay Malave","Sure, Carter. At Pratt & Whitney, the military business was down low double digits. The OE business was down high teens and the aftermarket business was down low single digits. At Sikorsky, the military business, the O.E. was actually up as well as the aftermarket.","The O.E. was up on the back of the international deliveries to higher international deliveries. The aftermarket was up, as I said in my remarks that there was a performance adjustments, contract adjustments. It impact profit as well as impact sales. So that business including that was up around 10%.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","If you exclude the adjustment, what would the growth rate have been?","Jay Malave","It would have been more, I think flattish.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Okay. All right. Thanks for the color, guys.","Greg Hayes","Okay, Carter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Joe.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Could you speak a little bit more to our Pratt spares? I guess, first of all, on the mix versus the legacy 4000, 2000. And then just thinking about the year, the comps get a lot tougher starting this quarter and so do you expect to be up as we look and I know you are not going to give quarterly guidance for this one line item but maybe more on the profile?","Jay Malave","So let me start with some of the data points and orders. The PW4000 and V2500 were both up. The PW2000 was down. But if you recall in the fourth quarter, we had a significant amount of orders for the PW2000 for delivery in 2014. So the book-to-bill on 2000 was well above, around 1.5.","As far as going forward, it is really -- as far as what we see is, is really not much of a change in our expectations for mid-single digit growth for the year. As Greg mentioned during his remarks, traffic is still flowing well, airline profitability is still strong. We are seeing a little bit of higher content per shop visit as we start the year, but again these things change. So there will be no significant change to expectations for the full year at this point.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Okay. And then just secondly, on Transicold, sales up nicely but orders down quite a bit, Baltic Dry Index was down, was down pretty significantly in Q1, so this is a pretty quick turn business. So when you think about profile, particularly margin profile for CCS for the rest of the year, how is this is going to have an impact?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. Clearly, I think we\u2019ve got some headwind going into Q2 with CCS. I think container was down more than 50% in orders in the first quarter but again sales were up. And so to your point, it\u2019s a very short cycle business. We still see the trend for refrigerator transport on a positive basis, up probably 3% to 4% this year. So it\u2019s lumpy in the orders and I wouldn\u2019t panic about the Transicold as they sit here in April. I think it was a year ago, we went six months without orders in the container business and then all of a sudden, it was gangbuster so. We should really focus on the longer term prospects. I think we are well positioned with great products as well as continue expanding markets.","Jay Malave","Joe, our expectations for the year are not overly aggressive. We are expecting for the total Transicold business to be up low to mid-single digit. So we are not banking on big growth in that business this year.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Okay. If I might sneak just one more quick one in, Greg, you have $375 million of restructuring to offset now, plus what seems that it could be couple $100 million - I don\u2019t know in a $100 million range plus of CMH charge, so could you give a little color on the gains that you are expecting to generate?","Greg Hayes","I wouldn\u2019t go -- I would tell you this. We do see gains out there, adequate gains to cover what we think is the range of potential loss on the CMH. The good news of CMH is with this new contract, I think we get a big chunk of the acquisition cost behind us, change in the way we account for this going to a cost-to-cost basis. So it gets it behind us and we have the flexibility with some things that we\u2019ve got in the pipeline to be able to cover most of that costs. So as I think about guidance, $665 million to $685 million, still very confident even with the CMH charge.","Joe Nadol - J.P. Morgan","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","","Good morning, folks.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Just a couple of things. Just on resi HVAC in the U.S., just little peculiar that people would be stocking early, it seems that there is something going on there where stocks extraordinarily low and any other color you would shed on that?","Greg Hayes","Well, I think as we talked about most of last year, the dealer stock was relatively low on a historic basis. If you look at inventories today, it looks like they were up about 20% as we headed the first quarter, which is in line with of course 19% growth we saw in U.S. res business. Again, dealers are procuring for what they think is going to be a very strong summer season and despite these weather issues that we saw in the first quarter I think people are generally optimistic.","Housing starts were trending positively in over a million. And keep in mind that this is still an 80% add-on replacement business. Only 20% really goes to res and new construction. As the U.S. economy picks up, I think everybody has got confidence, we are going to see a very strong start to the season here. It\u2019s early though, so I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves here. We still expect good growth but clearly not at that 19%, 20% that we saw in the first quarter.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And often it's kind of tough to really know what's going on with pricing this early in the season. But what do you see playing out on pricing, both in resi HVAC and in commercial HVAC this year?","Jay Malave","All right. The visibility that we have, Jeff, is little bit of benefit in pricing on residential side. I don\u2019t have visibility on the commercial side but a little bit of an uptick that we saw in the quarter.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay. And then finally from me, I was just wondering if we could come back to Otis and service. Is service price also declining or your comments strictly around OE equipment? And I am wondering if you\u2019re seeing any firming in service in Europe at all.","Jay Malave","Yes. Service is still tough in Europe. We are still seeing some price headwind, especially in the southern markets. I think service was down even in France this time. Again, it was offset, it was good in Germany, it was good in U.K., it was good in Russia. I think what\u2019s most encouraging, as I think about Otis and service, we\u2019ve been talking about this for several years, as we\u2019re getting really good traction in China. Last year the service business in China was up about 20%. First quarter, it was up almost 20% in service. And last year, I think we added about 50 branches or depots for service. We\u2019re going to add another 50 this year. We are getting traction there. I think again this issue of pricing in Europe, again we think it\u2019s going to stabilize as we go throughout the year. We\u2019ve seen signs of that, but the future of service for Otis is going to be in China. That\u2019s where the growth is going to come and that\u2019s where we are focused right now.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.","David Strauss - UBS","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","David Strauss - UBS","Back to Otis again, in terms of the phasing of the quarters as we go through the year, are you expecting it to continue to be all the EBIT growth to come into the second half and Q2 to be relatively flat year-over-year on an EBIT basis?","Greg Hayes","That\u2019s probably right. You might get a little bit of growth here primarily -- again, as you think about where the cost reduction is going to come in the factories, or the cost reduction is going to come in terms of some of the integration activities that BIS is undertaking, we are seeing mostly cost on the front end and then you picked up the benefits on the back end.","David Strauss - UBS","Okay. Back to CMH, so, Greg, are you implying now that the contract -- new contract that we\u2019re going to have here it\u2019s going to be restructured to the point that you can actually charge off the entire loss that you were going to see with new deliveries, so we won\u2019t have this $14 million per unit hit on a go-forward basis?","Greg Hayes","Let me try to explain this as simply as possibly. We\u2019re going to go to a percentage of completion accounting or cost to cost. So we will write off about 70% to 75% of the acquisition cost, or the losses on the acquisition contract this year because we\u2019re about 70% to 75%. There is some small tailwind in the next couple of years as we complete deliveries, but it\u2019s not in the order of -- it\u2019s nowhere near what we\u2019re talking about before kind of it\u2019s $120 million plus a year, it\u2019s substantially lower.","On top of that, we will start to see the benefit of the ISS contract kick in \u201915 and \u201916 to offset some of the losses. So the goal here is to get most of the bad news behind us I think by adopting this accounting which we think is probably a more realistic look in terms of the way the contract has been restructured gives us the opportunity to do that.","David Strauss - UBS","And just as a last follow-up, what does this due to the Sikorsky guidance for the year, I think the flat EBIT number had baked into that $120 million loss?","Greg Hayes","Yes, obviously they had a $120 million baked in and we run through the segment results. So whatever the charges there, the gains aren\u2019t coming at Sikorsky, but the cost certainly will. So as you think about Sikorsky guidance that we\u2019ve given, it is next CMHP, except for the $120 million that\u2019s baked into the forecast.","David Strauss - UBS","Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you. Actually I want to follow a little bit more with respect to what David said. I mean, Greg, if I understand, you have built almost all the helicopters already. So the charge should be -- I don't know if $350 million, $400 million the way to think about it when you affect this accounting?","Greg Hayes","Yes, I am not going to get into the exact number. The reason is, as I mentioned earlier on, we renegotiated say the scope of the aircraft. So the aircraft will be more expensive because of the increased requirements and the spec changes that we are making. We\u2019ve got some retrofit cost and all of them previously contemplated. So the total cost for the aircraft is going to go up. And as I said, we are 70%, 75% done with the total acquisition contract. So it\u2019s a good trade here. I think we are pretty confident that we\u2019ve got the wherewithal to recover this.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","I mean forever today, I have been hoping that. I mean, because when you look on the balance sheet, it's over $800 million of sort of capitalized costs, if I'm not mistaken, related to this contract at the moment.","Greg Hayes","Yes, actually over a $1 billion but who is counting. I mean, I guess, but keep in mind, so we are still negotiating with the customer on this contract. We are not done yet. So we got to finish the contract negotiation which should be in a couple of weeks. We\u2019ve got to go through that and do a bottoms up estimated complete for the whole contract. I think when Louis stands up at EPG by the end of May, we should be in a pretty good position to give you guys a number. And clearly if it happens after that, we will let everybody know as soon as we do what the impact is there.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","I appreciate. That\u2019s a big help. The other thing that\u2019s important has been that you have been working a lower cost in lot of the other businesses. Could you address some of the actions that UTA has done to drive out its cost? I mean, clearly, there were some profitability related to pension and spares, but you are also trying to lower the recurring cost of what you are doing to become even more competitive?","Greg Hayes","UTA, I think you are referring to UT Aerospace Systems as opposed to UT Automotive?","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","You and I have been around too long.","Greg Hayes","Yes, I think so. There is a couple of things I think you mentioned. We\u2019ve got some good news out of pension in the first quarter. We continue to get good news out of cost reduction on the products. We are coming down the learning curve on the 787. I think we are up to 10 ships sets a months on 787. So driving cost down there. Also, we continue with some of the synergy savings. We are going to get about $100 million of incremental synergy savings during the course of the year, but there is probably $25 million sitting in the first quarter. So all those things that Alain and Dave Gitlin and Mike Dumais talked about month ago are all coming to fruition, really good margin expansion. Obviously, the pension was a little bit of a one-timer, we got a benefit here in the first quarter, but still on your line a good solid cost reduction, good execution across the aerospace systems business.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","And then lastly I noticed you had about $100 million of divestitures or proceeds from divestitures, can you characterize them a little bit, and are there some other businesses that continue to keeping the call busy?","Greg Hayes","I think actually these were keeping us a really busy because primarily this was -- I think, yes, this is part of the whole portfolio rationalization that Geraud has been talking about for the last three to four years and nothing big on the horizon, a couple of small fire and security related businesses, but nothing significant. I think there was a guarding business as well that was divested in the Far East, but there are really nothing terribly significant.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Greg, you mentioned that the majority of the gains are going to be coming in the second quarter. I know you don\u2019t typically like to give any sort of the quarterly run rate, but how should we be thinking about the size of the gains that are going to exceed the restructuring in the second quarter?","Greg Hayes","While we talked about $375 million of gains for the year to offset the restructuring, all $375 million will come in the second quarter as it relates to the piece that is covering the restructuring. As far as the gains to cover the Sikorsky charge, there will be a little bit in the second quarter, and then some in the third and fourth.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then just going back to some of the comments around the Europe, I think the building and industrial systems being up 3%, you\u2019ve guided Europe to being up slightly. And so I am trying to just think you just talked about Otis service really hasn\u2019t improved. So where is that improvement and at what point are you prepared to talk about Europe, perhaps being a little bit better this year than you\u2019ve had in the outlook?","Greg Hayes","Probably in December. I think Europe has been better. Again, we have seen strength in Northern Europe on the new equipment side. I think I mentioned on the service side as well. So a good order traction in Northern Europe. Southern Europe remains a concern. I think orders were down in Spain, Greece, Italy. So again, it\u2019s this balance, but I think generally we\u2019re looking consumer sentiment, it\u2019s up across the continent, unemployment remains high, but things are getting better. I just don\u2019t want to declare victory. I think right now first quarter positive signs. We look at auto sales are starting to pick up. Interest rates remain very low. All of those indicators are there that we should see a recovery. So absent again something bad happened in Eastern Europe to upset the apple cart. I think we feel pretty good about the projections that we\u2019ve got right now.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay. And one last question, the $660 million increase in inventory, you said it\u2019s supporting sales growth later in the year. So when we look at the year end, should we expect inventories to be flat with where they were at the end of last year?","Greg Hayes","That is the plan, Sam. I think Inventory was up a little bit, I think the issue will probably be at Sikorsky on the CMH program and continue to add, Pratt\u2019s starting to add inventory as they start to ramp up for production on C-series on the A320neo. So it would be a little bit of inventory growth, but the growth that you saw in the first quarter although was across all the businesses, you should see most of that start to come back in the cash flow as we go through the year.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America","Good morning, Greg. Just maybe a follow-on to Howard\u2019s question, how should we think about M&A? I mean, you hinted at the investor meeting up in Connecticut that you guys like bigger M&A\/ How should we think about that over the next say 12 to 18 months? Is UTC contemplating doing something, I mean how do we think about it?","Greg Hayes","Well, in very simple terms, I would say I think there is no big deals this year as we sit here and however this is April, but thought of actually consummating a big deal this year is very unlikely. But we continue to look and I think there will some smaller deals less than probably $1 billion for the total year still, again primarily in the CCS side of the business or the BIS side. And then as we will continue to look for those opportunities of scale, we want to do things that fit into the core, but that will capitalize on the global scale.","We are going to continue to buy back shares this year as we have talked about, and if there is opportunity without an M&A, maybe we will take share buyback up again towards the end of the year. But right now, we are focused on this normal long-term goal, and pricing is very difficult on the M&A market today. We bought Goodrich back in 2011. Timing was very, very good. Interest rates remain low, but today prices are up as you know on in the equity side and everybody wants a 30% premium which makes these deals very, very difficult.","So we are going to continue to look for value, but I can tell you with underlying strength in the business we do organic growth, I am not in a hurry to spend the share or money at deals just to grow, we don\u2019t need to buy growth. We will buy opportunistically, we will buy for value and we will buy on the core.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America","Okay, great. And then just second question, changing gears a little bit. When we think about the gear turbo fan, and you're starting to move into a period here with we are not too far away from the A320neo going into service. And how do you -- how are you guys going to recognize profitability on those engines, right? Because my understanding is you're selling with something like 80% of them was power by the hour contracts. So will it be different -- won't it be different than what we currently see with the V2500, or is that going to go?","Greg Hayes","","Yes. Right now, again, it\u2019s a little bit in a state of flux because I think there was a new revenue recognition standard coming out from the FASB in May that\u2019s supposed to be due our last year which is going to cause us to re-look at how we recognize revenue. But as we state here today, we are going to continue to recognize revenue the way we always have to commercial engine business which is, as we ship an engine, we will recognize the revenue or we will recognize the loss on the engine when we ship. We don\u2019t have the ability that Rolls-Royce does to smooth earnings over the life of a aftermarket and OE contract, where you can look at a 20-year aftermarket revenue stream and its normalized margins. That\u2019s just not allowed under U.S. GAAP and it won\u2019t be allowed under the new revenue recognition standard either. But once this new rev rec standard comes out, we will take a look at it. It\u2019s not adopted till 2017 which is just coincident with the big ramp up that we are going to see in the GTF production. So we got time. We will take a look at it and see what the impact is. It will impact some of the other businesses because it will force us to go to percentage of completion of some of the military programs, some of the Black Hawk, but again, little early to worry about that.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America","Okay. And then if I can just sneak in one, quick one. It\u2019s my understand in the quarter, your China orders, I notice were up 27% and in that, I mean, I think you guys have two big China orders. I mean if you were to exclude kind of two major orders out of China, how would we think about of that?.","Greg Hayes","That was about half of the growth came from infrastructure projects and not just those two, but broadly speaking, half was infrastructure , half was on the property side.","Ron Epstein - Bank of America","Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Greg Hayes","Okay, Ron. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Greg, just a quick aftermarket question, should we read anything into the slowdown in new order growth in the first quarter is that just the normal timing ahead of the price increase?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. The first quarter is typically the slowest quarter for order growth as you mentioned we increased prices of catalogue prices. January 1, catalogue is published I think October 1. So, yeah, we saw big ramp up in fourth quarter orders across the aero business. So first quarter I think we feel pretty good about it.","Again, this is all driven continued RPM growth, where, I mean, the airlines are flying the aeroplanes, the airlines are making money and they are bringing the engines back to be repaired and we are seeing actually, I think the most encouraging thing is content per shop as they are starting to trend more positively.","So I think it all feels pretty good and look, we don\u2019t expect this trend, we are not going to grow 16%, this for the rest of year, but we still feel very confident of the guidance for spares for the year.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","And then, secondly, on the share buyback, you are also trending ahead of that overall annual amount Q1, you said you are going to see the same in Q2? Is there any sort of strategy behind this or is it just availability of cash?","Greg Hayes","Either early. I think the key of course is, quickly you buy the shares back, the better this average share count is for the year and we got the cash sitting here we took advantage of that, we bought back most of these shares early in the first quarter. We are buying back shares through 10b-5 program today in the marketplace and that we will probably do that again in the third quarter, trying to get ahead of this.","And then if we get to the fourth quarter, where we will probably spend all the share buyback by the end of the third, if cash looks good and there is no other big M&A opportunities out there we will probably take share buyback up again just like we did last year. I am talking a big number but a little bit.","Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Yes. Thanks so much. So follow-up on CMH, so, Greg, was the total expected loss higher than it had been before as a result of the new contract?","Greg Hayes","As I said, Cai, the total cost of the aircraft is going to go up and you\u2019ve got new specifications from the customer, a little bit higher retrofit cost and the program is going to last a little bit longer the acquisition. So it will go up and again, I am not prepared to tell you exactly how much because quite frankly we are not done negotiations. I just know as I sit here today is going to be higher and I think we will clarify all that.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay. Right. But so before kind of its look like roughly 335 if we kind of do the rollout and for contract of this size, I mean, it kind of sounds like this total number could be in the area of $500 million to $600 million and if the quarter of it is still in front of us, is it unfair to assume that we have got another 100, 150 something in that order of magnitude in front of us in \u201915 and \u201916?","Greg Hayes","Hey, Cai, you get way ahead of me here. Look until we get the contract actually negotiated and until we know what the total contract value is going to be both the aftermath and the OE all the trades are made, before we get the EAC done, I really can\u2019t comment, all I know is the aircraft is going to be more expensive, as I said, we are 70% to 75% done, again depending upon what this retrofit look like. So I am going to say out of the math work today and I will let my boss do that for you hopefully in May.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay. And then just back maybe to the principal, so we basically split those into two contracts, which is kind of equipment and then aftermarket support, so that the aftermarket support portion of this should be profitable? Is that the right way to think of it?","Greg Hayes","That has always been the case, Cai. I think we have already said, money in this contract at least for the last five years, it has been the aftermarket contract that provided the shield if you will for the losses on the OE and that's not going to change.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay. And then the last one, the GTF with kind of the slip on the C-Series, how many units are we looking for this year? And give us some color on the expected build in unit production, maybe in \u201815 and \u201816?","Greg Hayes","You talking delivery this year, Cai?","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Yes.","Greg Hayes","Yeah, you talking small numbers, you probably in the range of less than 10 shipments this year, its small numbers.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","And how does that build in \u201815 and \u201816?","Greg Hayes","Though mentioned -- I'm going to say, if you think about the run rate production is somewhere between 36 and 48 aircraft a year and build over the next several years. Again I think originally planned about 20 aircraft this year or 20 deliveries this year. It will build next year but I got to tell you the real ramp will be starting at the end of the next year on the Neo, whereby 2017 will be delivered 500 plus engines a year. So C-Series is our very important customer but the volumes are going to be very small compared to what we\u2019re going to see on the Neo.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Greg Hayes","Thank you, Cai","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Hi Doug.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","At CC&S, you had $43 million in restructuring costs in the quarter. And that's higher than we've seen in some time. What's the focus of the restructuring at CC&S and what should we expect to see over the course of the year?","","Greg Hayes","The biggest piece of the restructuring for the quarter was actually factor that we had outside of Milan called Villasante where we made commercial -- I\u2019m trying to think what\u2019s the right word for it, (indiscernible). And again, we\u2019ve been downsizing that facility for a number of years. We finally, in the fourth quarter -- first quarter here agreed with the Works Council there on a plan to close that facility. Again that was a relatively large portion of the charge with some other headcount related actions and some smaller things around the globe but Villasante is probably the biggest piece of the restructuring in the first quarter.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","So they\u2019re going on later in the year, we shouldn\u2019t see that level, I assume?","Greg Hayes","There will be additional restructuring across the CCS. Again I think the most of the factory actions, I think are done. I think what you going to see is more VIS integration related activities as we closed offices and consolidate some of the facilities around the globe. And again, most of that would be Otis but some will leak into the CCS segment as well.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then at UTAS, you said that E&D was higher in the quarter and what\u2019s driving the increase right now? And how do you look at the E&D trajectory going-forward for UTAS?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. It was higher but we\u2019re talking to small number less than $10 million of growth in E&D for the quarter. Really, if you think about everything that\u2019s on the plate at UTAS, you got obviously the A350, the C-Series, the Neo, the 777X now. I mean, all of these new programs are driving their requirements, thus 787-9 with the -10 coming up. There\u2019s all sorts of fun things to do there and they all are spread a little bit higher engineering expense. So engineering, we think it\u2019s more fun loaded, we think for the full year total across the all businesses will be relatively flat but little bit higher here in the first half.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","So you\u2019re not looking at a -- sort of as you take the 787-8 up, I mean there\u2019s enough work on 787-9 and 787-10 that we shouldn\u2019t see this come down very quickly over the next 12 months to 18 months, is that fair?","Greg Hayes","I think the pipeline is pretty full at aeropace -- I mean both at the Pratt & Whitney ate the Aerospace Systems Group. I think the engineering pipe is pretty full. Remember we\u2019re going to get done with the C-Series this year, entering into revenue service, hopefully towards the end of the year or early next year. And you\u2019ve got the Neo, you\u2019ve the got the Mitsubishi regional jet, you got Irkut up there and then you got the Embraer airplane coming after that. So engineering spending, it will come down gradually perhaps, as all these aircraft could certify same kind of profile which you\u2019re going to see at the aerospace systems business.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura. Your line is open.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Morning guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Hey, Greg. Just maybe a little more on this disconnect between Otis and commercial HVAC in North America. I mean, up 39% on Otis, down 4% on commercial. I mean I hear your point about the retrofit but that's still a pretty big difference. I mean, is there anything else you see going on in terms of the lag in the market or I know you were coming out with some new applied products; is there anything going on there? It just seems like probably even adjusting for this retrofit point, you made a little bit of a wider gap than you would think?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. I think, we continue to have -- see really good traction of the late commercial roof tops. I think again where we are lagging or we have lagged for number of years is on the implied side. To your point, we have new products in the pipeline, new products coming out that we think we\u2019ll address this as we go through the year, that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident as we begin. The sales will pick up on the commercial business as we move through the year, as we get these new products out there but clearly the issue has been on the applied. This is not a new phenomenon. The small rooftops continue to be very good business for us, good share but little bit behind on the applied side.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. And then just following up on your point on China service really being the story for Otis going forward, did you have to take any more additional actions there to kind of gain critical mass? And have you seen any meaningful shift in the willingness to pay OEs to do this service?","Greg Hayes","Well, I think this is about investing for the future. I mean, you got to continue to add service technicians. You\u2019ve got to continue to add infrastructure, offices and depots. Yeah, Otis has been making investments for the last two years now. There had a couple of thousands people into the service, little workforce over there. This will just take time. You also have to remember the way we go to market there and China is a little bit different because our biggest business was with Sheitzo.","As we go through agents and we don\u2019t get the same attachment rate or conversion rate there, we are working with the agents to make sure that we can capture more of that service revenue and find a win-win with the agents to capture that going forward. So, I think we\u2019re getting good traction. It\u2019s going to be investment for us for a number of years. But the margins will continue to improve as we get better route density and as we expand the footprint there in China.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our final question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Greg Hayes","Hey, Myles.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Maybe one quick clarification on CMH. Just for 2015, as you look at it in isolation by everybody that built in a loss on the delivery of a set of aircraft, is your baseline assumption now that we are in a better position or worse position or neutral position to that, Greg?","Greg Hayes","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a worse position, but I really can't tell you exactly where we are. I think, again, the idea here is to get a big chunk of the cost behind us this year to eliminate most of the headwind but I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m very reluctant Myles to go out there until we get this thing negotiated to give you a final number.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then the other clarification or maybe color I wanted was on the F-35, those fan failure and the fix that's ongoing. How is that affecting your deliveries or progress, your recognition on the contracts? And where is the kind of the escape trajectory from here?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. I think, we\u2019re on track with the F-135 engines. We had good deliveries in the first quarter. We continue to come down the cost curve. There was an issue on test stand. We talked about that. And I think, again, we understand the root cause, we are working on all that. So again these things happen. There was an engine that was a long cycle endurance. And we are clearly on track with the development of the technical aspects of that engine. It\u2019s fixed.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks, Myles. All right. So with that, let me just wrap up and first of all, I wanted just to maybe a little housekeeping here. And first of all, welcome Casey Forrest to the IR Team. Casey is joining us from Financial Planning Groups. Casey will be on the phone with you guys later today.","I want to thank Josh Banis for his three and a half years of service to the IR Group here. He has done a great job. Many of you know him. I hope you wish him well. He's off to get a real job as a CFO of our Actuation and Prop business over in the U.K. So, wish he and his family well. So with that, thanks very much for listening and look forward to hearing from you guys today. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the United Technologies Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available to download from UTC's website at www.utc.com.","Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and onetime items as they usually do.","The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.","UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions] Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. You saw on the press release this morning, third quarter earnings per share of $1.37 is down 4% versus 2011. The Goodrich acquisition, previously anticipated to be about $0.10 diluted in the quarter, did not have an impact on EPS due to lower onetime deal-related costs, lower amortization and better underlying performance of the business. IAE also had a solid performance in the quarter and contributed $0.03 of EPS.","Restructuring charges were also lower than we expected due to a shift in the timing from the third to the fourth quarter and were completely offset by onetime gains. There was also a $0.04 benefit versus prior year on the tax line in the third quarter, which we talked to you about in our September investor meeting. The year-over-year benefit from restructuring and taxes nearly offset the $0.07 adverse impact from foreign exchange and a 2% decline in organic sales, driven mainly by the slowing global economy and a decline in U.S. defense spending.","Organic sales declined 12% at Sikorsky and were down 1% and 2%, respectively, at Otis and Climate, Controls & Security. Organic sales at Aerospace Systems were up 6% but as you heard from Dave Hess, we've yet to see a recovery in Pratt's large commercial engine aftermarket business. Organically, Pratt & Whitney's large spares sales declined 25% in the quarter, and we now expect the full year to be down high teens.","For UTC, we now expect full year sales of approximately $58 billion at the low end of our previous guidance range, driven by lower organic sales and partially offset by favorable FX compared to our last forecast.","In spite of the top line softening, we continue to expect earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 for 2012. With a solid start at Goodrich, better visibility on the amortization and lower-than-expected deal costs, we estimate that Goodrich dilution, excluding the impact of share repurchase, will be approximately $0.10 for 2012 as opposed to our prior expectation of $0.20. That's about $125 million better. And we expect a $50 million pretax benefit from our full year tax rate of 29%. That's 50 basis points lower than our previous guidance.","Against an uncertain macroeconomic environment headed into 2013, we are preemptively increasing restructuring by $100 million in the fourth quarter. We now plan to invest $600 million this year, up from our previous estimate of $500 million. And for the full year, we now expect restructuring to be equal to onetime gains. And as spare order rates have remained depressed at Pratt & Whitney, we're also lowering Pratt's operating profit estimate by $75 million for the year.","So let me sum it all up. There's $175 million of upside; that's Goodrich, $125 million; and the tax rate of $50 million, offset by $100 million of additional restructuring and $75 million of headwind from Pratt commercial spares. There's also some favorability from the weaker dollar versus our previous FX guidance and this should help offset potentially softer top line at some of the commercial units.","Okay, now on to Slide 2, the third quarter. Total sales were up 6%, with acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 11 points of growth. The net acquisition benefit more than offset 3 points of unfavorable FX and 2 points of organic decline. The drop in organic sales is just a reflection of the global economic environment. North America is still struggling to gain traction, a slight recession in Europe and slowing growth in emerging markets.","At the commercial businesses, North American organic sales were flat in the quarter and are only up 1% year-to-date. In Europe, in the commercial businesses, sales are actually down 3% while sales in the BRIC countries grew 2%. That was driven by double-digit growth in Russia and India.","In Aerospace, robust commercial OEM organic growth was more than offset by weakness in the commercial aftermarket and military businesses. Commercial OEM sales were up 14%, led by double-digit growth in Aerospace Systems and Sikorsky. Commercial aftermarket, however, was down 14%, with the mid-teens decline at Pratt & Whitney more than offsetting mid-single digit growth at Aerospace Systems and 20% growth at Sikorsky. Sikorsky continues to feel the impact of reduced DOD spending with military sales down nearly 20% while Pratt & Whitney saw military sales up 20% on the back of F119 spare engine deliveries, which will wrap up later this year.","Excluding Goodrich and the incremental IAE shares, segment operating margin was 16.1%, so actually up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Our focus on cost reduction and productivity more than offset 80 basis points of headwind for pension, E&D and FX.","Free cash flow, very good in the quarter, 105% and that included a $200 million contribution to our domestic pension plan. We've taken the tough actions on our pension plan and we're well positioned with funding ratio of 84% even with the impact of Goodrich at historically low discount rates. And we have no ERISA funding requirements until at least 2015.","Okay, moving now to Slide 3, looking at order trends. Similar to sales, order trends in the quarter were generally in line with the global economy. CCS' North American Residential HVAC orders were up 3%. Otis new equipment orders were up 11% at constant currency, including strength in North America. China new equipment orders contracted 2% at constant currency in the quarter, following a 16% decline in the first half as we steadily regain momentum. I'd also note that the Q3 2% drop in orders is off a very tough compare with Q3 of last year when orders were up 31%.","Across the Aerospace businesses, we continue to see the impact of cash conservation at the airlines. Pratt & Whitney's large commercial spare orders were up 14% in the quarter, including the additional share of IAE. Excluding the incremental share, Pratt's orders were actually down 21% due to weakness, primarily in the wide-body fleet. Legacy Hamilton Sundstrand commercial spare orders were down 6%. So despite some weakness in our end markets, we continue to leverage our global scale and product innovation to strengthen the position of our industry-leading franchises.","Backlog for our base businesses increased by $3 billion so far in 2012. And with the addition of Goodrich and IAE, total backlog now stands at $81 billion.","Let me stop it there and turn over to Jay to take you through the business units, then I'll come back and wrap up '12 and talk a little bit about '13.","Jesus Malave","Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. At Otis, operating profit was down 10% on a 6% decline in sales. Foreign currency translation reduced sales and profit by 6 points. Operating margin was 22.7%, 1 point lower than prior year. At constant currency, new equipment sales were down low-single digit with mid-single digit declines in Europe and China, partially offset by mid-single digit growth in the Americas and the rest of Asia. Service was up slightly with higher contractual maintenance more than offsetting a slight decline in repair. The operating profit decline was driven by pricing pressure and lower volume in Europe and the absence of favorable real estate gains in last year's third quarter, which more than offset the benefit of cost reduction actions this quarter.","At constant currency, new equipment orders were up 11% with over 20% growth in North America and in Europe, which benefited from a major contract award in the U.K. Although orders in China were down 2% in the quarter, the rate of decline improved from the previous 2 quarters, and Otis had solid order growth in September.","Guidance for the full year remains unchanged with profits expected to be down $175 million to $225 million on a mid-single digit sales decline.","On Slide 5. UTC Climate, Controls and Security once again saw a sharp increase in margin, up 270 basis points from prior year at 15.4% as profits increased 5% on 13% lower sales. Organic sales were down 2% as many of our end markets have not rebounded as we had previously expected. While there were pockets of growth such as the Americas Residential HVAC business and China, each up mid-single digit, the balance of the business generally saw low-single digit declines. Transicold was down high teens organically, led by a 60% decline in container sales. Despite the lack of organic sales growth, CCS grew earnings 5% or 8% at constant currency. Profit growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security and favorable net commodity costs. Global commercial HVAC orders were flat with growth in North America offset by a decline in Asia. Transicold orders were down about 25% with container down about 90%, partially offset by over 40% growth in North America truck\/trailer.","Orders for global Fire & Security products were up low-single digit. Given current market softness, fourth quarter organic growth could be softer than previously anticipated. The CCS team continues to take preemptive action to offset the impact of lower organic sales, but full year earnings guidance is under pressure. Margin expansion for the year, however, will still be strong given the benefits from productivity, cost reduction and portfolio transformation.","Turning to Aerospace on Slide 6. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 16% in the third quarter, driven by the consolidation of IAE and the auxiliary power business transferred from Hamilton Sundstrand. Organically, sales were down 1% year-over-year, as higher military and Power Systems sales were more than offset by lower commercial aftermarket. Lower commercial spares -- large commercial spare sales were down 25% year-over-year. On a reported basis, large commercial spare sales were up 9%, including consolidated IAE sales. Operating profit in the quarter was down 10%. The impact of lower organic sales, including large commercial spares, higher E&D and pension costs, as well as unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada were partially offset by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, restructuring savings and a supplier settlement of about $0.04 per share.","For the full year, we now expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit to be down $175 million to $200 million and sales up mid-single digit.","On Page 7, our new segment, UTC Aerospace Systems, including Hamilton Sundstrand and 2 months of Goodrich, posted sales in the quarter of $2.7 billion with operating profit of $306 million. Organic sales in the quarter were up 6% with OEM sales up high-single digit, commercial aftermarket up mid-single digit and military aftermarket down 10%. Total aftermarket trends at Goodrich business units were slightly below legacy Hamilton Sundstrand. As Greg mentioned, Goodrich had better-than-expected results in the quarter. Organic operating profit at Aerospace Systems was down 5% after a strong first half, which was up 16%. The benefit from higher volume was more than offset by higher E&D and pension costs and lower license fees. With the benefit of approximately $50 million from lower-than-expected amortization, we now expect UTC Aerospace Systems' operating profit for the full year to be up $275 million to $300 million on approximately $4 billion of higher sales.","Turning to Sikorsky on Slide 8. Operating profit decreased 6% on 6% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 62 aircraft. 54 aircraft were based on military platforms and 8 commercial. Lower sales were driven by fewer international military aircraft deliveries. On profit, the impact from lower international military aircraft and transition to the new multiyear contract more than offset favorable commercial aircraft mix, lower E&D spend and restructuring benefits across the enterprise.","Of note, Sikorsky has received FAA certification for the S-76D. Deliveries will commence in the fourth quarter, and Sikorsky already has a backlog of over $400 million for this aircraft.","For the full year, we continue to expect profit growth of $50 million to $75 million, and mid-single digit sales decline.","With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay, thanks, Jay. Businesses are clearly seeing softening on the top line from these tough end market conditions, but we remain focused on program execution and cost reduction, the things that we can control. At CCS, we continue to make very good progress on the integration of legacy Carrier and F&S businesses. We're consolidating locations and back office functions and streamlining customer service processes. We've saved over $50 million year-to-date without an impact on the customer, and CCS continues to stabilize the U.K. Fire & Security business, which grew profits for the second straight quarter. Otis China is also making progress in regaining its leadership position. On the Aerospace side, the Goodrich integration is off to a very good start, and as you heard from Alain Bellemare in September, we are realizing synergy sooner than expected and there will be opportunities for more. Pratt continues to win orders for the GTF and with an additional 546 firm and option orders in the quarter, Pratt now has a backlog of nearly 3,000 engines. And Sikorsky, as you just heard from Jay, achieved a major milestone this month, certifying the S-76D with deliveries starting here in the fourth quarter.","The end market challenges are putting pressure on the business unit expectations for 2012, but with lower dilution from Goodrich, we're confident in our guidance range of $5.25 to $5.35. We continue to negotiate towards a win-win solution with the Canadian government for the Sikorsky Maritime Helicopter and we expect to provide you with an update at our December meeting. And with strong cash generation you come to expect from us, we now anticipate free cash flow will exceed net income for the year.","Okay. Slide 10. Let's talk a little bit about 2013. Various [ph] framework for next year. This is the same that we laid out in September with the exception of the Goodrich amortization. With about $100 million of lower full year amortization, we now expect nearly $0.60 of accretion next year from Goodrich compared with the $0.10 of dilution in 2012, and we continue to expect an incremental $0.05 benefit from a full year of IAE.","Turning to the base businesses. We've got great products and we're well positioned in the right markets for long-term growth. In addition to continuing growth from emerging markets, we should see solid growth in 2013 in the commercial aerospace OEM and aftermarket, in the U.S. residential HVAC business and in the U.S. commercial construction businesses.","We expect Europe to be essentially flat next year, and we expect the declines in the U.S. Defense spending to continue even without the impact of a potential sequestration.","Bottom line is that we're confident in our cost reduction and program execution and we have significant operating leverage should we see better-than-expected end market conditions.","Of course, we still face some other significant headwinds in 2013. As you heard from Mick Maurer back in September, Sikorsky expects lower sales next year and 100 to 200 basis points of margin headwind before CMHP. Now that's primarily due to the new Multi-Year 8 and the lower DOD spending that we've been talking about. And of course, we'll have about $300 million of pension headwind at the current discount rate of 3.8%. We won't actually set the rate, of course, until year end, but you know the math. Every 10 basis points change in the rate costs us $28 billion.","To sum it up. We've taken proactive, aggressive restructuring actions this year. Savings from these actions, combined with lower engineering and development, will drive earnings growth in 4 out of the 5 business units before pension and we will see about $0.75 of accretion from Goodrich and IAE year-over-year. We feel well calibrated for this year. The large deals are done, and we're focused on integration and execution. With our transformational deals, the new organizational structure, global industry-leading franchises and sustained structural cost reduction, we're well positioned for long-term earnings growth and strong cash generation. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Stephanie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let's start out over at Pratt. And Greg, I'm just wondering you had your meeting September 27, obviously very late in the quarter, and you're lowering here by $75 million, I think, all due to spares. So is it really -- I mean, can we infer from that, that really 2 weeks at the end of the quarter was responsible for the change in guidance, or is it maybe just looking more to the fourth quarter? And also at Pratt, if you could quantify that supplier payment?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, so -- yes, I think Dave laid it out pretty well back in September. He said that we are not seeing the order rates to actually support the spares, only down 10%. So I think Dave was pretty forthright with everybody in saying that we're not seeing it. And clearly, in the last couple of weeks of September we did not see any recovery in spares and we haven't seen it as we sit here today. So the takedown is all spares. I think, again, it's unfortunate to take down the guidance late in the year, but it is what it is on commercial spares. I think the good news as we dissect the data, the narrow-body platforms, the V2500s and the 757s, are actually -- have been recovering for a couple of quarters and where we see the weaknesses is primarily on the wide-body fleet and also in Europe. So again, not a surprise, I think. But it's clearly a tough market right now. As far as the supplier payment, that was about $45 million, $46 million, I think. It's actually a settlement. There was a legacy claim between Pratt and Goodrich, which relates to the -- from the sale on the CSeries. This had been in arbitration. We had an independent arbiter come in and we settled the claim and that was actually recorded on Goodrich's balance sheet as of the close, and Pratt recognized the benefit in this quarter.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, on Goodrich, you mentioned that Goodrich earnings were better than expected. Is that due to less amortization or is that real underlying performance? And what was -- I don't know if I missed it, but what was the organic aftermarket growth at Goodrich during the quarter?","Jesus Malave","Joe, organic aftermarket for sales was slightly below HS. HS had about mid-single digit growth in commercial aftermarket and Goodrich is a little bit below that. As far as military aftermarket, HS was down around 10% and Goodrich was down a little bit below that, close to mid-teens. And while we have the chance, I just want to correct the statement that I made before related to Sikorsky on Slide 8. I just want to clarify that operating profit decreased 6% on 12% lower sales.","Gregory J. Hayes","Regarding the first part of your question, as far as the underlying business, Goodrich did do a little bit better than what we had expected. Again, there it was primarily Aero structures at the end of the quarter. Things actually looked better. But the amortization is clearly better. The big piece in the quarter that was really these transaction-related costs, which were better than what we had expected. We took, I'd say, a very conservative view as we were looking at all of these costs and we had expected to expense some things that ended up on Goodrich's balance sheet, so that helped by about $100 million and then you had better performance and a little bit better amortization.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the Otis order strength in North America. It sounds like Europe may be driven by the big metro project. Maybe there's something else there, elaborate on that also. But what was going on in North America? Is it more than a one-off?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think it's a trend that we have seen as a recovery in North America. And we've seen the ABI or Architectural Billing Index be above 50 for the last couple of months here and actually seeing good traction in quarters there. We got, of course, some new product introductions also that's helping on the -- in North America. It's attacking some of the hydro [ph] markets. So, yes, I think it's product introduction and a recovery there. So that actually feels pretty good. Europe, well, Europe is Europe. We did get good traction out of the Crossrail project. I think that's over 107 escalators for that London Crossrail. But the rest of Europe is not a great story. We saw down markets in France and Spain and Italy, a little bit better in Germany. But on the whole, a pretty tough Europe market outside of the U.K.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then when you look at China down 2%, are you in position given kind of the comps and the trajectory to actually look positive on orders in Q4, or when do you see that happening, if you can, in fact, crystallize a view?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, my crystal ball is not terribly clear, but I would tell you we should be seeing order growth resume in Q4. As I said it earlier, orders were down 2% but that was off of a very tough compare last year where orders were up 31% at constant currency. So we are seeing a recovery. Last year, you'll recall China only grew 7% in the fourth quarter. So again, I think the trajectory that we saw in the -- coming out of the third quarter should continue into the fourth quarter. I think Pedro and team feel very confident we're getting share back and they're on track for a full recovery there.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And just can you give us a little more granularity on China? Is it high-rise resi? Is it bigger projects, central country? Just any other detail on what's going on would be helpful.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think it's actually really across the business we are seeing a recovery there. The commercial HVAC business remains soft there. I think some of the slowdowns that we've seen are actually playing out on the CCS side. On the flip side, residential's getting a little bit better. We saw that at CCS on their GST business, getting us some traction on order rates. For Otis, again, I think the property market has started to stabilize and come back a little bit. Still seeing good growth in the Tier 2 and 3 cities. Tier 1 is still pretty challenged. But again, that's not a surprise. It's a very uneven recovery in China.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And just finally, just flipping over to Carrier. It looks like your resi business underperformed from what I can see from a couple others who reported in the quarter. Can you just give us some color on how you thought you did relative to the broader market and what's going on in the channels?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, underperformance is a relative term, Jeff. I think, and again, we saw -- I think, one of the competitors reported the other day that they had what looked like kind of mid-teens growth in the resi business. But I think that was off of a very tough -- or very easy compare from 2011. Carrier thinks they have held share hear this year. They've done pretty well. Channel inventories are very, very light. I think nobody wants to get stuck with inventory this time of year given all the uncertainty and the global economic situation and the fiscal cliff coming up, so channel inventories are probably at some of the lowest levels we've seen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick one -- actually a couple of quick ones. On the transport refrigeration on the container side, you said sort of down 90%, which is sort of where you were at your Analyst Meeting. Did you see any incremental order activity besides that little blip you called out in the meeting, or are we still kind of bouncing along the bottom in that business?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well, actually, bouncing along the bottom is a relative term. Yes, I think we saw a little bit of good news post the Investor Meeting and we've seen some good news here in the fourth quarter. We're almost 50% booked in the fourth quarter. So orders, and again they're very lumpy as we know in this business, but yes, I think it's -- it looks achievable in terms of the forecast we've got out there right now for this year.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the spare side, I wondered if you might elaborate on a couple of other points. In terms of the wide-bodies, what you're seeing in terms of shop visits kind of year-over-year and also what you're seeing at Pratt Canada.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, so shop visits are a little soft on the wide-body fleet, and this is again the PW4000 fleet. I think the biggest impact is on the 747 fleet and probably a lesser impact on the 777 and A330 fleet out there. But clearly, we've seen lower shop visits. But I think more importantly, the average cost per shop is down substantially, like 25% down. So that's just gotten worse and not better from what we had seen earlier this year. We're getting good traction, as I said, on the narrow-body fleet. The Vs are up very strong, the spares in the quarter and even the 2000s had a nice recovery for the last couple of quarters.","Jesus Malave","Pratt Canada spares were down low-single digit in the quarter, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And one final one. You said Europe flat for next year is your kind of base case assumption. Does that assume anything different in terms of FX for next year than what's baked into this year's guidance?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think again -- FX, I think, is around $1.30 today. We've actually put our plan together to $1.25 kind of euro right now as we're looking at guidance for the last couple of months. So FX could actually be a bit of a tailwind next year versus what we've seen this year. I think, we're going to average $1.26 or something year-to-date, I think so. It could actually be a little bit of tailwind out of FX but who the heck knows?","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On CC&S, you had good margins there for the quarter. Could you talk about where -- what the puts and takes were with respect to margin? You didn't change guidance for the year and I was also wondering if the margins, were those above your expectations but being offset by weakness in the top line for the year?","Gregory J. Hayes","I guess, that's exactly -- I mean, margins were very strong. We got about 1\/3 of that came from the portfolio transformation, but the rest of it really came from cost reduction -- product cost reduction and restructuring and cost takeout in the base business. So I think again, it's -- it looks like the margins for this year will be at least 14% or so. So well on their way to the 15% goal that we've got out there.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And if you look across the business, the Fire & Security businesses and the individual parts within Carrier, are there some that you would point to where you saw more improvement than others?","Jesus Malave","In the field, Doug, both Europe and Asia were relatively flat from a sales perspective. Orders for products were actually up low-single digit this quarter.","Gregory J. Hayes","I think what you're seeing, though, Doug, is really broad-based cost reduction. I think, again, the structural cost takeout that we talked about is helping, but we're also seeing good news out of the factories. We're seeing good cost reduction out of the factories and that's both legacy F&S, as well as legacy Carrier businesses. I think our margins are holding up quite well on the commercial side, as well as on the resi side here in the U.S. Obviously, margin's under a little pressure at Transicold with volumes down as much as they are.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then on the restructuring, the increase in restructuring cost for the year, can you talk about where that's focused, Aero versus the commercial businesses?","Gregory J. Hayes","We've got a lot of programs lined up here. I think the biggest piece you'll probably see is going to be related to what we see is kind of this decline in Defense spending, so Sikorsky will have a good share of that. Pratt will pick up a big piece, as well as UTAS or our Aerospace Systems business. But again, I would tell you, there is restructuring appetite across all the businesses. Otis continues to find ways to take costs out. CCS, again, they're just starting on their journey from the structural cost reduction. So you will see additional restructuring from each of the businesses. And I would tell you when we started the year, I didn't see the appetite for $300 million, let alone $600 million for restructuring. And today, there's appetite for more than $600 million. So, again, I think that's -- just tells you how focused these guys are on cost reduction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Greg, I realize how challenged it's been to forecast earnings and still stay within the range. And so the harder question is could you help us a little bit with cash and sort of give us a walk as to where you are with the debt paydown plans, please?","Gregory J. Hayes","Sure. Yes, so cash actually came in about what we expected. We got about 105% of net income. We're at 100% of net income year-to-date. The cash machine continues to chug right along. And I think for the year, we have solid visibility. We will nicely exceed net income and cash flow for the year. As far as the debt paydown, I think we're still on track. We expect to close on the Hamilton industrial businesses kind of early December time frame. We got a $2 billion term loan that we'll pay down. We've got about $4 billion of commercial paper, and then we'll pay down probably another $1 billion of other debt this year, so -- and most of that -- the rest of that cash will come from overseas. So, again, we've got a line of sight to, I'll say, about $7 billion of debt paydown by the end of the year. And something might slip into the first quarter, but I think clearly line of sight for the $7 billion.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And related to that, I mean, looks like you did -- I mean, you had a terrific number on, well, you haven't closed yet on electrical products, but based on sort of the filing, it would seem to me that you're going to more than exceed your forecast on some of the other divestitures. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think the market for these businesses is much stronger than was originally anticipated. And it's not -- I guess it shouldn't be surprising because they're really good franchises and franchises like the EPS business -- Electric Power Business at Goodrich don't come on the market very often. So we had a very robust bidding process for that business, as well as for the Engine and Controls business, that's located here in West Hartford. That bidding process is also robust. It's moving right along. So I'd say we'll be at the high end of our expectation range for both of those businesses. But again, good solid businesses, great products and technology. I hate to lose them, but, again, part of the regulatory process.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then related to corporate overhead, I mean, it looks as if you've been able to put together United Technologies and Goodrich and not really increase the overhead a whole heck of a lot. Have I -- are there some other gains or anything in there, or what should we think about that in terms of going forward?","Gregory J. Hayes","Oh yes, clearly, as we put the Goodrich business together with Hamilton, we have seen or will see about $50 million of cost synergies this year. A big piece of that is public company costs. So I think Alain, as you would expect, is focused on a lean organization. We're not having a lot of overhead. And you're going to see that, I think, play out next year, as well as we continue to see solid cost reduction out of the Goodrich business.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then finally, you talked about avoiding a lot of transaction costs in the quarter and that was pretty helpful and then you're talking about increasing restructuring. Did those 2 items sort of in the end offset each other?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think if you think about it, we picked up about $0.10 on the Goodrich dilution this year and we picked up about $0.04 on the tax rate. You can offset that. We lost about $0.08 on restructuring, and we lost about $0.06 on the Pratt guidance reduction, so $75 million. So $14 million good, $14 million bad. It just kind of offset just naturally, if you will.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I want to go back to CC&S for a minute, Greg, and again put a little finer point on it. It looks like you were saying to an earlier question that you anticipate maintaining profitability going forward, but then you have some of the more profitable businesses, which have been rather weak. So wouldn't that intimate that you could do, even on potentially very slow revenue upside next year, better margins?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think you will see better margins next year at CCS. Again, it's a little early to call the markets next year. But generally, I think, Geraud and team feel pretty confident we should see a recovery at Transicold next year, especially on the container side. I think the U.S. resi business, again with housing starts up should recover next year. Commercial side and the U.S. ought to do better. So I think we're well on track. Again, I said 14% this year. 15% is the goal by '15. They're well on their way to getting there.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Well, that's what I'm trying to drive to. I mean you could get there quite a bit earlier. I mean, again, just given that you had some of the more profitable stuff down and you've been doing the restructuring on an ongoing basis, so you'll start to get those benefits as early as next year, or is there some part of that I'm not getting right?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think you're right on it. Again, I'm hesitant to say we're going to get to 15% next year because again, who knows what happens in the end markets. I think Geraud and team have done a great job this year managing in what is a very, very tough macro environment. They've taken out costs, they've driven up margins, they've done their portfolio rationalization and they're going to hit that 14% this year. Can they hit 15% next year? Maybe. But I think, again, that's a great question maybe for Louis in December or better yet for Geraud next March.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And then on -- turning on to Sikorsky, I just want to tease those businesses out a little bit better to understand the kind of puts and takes you're seeing there, Greg. Can you give us a little color on your aftermarket expectations in military and sort of your outlook for international military orders looking ahead?","Jesus Malave","International military...","Gregory J. Hayes","Let's just talk about military spares. Military spares, obviously, it's a tough market right now down at Sikorsky. And we expect that, that will be headwind again next year. Again, not a surprise with the optempo coming down in Afghanistan. And the uncertainty down at DOD, I think we've seen a reluctance of the procurement officers to go out and make advanced buys with all the uncertainty out there coming to a head in January. So those spares have been under pressure and they will remain under pressure next year.","Jesus Malave","As far as military aircraft, you'll recall that Mick, during September, said that part of the international military deliveries got pushed into 2014 because of the finalization -- delay in finalization of Multi-Year 8 contract signing.","Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jay, what I meant was orders. You guys have a number of campaigns out there. Can you bring us up to speed on the campaigns?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I would tell you that there is a robust process there on the international side. I think we're seeing good traction in South America. We're seeing good traction in the Middle East. We're seeing good traction in India. I think, again, you'll see international Blackhawk, the S-70i, out of Mielec should start to pick up next year. And the deliveries really -- I think Mick has clear line of sight to 2014 to see a large increase in these international Blackhawk deliveries.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Greg, I was hoping you could make it a little simpler for me in terms of into 2013 with Goodrich and IAE. You increased or lowered the dilution for Goodrich for 2012 and you previously talked about a $0.75 EPS swing '12 into '13. Is that $0.75 still intact, or are we now talking about a lower swing because 2012 showed up better?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, no, it's well -- I think, the math is, I would say, it's complicated. But the fact is we have $0.10 of dilution now and Goodrich this year and $0.60 of accretion. So net-net year-over-year you ought to get a $0.70 benefit because of Goodrich plus 5% on IAE. We previously had talked about $0.20 of dilution this year and $0.50 of accretion next year. The fact is next year it gets better because of lower amortization costs, lower than expected. So that gives you -- it takes you from the $0.50 to the $0.60 and that benefit also helps this year.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on spares, Greg, I think you said high teens organic declines. Could you separate -- create the differential on the organic declines between for the full year what you're seeing on the 2500s versus the wide-bodies? And then also, the wide-bodies, can you parse out what's just been retired and taken out of the fleet that never comes back?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I can't give you the kind of granularity in terms of what may have been retired. I think it clearly is, as we were talking earlier, the 747-400s, the PW4000s, those have been probably the hardest hit. Now whether some of those have been retired or not, I couldn't tell you. Clearly, flying hours are down on that fleet. On the other hand, you see 777s, again the 4000, those are 112 inch. Those, the flying hours are actually up. We just have seen the airlines be very reticent to spend a lot of money at repairing the engines as they've come back. So again, I think 747-400s are probably the hardest hit and then 777s less so. And then again real solid recovery on the Vs as we had expected when we bought IAE.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's full year '12 though for the Vs, mid-single digit declines?","Gregory J. Hayes","Say that one more time.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If you just separated out the V2500 organic spares for 2012, what did that look like?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think you actually see an increase.","Jesus Malave","Yes, for the full year, Myles, you should probably see an increase anywhere between low- to mid-single digit. And really, we're benefiting again from the higher cycles, as you know, on narrow-bodies.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then the last one, was the Pratt settlement previously in the guidance, or was it kind of concluded post the guidance?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, I think we had known about this for some time, so that was contemplated in the numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So this year, the Goodrich, yes, maybe you could walk us through. So you said $50 million kind of lower intangibles. Maybe -- and what you had -- R&D was $101 million. So presumably, that was an accounting conformity negative. So maybe walk us through kind of what are the step-up in intangibles this year for Goodrich? What should we think about for next year? You said $100 million lower, but from what to what? What should the accounting conformity be this year and next year? And you mentioned synergies, $50 million. What is it next year? And what is the restructuring? Is any of the incremental restructuring there at Goodrich?","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay. Let's start out with the amortization for this year. I think we have seen lower amortization. So I think there was $140 million of amortization we now expect for the year. I think -- I'm sorry, that's for the quarter, the $140 million?","Jesus Malave","$140 million was the absolute number of amortization in the third quarter.","Gregory J. Hayes","In the third quarter, $130 million of that was from inventory step-up. About $10 million of that was the net of inventory intangible amortization. So again, you should see that inventory will repeat again in fourth quarter, as well as the intangible amortization. Next year, there's no inventory amortization. I think that's all behind us. So what you're down to is about $50 million of intangible amortizations net next year.","Jesus Malave","Yes. Cai, the best way to look at it, if you recall the charts that we've shown, we've lumped amortization and accounting conformity together, it's $500 million previously. The best way to look at it is that now goes to $400 million, the combination of those 2 items.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So let's just stick with this course. So we have $100 million this quarter of accounting conformity because, I guess, I'm a little confused. If you had $140 million of accounting intangibles and step up $100 million of accounting conformity and synergies, a little tough for me to see how you got to breakeven?","Gregory J. Hayes","Well, again, I think the $100 million is really the run rate for the accounting conformity.","Jesus Malave","Yes. Cai, $100 million is the total E&D at Goodrich. Part of that E&D always went to the P&L. It was just put into SG&A in their form of reporting. So the piece -- I can't tell you -- I don't know what that piece is just on an accounting-conformity basis.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then -- so we're really going to get like a $280 million swing next year because you're going to lose the inventory step-up is all this year, correct?","Gregory J. Hayes","That's right.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then on the restructuring. You said $100 million given you've taken your total restructuring up. Is Goodrich still $100 million, and what should we think about for next year?","Jesus Malave","The Goodrich restructuring this year is closer to about $150 million. We said, I think, next year in a range of $100 million. As far as amortization, though, Cai, we just have to recall that next year is 12 months versus 5 months this year on amortization.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So what is the number? I think Greg said, what was...","Jesus Malave","Yes, $50 million of amortization next year.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","For the whole year?","Gregory J. Hayes","For the whole year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","When we think about going into the fourth quarter and we think about what you guys are implying about where fourth quarter -- the fourth quarter numbers will be compared year-over-year, I think they kind of really decelerate into the fourth quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about it, or you're just being conservative? Or how should we think about the fourth quarter number?","Gregory J. Hayes","So I think what you're going to see is you see pretty good acceleration in the base businesses. The segment results should be better. I think you'll see solid growth at CCS. You'd see over $100 million of earnings growth there. You should see a little bit of growth come back at Otis. I guess Sikorsky should have a very big fourth quarter. They've got almost 100 helicopters to deliver. So base business is actually going to do very, very well here in the fourth quarter. I think we got confidence that we're going to hit that number. The downside, I think, as you think about fourth quarter actual EPS is you got about $0.25 of headwind in the fourth quarter from restructuring. And not surprising. We've got about $270 million of restructuring to go. We've spent $330 million so far. So you're going to see a big $0.25 or so of net restructuring in the quarter.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe over to Sikorsky real quick. Any more color on what's going on with the Canadian Maritime Helicopter and where that negotiation with the Canadian government is?","Gregory J. Hayes","I'd like to say we're making good progress. What we want here, and I said it before, we need a win-win on this with the Canadian government. Obviously, we're disappointed we haven't been able to deliver the helicopters. We're building them right now down at West Palm. We'd expected to build 5 -- build and deliver 5 this year, build and deliver 19 next year. We're well on our way for all those helicopters. But until we have an agreement with the Canadian government in terms of the final configuration and an interim configuration, we really can't ship anything. So as I sit here today, I tell you we don't have a solution. I certainly hope by the time Louis stands up in early December, we can give you guys some more clarity on it. But right now, all I know is that we need to continue to work with the Canadians to find a win-win here.","Jesus Malave","We're ready to deliver the 5 aircraft. It's just a matter of letting this negotiation play out.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. Then maybe just one last quick one on Aero aftermarket. Do you have a sense for what impact cargo has had versus passenger? Meaning, is your cargo business much more off than your passenger business?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, Ron, I really don't have a lot of granularity between cargo versus regular. I would tell you that cargo's not a big piece of the fleet. And the hours on cargo are much lower than the hours that we see on the regular commercial flight, so the overhaul cycle is much, much longer. So haven't really seen a pronounced impact from cargo versus commercial.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The reason I ask is if you go back a couple of years after '08, Goodrich had a couple of rough quarters largely due to cargo, so I'm just trying to get a sense for what impact it's having now.","Gregory J. Hayes","I have not heard that either from the Pratt team or the Aerospace Systems team. We'll check it out and we'll get back to you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Greg, I just wanted to get to this Goodrich dilution a little differently. In the 8-K, you said the pro forma for '11 was $0.50 a share accretion and now you've upped it to $0.60 in '13. So what are the variables that go into that added $0.10 from '11 to '13? Obviously, there's cost saves and whatever, there's some growth in the business, but if you could spell out the differences?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think, again, if you think about that $0.50 versus the $0.60, really, the only difference is lower net amortization for next year. I mean, this year, we had deal costs and we had little better performance in the business as well as lower amortization. But next year, we're really we're getting about -- we're getting north of $100 million of lower amortization, more like about -- well, almost $0.10, I guess, of lower amortization costs, probably $120 million, $130 million of lower amortization costs.","George Shapiro","Now that's relative to 2011, I'm asking, not '12. Because you've provided the pro forma numbers in the 8-K that you disclosed a couple of weeks ago and that showed $0.50 accretion in '11 on the pro forma, so I was asking for the comparison '11 to '13?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, we're just looking at it here.","Jesus Malave","Yes.","Gregory J. Hayes","George, I think we're going to have to get back to you on that. I have not gone back into these pro formas. I haven't really focused on 2011 very much since, well, since last year. But we can go back and took a look and get an answer for you.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then the other one is you said IAE will be accretive $0.05 next year, but it was accretive $0.03 this quarter, so why is it only $0.05 next year?","Gregory J. Hayes","Because you get another 1\/2 a year. So you're going to get $0.05 of accretion this year and another $0.05 next year. So $0.10 in total next year, $0.05 incrementally.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Greg, just on the 2013 outlook, you've put the commercial aerospace aftermarket as a positive. Is that looking on a reported basis because of the inclusion of IAE, or is this looking at it on organic basis?","Gregory J. Hayes","No, that's on an organic basis, Rob. I mean, again, if you think about Pratt spares being down high teens, we've seen Hamilton Sundstrand legacy down, we've seen Goodrich down a little bit. I think just based on what we're seeing from a flying hours perspective, we know that we're going to see the spares come back, and I think it's just a matter of timing. And I don't know if that's first quarter, second quarter or third quarter of next year or even fourth quarter of this year, but spares will come back. So we've got high confidence we're going to see good news on the commercial aero aftermarket organically next year, not just the addition of the acquisitions.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just follow-up on the aftermarket. You've given us quite a lot of detail on what you're seeing at Pratt with the wide-bodies. I was wondering if you could explain maybe what's going on in Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich and why the orders there and the spares there are a bit soft relative to flight hours maybe.","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think that's the $64,000 question at Aerospace. Again, Pratt, we've got much better visibility because it's all time-based overhauls primarily. So we know the schedule when these engines are supposed to come back. And for the most part, they're coming back as we had expected because they're putting the flying hours on. On the Goodrich and the Hamilton legacy, that is all condition-based. They're on-condition repairs. So in other words, if you have a failure in the field, you're going to see the units come back in. And quite frankly, these LRUs, the Line Replaceable Units, the airlines do have inventory of these various parts that Hamilton and Goodrich make and they're bringing down inventory, we believe, and not sending everything back for repair. So again, I think we will see, just based upon flying hours, a recovery there to a more normal kind of 5% to 7% growth year-over-year starting next year on the Aerospace Systems side. But this year, I think it's just all about airline cash conservation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Greg, in terms of next year, when you think about the noncash and the cash items, I mean, you're going to have a fair amount of noncash stuff running through with the pension and the amortization. Are there any big kind of cash offsets in terms of pension contributions or working capital dynamics in the businesses?","Gregory J. Hayes","I think there's 2 offsets that we have to keep in mind and we still have to manage. One is there's an appetite for additional inventory to support the build on the commercial OE side. So again, I think we see pressure at Pratt & Whitney. We see pressure at the Aerospace Systems side for inventory. And we also see an appetite for those businesses for CapEx. And I think that's, again, something we need to meter out effectively. We need to make sure that we take full advantage of all the facilities that we now have between Pratt and legacy Hamilton and Goodrich. So like I think -- initially, everybody wants to build everything new, buy everything new. We just need to think about that and we'll come back with a specific guidance. But I'll tell you, there's pressure on CapEx and there's pressure on working capital, specifically inventory.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And pension contributions?","Gregory J. Hayes","Again, we made $200 million of pension contributions this year because cash, as I said, has been very strong. It's actually a good place to put our money. We get an 8% return on it in the pension plan. But we have no funding requirements under the ERISA rules until at least 2015. And quite frankly, we're 84% funded at the pension plan today and if I get to a discount rate of 5.5%, which is where we were 2 years ago, we'd be fully funded. So the last thing we want to do is throw more cash into the pension plan.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just can you explain a little more why the Goodrich amortization went down? I mean, did you assign a lower value to something that would have been amortized? Could you just explain that a little more?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, I think what we found is there were some several contracts in the legacy Goodrich business, which were in loss-making positions. And as we've changed the accounting to our accounting conformity, we were -- we had to recognize those losses upfront. So we actually provided for that as a liability, if you will, going forward. That's now getting amortized and offsetting some of the other intangibles. Again, we initially had not expected to set up this liability, if you will, for these loss-making contracts. If you remember, the Goodrich accounting, they took a look at the contract over its life and had a very, very long-term view. We've got, let's say, like an 8-year life for looking at these contracts that are loss-making. So we amortize the intangibles on these loss-making contracts over that 8-year period.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, my first question was just on the Otis operating profit progression so I guess you had pretty high decrementals in the sort of mid-high 30% range in Q2 and Q3. You're saying that profit should grow though year-on-year in Q4 even though your revenues are probably down. So I guess I'm trying to figure out what's going on in the cost base. Is it to do with mix that you think European aftermarket maybe is now stabilizing in Q4, or is it that you've added a lot of costs in places like China and that kind of hiring is now coming to an end, so you get a natural lift on incrementals or something?","Gregory J. Hayes","Really there's 2 things that impacted first half of the decrease in margins. Part of that was pricing, we've talked about that. I think we've probably seen $75 million year-to-date of pricing impacts, about 1\/2 of that in Europe. We also had commodity headwind in the first half of the year related to the rare earth. Again, that was something that probably started playing out last year and really, by the middle of this year, by third quarter, had gone away but certainly hurt first half margins. We've added a little bit of cost on the SG&A line. But again, that's just positioning Otis to take advantage of what's going on over in China. We've moved the businesses' strategy development to Shanghai. We've opened up the high-rise CLC in Shanghai. So there are a little bit of investment, but really the story is in the first half has been pricing and it's been commodities.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, switching to your 2013 outlook. I just wondered the commercial Aero OEM side, that comes up in sort of a plus and a minus. Is that just the difference between regions or wide-body versus narrow-body or...","Gregory J. Hayes","No, the reason we put commercial Aero OEM up there is a positive. Certainly, on the revenue line it will be a positive. There will be some headwind from negative margins and some of the -- especially on the engine side, I think, especially probably on the -- there will be the A380, the GP7000 engine. They basically ramped up production at Airbus, we'll see some headwind there. So good news on the top line, not as much on the bottom line.","Operator","Our final question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a clarification once again on Goodrich. You had said in your prepared remarks that it's $125 million better. But then the, I guess, Aerospace Systems business, you're saying is only $50 million better for the year. What's the gap in there did you bring down for Hamilton?","Jesus Malave","The other piece, Sam, is related to the deal cost that Greg mentioned and that is in corporate elims. So the $125 million, a piece of it is in the segment and a piece of it is in UTC corporate elims.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the growth in the receivables of about $1 billion in inventories, almost $2 billion, how much of that would be the core business versus just layering in Goodrich, and I guess, IAE as well?","Gregory J. Hayes","Yes, most of that build is actually Goodrich and IAE. I don't know if I've got the exact numbers down here, but actually, let us get back to you, Sam, on that. Because again, I think, the large majority of those additional AR and inventory, all that working capital is really related to the acquisitions.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last thing is on the order rates as we look into the fourth quarter. You've already mentioned North American or just CCS easy comps. It looks like Pratt large commercial also has pretty easy comps. And even Otis new equipment isn't that bad. I mean should we be seeing positive bookings across all the segments in the fourth quarter?","Gregory J. Hayes","I would think so with the exception, perhaps, at Transicold. Again, I think last year fourth quarter was still pretty strong at Transicold. So that's a pretty lumpy business, as I said. So that would be the one caveat I would say to order rates. Everything else, again, I think we had seen a pretty slow fourth quarter last year on the order intake side, so should be pretty easy compares both at Otis and the Aero businesses.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And Pratt commercial spares, if you have the same dollar amount in this third quarter versus the easy compare in fourth quarter, would we actually see bookings up next year -- I mean, next quarter?","Gregory J. Hayes","I'm sorry, if we had orders in the...","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Similar dollars. If it was just sequentially flat in the December quarter from the September quarter, do we end up with a positive comparison?","Jesus Malave","No, Sam. You would be down. Last year was pretty flat throughout the year.","Gregory J. Hayes","Okay. I want to thank everybody for listening. I know it's, again, a lot of stuff going on in UTC here. We'll see you guys all in December next for Louis' annual guidance. We're going to continue to focus on what we do best. We're going to focus on integration, we're going to make sure we're accelerating on cost reduction and we're going to focus on outperforming the peers. And that's what we do every day here. So thanks, everybody, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

On the call today are, Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neil Mitchill, Acting Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nathan Ware, Senior Director, Investor Relations.","This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at www.utc.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and\/or non-operational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.","Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.","Greg Hayes","Thank you, Catherine. And good morning, everyone. So a couple of new folks on the call with me this morning, Neil Mitchill, taking over for Akhil Johri, as our new Senior VP and CFO, and Nathan Ware, taking over for Carroll Lane, Head of Investor Relations. So a little bit of change here, but no change in terms of the results as you would have expected. So really a solid quarter and more importantly, a great year, record year in fact of financial performance.","This morning, we are going to cover three topics. We will of course go through the fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, but I\u2019m also giving you an update on where we are with the UTC portfolio transformation, including the Rockwell Collins integration, the separation activity around Otis and Carrier and of course, the pending merger with Raytheon. And finally, Neil will take you through the 2020 outlook for Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace.","Just a word on the cadence of our outlook disclosures for the years can be a little bit different this year given the separation activity, and given the pending merger. We recently announced that Carrier and Otis investor meetings are scheduled for February 10th and 11th respectively. This is when Dave Gitlin and Judy Marks along with their senior team will give you guys an overview of their respective businesses and provide their financial outlook for 2020. So we\u2019re not going to preempt those today and go through their guidance, but you can look forward to talking and quizzing Dave and Judy in early February.","Also, you\u2019ll notice that we\u2019re not going to provide EPS or cash outlooks today. We\u2019ll come back and talk about all of those metrics and the full year outlook for Raytheon Technologies following the completion of the merger, which we expect to close early in the second quarter. So as you expect, different timeline this year given the various transformational events underway, but again, it will \u2013 we\u2019ll get it all out there in due course.","So let\u2019s start on 2019. For the year, we reported record sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Adjusted EPS that was $8.26 and that\u2019s up 9% versus last year. Sales $77 billion, that\u2019s up 16% and importantly, organic growth 5% and that\u2019s on top of the 8% organic - sales growth we saw in 2018. All four businesses contributed to the organic growth.","We saw good margin expansion at the Aerospace business, as well as a return to earnings growth and margin stabilization at Otis. At Carrier, the team closed out a challenging year on a positive note, slightly exceeding the most recent outlook for the business.","Free cash flow for UTC was $6.6 billion for the year and that included approximately $400 million of one time cash payments, related to the portfolio separation activities.","The cash performance was about $1.1 billion better than the mid-point of our latest outlook due to the timing of separation tax payments, most of which will take place here in the first half of 2020 and of course, better operational performance from each of the businesses. In total, we continue to expect about $2.5 billion to $3 billion of one-time cash costs associated with the portfolio separation.","So strong results for 2019 above our expectations coming into the year and above our expectations as late as October with each of the businesses well positioned as we move into 2020.","Okay, on the webcast, this is now on to Slide 2. In addition to the financial results, we had several notable highlights and we\u2019ve made significant progress on the transformational initiatives that we\u2019ve been working for the last year. Let me give you a quick update on a few of those.","At Pratt & Whitney, the GTF and F135 engine output continue to ramp in 2019. We continue to add to the order book for both programs including yesterday\u2019s announcement that Wizz Air had selected the GTF engine to power its next lot of 166 aircraft adding to an order book of more than 10,000 firm and option engines for the GTF program.","While durability issues on the GTF continue to be addressed, it\u2019s clear, our customer see the value of the engine, which continues to meet or exceed all of the key performance metrics, including fuel burn, reduced noise and emissions. And with - we now have more than 700 GTF powered aircraft in service about 4.3 million flight hours.","Since October, Pratt has also secured contracts totaling more than $7 billion for the production of more than 400 F135 engines in the related program support. So a very strong backlog at Pratt & Whitney.","This past quarter, we also celebrated the one year anniversary of Rockwell Collins. Throughout the year, following close, the Collins team has delivered outstanding performance. We achieved approximately $300 million of acquisition related cost synergies and captured about $200 million of sales synergies in our order book.","Adjusted EPS accretion from the Collins acquisition was $0.66 for the year. Now you recall, going into the year, we had estimated about $0.35 of accretion. So a very strong year from Kelly Ortberg and the whole team at Collins Aerospace.","We continue to see clear line of sight to the $600 million of cost synergies that we started out with, but more importantly over $1 billion of sales synergies we would expect from the acquisition.","Okay. Let\u2019s turn to the separations. For both Otis and Carrier, they are substantially complete from an operational standpoint. That happened on January 1, where we cut them off from the corporate systems for the most part and they are now operating independently. Both companies as you see, announced their future Board of Directors in December and are looking forward to their pre-spin investor meetings in early February.","Importantly, we received both US and Canadian tax rulings for the separation and we\u2019re currently working through a few final legal entity restructuring activities required to stand up the businesses as independent companies. Again, we\u2019re now targeting early in the second quarter for the spin of both businesses. So, no surprises there, portfolio separations remain on track.","Finally, on the merger with Raytheon. Our goal is to have the combination of UTC's aerospace businesses with Raytheon closed concurrent with the portfolio separation in early April. As of course subject to receiving all regulatory approvals, integration planning is well underway and we are already working a detailed list of items to generate the $1 billion of gross cost synergies that we\u2019re targeting for the transaction.","I also remain very excited about the technology synergies that result from the combination and the opportunity this merger presents to create a best-in-class premier aerospace and defense system provider.","Okay, with that, so let me turn it over to Nathan to take you through the fourth quarter results and then Neil will walk you through 2020 outlook and I\u2019ll be back to wrap up at the end. Nathan?","Nathan Ware","All right. Thanks, Greg. Moving to Slide 3. As Greg said, Q4 was another solid quarter for UTC, reported sales of $19.6 billion were up 8% including 1% organic growth and 8 points of M&A benefit driven by the Rockwell Collins acquisition.","Foreign exchange was a 1 point headwind in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.94, down 1% versus the prior year on a difficult compare. You will recall, we saw 22% adjusted earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. Within the quarter, segment profit growth was offset by expected higher corporate items including interest expense and higher share count.","On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $1.32, that\u2019s up 59% versus the prior year and includes $0.16 of restructuring and $0.46 of net non-recurring charges, including $0.39 related to the portfolio separation activities.","The GAAP earnings per share growth was largely driven by the absence of a tax charge that you will recall we booked last year, partially offset by the portfolio separation charges incurred this year.","Free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 54% or approximately $700 million compared to the prior year and included approximately $200 million of one-time cash separation payments. The quarter capped a strong year for free cash flow as Greg mentioned earlier.","Okay. With that, I\u2019ll move on to the segment results and I\u2019ll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do and as a reminder, there is an appendix on Slide 17 with additional segment data as a reference.","So starting with Otis on Slide 4. Sales of $3.4 billion in the quarter were up 4% organically. New equipment sales grew 1% driven by high teens growth in China, partially offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.","Service sales grew 5% driven by growth across all regions. Within service, maintenance and repair was up 5% and modernization was up 8%.","At constant currency, new equipment orders grew 3% driven by mid-single digit growth in the Americas and Europe, as well as low single digit growth in China as the region continue to benefit from favorable pricing and mix. Asia-Pacific was down low single digit.","Operating profit was up 3% at constant currency driven primarily by volume growth and favorable price and mix and service, partially offset by higher research and development and strategic investments in the business.","Service contribution also grew for the sixth straight quarter with all regions contributing. Foreign exchange translation was a 2 point headwind to sales and a 1 point headwind to earnings.","For the year, Otis' sales grew 5% organically with mid-single digit growth in both new equipment and service. Operating profit was up $28 million at actual currency. The benefits from service transformation initiatives globally and improvements in China led to margin stabilization during the year and establishes a solid base for Otis to build upon as they become independent company.","Moving to Carrier on Slide 5. Carrier sales were down 2% organically in the quarter driven by refrigeration which was down 8%. That's mainly due to hard compares in the North American truck trailer business, which was up almost 50% in Q4 of 2018. Global HVAC sales were flat and global fire & security was up 1% in the quarter.","Moving to orders, Carrier equipment orders contracted 4% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by transport refrigeration, which was down 32%. Within transport refrigeration, North American truck trailer was down 63% after being up over 50% in the fourth quarter of last year.","Fire & security product orders were down 3% while global HVAC orders were up 2% with North American residential up mid-single digit and global commercial HVAC flat. Within commercial HVAC, EMEA was up 10% offset by high single digit declines in the Americas.","On a constant currency basis, operating profit was down 4% in the quarter. Lower volume and adverse mix, as well as headwinds from lower discount rates used for valuing long-term liabilities were partially offset by pricing benefits and material productivity net of tariff impacts.","Operating profit included the gain on a sale of an equity investment and a land sale offsetting the absence of prior year similar items. For the year, Carrier sales were up 1% organically and operating profit was down $80 million at actual currency, slightly exceeding the most recent outlook for the business.","Turning to Pratt on Slide 6. Sales of $5.6 billion were up 2% on both an organic and reported basis in the quarter and that was on top of 22% organic growth last year. Commercial OEM sales were down 7% driven by expected declines in V2500 shipments, partially offset by higher GTF engine shipments and favorable engine mix at Pratt & Whitney Canada.","Commercial aftermarket sales were flat in the quarter. Early GTF shop visits, as well as higher Pratt & Whitney Canada and V2500 volumes offset expected declines in legacy programs and the absence of prior year contract adjustments.","Military sales were up 12% driven by continued ramp of the F135 program and higher aftermarket sales across all key platforms. Operating profit of $456 million was up 34%, drop-through on higher military sales, favorable commercial aftermarket mix and growth at Pratt & Whitney Canada more than offset commercial OE mix headwind and the net impact of contract adjustments. Results also benefited from lower engineering and development expense in the quarter.","For the full year, organic sales were up 8% driven by higher GTF and Pratt & Whitney Canada engine shipments and higher military volume. Operating profit was up $239 million.","All right, turning to Collins Aerospace on Slide 7. Sales in the quarter were $6.4 billion, up $1.5 billion on a reported basis and 1% organically. Operating profit of $1 billion was up $236 million versus the prior year. You\u2019ll recall that the fourth quarter of last year contained about five weeks of results from the Rockwell Collins acquisition.","On a pro forma basis, including results for Rockwell Collins the entire fourth quarter of 2018, Collins Aerospace delivered operating profit growth of 8% on 4% higher sales. The pro forma sales growth reflects continued strength in commercial aftermarket and military channels, partially offset by commercial OEM volume.","Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% driven by continued strength in initial provisioning and demand for modifications and upgrades. Military was up 10% driven by F35 volume and overall aftermarket growth. Commercial OEM sales were down 6% driven by expected declines on legacy programs which more than offset growth in new platform sales.","Operating profit growth was driven by the contribution of two additional months of results from the Rockwell Collins acquisition, drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales and synergy benefits. The growth was partially offset by lower commercial OE volume and unfavorable mix, as well as higher SG&A and engineering and development.","On a full year basis, Collins Aerospace delivered 6% organic sales growth and over $1.8 billion of operating profit growth, driven by contributions from the Rockwell Collins acquisition, solid execution and synergy capture and strong end markets. Pro forma operating profit growth was 16% on 7% sales growth.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Neil, who will provide more detail on the 2020 outlook. Neil?","Neil Mitchill","Thank you, Nathan. I\u2019m on Slide 8. As Greg said, I\u2019m going to talk about the 2020 outlook for Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace today. As you think about both businesses, let me begin by highlighting a few of the dynamics we see impacting our outlook before I go through the specific numbers.","Starting with the positives, revenue passenger miles are projected to remain solid and grow over 4% in 2020 which will continue to support growth in the underlying aftermarket demand in both Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace.","I\u2019d say, we also have clear line of sight to continued growth at our military businesses driven by higher F135 engines and F35 system content, as well as strong aftermarket demand across key programs including the F117, F119 and F35 programs.","And lastly, we will see continued synergy benefits at Collins Aerospace as they enter year two as a combined entity. We expect to capture approximately $150 million of incremental cost synergies from the Rockwell acquisition and that\u2019s on top of the $300 million that we realized in 2019.","On the challenges side of the equation, no surprises here, we anticipate headwinds at Collins Aerospace, driven by the suspension of the 737 MAX production, as well as an expected decline in volume associated with the ADS-B mandate as the deadline for compliance in the US was the end of 2019. We do see some ADS-B demand in 2020 driven by the mid-year European deadline, but substantially less than levels we saw last year.","So turning to Slide 9, you will see the 2020 segment outlooks for both Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace. As usual, the appendix has a detailed sales and operating profit walk for both businesses.","At a high level, we generally see these outlooks in line with our S-4 projections excluding the impact of the suspension of the 737 MAX production, the expected impact of divestitures associated with the merger with Raytheon, as well as cost to achieve synergies at Collins Aerospace.","Okay. Starting with Pratt & Whitney and the outlook there. We expect mid-single digit sales growth in 2020. Organically commercial OE will be up high-single-digit as GTF volumes will continue to ramp and we expect to see higher Pratt & Whitney Canada OEM sales driven by business jet and helicopter engine shipments.","Commercial aftermarket is expected to grow low to mid-single digits, primarily driven by continued V2500 growth and GTF activity, partially offset by declines in the legacy engines. The military business will continue to see benefits from higher F135 engine shipments and continued aftermarket demand as is expected to grow mid-single digit.","On the profit side, we expect Pratt\u2019s operating profit to increase $225 million to $275 million driven by drop-through on the higher commercial aftermarket and military sales. Commercial OE profit is expected to be flat year-over-year.","So now turning to Collins Aerospace. Reported sales are expected to be down low-single digit, including approximately 5 points of headwind due to the suspension of the 737 MAX production, lower ADS-B mandate volume and the divestitures that I just mentioned. Organically, commercial OEM sales will be down mid-single digit as declines in the 737 MAX and legacy programs more than offset the ramp of other new programs.","Commercial aftermarket is expected to be up slightly and within the commercial aftermarket, provisioning is expected to be down mid-single digits after being up over 20% organically in 2019.","Military sales will be up mid-single digit and continued strength in the military end markets. Operating profit for Collins Aerospace will be down $275 million to $325 million versus 2019, including approximately $550 million to $600 million of combined headwinds due to the 737 MAX, the ADS-B mandate and the required divestitures. These headwinds are partially offset by drop-through on higher military sales and the $150 million of incremental cost synergies I referenced earlier.","Lastly, before I hand it back over to Greg, just a few comments as you think about UTC in the first quarter prior to the spins and merger. Starting with sales. We expect Q1, 2020 reported sales to be up slightly versus the prior year. We expect low to mid-single digit growth at the aerospace businesses despite the 737 MAX headwind and this growth will be partially offset by Carrier, which is expected to be down driven by tough first half compares for the refrigeration business and some FX headwind.","On the earnings front for Q1, at the segment level, we expect operating profit to be flat, including the 737 MAX and ADS-B headwind, as well as some incremental costs at Otis and Carrier as each business staffs to be a standalone entity.","Below the line, we see a few moving pieces. First, we have some FX pressure due to the portfolio separation, interest expense and other corporate costs which accounts for around $0.10 of headwind. And second, non-service pension income will be lower by $0.03 driven by the discount rate impact we discussed last quarter.","In addition, the absence of a prior year tax gain, which you will recall was related to the legacy BE business, as well as higher minority interest adds another $0.06 of pressure. And finally, share count will be higher than last year.","On the cash front, we expect Q1 free cash flow to be an outflow and that\u2019s driven primarily by the approximately $1.6 billion of portfolio separation payments expected to occur in the first quarter.","So with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Greg.","Greg Hayes","Okay. Thanks, Neil. So some moving pieces, as always, but really strong performance in 2019 - excuse me. As we look to 2020, I would just remind everybody that the priorities of our businesses remain clear and consistent. We\u2019re focused on executing on our commitments to customers, driving growth through innovation, cost reduction and of course remaining disciplined in capital allocation. At the same time, we continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment.","The US remain strong, Asia, of course, continues to grow but at a little bit slower rate and the Europe remains a watch item. Overall, the aerospace and defense end market remain robust and we feel very good about our ability to deliver in 2020. That said, we\u2019re also keeping our eye on the developing Coronavirus situation, any impacts that could have to all of our businesses.","And while 2020 marks the last chapter for United Technologies as it stands today, it also begins a bright future for Otis, Carrier and Raytheon Technologies as standalone public companies. I\u2019m excited about the future of each of these businesses and I\u2019m confident of the teams that we put in place to drive sustainable long-term value creation, that\u2019s going to benefit customers, employees, shareowners and our communities for decades to come.","With that, let\u2019s go ahead and open up the call for questions. Catherine?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Mr. Sprague.","Jeff Sprague","Feeling a little nostalgic here, this is the last call. But good ride, thank you.","Greg Hayes","Yeah. It\u2019s amazing, isn't it?","Jeff Sprague","Yes, it really is. Greg, I was hoping you could unpack a little bit to some degree kind of the Collins Aerospace headwind between what is MAX, what is ADS-B and what is tied to the divestitures and does that assume kind of a full year halt on production?","Greg Hayes","Okay. So let\u2019s start with the 737 MAX that\u2019s probably the easiest part for everybody to understand. So we\u2019ve assumed roughly a 90-day production delay, which is consistent with direction that we\u2019ve received from Boeing. So if you\u2019re thinking about that each month, if you add up both the OEM, the aftermarket provisioning that you\u2019re not going to get, costs you about $100 million in revenue and about half of that in operating profit and a big chunk of that operating profit is coming from lack of absorption in our factories.","So think about 100 over three months, that\u2019s $300 million of sales, plus about $150 million of op profit and then in the back half of the year, we\u2019ve essentially cut production in half from the rate that we had, so from 42 to 21. So you can double that in the back half of the year and you\u2019ll get roughly $600 million and $300 million.","We\u2019ve also in the guidance added in some monies for some supplier disruption. So we think, overall, the impact could be somewhere between $350 million and $375 million to the year. I hope that\u2019s conservative, we hope, but again the reduction resumes more quickly. But as we sit here today that\u2019s the best outlook that we can give you.","The ADS-B mandate, I think we\u2019ve taken you through that number before and again it\u2019s a - north of $100 million of earnings, that will go away and the other big piece of course is the divestitures. So two divestitures, one was the military GPS business at Rockwell - legacy, Rockwell Collins out in Cedar Rapids. That\u2019s a great business. As you guys saw, BAE bought that or signed a contract to buy that. That will close sometime we think in the back half of the year.","And then on top of that, our business in Danbury, Connecticut, our ISR business, military optics, space optics that will also - will probably sign here in the next couple of months and that will also close in the back half of the year.","So that\u2019s the additional headwind that we see both on top line and bottom line. So again, you\u2019re only going to see about six months impact from the divestitures this year. You\u2019ll see a full year obviously next year.","Obviously, the good news is, we\u2019ll get another shot at this guidance in probably May, once we close with Raytheon, we\u2019ll come back in early May, probably a month after the merger and give you full year guidance for RTX and give you an update on the MAX and everything else that\u2019s going on.","Jeff Sprague","And just one more and I\u2019ll pass it on. What was the MAX impact in the fourth quarter?","Greg Hayes","It was - it really was not significant. Again, we were - Boeing was still taking at a rate of 42, again, our original guidance had assumed it was going to be 56, I think. So there was a little bit of an impact, you can do the math, but it wasn\u2019t significant. And most of that was made up by additional aftermarket in the other - for the other aircraft that are flying.","Jeff Sprague","Great, thank you. Good luck with everything.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Hey, good morning. Thank you, Greg.","Greg Hayes","Hi, Sheila","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just to continue on the MAX. This was been a pretty favorable environment for the GTF in general and Airbus recently announced the new allocation between CFM and Pratt with a higher share for CFM.","So I guess, when we think about GTF, how does that change that trajectory in terms of production? How do we think about annualized losses? You mentioned was there - are there other opportunities to take some share?","Greg Hayes","So let me just put GTF in perspective. I think I mentioned it as we started out. We've got about 10,000 GTF engines in backlog and as a program to date we\u2019ve got about 40% share on the A320 family, higher share on the A321 than on the A319 and A320.","If you think about it in the last 12 months, we\u2019ve won about 50% of the orders that are out there. We just announced Wizz Air, obviously, I think that came out yesterday. As you think about it going forward, I think the opportunity is even better for GTF.","As you think about the XLR, the long range version of the A321, that requires a higher thrust engine, which we\u2019ll be able to deliver for Airbus and for their customers. And again, we think more production going to the higher ends, even the A - just the basic A321 where Pratt has got a probably a stronger offering.","I mean, said that, we are I would say production constrained in terms of how many engines that we can build. I think loss provisions last year were about the same as the year before about $1.1 billion or so. We expect that number will probably continue at this rate.","Cost came down roughly 8% to 10% last year. We\u2019ll continue to take cost out. But we\u2019re trying to be judicious in terms of which customers we choose and which customers we elect not to make offerings to. You\u2019ll note in the - in the discussion before, there were some contract adjustments at Pratt in the quarter that obviously relates to some of the durability issues that we\u2019ve seen on the GTF, specifically in some of those very difficult operating environments. But again, very good performance and a very good future I think for GTF.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you.","Neil Mitchill","Thanks, Greg - Jeff. Greg, I will add a comment to that on production. Sheila, the numbers that you\u2019ll see in our external documents here, our combined GTF and V2500, obviously the legacy engines production is coming down substantially. If I look at the production sequentially Q3 to Q4 on the GTF, it was up over 30% on a full year basis about 20% and we would expect that same kind of rate going into 2020. So the numbers you see are aggregated, but we\u2019re supporting Airbus in 2019 and we\u2019re aligned with them in 2020 to deliver the engines for their airplanes.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Good morning, guys.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Echo - I would echo Jeff\u2019s comments. This is kind of a silly question, but have you guys gone back and looked at what possibly kind of could happen here with air traffic? I know it\u2019s early on with this whole virus thing, but just looking back at past events like this, what the risk - kind of frame the risk around that?","Greg Hayes","Yeah, Steve, we actually - we obviously went back and took a look at 2003 and the impact of the SARS virus and as you will recall air traffic slowed down significantly for about three months and really, there was about a six month impact overall in the aftermarket.","I would say, there are two major differences today. One is the airlines are a hell of a lot healthier than they were in \u201903. You were coming off of 9\/11 and airline bankruptcies and nobody had any money. The fact is air traffic remains pretty strong, but there will be a blip in Asia this quarter as a result of this.","The second thing is the flu, it happens every year. I just - we went back and we\u2019re looking at the last full flu season, we had 960,000 people in the US were hospitalized with the flu, 80,000 people passed away. So as we think about this, you got to keep it in perspective, it\u2019s a big deal, obviously until they get it contained.","But the Chinese government I think is doing a much better job today in terms of being proactive and containing this and while we expect there will be some impact of the commercial aftermarket, we don\u2019t expect it will be significant. Again, back in 2003, we saw about a 20% drop in the aftermarket for that - for two quarters, I don\u2019t expect it\u2019s going to be that bad at this time.","Steve Tusa","Right. And then just last one last one on the math here. When you look at the kind of $8 billion plus cash target, obviously, this is somewhat temporary, you guys seem to make, obviously a lot of money on what your supplying to them. So it's a little bit different than engines, where you might be loss making so lack of deliveries would be kind of a positive from that perspective. But at any change to kind of that $8 billion target and kind of that \u201921 period from\u2026","Greg Hayes","No. So look there is clearly a cash impact, this year was probably in the - let's call it $400 million range at Collins Aerospace and I would tell you that\u2019s within the \u2013 is contemplated in our overall guidance for the year, its not going to change the $8 billion target and again, it is temporary. Next year, I think that as MAX production ramps back up, that abates.","So I think again, it's a one-time issue and part of it, of course, as you know, see we\u2019re trying to keep the supply chain, going a little bit here. And any time you have these production disruptions you always worry about the supply chain and some of the smaller suppliers out there.","So, Collins is doing the right thing. They\u2019re trying to manage that proactively, so that we don\u2019t have a problem as we start the line back up with suppliers who can\u2019t meet the new demand.","Steve Tusa","Right. Okay. Great, great color. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Good morning, gentlemen.","Greg Hayes","Morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Greg, I wondered if you might expand just quickly to clarify on that cash impact that is - how much of that is payments to suppliers versus inventory you may build that\u2019s higher than the rate just to keep the production healthy?","Greg Hayes","Well, you can do the math on terms of the lost sales, right? We\u2019re talking about $600 million roughly for the year. So most of that is going to be cash, we\u2019re not seeing from suppliers - from our customer. But there is a small piece of that - look we - Collins folks have identified as going to the supply chain. It\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re not talking hundreds of millions of dollars here, we\u2019re talking probably less than 100.","Carter Copeland","Yeah. So it sounds like you\u2019re not planning on building inventory in any substantial amount above whatever the agreed upon rate is?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. So it will be, I would say more surgical than just \u2013 you know, we\u2019re going to bring all the inventory. We\u2019re going to do \u2013 we\u2019re going to bring inventory where we need to. And so the other opportunity here is, to the extent that we were behind on certain programs, Collins does have a pretty significant backlog of things that they can work on. There is still disruption costs in the factory as you could imagine and absorption issues. But we think, we\u2019ve captured all of that in the guidance numbers here.","Carter Copeland","And do you have any, just as a final point, do you have any cost actions built into that or what not, are you basically just going to eat the stranded cost?","Greg Hayes","We do not anticipate any lay-off. I think that would be the easiest thing to do. But quite frankly, given the scarcity of talented aerospace workers out there, we're not going to be laying anybody off for a 90-day delay here. I think, we\u2019re going to work on the backlog. We\u2019ll try and keep everybody busy, but it just doesn't make sense to lay people off for 90 days and try and bring them back.","There is probably some offset here and again on the aftermarket - haven't really been able to quantify what that is, given the kind of the late-breaking nature of this change. But there\u2019s probably some upside in the aftermarket from what - what we\u2019ve got baked into the guidance today. But we\u2019ll see what - how that whole thing shakes out as the year progresses.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thanks, Greg.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ronald Epstein","Hey, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Ron.","Ronald Epstein","Could you walk through some of the kind of where we stand on the durability issues on the GTF, you know, you alluded to it being challenged in some of the more - by this challenging operating environments. But like where do we stand? What's going on and how should we think about it?","Greg Hayes","So I think, let me just categorize. There is no new durability issues on the GTF. We\u2019ve had three issues that we\u2019ve identified over the last couple of years that have required retrofits. The biggest issue today is on the third turbine blade - third stage turbine blade. This was a problem - or an issue that we identified early on in the program, originally that blade was made of a titanium aluminum material which proved to be way too fragile for the operating environment. And so, we\u2019ve moved to a nickel-based alloy.","That change was made a couple of years ago. All the new engines have the upgraded blade. Unfortunately, some of the issue or some of the early engines, especially those in India at Indigo and GoAir, and some of the other Asian operators still have the older blades in there. As you can get fire [ph] through the engines, this blade tends to fracture and causes in-flight shut down.","So in a - I would say, to be very cautious focus on safety first, we're doing some accelerated inspections and accelerated retrofit to get this older design blade out of the market or out of the - out of the fleet. So that will \u2013 that will happen mostly in India in the first half of the year, again in very difficult operating environments and we\u2019re monitoring that around the rest of the world. But probably all of that - the retrofits going to take through the end of this year to get complete.","The two other issues that we\u2019ve always talked about, one was the auxiliary gearbox, where we had a gear that needed to be replaced. We were getting some resonance and some early fatigue on that. That retrofit is underway. And lastly, of course, the combustor liner, which again has been a problem since the get-go, especially in these difficult operating environments, given the temperature that this operates at.","So that will - again we've got a retrofit program in place for that - the latest version of the combustor, the D will be out sometime in the - in June timeframe this year, so we\u2019ll be retrofitting that. So no new issues, but I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s causing out of the operators pain, especially in India and China, and again some of these more difficult operating environment.","So as a result of that, again, we\u2019re trying to be very cautious here. We don't want to put anybody at risk. So a lot of inspections, a lot of time on wing, and a lot of time out there trying to get all of this fleet upgraded and it\u2019s just going to take us, probably through the first half of this year to get most of that work done.","Ronald Epstein","Okay, great. So you expect to get it mostly done through the first half there. Super. Great. Thanks.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Just a question around Pratt, so you do have those legacy programs weighing on the aftermarket growth, maybe just help us understand what headwind do you have dialing in for legacy aftermarket sales declines in 2020 and what the scale of that legacy piece now is within Pratt?","And then perhaps, switching text slightly within Collins Aerospace, maybe give any color around the cadence of organic sales as we go through the year, please, within that down slightly guide how we think about first half, second half?","Neil Mitchill","Julian, thanks. It\u2019s Neil. Just a couple of comments on the Pratt aftermarket. Clearly the legacy programs are starting to trail-off, but there is still a pretty substantial part of the profit going forward in Pratt. We\u2019ve had some headwinds, we talked about that earlier this year and some contract adjustments.","But I think about the V, though. When we came out of the fourth quarter here, very strong inductions and so we saw about a 6% increase quarter-over-quarter in induction activity on the V. We\u2019re well capacitized to deal with that level of inductions through 2020 and we\u2019d expect the underlying demand to be there.","Keep in mind though in order to overhaul an engine, it needs to come off of the wing and with the 737 MAX situation, the legacy planes are flying quite a bit more. And so - and we\u2019ve seen good durability on the V2500.","That said, still expecting to see growth there. The network is - recovered from the early blips that we had in 2019. So I think, well positioned for 2020 on the aftermarket side at Pratt.","As for the Collins organic growth, I think, we\u2019ll expect to see that fairly ratable through the year. What I would say is that the first quarter will hurt a bit more from the 737 MAX headwind that we just talked about, and you will recall that the first quarter of 2019 for Collins was exceptionally strong, especially given the Rockwell post merger activity.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.","Peter Arment","Thanks. Good morning, Greg, Neil.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Arment","Just you had some acquired divestitures with the Collins GPS and I guess, the optics business, I think you mentioned regarding that - that's going to still be closed here soon enough. What about other divestiture activity, you know, just given the - the merger with Raytheon, are you thinking about other things or should we expect other actions going forward?","Greg Hayes","I\u2019m not going to announce anything today, Peter. But let me tell you, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself here. But I think, it's clear, when we get - when we complete the merger with Raytheon, we\u2019re going to have a fairly substantial portfolio. And I think, as we typically would do at UTC, we\u2019re going to take a look at that portfolio and quite frankly, some of it is investable and some of it probably is not.","But I think, we\u2019ll take the first year. Mike Dumais, who heads up our strategy group here, he and I will go through the portfolio on both sides of the business. And I think there'll be places where we might elect not to invest and to cash out in other places where we may want to double down.","But right now, I can\u2019t tell you what that\u2019s going to be other than the fact that we\u2019re going to - as we typically do here, we\u2019ll take a dispassionate look at the whole portfolio and figure out where we think we can really add value over the long-term and where we can\u2019t.","Peter Arment","I appreciate that. And just if I could just ask one follow-up quickly on the GTF. Greg, are you changing the cash profile of that outlook just given some of these durability issues or is that still kind of tracking to what you originally said back...","Greg Hayes","No, it\u2019s - we talked about the charge we took in the fourth quarter, impacted the aftermarket because of some of these durability issues. But again, it doesn\u2019t change the overall - overall return on the program or the cash outlook.","Peter Arment","I appreciate the color. Thanks, Greg.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning, Nigel.","Neil Mitchill","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","Greg, congratulations on getting this piece to the finish line.","Greg Hayes","Almost there.","Nigel Coe","So I just wanted to ask my first question on the Collins EBIT this quarter. Obviously fully in line with your guidance, but a big step down from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion run rate through to 2019. So I\u2019m just curious, is that normal seasonality for Collins as is now or was there a mix differential? Anything - any color there?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. Look there is a lot of moving pieces there. I think obviously the aftermarket was still strong, but you also had some OEM headwinds in the quarter and some additional E&D spend, which impacted the quarter a little more than normal. Keep in mind also as we picked up the last five weeks of Collins last year that was a very, very strong five weeks of activity as you can imagine in any of these acquisitions.","So I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions from the fourth quarter compared at Collins. I mean the business is doing great, $300 million [ph] of cost synergies. Overall, the aftermarket for the year was up what 14% with 20% growth in provisioning. So it\u2019s just a solid quarter and again, no, no drama there.","Neil Mitchill","I fully agree with that. It was I would say characterization of OE deliveries from Q4. We see some of that coming back in Q1. So nothing abnormal in the results, they're very strong.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Very helpful. And then Neil, a quick follow-on to you. You provided some, I know that - I know Otis and Carrier guidance will be in two weeks time, but you provided some elements of guidance or the outlook for 2024 [ph] for the commercial businesses. Can you just remind us on that, I didn\u2019t catch all the elements that, I think you said flat op profit, but maybe I\u2019m confused there?","Neil Mitchill","All I was talking about there was with respect to the first quarter. So we do expect Carrier to be down a little bit on the sales, that\u2019s a headwind we expected because of the transport refrigeration headwind and some foreign currency headwind on the sales side.","We also have a couple of some cost coming through in the first quarter. Now that these two businesses are operating separately, there are costs embedded in their stand-alone business right now that are not incremental to the combined UTC and so they won\u2019t be measured out. So we have a little bit of headwind there, but that\u2019s as expected because we\u2019re ready to turn them on to be stand-alone companies.","Greg Hayes","Yeah, just remember, Nigel, we always talked there\u2019s probably about $300 million of annual cost that the businesses have added between the two of them for stand-alone public company costs and then of course, on a year-over-year basis will be headwind here in the first quarter. I think both Judy and Dave have done most of the staffing, I think over 90%, in fact, of what we have expected needed to be added to these businesses.","So, yeah, it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s just a funky quarter with all of these transition costs, some of it - we will identify them when we\u2019re done with the quarter, but it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a little choppy.","Nigel Coe","Great. Thanks guys and good luck.","Greg Hayes","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","Thanks, good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Myles Walton","I think the last six or seven quarters, you\u2019ve done much restructuring in at Pratt and obviously a big tick up here in the fourth quarter, so maybe, was there something you saw there that you\u2019re taking action that you had an opportunity to do previously.","And then, as you look out over the next year not considering the kind of the integration, which sounds like you\u2019re going to keep the two businesses relatively separate with Raytheon, but what\u2019s the outlook for opportunity at both - at both Collins Aerospace as well as Pratt?","Greg Hayes","So at Pratt, in the fourth quarter, we had a early retirement program which was I would say well received and frankly for the last five years as we\u2019ve ramped up GTF production at Pratt, we have added a tremendous amount to the workforce in the back office to support procurement, quality manufacturing, et cetera.","And as Chris Kelly was taking over there, we decided that it was time probably to turn that spicket off and to take some - and get some efficiencies in the overhead pools. So we\u2019ve taken out over 1,000 people through the early retirement program and obviously, the payback is phenomenal on that, that's in fact what's driving a big chunk of Pratt growth next year, is that restructuring.","There remains other opportunities and I think, we will get an opportunity later this year to have Mr. Calio and Mr. Ortberg, take you guys through some of the opportunities they have. Chris is looking at - at a restructuring of some of the other manufacturing operations there and there will be other things that we can do, I think to drive efficiency at Pratt.","Collins is - I think Neil mentioned, we expect another $150 million of cost synergies this year. That\u2019s going to slow down a little bit, but there are still, I would say, lots of opportunities in the facility side that Kelly and team continue to look at.","So even though we haven\u2019t done a lot in the last I would say six quarters, we haven\u2019t forgotten how to do this. I would tell you also Carrier over the course of the last year did a lot of restructuring. I think they took out about 1300 indirect heads during the year.","So we haven\u2019t forgotten our roots on cost reduction. We\u2019re just trying to be judicious with the aerospace sales up like they have been for the last couple of years there just hasn't been as much opportunity, but we certainly see more on the horizon.","Myles Walton","Okay. And just one clarification, the GTF manufacturing and delivery profiles over the last year, has that changed significantly in terms of your outlook or is it roughly the same?","Neil Mitchill","No, I\u2019d say, it's roughly the same.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thank you.","Neil Mitchill","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","Hi. Good morning.","Neil Mitchill","Good morning.","Greg Hayes","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn","I wanted to follow up on the question on the Collins cadence from a couple of minutes ago and focusing on the interiors business. We don\u2019t talk about it a lot, but given that it's a discretionary driven business, it behaves differently than the others. I wanted to see how that was trending at the back end of '19 and what you\u2019re expecting there in 2020?","Greg Hayes","Yeah. I think, I would tell you that the interiors business, first half of last year and even back in 2018, it was not doing as well as what we had hoped. But they have really picked up the cadence here in the back half and very strong backlog. They\u2019ve got some new products out there, both on the economy, and economy plus, as well as in the business class seating, and they\u2019ve got a very strong backlog. So if anything, I would expect there\u2019s some pretty decent growth coming out of the interiors business this year.","Robert Spingarn","I'm sorry.","Neil Mitchill","I was just going to say, the interiors business was a major part of our parts and repair performance in the fourth quarter. So they are performing quite well.","Robert Spingarn","Does the pressure from MAX on the airlines interfere with that discretionary spend or is the idea that that\u2019s really narrow-body carriers really doesn\u2019t influence what is otherwise a wide-body business?","Greg Hayes","Well, just to be clear, we still supply a lot of I would say economy, economy plus seating in the narrow-body sector. Now we haven\u2019t seen a big impact this past year, of course because Boeing was still building the aircraft and still doing \u2013 and fitting out the interiors. And keep in mind, it\u2019s more than just seating. It\u2019s also all the galleys, where we\u2019ve got pretty good share as well.","So when we think about that, we\u2019ve talked about $100 million of sales a month, a chunk of that will come out of the interiors business here in the first few months as Boeing has this production pause.","But beyond that, the backlog still remains very robust. We\u2019ve continued to add there folks both in The Philippines, at our factory there, as well as down in Winston-Salem. So, I would say, that business has turned around nicely.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.","Cai Von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. I think, I followed UTC longer than most. So Greg, you mentioned on the MAX that the 90-day suspension and then you\u2019re going to 21 [ph] in the second half, is that based on your estimate or with some rough guidance from Boeing?","Greg Hayes","I would say that we have been in constant contact with Boeing and so this is our best guess, I would say, educated guess and working with Boeing about what that production pause will look like.","Obviously, I mean, we\u2019re working with them on the software elements of this, but we think this is a - the most reasonable view we could have in terms of what the impact will be to the year. If it\u2019s better, you guys will certainly see it, but for right now, we think that\u2019s what it's going to be.","Cai Von Rumohr","But you mentioned that you don\u2019t plan on laying anyone off for 90 days, but it isn\u2019t really 90 days, because your production rate in the second half by your assumption is going to be down 50%.","So could this very high drop through of the decremental volume be lower, I mean at some point, are you going to think of laying some people off, given, you know, this goes for more than nine months?","Greg Hayes","Well, keep in mind, Cai, this - if you think about Collins, $26 billion in revenue last year. You\u2019ve got a lot of other programs out there, you\u2019ve got growing demand on the military side, you\u2019ve got backlog in wheels and brakes and many other parts of the business.","So will we work some less over time? Probably. But are we going to lay people off because of this? No. I think again, it\u2019s just, it hurts on the absorption front, but it\u2019s not significant in terms of the overall Collins business.","Cai Von Rumohr","Okay, terrific. Thank you.","Greg Hayes","Thanks, Cai. So we want to thank everybody for listening today. I know it\u2019s a busy earnings day. This will be the last earnings call for UTX. All things being equal, and we look forward to seeing everybody, talking to everybody with the completion of the merger and we wish our friends at Carrier and Otis very well. And thank everybody for listening today. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."]}}
