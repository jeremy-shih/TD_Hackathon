Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Vickie, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for the Q3 call. Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks as usual and joining us for Q&A are Tom Lynch our Chief Scientific Officer and Christopher Boerner, our Chief Commercial Officer. Before we get started I'll take care of the Safe Harbor language.","During the call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements, actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date we specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.","We're also going to focus our comments during the call on our non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items, reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, John, good morning everyone. Today we announced another very strong quarter with sales growth of 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 45%. With that said, I'm aware of some of the frustration that many of you have. I wanted you to know that I acknowledge your concerns and today, I'm going to give you my perspective on some of the things I've heard from you.","Let me start with the news on our TMB filing then I'll provide my perspective on the quarter and finally I'll discuss how I am thinking about the company going into 2019 and beyond. Charlie will provide some color on the financials and Tom and Chris are here for your questions.","So let me step back and discuss first where we are with TMB. We have always believed in pursuing areas of high unmet need and following the science to bring the best options to patients. TMB is an important example of that. As we described earlier this year, based on the emerging data for TMB we amended study 227 to evaluate PFS in high TMB patients and demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS. We did it in a way that had no impact on the statistical plan for OS in part 1a and part 2.","With regard to the current regulatory filing for TMB, we have always said this was going to be a complex review, and we recognize that the additional OS data increases that complexity. We remain committed to working with health authorities on the application.","We continue to believe that TMB's scientifically important and as you know, several other companies as well as academic institutions are working to advance the understanding of TMB. Based on everything we've seen, we believe TMB will play a role in the treatment of cancer and we look forward to advancing our research in this area.","Turning now to our results. We delivered another great quarter with outstanding execution across the company. We saw strong demand growth and meaningful market share trends in our portfolio with Opdivo and Eliquis continuing to be positioned well. Specifically, our I-O franchise performed well in a highly competitive market. Our existing indications contributed strong results, including second-line lung where we maintain a leading share. Our new indications also performed well. We continue to see strong uptake for the adjuvant melanoma indication in the U.S. and have begun to launch in the early reimbursement markets in Europe such as Germany.","Let me turn to the other newly-launched indication, first-line renal. I know there has been a lot of news and debate about how this market is going to evolve, so let me give you my perspective. I feel very good about our market position. We were the first I-O approved in renal and we've been calling on physicians who treat renal cancer for almost three years. We've established Opdivo as the leading agent in the second-line setting in a very competitive market.","With the approval in first-line, Opdivo plus Yervoy is already the leading treatment for patients with intermediate and poor risk. We've achieved this by executing well in the market and leveraging a competitive profile for the combination which includes strong overall survival, compelling complete response rates, and good tolerability.","We operate in competitive markets around the world and I have full confidence in the commercial organization to continue to be successful in RCC. Looking forward for Opdivo, based on the strong trends through three quarters, we continue to believe that Opdivo will grow in 2019 based on the current set of indications today.","Let me now turn to Eliquis, the other key growth franchise in our business. We are seeing strong trends and Eliquis has now become the #1 oral anticoagulant in the U.S. This is an incredible milestone, reinforcing the clinical value that Eliquis offers in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. I'm confident that Eliquis continues to have an important opportunity for growth going forward.","Now, looking ahead into 2019. The momentum in our business gives us a solid foundation for growth. Additionally, for 2020 and beyond, I see further potential growth drivers in the future, coming from a number of sources. First, in oncology. We have over 20 registrational trials reading out between now and 2023 in more than 10 tumor types. Importantly, this includes six ongoing trials across multiple indications in the adjuvant setting. This is an area with great progress with readouts beginning in 2020.","With respect now to the early pipeline. One of the things we've learned is that for earlier I-O assets it is helpful, where possible, to see randomized data before moving to registrational studies and we've applied this to 4 to 5 programs where we expect data to enable go\/no-go decisions in 2019.","As you know, one of my key priorities is to further diversify our portfolio and I think we've made good progress in 2018. I want to highlight some key areas. First, we've moved TYK2 into Phase III based on the very promising data in psoriasis you saw in September and I look forward to the opportunity to broaden the TYK2 program based on Phase 2 readouts in the other potential indications, such as Crohn's, UC, and Lupus.","In addition, earlier this year, we entered into a partnership with Janssen for Factor XIa, which is now beginning Phase 2. With respect to the FGF21 program, we've started the Phase 2 needed to enable a phase 3 program. And finally next year we expect data from our nitroxyl donor agent that will inform a potential registrational start.","Business Development has always been a core part of our strategy as we look to source innovation externally, to diversify the portfolio, and then further support long-term growth. This remains a company priority. One that I am very focused on. Our strong balance sheet gives us flexibility in this regard.","In closing, while acknowledging the intensively competitive markets where we operate, I feel good about our performance in the quarter, the momentum in our business as we head into next year, and the breadth of opportunities for longer-term growth. With that, I'll hand it over to Charlie for more specifics on the quarter.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was another strong quarter for the company highlighted by continued growth across our key brands including Opdivo and Eliquis. As Giovanni mentioned, Opdivo trends remain strong and we are executing at a high-level with our new launches in adjuvant melanoma and first-line renal cell in the U.S.","Looking at our international business, we continue to see growth across core indications and we are in the early days of launching and securing reimbursement for adjuvant melanoma. The strength of Yervoy in the U.S. continues to be driven by the uptake of the Opdivo-Yervoy regimen in renal cell and continued leadership of the regimen in metastatic melanoma. With these trends in mind, we feel really good about our competitive position and expect that Opdivo will deliver growth in 2019.","Also contributing to the strong commercial execution was Eliquis which during the quarter became the #1 OAC in the U.S. in total prescriptions. While Eliquis TRx volume was up 36% versus prior-year, it's important to remember that the impact of coverage gap is most pronounced in the third quarter, and when compared to our second quarter, net sales were reduced by roughly $100 million. Also impacting sales was an inventory reduction of approximately $50 million.","We believe that Eliquis' profile and leading market position will be further strengthened by compelling real-world data such as the Ester Foney (10:17) study shared at ACC earlier this year; and with warfarin TRx share at roughly 35% in the U.S. we believe Eliquis has significant headroom for further growth as the leading agent in the expanding NOAC class.","Now I'd like to highlight a number of items from our non-GAAP P&L. As I mentioned back in July, we are beginning to see a moderating of the impact of product mix on our gross margin. Regarding OpEx, we remain disciplined in order to facilitate differential investment behind R&D. As you know, we tend to see a natural phasing of investment towards the final quarter of the year.","As I previously mentioned, other income and expense has increased mainly due to royalties from our diabetes alliance and PD-1 products. And finally, with regard to our tax rate, favorability in the quarter was largely due to the release of a reserve from prior periods and the impact of U.S. Tax Reform.","With respect to capital allocation, and as Giovanni mentioned, we continued to view BD as a top priority. We maintain a very strong balance sheet that provides us significant financial flexibility and will evaluate opportunities on the basis of their strategic, scientific and financial fit.","I'll now move on to guidance. Based on strong sales trends and favorable product mix, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the high-single-digit range and gross margin as a percentage of revenue of approximately 71%. We now expect our effective tax rate to be roughly 17%. With these revisions, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.25; and as always, our guidance assumes current foreign exchange rates.","Now I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Giovanni, and thanks, Charlie. Vickie, I think we're ready to go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much, and I appreciate all the color. First on RCC, is it fair to assume that this is going to get an increasingly fragmented market? I fully appreciate your OS data in the high-risk patients. What is your, I guess, confidence about being able to protect that business given your survival data? That's the first question. And then, Tom, I'm just wondering if I could get your thoughts from Merck's anti-CTLA-4 data at ESMO. It looks to be active, seems to be better tolerated. I appreciate that the data is relatively small and early, but just wondering how you view that as a competitive risk for Yervoy. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Alex. Why don't we start with Chris on RCC, and then we'll move to Tom.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, Alex, thanks for the question. I think it's useful to step back and really level-set on the dynamics in renal cell even beyond Giovanni's opening comments. And so let me get at your question by sort of giving a little bit of perspective here. We've been in this market for a number of years. We know these physicians, they know us, they know our drugs, and we have a strong base book of business in renal cell. In second-line we're standard-of-care in most of our major markets and in many of those, including the United States, market share is at or north of 50%. So that's the second-line business.","As we look at the first-line setting, share is currently in the 30% to 35% range which, you may know, we've achieved in roughly six weeks post-approval, and as was pointed out at ESMO, both from the podium as well as with the customers we spoke with, Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy is and should continue to be standard-of-care in the U.S.","So I think if you step back and ask yourself, why have we achieved that level of success, I think there are a couple of things at play. First, we have a very good profile with Opdivo plus Yervoy. We have OS demonstrated both with a compelling median as well as compelling two-year landmark data. We've got deep and durable responses and as I think we talked about previously, durability is really important not just in this market, but also in other tumors. We have a manageable safety profile, and Opdivo plus Yervoy has demonstrated an improvement in patient quality of life in this setting, so that's important as well.","Now with respect to the competitor news that we've seen, I think you're right, in the long-term you will see a much more fragmented market, but a couple of things are true. First, we need to see the data coming from Merck, and we look forward to seeing that at an upcoming conference. But with comparison to the data that we saw at ESMO, we continue to believe that Opdivo plus Yervoy has a very competitive profile. We're compelling on overall survival, we're compelling on complete response rates and we're compelling with respect to the safety profile and quality of life. Now, how the competitive data evolves, we'll have to see but based on what we've seen so far, we feel very good about the competitive profile of Opdivo plus Yervoy in renal cell.","The second thing we feel very good about is the ability of our team to compete in this market. I actually ran the U.S. business when we launched in the second-line setting. That was a market that was dominated by TKIs. We not only introduced I-O, but we made it standard-of-care. That same dynamic has played out in the first-line setting and I feel very good about our team's ability to continue to compete in this space.","So net-net, this is a very dynamic environment. There are things that we don't yet know but if I step back and think about the things we do know, we've been promoting in this space for almost three years. We have a very competitive profile, and the teams are executing exceptionally well, and I have every expectation they will continue to do so.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Alex, thank you for comment, your question, on CTLA-4. So let me just say a couple of things. I'm not going to comment directly on Merck's drug, I think it's probably better for them to do that. What I will tell you is a couple things about CTLA-4. I think CTLA-4 is a very important target. It's been something that we've been extremely proud of at Bristol-Myers Squibb in terms of how we have pursued this target. Let's just think about what we've learned about CTLA-4. We have shown, as Chris just told you, we've shown that we are able to improve outcomes dramatically in renal and in melanoma and we've made major improvements in the outcome of taking care of patients in those settings.","The durability of response that we see with Opdivo and Yervoy together is something that, again, we're very proud of and I think it's made a big difference for patients, and not only in renal cell and melanoma, but if you look at MSI colon cancer, if you look at bladder cancer, if you look at small-cell lung cancer, if you look at non-small-cell lung cancer, those are all areas where we have shown evidence that CTLA-4 plus Opdivo can make a difference. I think those are all very important to keep in mind.","I think also something that Chris said that I think is extremely important to emphasize is when you look at patient-reported outcomes, and we've looked at patient-reported outcomes in our non-small-cell studies, we find that the patient-reported outcomes for patients treated with a combination of Opdivo-Yervoy can be superior to those for patients treated with a chemotherapy backbone. So I think that CTLA-4 remains a very important target.","We also think that when you give CTLA-4 in the doses that we're giving it in renal cell and non-small-cell it is very well-tolerated. In addition, we're continuing to develop new ways of targeting CTLA-4. For example, we have a CTLA-4 Probody that we're developing with CytomX. This is an agent which we think will preferentially get into tumors and will be able to possibly modulate some of the peripheral immune-related events and accentuate some of the anti-tumor events. We also have a (18:10) formulation of CTLA-4. Both of these drugs are in Phase I. Both of these drugs we expect to have some readouts in 2019. So CTLA-4 is a very important target for Bristol-Myers Squibb and one we look forward to presenting additional data for in the next coming year.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Alex, for the question. Can we go to the next one please, Vickie?","Operator","Yes, we'll now go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Giovanni, I very much appreciate your opening comments, they were helpful, but I can't help to think that Bristol-Meyers feels like the company is in a similar situation it was in two years ago after the failure of CheckMate -026 and clearly the big bet the company made in exploring Ipi-Nivo in frontline lung hasn't materialized exactly the way it was expected and while we still await the outcome of chemo combo, it's looking less and less likely that Bristol will have a meaningful role in the frontline lung market. You might disagree, and I'd like to hear that.","But how are you hedging your bets against what clearly was supposed to be one of the most important growth drivers of the company? Is there more of an urgency to explore M&A options or other strategic initiatives that change the company narrative, and can we read into the fact that you did not announce a share buyback program today like Merck did, even though your stock is at a 52-week low, that you're likely to do something in M&A relatively soon? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Jami. So let me answer your two questions. First of all on our oncology strategy. If you step back, I believe it is fair to say that from the beginning, a really important core pillar of our strategy has been to focus on I-O\/I-O combinations as a way of replacing standard-of-care where appropriate. And, what I would say, is that in some areas, this strategy has been very successful, because when you look at melanoma, when you look at renal cell and potentially other tumors in the future, first of all we've established new standards of care and second, we've made Yervoy into a really important medicine for patients and an important product for the company.","I think it's also important to recognize that as data has matured, that has shown the value of combining Immuno-Oncology agents and specifically Opdivo, with existing standards-of-care like chemotherapy and some targeted agents, we have broadened our scope to include combination strategies, including chemotherapy which is currently ongoing across multiple types of tumors, and where appropriate, with targeted agents like TKIs, which is for example, the case in the work we are doing in renal cell, so our strategy has broadened and the clinical trials that we've designed over the last few years has reflected a broader approach to Immuno-Oncology.","With respect to your question about capital allocation, as I said in my prepared remarks, we continue to think about business development as a really important driver. As I said it's one I'm really focused on personally, and as part of that, I would say, we've demonstrated to also have a fairly balanced capital allocation strategy. We've been committed to the dividend for a long time and we've increased it year-over-year multiple times. In the past, we've executed meaningful share repurchases programs where we've felt it was the right thing to do, maybe more opportunistically. And again as I said, a core pillar of our strategy is business development which is really linked to my priority to continue to diversify the business.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Jami. Vickie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. Next is Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to come back to the comment about the importance of TMB. As we think about next year, CheckMate 9LA, in lieu of some of the more recent updates, is that a patient population you plan on selecting for in the primary analysis? Just trying to get a sense of how you're prioritizing TMB. And, then my second question, just on TYK2. Can you comment the trials on CT.gov obviously don't list the dose strengths and the dosing regimens but can you at least confirm that these are the dose strengths that got PASI 75 scores that were roughly 2x the active compare that you're going to be studying against? Thanks.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jason, thank you. So a couple of ways of approaching it. The first one just to talk about TMB. I think as Giovanni said in the very beginning, TMB is a great example of how we are following the science, that helps us understand how drugs work well in immuno-oncology and I think that's a very important pillar to how R&D is done at Bristol-Myers Squibb. I think that as you've seen, we have introduced the measurement of TMB in a number of our different studies. In 9LA, we have required collection, or attempted collection, for TMB from patient samples but we don't stratify based on TMB in study 9LA. I think that's really important to keep that in mind. So, I think TMB will continue to play an important role.","I think we look forward to seeing the interaction of TMB with a number of different biomarkers as we move forward, and I think that 9LA will be a dataset that will hopefully give us that opportunity for looking at that, but of course that's not 'til sometime next year.","Think your second question on TYK2 is a very good question, and I think one that is an area that we think is extremely exciting to us. As you know, Jason, TYK2 is very unique as a molecule in that it hits both the IL-1223 axis as well as the Type 1 interferon axis; and it's an oral compound. And what's interesting is the way this was done, and again it's a real testament to the discovery chemists at Bristol-Myers Squibb under the leadership of Carla Chico, what they were able to do is actually target the pseudo kinase. So we don't end up with the JAK-type side effects that you see with some of the JAK inhibitors. So it's got a unique mechanism of action which we think is going to lead to a favorable side effect profile, and of course we only have one large Phase 2 study. So, it's going to take more time before we understand fully how the drug is going to be used. At this point we have not disclosed the dose that's being used, for competitive reasons, but we do think we have two very well-designed trials that will unlock the potential for this drug in psoriasis.","Now in addition, Jason, I think it's important to remember, TYK2 is a drug we're not developing \u2013 we're developing not just for psoriasis, but we also have active studies in psoriatic arthritis, we're moving into inflammatory bowel disease, and we also think it's important to think that lupus is an area that could be important. Now I know lupus has been an area of very difficult in the area of drug development and drug design, but we do think because of the Type 1 interferon interaction of TYK2 that it's an area that we really should be looking at with this drug as well.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jason, let me just go back to your first question for a second, and I just want to make sure to clarify that as we think about TMB being an important element of many of our studies going forward, you shouldn't be thinking about that as being a primary endpoint in future studies. It's one of the areas we are exploring and that's clearly the case for 9LA.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Jason. Can we go to the next question please, Vickie?","Operator","Next is Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Wolfe Research, LLC","Thank you. A couple of Opdivo questions. Investors are starting to question what sort of OS hazard ratio you might show with part 2 of 227 relative to the big hazard ratio number out of KEYNOTE-189; and I'm really only talking about the non-squamous segment where you can make an appropriate side-by-side comparison to 189.","To me it seems pretty improbable that most trials are going to show a hazard ratio as good as what was shown in 189, but to me that also doesn't render your program irrelevant in first-line depending on what that number is. So the question here is really, what sort of hazard ratio do you think you need to show in the non-squamous population such that institutions that are currently using Opdivo in second-line lung or other tumor types say, hey that's good enough, it continues to support that the PD-1s are probably in reality all the same.","And then the second question is beyond 2019, of course everyone is asking whether Opdivo goes ex-growth in that period, so you're only confirming 2019. So any sort of comfort you can give us about the beyond 2019 outlook, and if not today, when might we get such guidance?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, Tim, thanks for the questions. Let me start with your second question about the outlook. As I said in my remarks, we're just coming out of three very strong quarters for Opdivo and for the company in general, with good momentum commercially across-the-board. And I feel pretty good about this year. I've made comments about the fact that we see Opdivo having, being a growth brand in 2019 based on the currently approved indications. With respect to more guidance on 2019, we'll do that in January as we always do, but as I said earlier, I feel pretty good about the momentum in the business. Now let me ask Tom to answer the first part of your first question, and then Chris will give you some comments as well.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Tim, thank you for your question. I'd say a couple things. One is we obviously look forward to seeing the results of our chemo combo studies, both part two of 227 and 9LA. As you know those are event-driven and we look forward to seeing those when they occur and we're predicting that's going to be some time in 2019.","I'd say one thing about hazard ratios. I practiced oncology for 28 years. Never once, never once, did I ever mention the word hazard ratio to a patient. It was never anything I ever spoke to a patient. It's not a factor in patient selection. What patients care about is the regimen or is the given approach, something that's going to give them a chance at being cured or living longer with their disease. So I tend to think what really matters when you've got a profile such as what we see in immuno-oncology, it's really the duration, depth and durability of treatment that's so important. So I think things like landmark analysis, two year, three year, four years survival \u2013 one of the things we are most proud of when we were at ESMO this year was presenting our four-year data in melanoma. We're starting to see landmark analysis at four years with Opdivo-Yervoy which is really quite impressive in that setting. And, so for me, looking at the durability and duration of response is really something that I think that doctors are going to focus on and that we're going to be looking at from a research standpoint. Chris?","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, the only thing I would add to that is when we talk to customers, interestingly both in academia as well as in the community setting we hear a very similar story about landmark and the importance of landmark. Very few physicians talk to patients about hazard ratios and I think that's absolutely going to be critical. The other thing I would say just from a commercial standpoint is that lung cancer is a space that we know exceptionally well. It's an area that we've obviously had success competing in and I think we'll be ready from a competitive standpoint to compete depending upon the opportunities that we have going forward.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Tim. Can we go to the next question, Vickie, please?","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Maybe first Opdivo in second-line lung. Can you just give us an update on the trends you're seeing and the overall size of second-line for the PD-1's now that we've had a bit more time to see KEYTRUDA ramp in frontline? So basically how do we see that market evolving? What percent of patients do you think are still going to be seeing a PD-1 second-line? And then probably more importantly, is there any change from your prior views here? My second question was coming back to TMB. How are you interpreting what seemed to be very different PFS versus OS trends that we saw for the TMB high versus low populations in 227? And I guess does that update change at all your confidence in TMB and its predictive power as a biomarker and if not, why not? Thank you.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Let me take the first part of that question, Chris. So market dynamics in second-line are pretty much as we have been discussing for the last couple of quarters. Our market share in second-line is stable at roughly 30%. In terms of patient eligibility, these dynamics are very much in line with what we have been forecasting. We have seen a continued gradual decline in second-line eligibility since the approval of PD-1 agents both as monotherapy and in combination in the frontline setting. That continues to be more gradual outside the U.S. just given the timing of approvals. In the U.S. we think that roughly 50% of patients are eligible for I-O in the second-line and we still believe that that's going to level out somewhere in the range of 40% to 45%, consistent with what we said previously.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks. And, Chris, let me just take a second to explain a little bit about TMB and what you saw happen over the past week or two since we \u2013 or week since we reported the interactions with the authorities. So let's think back to TMB. So how did we get to TMB? We got to TMB because we were looking for a scientific reason to understand or explain how our I-O drugs work in cancer, in cancer in general and in lung cancer specifically. And as you know, TMB can be a surrogate marker for increased number of new antigens or possibly even increase specific neoantigens that could be driving the immune response and I think both of those are potential reasons that TMB can identify patient groups that could do better.","So we designed prospectively to look at 227 Part 1 for patients who had high TMB and our initial look showed that the high TMB group in reaction to Opdivo-Yervoy had an increased response rate, a clearly improved progression-free survival and then a descriptive statistic, remember because the survival was not in the hierarchy statistically evaluated, a descriptive statistic that showed a survival advantage for those patients treated with Opdivo-Yervoy in that setting. We were very happy to see that result, and we shared those with the authorities and you know those resulted in submissions both in the United States and in Europe.","At the specific request of the European Agency, they specifically asked us to look at survival in the TMB-low patients. And of course, I've been asked by many people over the past three or four days at ESMO, why didn't you look at that initially. And the reason we didn't look at that initially is we want to be very careful to protect the integrity of the survival in all parts of the trial, and that's why we did not look at that the first time around. But when we did look at it in response to the European Agency, we found that there was this overall survival trend again favoring the group treated with Opdivo-Yervoy in that setting.","So what can you conclude from this data? I think the first is that TMB clearly, high TMB clearly is predictive for a response rate and PFS in an important group of patients and those are important endpoints and that's what the trial was designed prospectively to show. However, we also probably can conclude that TMB at least is in part prognostic as well to a certain degree. And we know that not just from the data we generated, but from the data that some of our competitors have generated and when you look back at some of the academic studies like the LACE meta-analysis of resected lung cancers, you find higher TMB patients do better. But I think one thing that's important, Chris, to look at is that if you look at the overall survival and response rate and progression-free survival magnitude of benefit, it's definitely higher and better in the group that has high TMB, again attesting to this depth, durability and duration of benefit in that patient population.","But I also think it's important, Chris, to remind everyone that we're still early in the process. We will continue to follow the science and we'll continue to work to try to understand how to use TMB and how to use TMB in relation to other biomarkers as we understand better how to treat lung cancer.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Chris. Vickie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","The next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe first, if we can get a bit more granular on Opdivo sales breakdown today and if you fast forward three years, what indications lose, how much and what indications gain and how much. It would be really helpful given all the investor questions on this topic, first. And secondly, just wanted to get a bit more color on 9LA as it relates to the thought process behind changing the sample size as well as the criteria on when a patient should be discontinuing from therapy or not, depending on the progression. Will that be consistent with how 227 did it or are there any changes? Thank you very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Umer. So, Chris, why don't you start describing the distribution of our business today and some of the growth into next year and then Tom can answer on 9LA.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, Umer, thanks for the question. So let me start by just giving you the distribution of business as it sits today. So in the U.S., lung is about 35% of our business for Opdivo, renal is roughly around 20% and then 30% of that is going to be in melanoma and then the remainder will be spread across other tumors. Ex-U.S., you will see a difference based mainly on a different set of indications that you have ex-U.S. versus in the U.S. So, outside of the U.S., lung is a larger percentage, it's about 60% outside of the U.S., renal is around 20% and then we've got 20% in melanoma.","A couple of things to keep in mind is this is going to be dynamic over time. So for example, in the U.S., you have a larger percentage of the business in renal cell, that's a result of obviously the frontline indication. Adjuvant melanoma plays an important role in the U.S., that's just launching outside of the U.S. So what you're going to likely see is a continued diversification of the business in the U.S. You'll likely see the percentage of the business in lung cancer outside of the U.S. continue to decrease as we get more business in other markets like adjuvant melanoma.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And I think, Umer, just to address your question on 9LA. I think, a couple things, let's think about 9LA, and why it was designed. It was really designed to bring the very best of immuno-oncology along with chemotherapy. And the benefit of chemotherapy is that if there are patients who are early progressors, chemotherapy can help address that plus there's theoretically \u2013 it's a possibility that could you be generating more neoantigens or uncovering neoantigens that could help to stimulate and drive an immune response.","So what we thought when we designed 9LA was it also gave us an opportunity to look at maybe just using two cycles of chemotherapy as opposed to four cycles of chemotherapy, and we thought that might also give us an ability to reduce some of the chemotherapy related side effects in patients while still maintaining the benefits that we see.","As you know this trial accrues very, very quickly and so when we saw the rate of accrual we realized that by adding an extra couple of hundred patients to 9LA, we were going to be able to increase our optionality with looking at specific biomarkers. And that really was what drove the desire, it was accruing very, very fast, and it was really following on 227 where we had engaged a number of great centers throughout the world. And so we thought that 9LA, increasing the accrual at that point made sense. And so that really is the reason that we increased the size of that trial. Thanks.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Umer. Can we go to the next question, please, Vickie?","Operator","We'll go to Matthew Phipps with William Blair.","Matthew Phipps - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick ones, one you've recently presented data CheckMate-511 of different dosage of Nipi-Ivo (39:39) in melanoma, and saw a decrease in AEs there with similar overall survival. Do you plan on submitting that to regulators? And then also I don't know what you can really say on this, but CheckMate-459 has kind of had continued delays in readout there, and I realize it's an event-driven study. But can you also walk us through some of the other changes in the trial, and why that's taking so long?","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So let me just make a couple comments. We obviously know we don't comment on the interactions with regulators until we have firm communications from them. I will say that CheckMate-511 I think offers some flexibility and optionality to doctors, and gives them some guidance, and Chris may want to comment on his view of dosing particularly in melanoma globally in that setting.","What I'll say about CheckMate-459 is you know, Matthew, you kind of answered the question yourself there. It is an event-driven process, and we will have to wait until the number of events occur to be able to help us understand the dynamic in Hepatoma. We do believe that Opdivo is an active agent in this setting and we look forward to seeing how it compares to a TKI in this setting. And again, we look forward to sharing that data with you as soon as we have that data. It's just event-driven and it takes some time.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Matt, I'll just make a couple of comments on 511. We're encouraged to see the alternative dosing of Opdivo plus Yervoy. Overall, we think the data from the safety study is going to be important in providing physicians with some additional information on the benefit\/risk of the combination dosing. The implications commercially, we'll have to wait and see how physicians think about adopting this. It's obviously not something that's going to be promotional for us. We see a bit of low-dose Yervoy in metastatic melanoma now, and you certainly could see that increase over time, but we don't anticipate a wholesale shift in dosing based on what we're seeing so far.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, and let me just clarify that this is really a medical study to inform questions from physicians in practice. We do not have registrational intent with that trial.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Great. Thanks, Matt. Can we go to the next question, please, Vickie?","Operator","Next is Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thanks for the questions. Just a couple here for Tom. Tom, can you just update us on how you guys have stratified Part B of the 227 study by different PD-L1 levels? And how confident you are that this will successfully include PD-L1-high patients just given the risk of selection bias? And then the second question is just, it's my understanding that the Opdivo plus cabozantinib study is likely to complete in the first half of 2019. Can you just confirm the timing and how you think this study may distinguish itself from your own Opdivo plus Yervoy combination? Thanks.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So let's just say a couple things. I think what you meant by Part B, was actually part 2 of 227. As you know, that's an event-driven study, and when we enroll patients into that study we enroll patients with a broad histology and enrolled regardless of histology and regardless of PD-L1 status, and we'll look forward to seeing what that data shows when we have a chance to see that data when it matures.","In terms of the renal cell work as you know, we think that the approach of using Opdivo along with a TKI can be a very potentially interesting approach. With TKIs, and we saw data presented at ESMO this year with some of our competitors, and we've seen press releases from other competitors, TKIs have the advantage of having rapid early on response, and that's one of the reasons that we combined Opdivo with cabo and we think cabo is one of the best TKIs in renal cell carcinoma. And again, we look forward to seeing that study 9-ER watching that data mature as well.","I think, Seamus, you had suggested it might be early next year, I'm tending to think that's probably going to be a little bit later than that, but again as you know, it's event-driven and it's very difficult to be able to pin that down.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Seamus. Can we go to the next question, please, Vickie?","Operator","Next is Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Couple questions on Eliquis. First, do you see either an opportunity or a need to launch a second NDC code version for Eliquis under Medicare? And then second, in a world without rebates and without service fees, how much volume and market share risk do you see to Eliquis given quite how competitive that segment is? And then finally, just very quickly, can you share any details about planned interim analysis for the ongoing renal trial with cabozantinib?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Andrew, just a couple comments from me. So first of all, we currently don't have plans to launch additional Eliquis forms and second, I would say, we don't generally comment on interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials but let me just ask Chris to give you a perspective about Eliquis coverage and performance in a competitive access world.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, so thanks for the question. I mean, I think that what you see in the cardiovascular space is this is a class that has been and will continue to be targeted for increased utilization management. That said, we have a strong advantage which is that Eliquis is a differentiated product, that's important not only for physicians and patients but it's also been very important for payers. We have historically been able to demonstrate to payers superior performance for Eliquis both in terms of efficacy and with respect to reduction in bleed and the risk of stroke through real-world data in patient populations that are relevant to those payers.","And, so as a result of that, we've actually seen a strengthening of our access position. We've seen in particular strengthening of our access positions in part B plans year-over-year. That carries with it some gross-to-net exposure but we've an able to leverage that improved access really across both commercial Medicare and Medicaid channels and what you've seen is a continued growth in both the brand's share as well as revenue.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Andrew, for the question. Vickie, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","We'll go to Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, I have two questions. The first-line renal CHMP rejection of CheckMate-214 was now three months ago. Bristol had been expecting a quick hearing which did occur but also a quick resolution which has not. And, I'm just wondering, if anything has changed in the CHMP's eyes? And then secondly, Nektar-214 in lung cancer, when could we see the data, will another trial be needed and how does the deadline to start Phase III trials impact your decision? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Steve. Let me just ask the CHMP question on renal. What I can say is we are going through the procedure. Every one of those, as you know, there are many, every one of those has its own timing. There is really no comment at this point and our team are working with the European regulatory authorities on the application.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And, Steve, thanks for your question about Nektar-214 in lung cancer. So let me just start by saying a couple things. Why did we do Nektar-214 and why are we working so closely with our partners at Nektar? And I think what it comes down to is that when you look at immuno-oncology there are three validated mechanisms. You've got the PD-1 access, you've got CTLA-4 and you've got IL-2. And we think the opportunity to partner with Nektar to develop this agent, it's a pegylated form of IL-2, was a unique opportunity. And we worked very hard with them this year to put together a number of clinical trials to determine how to best use these agents in cancer.","So the PIVOT-02 study which is a study run by Nektar has shown some very interesting data, in terms of activity and certainly also in terms of safety profile. Because as you remember, the other premise with the pegylation process is that perhaps you may change the immuno-oncology-related, the I-O-related side effect profile by stimulating peripheral T-regs. And, of course, we need more time and more data to be certain of that but it's certainly an intriguing prospect to how one uses Nektar-214 in that setting.","So from PIVOT-02 we saw some data that certainly justified trials in renal cell cancer, in melanoma, and in bladder and you've seen the design of the melanoma study. And we continue to follow the cohorts from PIVOT-02 to determine which tumor types are going to be included next. And we're certainly looking very closely at lung cancer. I think one of the important things from our perspective is to make sure that the trials are done, they are the best trials that are going to be able to help us most understand how to use this drug, because it's early in the process of drug development and we want to make sure that we optimize its therapeutic potential.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks a lot, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please, Vickie?","Operator","Yes, we'll go to John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the results. First, on first-line renal. In the intermediate to high what percent of patients are in the intermediate to high area relative to where PD-1 plus Inlyta might be used? The second question has to do with Yervoy. There's an inflection obviously it may have increased use in Yervoy. Can you give a breakout of use by melanoma, renal, lung, MSI-high and other tumor types? And then last question on Eliquis. You indicated warfarin still 35% of volume. How low can that number go, especially since it's pretty extensively used in patients with heart valves, but how much lower can you go before you exhaust growth? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yes. Thank you, John. So, Chris, why don't you take the three parts of the question?","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So let's start with the renal question. So the renal question around the percentage of patients who are in an intermediate and poor prognosis patients is roughly 75% of that population. And by the way, in terms of our performance in frontline renal, we continue to see very good momentum in frontline renal; share as I mentioned is roughly 30% to 35%. We've got opportunities to continue to grow. There is sub-populations within our improved indication where we can continue to drive utilization and that's been the focus in frontline renal.","With respect to your question on warfarin. As you mention, we continue to see significant use of warfarin both in the U.S. and ex-U.S., U.S. warfarin still garners roughly 22% of new share in the U.S. and in terms of total share, it's roughly 35%. And if you look ex-U.S., you've got markets where warfarin is still upwards of 40% of utilization. So we believe we can continue to drive utilization of warfarin down. The key constraints on the use of warfarin in the U.S. are going to be things like familiarity with warfarin as well as price, but if you look at the efficacy profile as well as the safety profile of Eliquis, we have continued to believe that we can continue to take share, not only from other NOACs but also from warfarin.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And the other thing I would say, John, is I believe one of the reasons for our very, very strong performance with Eliquis has been the fact that we've been very disciplined in looking at different business opportunities over time and our first priority was to be the leading NOAC, then we moved on focusing on expanding against warfarin and that is ongoing and continues to have good potential. And then the third point is, I would say, is that there is clear opportunity for the total market to grow in terms of undiagnosed patients and poorly treated patients, and many of our countries where we are the most advanced with the warfarin erosion strategy are beginning to work \u2013 or market expansion opportunities which are important. As you said, Yervoy, melanoma and renal are really the two sources there. The rest of the use of Yervoy is very small.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, John. Vickie, I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","All right. We will take the next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. David, your line is open. We're unable to hear you. If you could please check your mute button. David?","I'm sorry. Hearing no response, we'll just go ahead and move on to the next question, and that will come from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So just two, both sort of higher-level; one following up on the earlier question around business development, and I know Giovanni said it's a priority and something you're personally focused on. I'm just trying to get a sense, I think the question was also related to the urgency and how you're feeling the urgency now relative to maybe a few quarters ago, how things have evolved for Opdivo and Yervoy is, has there been a change in the desire to pursue business development and especially in terms of size, maybe something bigger as opposed to something smaller to diversify the company?","And then the second one, would just love to get some updated thoughts from you on all the debate around drug pricing. I know we're going to hear more from the President later this afternoon but just maybe from a Bristol perspective, what are your expectations on what is likely to happen, what may be likely not to happen, and where should we focus as investors? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Vamil. So, a couple of things. Stepping back and going back to my comments at the beginning, when I think about where we are today as a company, there is very strong momentum in the business. We obviously operate in very competitive markets, which I acknowledge, and there is good momentum going into next year with a significant number of potential growth opportunities looking at the medium and long term.","In that context, business development has always been a priority for us and it is an important priority today and many of the lenses that we've put on the types of business development opportunities that we look at remain valid, scientific from the perspective of areas we know well where we can develop truly transformational science. They need to be strategically aligned with areas where we already have presence and expertise, and obviously it needs to make sense financially. So, there is a clear focus on BD, but I think the elements of that focus must be put in the context of a significant set of internal opportunities that have not really changed qualitatively in the past, as I said.","From a pricing perspective, my point of view is that we're very early and it's difficult to predict how many of the policies being discussed by the administration will evolve, both in terms of the policies themselves and the way they're implemented. From our perspective, what's important, it's a couple of things. It's important that patients continue to have access to medicines they need for very serious diseases. I think it is important to focus on policies that address the issue of patient out-of-pocket cost and affordability, which is really important to us. And the third very important thing is that as a company and as an industry, we are very open to dialogue with the administration in order to progress new policies forward in a way that really benefits patients. But it's difficult for me to comment on specifics because it's very early.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Vickie, can we go to our last question?","Operator","Yes. Our last question today will come from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good mornings, guys. Thanks for the question. Tom, on your strategy in I-O, you guys have optimized Nivo-Ipi combos and you've added many other doublets, including IL-2 to the mix, but it takes some time though to optimize these before Phase III. So, my question is, has your urgency or the hurdle rate to advancing these doublets changed over time? You look at targets like STING or OX40 and it may take a few years to figure out if they're even viable.","And then the last question, Tom or Giovanni, I wanted to get more color on the \u2013 more context on TMB and the regulatory review. Is it your sense that regulators need more validation or experience in the clinic for TMB? It doesn't appear to be a worry from KOLs, but is the science in your view mature enough for widespread use in the community? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Geoff, thank you. Let me just answer the second question first. I think we made quite a few comments on TMB and Chris can give you some perspective of what we hear from the market. We and prescribers and thought leaders, we're not going to comment on the ongoing interaction with regulators. Chris and then Tom can answer your question on next-generation combos.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, let me just give you a sense of what's happening with respect to the use of TMB and the interest in TMB at least based on what we're hearing. So, right now, TMB testing is around 15% if you look in frontline lung cancer, and there's been a slight uptick on that in the U.S., but that's a rough percentage of the patients who have been tested and have an evaluable TMB status.","As you think about the dynamics in the marketplace right now, what you were seeing is lung cancer is becoming a bit more of a segmented market. The interest in \u2013 and that's being driven in part by the interest in being able to have specific drugs targeted to specific patients. That's why, for example, you've seen such a rapid increase in PD-L1 testing in the frontline setting. It's also why you are seeing continued interest in TMB as a biomarker. We've seen that increase going back to AACR and certainly at ASCO.","It's also, I think, going to continue to be an important consideration for physicians because TMB is clearly telling us something about the prognosis for patients in this setting. And when you do TMB testing, you not only get the TMB results, but you also get a number of other biomarker-related data that could be informative of physician choice. And so, I think there is an organic uptick that you will continue to see an interest in and testing of TMB. But, obviously, we'll have to wait and see how that plays out as more data becomes available and as potentially you have products like Opdivo plus Yervoy, which could be an option for patients with high TMB. Tom?","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Chris, thank you and, Jeff, thanks for your questions. It's obviously something that we think a lot about, and gosh, we talk a lot about in terms of, how do we identify doublets and triplets and quadruplets even that can even make a difference. I'd say a couple things. The first is our field needs to continue to remain grounded in the science and what we're doing in Cambridge, we just recruited Emilyse (59:24) to join Saurabh Saha up in Cambridge to help look at why patients become resistant.","I think the concept of studying resistance is going to be extremely important in understanding which doublets make the most sense which combinations beyond CTLA-4 and PD-1 make the most sense. And I think that the other thing that we've learned is the importance of doing good randomized Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies where you've got a control arm so you can isolate the effect of the new drug. I think some good examples of that are what we're doing with CSF1R, in our relationship to be able to look at CSF1R in pancreatic cancer. And this is an area where we've got randomized Phase 2's that are going to be able to tell us and isolate the impact of the new agent that's being added, CCR-25 (01:00:09) being a great example of that as well.","I think, Geoff, your concept of urgency is extremely important. I think patients need options. When you look at \u2013 if we were looking at CCR-25 (01:00:20) and CSF1R, it's in pancreas, it's in colorectal cancer that's not MSI-high. These are areas that are screaming for innovation and where the market and patients are demanding new options. So I think your question about urgency is very well taken but at the end it's going to be fundamentally grounded in the science.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you. So, in closing, we had a good quarter with strong commercial performance, there's good momentum in the business, we discussed some of the opportunities for growth in 2019 and longer-term opportunities for growth.

LLC","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Bristol-Myers Squibb 2018 first quarter results conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Lauren, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call to discuss our Q1 results. With me this morning are Giovanni Caforio, Chief Executive Officer; Charlie Bancroft, Chief Financial Officer; Murdo Gordon, Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Lynch, our Chief Scientific Officer. Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks and obviously Tom and Murdo will be here for the Q&A.","Before I turn it over to Giovanni, let me read the Safe Harbor language. During this call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.","The forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.","We'll also be focusing our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.","Today we reported a strong first quarter, and I'm proud of the performance across the company. We delivered superior commercial execution in a competitive environment, made progress against significant growth opportunities in oncology, and continued to strengthen our diversified pipeline.","First, let me discuss AACR, which was an important meeting that highlighted the rapidly advancing science in I-O, which was very good news for patients.","I am proud of our teams and the important role we played in advancing the science with a new biomarker. I believe that personalized medicine will become increasingly important. And TMB has a role to play in helping to identify patients who can benefit from I-O-based treatments.","We see an important opportunity to deliver a chemo sparing option in a defined set of patients and are encouraged by the deep and durable responses seen in study CheckMate-227.","At the same time, I acknowledge the competitive dynamics coming out of AACR, which I'm sure we will discuss later.","I'm also proud of our commercial and scientific results this quarter. As I've said before, Eliquis and Opdivo are key franchises for the company and continue to deliver strong performance. Eliquis is well established as the leading NOAC and is now on track to overtake warfarin this year. Real world data is further characterizing the benefits of Eliquis. And we saw good results with ARISTOPHANES, a large real world study presented at ACC in March.","Opdivo delivered strong performance, maintaining leading shares across approved indications in melanoma, RCC, lung, and head and neck. Additionally, we are pleased with the launch trajectory in adjuvant melanoma and see continued growth for this indication going forward.","As I mentioned earlier this year, RCC is one of the significant billion-dollar-plus growth opportunities for Opdivo. And we are excited with the recent approval of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line RCC in the U.S. Anticipating this approval, the teams have been preparing and are ready to support a strong launch, building on our success in second line.","In addition, we secured FDA and EU approval for the four-week dosing regimen to improve convenience for patients using Opdivo. And we've seen significant interest in both academic settings and community oncologists.","We also received two Priority Reviews for Opdivo, as a third-line therapy for small cell lung cancer and in combination with Yervoy as a second-line treatment for adults with certain forms of metastatic colorectal cancer. These are important opportunities to potentially broaden the indications for Opdivo.","We continue to source the best science in oncology, both internally and externally. And we were active in strategic business development in the quarter.","In oncology, our collaboration with Nektar adds a third validated I-O pathway that has demonstrated a clinical benefit for patients. We look forward to new data at ASCO on this promising agent.","There were many scientific updates in the quarter. And I know you have questions about the recent developments with IDO. Based on the Incyte announcement as well as data from our own IDO program, we are rationalizing our overall IDO program, ensuring we prioritize resources across the portfolio. We can answer specific questions during our Q&A.","We also advanced our diversification strategy in the quarter, with good progress in our pipeline. First, our TYK2 inhibitor is advancing towards registrational studies, and we are planning to present data in psoriasis later this year.","We also announced an important collaboration with Janssen in the area of thrombosis. We look forward to working with Janssen to develop and commercializing new treatments from thrombotic disease based on our growing understanding of Factor XIa.","In closing, the company had a strong quarter, where we delivered excellent commercial performance, broadened our Opdivo business, and brought forward innovative science that positions us well for the future.","I am confident in our strategy and the many significant growth opportunities we have with Eliquis and Opdivo, where we look forward to important data readouts from Phase III studies in lung, liver, gastric, and head and neck cancers in the next 12 to 18 months.","I'm also excited with the progress we are seeing across the disease areas in our pipeline, with important medicines advancing in development to support our long-term sustainable growth.","Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Charlie.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning, everyone. As Giovanni just described, we delivered very strong financial results during the quarter, driven by robust performance across our key brands. Our prioritized brands were up 21%, driven by strong performance for Opdivo and Eliquis. In the quarter, we also had a 4% benefit on revenues due to foreign exchange.","Starting with our I-O franchise. As Giovanni mentioned, our commercial organization continues to execute at a high level in intensely competitive markets.","During the quarter, sales of Opdivo were $1.5 billion, with growth driven by strong demand. Sales also benefited by approximately $40 million from stocking due to the launch of the 240 mg vial in the U.S.","While we continue to drive leading share across our key indication, we've also broadened our indication set, with second-line lung share remaining roughly stable, approximately 60% of U.S. sales now come from non-lung indications. We are seeing rapid uptake in new indications, such as adjuvant melanoma and strong enthusiasm for the launch of Opdivo and low dose Yervoy in first-line renal cell.","Outside the U.S., execution remains strong in markets such as Germany, France, Italy, and Japan. At this point, we've reached reimbursement coverage for major indications in almost all key markets. We are well positioned to expand our indication set internationally with new potentials approval for adjuvant melanoma and first-line RCC.","With respect to Yervoy, as we discussed on our Q4 earnings call, we have seen pressure from the rapid uptake of Opdivo in adjuvant melanoma. Exiting the quarter, trends have begun to stabilize. And the outlook for the back half of the year remains positive, with continued leadership of the combination in first-line metastatic melanoma and the first-line RCC launch with low dose Yervoy.","Now turning to Eliquis, which delivered exceptional performance, as it further expanded its leadership position in the U.S. with over 52% share of total prescriptions in the NOAC market. Sequential sales in the U.S. were driven by a 10% increase in total scripts and from the positive effects of the lower Medicare coverage gap when compared to Q4 of last year.","Internationally, Eliquis sales grew 54%, as it continues to be the number one NOAC among cardiologists across a growing number of markets around the world. Eliquis has become the foundational product for stroke reduction in AFib and its best-in-class clinical profile supported by real-world data positions it for sustained growth and leadership.","Based on current script trends, we expect Eliquis to surpass warfarin later this year in TRx, an important milestone.","With respect to other products, Sprycel script trends remain steady despite competition from generic imatinib. Sales, however, were negatively impacted during the quarter by lower inventory and lower average net selling prices.","Now I'd like to highlight a few items from our non-GAAP P&L. In the quarter, gross margin was down approximately 460 basis points compared to the same time last year, primarily as a result of mix and to a lesser extent, foreign exchange.","With regard to expenses, we continue to drive efficiencies in MS&A while prioritizing our resources behind high value opportunities. As we've discussed, we expected other income and expense to increase this year with a step-up in the AZ royalty rate, restructuring of non-Amylin royalties, and the recognition of net pension benefits now recorded in other income.","In regard to our tax rate, there are a few items that are affecting our rate for the quarter and the expected range of 17% to 18% for the year. First, we have favorable jurisdictional earnings mix. And under the new tax code, we are seeing a lower than expected impact of U.S. taxes on foreign income as well as improved utilization of the Puerto Rico excise tax credit. Looking at the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, depending on mix and details on how the tax code evolves, it is possible that we could see slight additional rate improvement.","We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. Business development remains a top priority, as does our commitment to our dividend. We executed multiple strategic transactions that have the potential to advance our I-O and non-I-O portfolio of innovative agents. This includes a global clinical and commercial collaboration with Nektar as well as the collaboration with Illumina to develop and commercialize companion diagnostics for our oncology immunotherapies. Outside of I-O, we are excited to advance our Factor XIa program with J&J, which has the potential to bring this innovative agent to patients with thrombotic conditions.","I'll now provide some comments on guidance. Based on our strong performance, the tailwind on sales from FX, and revised outlook on our tax rate, we are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.35 to $3.45. As always, this range assumes current foreign exchange rates.","To close, we had a very strong quarter, marked by excellent commercial execution across our portfolio, and we continue to prioritize our resources in areas that deliver value. Our business is well positioned, and we continue to see a number of opportunities to drive growth going forward.","Now, I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Charlie and Giovanni. Lauren, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question, just two for me. First, just on Eliquis, obviously a strong quarter. And what we see in the market is about 2 percentage points of share conversion from warfarin every calendar quarter. So I'm just curious how you guys think about that trend. Do you think about it as relatively linear? Do you think there are any kind of gating factors that could slow that trend downward?","And then just my second question, as we head into ASCO, what should we expect in terms of the data of Opdivo-plus-chemo combination that you'll be presenting there? My understanding is that it's going to be descriptive analysis, not data that could enable you to at least file for approval on your chemo combo. But any clarity would be helpful. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Right. So, Jason, it's Murdo here. I'll answer your first question on Eliquis. We do see a fairly linear relationship on Eliquis prescription growth. We did see a bit of an uptick in the first quarter, related primarily to new access contracts and a strengthening of our U.S. access position. But if I look at our NOAC TRx shares, we're running at a 52% share. But our NBRx share is higher, running at around 59.7%. So that gives you a leading indicator that we'll continue to be able to grow our total prescription share in a relatively linear fashion.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And to comment on your question more specifically regarding warfarin, I would echo Murdo's comments as well. And when you look at the progression of the total NOAC market in terms of penetration of the opportunity, we continue to see growth there. And there as well, the NBRx's for NOACs in total are significantly higher than the TRx's for NOACs in total, which points to the opportunity for the market to continue to grow.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And, Jason, thanks for your question about ASCO. As you know, this is an extremely busy time in oncology. And just coming off of AACR, where we were very happy to present our data from CheckMate-227, which we think not only was statistically significant but very clinically meaningful with deep and durable responses across the PDL-1 spectrum in a chemo sparing regimen, something that we felt we presented well and established a potential important therapy in lung cancer.","What are we going to see at ASCO as the next step? I think to say a couple things, first, you're going to see some data on the Ib portion of the trial, which is the PD-L1 negative patients. And that will be the first chance really to begin to look at the I-O\/I-O combination of Opdivo\/Yervoy versus our chemo combo of Opdivo and chemotherapy in that setting, although it will be in mostly PD-L1 negatives. But it will be the first chance for us to get a sense of how TMB might work in this patient population. We look forward to seeing what that data looks like at the ASCO meeting.","I think also you'll see at ASCO some very interesting patient report outcomes data from the TMB population. Again, very eager to see what those show and if they can confirm many of the benefits that we believe are present in an I-O\/I-O regimen.","There will be an update of data from Nektar, from our Nektar collaboration. Look forward to that. Plus we have a very interesting neo-adjuvant paper in merkel cell and some more data in breast cancer. So we expect a very vigorous and interesting ASCO meeting.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","The only thing I would add is out of the AACR we saw a very nice increase in interest in TMB as a biomarker, having looked at recent market research from a number of community oncologists in the U.S. as well as academic oncologists. And the awareness of TMB has more than doubled to about half of physicians surveyed being aware. And then what's also exciting for us is they see real utility in the biomarker, with the vast majority of physicians interested in understanding TMB status of patients for treatment decision making.","So as Tom said, having more descriptive data coming out at ASCO in other subpopulations of patients and including comparison to PD-1 plus chemo, I think it's going to continue to drive that interest in TMB.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jason, thanks for the question. Lauren, can we go to the next one?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much. Can you just elaborate a little bit more about Opdivo in second-line lung and how you're thinking about dynamics going forward here in light of the KEYNOTE-189 results? I think a lot of the Street is just trying to get their hands around what type of impact you're expecting, how quickly that impact could play through.","And then maybe the second piece of that question was on the new indications. It's obviously a bigger piece of the business right now. But where do we stand with regards to adjuvant melanoma in terms of share? And then when we think about the launch dynamics around first-line renal, just talk a little bit there about how quick of uptake we should think relative to some of the prior indications you're seeing, et cetera, just as we try to balance those two dynamics against each other. Thank you.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Great, Chris. Just on second-line lung, we've seen very stable shares there, around 40% of second-line I-O-eligible patient population. Obviously, there is a bit of a contraction of that pool of patients, given the presence of PD-1 monotherapy and PD-1 plus chemo as a result of the KEYNOTE-021G approval. I think most of the expansion of that I-O treatment in the first-line population will impact the eligible pool in 2019. So I would expect our shares in second line to remain stable for this year.","As we go though beyond second-line lung, and we look at the indication performance across the rest of Opdivo, it's really very strong. I look at the Opdivo uptake in adjuvant. We're running between 40% and 50% share right now. It's been very good feedback.","And I would say the addition of our Q 4-week dosing to that indication, I think is a very compelling treatment option for adjuvant setting in melanoma. And it's getting very, very good feedback in the early days of this launch.","Moving beyond adjuvant in metastatic melanoma, we continue to have strong shares with the combination. And we're actually seeing some uptick in our BRAF mutant population, which has been a difficult part of the segment of the market to penetrate, but that's looking better.","In the renal launch, it's really early days. We just got our approval. And of course, there was no update to the NCCN Guidelines, so we really are starting from a low NPS, a low off label baseline. So I would expect fairly rapid evolution there. I would also say that we continue to do well in second-line renal at between a 50% and 60% share in that tumor type.","So renal will become a very important tumor for us, given that we have strong overall survival data with Opdivo plus a low dose of Yervoy. And just a little bit of a read-through on that for our first-line lung program is that we will generate a much broader experience base in the community oncology realm with about 80% of renal cell carcinoma treaters being first-line lung cancer treaters.","So this is a pretty important and pretty strategic approval for us, but nonetheless, very good. And our shares are stable and strong across the other indications that we have.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Chris. Can we go to the question, Lauren?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Giovanni, I have sort of a bigger picture question. Obviously post-AACR, the market reacted in such a way that I think was different from I think what you expected as you described the data from CheckMate-227. And I think investors are questioning sort of the overall growth profile of the company. Can you sort of level set expectations on whether or not Bristol is still a growth story?","And then maybe even more broadly, since it's I think still a bit unclear as to where Opdivo is going to be positioned in front-line lung, if it is \u2013 I think you believe there will be a place in the market for front-line lung, and we believe that as well. But if not, can Opdivo still be a franchise that grows, even if you're not a major participant in the front-line lung market? And I understand there are going to be some near term disruptions due to the second-line share declining next year.","But overall, when you think about new indications, new tumor types, is this a franchise that can grow? Because I know the market is sort of debating that right now. Many assuming no growth.","And then just my last question relates to operating expenses. I think about a year ago, you had guided to flat operating expenses. You gave guidance for 2018, but beyond 2018. And I'm wondering if that's changed at all. Does it make sense to increase R&D expenses? How are you thinking about that? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Sure. Jami, thank you. So let me cover the areas you asked about at a high level. First of all, as I've said in my remark, I acknowledge competitive dynamics in first-line lung cancer coming out of AACR.","But I want to be very clear, I continue to see BMS as a growth company. And I do see Opdivo as a growth franchise. And let me tell you why.","With respect to the company, I would point to three areas. The first one is very strong commercial execution and performance of our leading franchises today.","The second point is the opportunity for growth coming from the opportunity for Eliquis to continue to advance its leading position in the marketplace and a number of short term important catalysts with Opdivo. We mentioned before the number of clinical trials that we have, Phase III clinical trials running, and with potential readouts in the next 12 to 18 months, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, including small cell lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. These are all important events.","And then as we look at the medium and the long term, I'm quite excited that we have three agents now in our innovative medicines business, our TYK2 agent, for which we'll show psoriasis data later this year moving into Phase III; the FGF21 continuing to progress; and then the decision to move the Factor XIa together with Janssen into Phase II.","So when I look at the short term, the medium term, the long term, there are a number of really important catalysts in the company.","Nothing really has changed as far as the way we think about OpEx and the continued commitment to the management on OpEx. And at the same time, the investment in R&D. Let me ask Charlie to give you some more perspective about that.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Jami. I mean, as Giovanni said, strategically we continue to be committed to refocusing our resources on our highest priority opportunities. And if you look at last year and even this year's guidance, there's been really good management of our operating expenses with MS&A down, R&D up.","And at the same time, we continue to pursue opportunities to drive longer-term growth opportunities in recent deals like Nektar and last year, the Halozyme deal and many other BD opportunities that we have pursued. So strategically, we're very aligned of how we think about our commitment to really focus on those things that drive value.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. And, Jami, just to your question about the I-O franchise overall. I see really good expansion this year into the new indications that we've received. I really do feel that there will be a role to play, given the data that we're showing in first-line lung cancer.","We're hearing back from customers that the perception of Yervoy plus Opdivo having deep and durable responses, being a chemo sparing regimen, and just the ability to potentially improve the impact of these medicines on patients' lives in terms of side effects associated with therapy, those things are coming through from the early read, post the AACR.","Clearly it's going to be a challenge given the strength and position that our competitors will have, because they're a little earlier than we are. But I think the commercial and medical organizations of Bristol-Myers Squibb around the world have shown their ability to compete effectively, remain patient focused, and drive strong performance. And I'm very proud of what they've done so far, and I remain very optimistic of what they can do in the future.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Jami, for the question. Lauren, can we go to next one, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus really on CheckMate-227 today. And my first one is, do you think the duration of therapy \u2013 why do you think the duration of therapy has been so much less in your first-line lung studies versus Merck's? And do you think the use of RECIST for second scan confirmation has \u2013 instead of irRECIST has led to some of the duration differences we've seen?","And finally, when I look at CheckMate-227 broadly, it seems like Yervoy drove most of the benefit in TMB positive patients. And I wonder, have you or can you look at the Yervoy chemo Phase III trials you guys previously conducted in squams [squamous] to see if TMB was an important predictor in those trials as well? Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Umer, thank you for your question. I want to start of by addressing that and also alluding a little bit to some of \u2013 the point that Jami talked about earlier. I just want to emphasize that from an R&D standpoint how excited we are about the CheckMate-227 data. As Murdo mentioned, we are seeing deep and durable responses that are across the entire PD-L1 spectrum, regardless of PL-D1 expression, not dependent upon histology, and is chemotherapy sparing.","I also want to comment on something else that Murdo said, which is the importance of chemotherapy sparing from a patient perspective. And I've been asked a lot of questions about this actually over the past two weeks.","And when you think about how long, how hard we've tried to find ways of reducing chemotherapy side effects \u2013 fatigue, neuropathy, anemia, nephropathy, cognitive impairment, nausea, vomiting \u2013 all of these side effects are gone when you don't have a chemotherapy based regimen. So I think it's important to remember that there are things about a chemo-free regimen I think are really important.","So the second question \u2013 the second part of this is really thinking about some of your points on CheckMate-227. And one is the duration of therapy. And I did have the chance, Umer, to take a look at your note that you posted a couple days ago.","And I think what \u2013 in looking at this, I believe that the duration of therapy is actually very, very similar between the two trials. The reason being is that in the KEYNOTE-189 trial, duration of therapy was expressed as a mean exposure, a mean time of therapy. Whereas in our study, it was looked at a median. As you know, there's a difference. Mean is impacted by the long term folks, as oppposed to median, which is the 50% mark when looking at duration of therapy.","And when we look at our data for mean duration of therapy, it's nearly identical, 7.3 versus 7.6 months, something like that, very nearly identical to the Merck data. So I don't believe that there's a difference in duration of therapy.","In fact, when you look at the outcomes in the non-squamous patients, our median PFS compares very nicely at 8.5 months versus 7.7 months. And our one year overall survival in non-squamous also compares very nicely with what was seen in EMPOWER and what was seen in KEYNOTE-189.","You do mention the question of the RECIST criteria and that Merck used the immune-related RECIST criteria. We used the RECIST criteria. I would look at that as something which I think is highly unlikely to explain big differences in outcome, although it could explain very small and subtle changes I think. There's really no way to know that.","We are looking carefully at whether that could be one explanation for how data turns out. But it's not something that I think is likely to turn out to be a major explanatory factor.","And then finally on the question of Yervoy driving benefit, I think one of the things we feel really good about on the CheckMate-227 data is we think we have shown clear contribution of components. That both Opdivo and Yervoy are making a big difference in this setting. And I think the two drugs together are what's doing this.","You alluded to the fact that Yervoy was driving in the TMB positive. And I think that we certainly showed that in our data, and we also showed that this is true is across the PD-L1 spectrum of patients, both PD-L1 negative patients as well as patients who are PD-1 positive. So, thanks.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Umer, for the question. Lauren, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","We can't hear you, Andrew.","Operator","Mr. Baum, your line is open. Please check your mute function.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hello?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","There you go.","Andrew? Lauren, maybe we can go to the next question and if Andrew could log back in, we'll go right to...","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hello? Got it?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","There you go, Andrew.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","You got me?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","So sorry about that. This is to Tom. How excited do you remain about CheckMate-9LA, given the backdrop of KEYNOTE-189? And some explicit questions on CheckMate-9LA. Should we assume that you're going to be looking similar to CheckMate-227, PFS and TMB high and OS in PD-L1 expressors? Would you be losing blood or liquid TMB? Would you be looking \u2013 allowing archival samples?","And then separately, you mentioned that you're going to be prioritizing other assets aside from IDO. I think you used the word rationalization. Will there be a write-down associated with that, given the acquisition or licensing?","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Andrew, thanks for your question. And let's start talking a little bit about CheckMate-9LA. And one of the things I've said for the past year that I've been talking with you guys is that I really believe you're going to see the lung cancer market continued to segment, and we've seen that over the past year. We saw the establishment of PD-L1 as being an important biomarker in people who were very high, PD-L1 high groups. We certainly know the EGFR, ALK\/ROS story very nicely. And I think now you're seeing TMB also playing an important role in this setting in terms of being able to guide a precision approach to personalized medicine that makes a difference.","So as part of that, I do believe the chemo combo will play a role. I think the data we saw from KEYNOTE-189 makes me even more encouraged for what we're going to see in CheckMate-9LA. And there are reasons to believe that the chemo combo could have benefits. The idea that patients who are early progressors, patients who have visceral crisis, that might be a circumstance where giving some chemotherapy first could help stabilize the patient to allow a vigorous immune response that we see.","So from my perspective, I think the idea in CheckMate-9LA of two cycles of chemotherapy, which could minimize chemotherapy side effects, help with early progression, and still allow a vigorous immune response with what we believe is the best combination, the I-O\/I-O combination of Opdivo\/Yervoy, I think is a very attractive option in that setting.","Now we're not going to comment on the physical plan of CheckMate-9LA at this point. As you know, we have committed to collecting TMB in this patient population, and we look forward to seeing how TMB plays out in this patient population. We have announced that overall survival will be an important endpoint in CheckMate-9LA. But as you know, we do have optionality regarding and around that statistical plan as we move forward.","I think in light of your question about blood or liquid biopsies for TMB \u2013 or compared to biopsies with TMB, I think it's very timely. I was extremely excited this morning to see the approval of the foundation liquid biopsy \u2013 not the approval \u2013 the fact that it was given a Priority Review designation \u2013 Breakthrough designation of the liquid biopsy. I think that's a really great finding, particularly if you're committed to personalized medicine. It means that we're going to have eventually even more ways of assessing the genomics of a patient's cancer. So I look at that as being very positive.","We have a number of efforts to begin to correlate what we see in blood and liquid TMB versus what we see in biopsy specimens. I think I would be less than frank if I told you that that process was complete. I think that's an ongoing process as we begin to correlate this. But I have every reason to believe, Andrew, that it's going to move in the same direction in this setting.","Regarding archival samples, which was your last question for me, I think you're going to see the same \u2013 the patients will have samples within three months of diagnosis, which is similar to our other studies and most other studies now that are being done across the board. Regarding the capital question, I'll turn it to Charlie.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","I think, Andrew, your question regarding was the Flexus IDO. We treated that as an asset purchase at the time. So there is no \u2013 anything on our balance sheet regarding Flexus.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Andrew. Can we go to the next question please, Lauren?","Operator","Our next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, first one just for you, Tom, just very general high level on regulatory processes. One thing that we see happening quite frequently is a trial stops materially earlier, or you end up getting a Priority Review on an indication that the Street isn't anticipating or expecting. So what's actually going on between DSMBs and regulatory authorities and companies that are leading to trials stopping early, approved early? Just some general comments on that.","Second question just has to do with the market segmentation for Opdivo\/Yervoy, U.S., ex-U.S., for Murdo.","And then third question just has to do with Sprycel. We saw some Tasigna weakness from Novartis. We saw Sprycel weakness. Is this because of potentially Gleevec being very inexpensive, leading to higher discounts and rebates on Sprycel? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, John, thanks for your question. I'll start off with the regulatory questions at this point. Again, just to point out that we presented data at AACR. And most importantly, published this data in The New England Journal of Medicine, which we think is very strong, deep and durable responses, chemo sparing across the PD-L1 spectrum, and identifying really a new biomarker that helps advance the role of precision medicine.","As you know, John, we don't comment on our interactions with the FDA. We will certainly announce any acceptance of filings that occur for any assets that are in our portfolio.","I think the other point you raised about DSMBs and regulatory interactions and stopping early, as you know, John, these are all event-driven processes. And I know you folks are often surprised when data comes out. I can tell you the companies and the investigators are also surprised when the data comes out because we don't always know when the events are going to necessarily trigger data that justifies early stopping. So we obviously have in all of our trials, across our spectrum of studies, have DSMBs that are involved and early stopping rules. When they're triggered, we will certainly announce those to the market because we think that that's important. Murdo?","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, John. Just to address market segmentation, first off, in the U.S. by tumor type, what we're seeing is about 40% of our business coming from lung, the rest coming across our different tumors. For Yervoy, it's much smaller. Obviously it's off-label usage, so the vast majority of Yervoy is on-label in melanoma at roughly 85% to 90%.","Our European business segments a little bit differently. It's higher in lung at around 47% \u2013 48% in lung for Opdivo. RCC is about 16% \u2013 17%, and then the other indications play out. And that's mostly a function of timing for competition in addition to the fact that there was no European approval for chemotherapy plus PD-1, so really a very good balance in business and really nice growth across European markets.","And the one market that's a little bit different is Japan, because of our Ono partnership. But we also have a gastric approval there, which is going very well. And we're seeing nice uptake in that indication.","From a Sprycel perspective, it's really just a market volume story. There are a lot of \u2013 there's a reduction in overall prescription going in the market. Our shares, though, are stable at roughly 24% of the market. And we continue to see good demand growth.","There's really no significant dynamic between Gleevec or generic imatinib versus the second line. And of course we continue to lead in the branded component of the CML [chronic myeloid leukemia] market.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, John. Lauren, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. Just have a couple. Post-AACR, what differences have you guys seen or would you expect to see in the receptivity to TMB testing? And I'm talking between KOLs versus the community setting. And does this differ, you think, versus European positions?","And then on the CheckMate-227 filing, is there a follow-up period when you look at OS or say duration of response that would change your confidence in approvability? I know with -021G, data did in fact improve over time on OS. But CheckMate-227, obviously bigger and more mature relatively. Thank you.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, thank you, Geoff. Just to your first question, post-AACR, I have to say I'm pleased with what we're hearing back from both academic and community oncologists. I referenced earlier in the call some market research that we got back in house. We've seen unaided awareness of TMB go from roughly 20% pre-AACR to roughly 50% post-AACR. And that's on TMB as an emerging biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer.","So that's a really good signal. So there was a lot of noise out of AACR that helped raise awareness of the importance of TMB.","We drilled into understanding whether or not physicians believe that TMB is equally or as important as PD-L1. And over 50% of physicians agreed that that was the case. So we're in good shape I think on the data attracting the interest of both academic oncologists and community oncologists as a useful biomarker for front-line lung.","I think when you go internationally, we're seeing similar interest, more so there with the thought leader community. But that is where the majority of patients are treated when you go internationally. They tend to be treated in a hospital setting with the exception perhaps of Japan and Germany.","And what we're also doing internationally is we're working very actively in partnerships with the biomarker companies to make TMB testing widely available. And each market is a little bit different. We work with the academic centers, who are already developing tests for TMB. And we obviously work with different commercial partners to do that as well.","So I'm optimistic that TMB is starting to become much more interesting to the treating community.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Geoff, regarding your second question on the CheckMate-227 filing. Again, as we just mentioned to John, I'm not going to comment on the actual regulatory status.","However, the second part of that \u2013 second part of your question I think is really important. And I would say that that really is the magic question that you just asked. Because really that's what we're waiting for is, we shared with you at AACR our overall survival data. Okay? Which again, looks very promising. It's early, but it looks very promising.","Now, when you couple that with the duration of response data that we showed, we haven't even hit our median duration of response. And I like the way that curve looks in terms of duration of response.","Now the real question is, does that increased duration of response correlate into improvements in overall survival? I hope it does. We don't know. That's why we do trials. If you knew the answer of a trial, you wouldn't do it. And you wouldn't do the trial. So I eagerly await to see that data.","But seeing that fact that we haven't hit the median duration of response, and seeing that particularly if you look in the nonsquamous patients, the one year survival mark for CheckMate-227, KEYNOTE-189, EMPOWER, all is about 70%. If an I-O\/I-O combination truly has better duration of response, as we have seen in other tumor types, then that could be encouraging.","But again until we actually see the overall survival data, it's really just conjecture at this point. But thanks for the question.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Geoff. Lauren, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. The focus of a lot of folks is usually the battle between chemo combo and CTLA-4 combo. But Roche is trying to introduce bevacizumab or Avastin into the mix. And obviously they have data from their front-line trial.","So my question to you is, what's Bristol's view on the role of bevacizumab as a potential combination agent in something like front-line lung? Is that something that you guys are considering exploring? Do you think there's a valid mechanistic role to consider there?","And the second question is \u2013 and I think you may have kind of answered this already, but just to clarify. The trajectory of Opdivo, can you say with confidence that really there will be no periods in which there's any year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter declines when you think about all the pushes and pulls? Whether that's on a quarterly basis or an annual basis in 2018 and beyond?","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Tim, I'll start with the question about bevacizumab and then turn it over to Murdo.","I'd say a couple things. First, bevacizumab plays a role in a small, increasingly small number of patients with lung cancer.","I was intrigued by the data, the post-TKI data. Maybe that would have a role, the post-TKI setting. And eager to see how that pans out.","But I think that for the majority of patients, I haven't yet \u2013 I don't think we have a data set that's enough to be conclusive about what the role of bevacizumab would be in contributing to outcome for a more broad patient population. Murdo?","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, I would just say that the usage there is very low today. And without being able to describe a very specific patient population, it seems to be benefiting disproportionately. I'm not hearing a lot of enthusiasm from treating physicians on that regimen.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tim, obviously, we're not going to \u2013 and we don't provide guidance on individual brands quarterly or on a yearly basis. This is a large franchise, which is continuing to diversify with strong performance across many of its segments.","And what I've discussed before is a couple of things. First of all, we do see Opdivo as a growing franchise. And second, I acknowledge the competitive dynamics in first-line lung cancer.","At the same time, we are very focused on a significant number of growth catalysts we have, including a large program in first-line lung cancer and a number of other tumors with a lot of data reading out in the next 12 to 18 months.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Tim. Lauren, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Phipps with William Blair.","Matthew Phipps - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking my questions. First, in the CheckMate-227 trial, there was about 60% \u2013 just under 60% of patients you had enough sample for TMB. Obviously, that was kind of looking back and happen to find the samples. But what do you think is a realistic number for the patients who you can successfully get enough sample for TMB analysis?","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Matt, thanks for your question. I would say \u2013 and again, as you point out, the 60% that were valuable reflected patients where we weren't collecting it for TMB in that setting. So I think that we were actually very happy that we were able to get 60% rate in that setting.","I think when you start collecting prospectively, I think what you're seeing is, I think that numbers close to 85% to 90% are not unreasonable to expect that.","And just think about how biomarkers have evolved. I mean just think about estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor. I know \u2013 I don't want to sound old school on you, but if you go back to the days when we started looking at ER and PR, there were times when we wouldn't have sufficient breast cancer tissue to be able to determine ER\/PR status.","And so as we understood how crucial that became in treating women's breast cancer, we made darn sure that we had enough tissue to be able to look at ER\/PR.","So I think that you're going to see docs, when they know that TMB is going to be evaluated, obtain slightly largely core biopsies. And I think that the success rate of the test, between 85% and 90%, is not \u2013 I think that's achievable. Take a little time to get there, but I think it's achievable.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Matt, for the question. Can we go to the next one, please, Lauren?","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. A couple for Murdo and one for Tom. Murdo, could you size the front-line RCC opportunity? And are there any barriers to rapid uptake you should let us know about?","More broadly on I-O pricing, or PD-1 and I-O pricing, Murdo, can you confirm that there are no pricing pressures or cost-containment themes playing out in the U.S. market in this space yet? And also comment on pricing dynamics in Europe and in Japan, since it's quite different there?","And lastly, Tom, more broadly, since taking over the CSO role, you've had a lot of I-O questions to answer and I'm sure there will be more. But can you talk more broadly about strategic \u2013 or strategies or priorities that you've changed in order to diversify the pipeline, while maximizing oncology at the same time? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Gregg. In the U.S., the front-line RCC treated patient population estimate is about 15,000 patients. In Europe, top five, also about 15,000. And in Japan, about 5,000.","Those numbers are roughly double the size of the second-line population, given the volume of patients that will progress into second line.","And just one thing to remember on RCC is progression is a little bit slower. It's a slower moving malignancy, so it will take more time for patients to progress out of front-line treatment into second line. So the impact on our second-line Opdivo business because of our own indication in front line, will take a while to evolve.","Then on pricing, I think it's fair to say there's always pricing pressure in all markets. But I think we've been very successful in securing good access, as was mentioned earlier by Charlie, across all major international markets. There have been price effects in Japan that are unique to Japan.","But I would say overall, we have done a very strong job, and the teams in each of these markets, to establish the value of Opdivo and the value of Opdivo plus Yervoy. We received one of the fastest NICE approvals ever for our O plus Y [Opdivo plus Yervoy] indication in metastatic melanoma from the UK.","The other thing I would say is we've incorporated patient reported outcomes into our clinical trials. And you see that in our first-line RCC data set. I think that will help us significantly across Europe. And of course we would plan to do that in other trials going forward.","And last but not least, as you look at the evolution of our pipeline, clearly we're going to be working with payers around the world to find good solutions, good value based contracts that allow us to treat patients at an affordable level going forward.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And so, Gregg, just to get to your question about my perspective on the first year as CSO and how we work to diversify.","When I came in last year, exactly a year ago on this call, I told you guys that we were going to focus on three areas. I said we're going to focus on following the biology of cancer, we're going to focus on investing in translational medicine, and I told you we're going to deepen our data and analytics approach. And I think we've done all three of those things this year.","And let's just focus on two of the areas. The first is on what we've done in translational medicine. We brought in Saurabh Saha to lead our TM Group. And look what we've accomplished just in this first year. The fact that we identified TMB as an important biomarker, and we're able to have the optionality and flexibility to be able to look at that in a large randomized trial and establish yet another biomarker in lung cancer, a very important accomplishment.","Second, the TM Group is working hard at looking at potential markers in immunoscience and inflammatory disease, in systemic lupus, and in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. So the impact that TM has had on the company has been extraordinary in the first year.","Second point, there's diversifying within I-O that I think is important. I think there are lots of ways of diversification. One is diversifying within I-O. So what do I mean by that? Well, two important BD opportunities. The first was the acquisition of IFM and obtaining the NLRP3 molecule and the STING molecule, very exciting to see those move into clinical development. And that resulted from the fact that our discovery team, led by Carl Decicco, looked at the innate immune system and figured that's an area we need to be in. And we again follow the biology to be able to deepen our portfolio as we move forward.","Next is Nektar. There are three validated I-O mechanisms that have been shown to improve survival in cancer, PD-1, CTLA-4, IL-2. Bristol-Myers now has all three of these in clinical development. And we could not be more proud of our relationship with Nektar and very eager to see what that data continues to evolve.","But then there's also diversification outside of I-O. And I think there are some great examples that Giovanni mentioned in his talk. And we've advanced this area in the past year, first, TYK2. TYK2 is a compound that has a very broad range of targets, multiple targets within the immune system. And we've seen some very exciting data in rheumatology, in psoriasis that we look forward to seeing presented at an upcoming derm meeting.","RORgamma t has been advanced as well as FGF21. And then you saw our relationship that was disclosed with Janssen. I'm very excited about Factor XIa, a compound which could be even more effective than the Eliquis compound and other drugs that we have right now.","Again, these drugs take a little bit longer time to develop. But again, I think it shows that we're positioned for continued drug development success in the years to come.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Gregg. Can we go to the next question, please, Lauren?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple things I want to get clarification on, non-CheckMate-227 related. So one, on the four-week dosing approvals in the U.S. and EU, it looks like it was a difference there, where the European Commission only approved F4, melanoma and renal, whereas the U.S. approval is much broader. Maybe if you can, just talk about the differences between those two approvals.","And then on the small-cell lung cancer side, it gets overlooked sometimes with all the focus on non-small-cell, but you mentioned the filing for Opdivo monotherapy was recently accepted. But the press release didn't comment on the combination Opdivo\/Yervoy, even though that was also in the CheckMate-032 study. So can you maybe just comment on where things stand on getting the combination potentially approved? Do we have to wait for the CheckMate-451 data, or is there something else that we're waiting for there? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So thanks for your question. I'll approach the two questions. The first regarding the 4-week dosing, we're very happy about this because we think it gives doctors tremendous flexibility and patients flexibility as we move forward. And I think what you're seeing is we're very happy that in the U.S. that it's very broad. And the fact that renal and melanoma were accomplished in Europe, we think is a real good start in that process. And we look forward to developing additional data as time moves forward.","Regarding small-cell, you did notice that our filing was accepted for monotherapy. We also have data coming out this year in earlier stages of small-cell, late this year, early next year, that we look forward to seeing, one in the maintenance setting and one in extensive stage disease up front. So we look forward to seeing that data evolve and our own small-cell also evolve. And again, we continue to develop combination data in small-cell. It's just a little bit behind the non-small-cell in terms of the evolution of that data. But again, no lack of confidence that this could be an important pathway in small-cell as well.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And, Vamil, I would only add that there's very good interest in Europe as we've seen in the U.S. in having a 4-week dosing available. The two steps you have to take is you have to establish your flat dosing regimen, and then you establish the 4-week dosing. So that's why it's a little more staggered in Europe on some of those other indications. But we anticipate being able to secure 4-week across the portfolio. So we're looking forward to that as a competitive advantage in the market.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks. Lauren, I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. So I have a few questions. First, could you comment on whether CheckMate-227 can potentially yield statistically significant OS data in TMB high, or is that not possible to show any statistical significance, since in the hierarchal analysis, the first cut on PFS failed to show Opdivo monotherapy superiority?","Second, with respect to chemo combo for Opdivo, so looking ahead. Could you just provide some color on when we will see all comers' data for the chemo combo? Will that not be until the CheckMate-9LA disclosure next year?","And then third, just a financial question, please. With respect to the $371 million alliance partner revenue in the first quarter, what was the Keytruda component of that? And how should we think about the sequential step up from $371 million into the second quarter of this year? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tom?","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, David, thank you for your questions. The first question regarding CheckMate-227 and survival, I think you're absolutely correct in what you just mentioned, which is that this will be a descriptive endpoint. And that's because of where it sat in the hierarchy of fiscal analysis.","So you are completely right. This will yield a descriptive analysis of overall survival, even the TMB high population. And again, we look forward to seeing that data mature with time as we move forward.","Second question is regarding when you can expect to see data on the chemo combo. As I mentioned earlier, this is an area that we think will still play a role, an important role, as lung cancer continues to segment. As you remember, Part 2 of our study of CheckMate-227 has a chemo combo arm across a broad spectrum of patients.","We expect that data to be out \u2013 you know it's very difficult to know \u2013 probably in early 2019 at the best way to look at that. But again, it depends upon how that data matures.","And then CheckMate-9LA will be probably a little bit after that. Now, you will see some data on the chemo combo at ASCO this year, but that will be in the PD-L1 negatives. I think your question really focused more on the broader patient population. And unfortunately, that really is 2019 before we're going to have that information. Charlie?","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, David, on our Keytruda royalties, we book those actually in other income and expense. And for the quarter, we booked approximately $70 million related to Keytruda royalties, which compares about $30 million in Q1 of last year.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","David, thanks for the question. Can we go to our last question, please, Lauren.","Operator","Our final question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have two questions. First, for Giovanni, I understand you're not giving future guidance. But in prior periods of uncertainty, specifically 2013, the company gave thoughts on minimum earnings in a future year. In that regard, can you speak to earnings in 2019? Do you see earnings growing in 2019? Or is it simply too early to say?","And then a question for Charlie. Something important regarding U.S. tax reform seems to have either been clarified or learned in the last three months, leading to the downtick in the tax rate, in part. I realize there was other factors as well. But can you elaborate on the tax reform aspect of the downtick in earnings \u2013 in tax rate? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Steve, just very briefly on guidance. At this point, we are not providing guidance on 2019. It's clearly too early. And we are very focused on execution this year, as you've seen very good results and very good trends in the business. But premature to discuss guidance for 2019.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. So, Steve, on the U.S. tax reform. As you know, tax reform, which was approved at the very end of 2017 with no real simplification, it was actually on top of the current tax legislation. So there was a lot to work through to understand all of the implications.","As we mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call that we did see a benefit in our rate going forward. As we dug into the legislation, we found some of those opportunities as we have applied it to our particular business and were able to accelerate some of that.","So as far as the benefit related to what we originally guided, I would say about three-quarters is related to tax reform implementation versus just jurisdictional earnings mix.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, everyone. So in closing, let me just reaffirm, this was an important quarter with strong performance across the company. We continue to make progress against our strategy with a focus on transformational medicine.","And as I've had an opportunity to discuss with all of you during the call, I am confident in the significant growth opportunities we have as a company for the future. Thanks very much for your questions.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. That wraps up the call, Lauren. And everyone, thank you.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to John Elicker. Please go ahead, sir.","John E. Elicker","Thanks, Travis. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us to review our Q3 results. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. They'll both have prepared remarks. And then also joining are Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Operating Officer; and Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer, who will be here for Q&A.","So before I turn it over to Lamberto, I'll handle the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.","We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a very good third quarter. We delivered strong sales across our key brands. Revenues were $3.9 billion, a 7% increase over last year, excluding the Diabetes business that we still had in 2013. Equally important, throughout the quarter, we made significant progress in delivering our pipeline, with important clinical and regulatory milestones and several business development agreements.","With respect to Eliquis, the combined efforts of our sales, marketing and medical team contributed to its strong performance around the world this year. And approval for the VTE treatment in both the U.S. and Europe this quarter provide another strong platform for success. The strength of our data and our progress to date supports our continued high expectations for Eliquis.","With respect to hepatitis C, we have a clear opportunity in Japan where hepatitis C patients have had limited treatment options. We received approval for our dual, Daklinza+Sunvepra, Regimen in July and launched in September. This Dual Regimen, which was developed to meet the distinct need of a significant proportion of the Japanese patient population, has the potential to play a major role in curing HCV patients in that country. We are only at the beginning, but the initial performance indicators give us reason to be optimistic.","We are also off to a good start in Europe, where the European Commission approved Daklinza for use in combination with other products across multiple genotypes and where we have launched in Germany and a few other countries.","In the U.S., we have withdrawn our new drug application for asunaprevir while we continue to pursue FDA approval of Daklinza, focusing on distinct patient populations with unmet medical need. We look forward to presenting important data at the upcoming AASLD meeting in Boston.","And with respect to our immuno-oncology platform, we made important, commercial, clinical and regulatory advances in the quarter.","From a commercial perspective, Yervoy had best quarter ever with $350 million in sales, a significant increase over last year and continues to be a key treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. From a clinical and regulatory perspective, we reached a number of key milestones for Opdivo. We completed regulatory filings for melanoma in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., the FDA has granted us priority review and Breakthrough Therapy status. And in Europe, our Marketing Authorization Application has been granted an accelerated review.","The European Medicines Agency also recently validated our application for Opdivo in non-small cell lung cancer based on our -063 study. This month, we announced the early results from CheckMate -037, the first Phase III trial of a PD-1 inhibitor. And we are looking forward to presenting additional data for Opdivo in upcoming medical meetings, including lung cancer data later this month, next week in Chicago, the first demonstration of overall survival in melanoma in November at SMR and the first hematology data in December at ASH.","And finally, as you know, we have always considered business development being an important source of innovation for us. During the quarter, we finalized a number of new agreements both within immuno-oncology and in other therapeutic areas that are important for us. Charlie will describe them in a minute. Again, taken together, this was a very good quarter across the board, affirming the value and reinforcing the strength of our balanced approach, delivering strong results today while building a solid foundation for tomorrow.","And now I will turn the floor to Charlie.","Charles A. Bancroft","Thank you, Lamberto. Good morning, everyone. As Lamberto noted, we had a strong quarter. Our key brands did particularly well, with Eliquis, Yervoy, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL each posting double-digit sales growth versus the same period last year.","Let me provide a few highlights. Eliquis sales were $216 million. We saw continued strong growth during the quarter and have recently launched our new indication for VTE treatment in the U.S. and Europe. Our expectation is that the new indication will be an important catalyst for continued growth. While our focus will remain on cardiologists, the progress we've made in new-to-brand prescription share for AFib and the VTE indication should help as we expand more into primary care.","In the U.S., net sales for Eliquis were $113 million, up 20% sequentially from the second quarter. And AFib, our new-to-brand share among cardiologists, is now approaching 45%. Overall, Eliquis' total prescription volume and new-to-brand volume continues to grow faster than any other NOAC.","Outside the U.S., net sales were $103 million, up 34% from the second quarter.","Yervoy sales grew 47% to $350 million. Yervoy had its best quarter since launch and the recent weekly sales trends remain strong. U.S. sales were $191 million, up 47% from the same quarter last year and up 10% from the previous quarter. We continue to make significant gains in first-line use among immuno-oncologists as they become more comfortable treating patients with Yervoy. Sales outside the U.S. totaled $159 million, also up 47% over last year's quarter, and we continue to see strong demand growth in all key markets.","Both SPRYCEL and ORENCIA were strong, with sales increasing 22% and 18% respectively.","Certainly, the highlight in our virology business was the launch of our Dual Regimen in Japan and Daklinza in Europe for hepatitis C. We reported $49 million in sales during the quarter and early results are encouraging. In Japan, we are focused on the approximately 300,000 patients who are currently diagnosed, half of whom are being actively managed by a physician.","In Europe, we have launched in several markets and early trends are positive, particularly in Germany. We continue to face growing competitive pressure across our HIV franchise, including continued erosion for SUSTIVA due to generic competition in Europe.","Sales for BARACLUDE were down 14%, mostly due to the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. and softer demand in China. Due to the loss of BARACLUDE exclusivity in the U.S., we anticipate a negative EPS impact of about $0.06 for this year and $0.10 for 2015.","A couple of additional points on revenues in 2015. Included in the mature products category are revenues related to a few agreements entered into over the last several years. The structure of those transactions provide a revenue stream primarily through this year and we expect revenues will decline by approximately $400 million in 2015. On the other hand, we had previously expected loss of exclusivity on SUSTIVA in the U.S. in March of next year. While the resolution of patent litigation, we now expect that we will have exclusivity in the U.S. through 2017, which should more than offset the 2015 impact of the mature brand -- products I just mentioned.","I would like to spend a moment discussing some business development highlights. During the quarter, we announced several deals to strengthen our immuno-oncology portfolio. These collaborations with Janssen, Novartis, Celgene and MD Anderson, coupled with earlier deals with Incyte and Celldex among others, demonstrate our commitment to explore a full range of opportunities, including different combinations across multiple tumor types to help us realize the full potential of our immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer.","Now a few comments from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was up 240 basis points compared to the same period last year, mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our global Diabetes business.","Marketing, selling and admin expenses decreased 5% to $931 million as our increased investments in Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our HCV franchise were more than offset by reduced expenses in Diabetes.","Our tax rate was 24.2% during the quarter compared to 17.8% for the same period last year. The difference is due to earnings mix plus the expiration of the R&D tax credit, which has not yet been extended for 2014. As previously discussed, our quarterly tax rate will fluctuate due to changes in earnings mix.","Regarding guidance for 2014, we are confirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.70 to $1.80. Based on current trends and assumptions, it is likely that we will come in closer to the higher end of the range. Our guidance assumes current exchange rates and that the R&D tax credit will be extended by Congress in 2014. The only line item change in our guidance is the tax rate, which we now expect to be between 19% to 20%. The increase from previous guidance is driven by our earnings mix.","Now we'd be happy to address your questions.","John E. Elicker","Thanks, Charlie. And I just like to remind everybody that in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, both Giovanni and Francis are here to handle any questions you might have. Travis?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just a question as it specifically relates to thinking about kind of metrics in third-line lung cancer. Just hoping that you could give us a little bit of a rundown of Bristol's thoughts on the information that you have in terms of the 1-year survival metrics, 2-year survival metrics for the squamous non-small cell lung cancer patient population. And also as it relates to the CheckMate -017 study, any update on the timing of the readout and any sort of -- is it possible that the events are coming in more slowly and that this could slip out? Or do we still expect CheckMate -017, the interim look, to occur this quarter?","Francis M. Cuss","Good morning, Seamus. Thank you. It's Francis. First of all, let me take the -063 study. We're looking forward to presenting that data next week at the Thoracic Oncology meeting. The -- as you know, it's very difficult to compare across trials in this area because -063 is a highly pre-treated, third-plus line of therapy with no really other approved options or recommendations. But as we've looked at this roughly similar patient population, I would suggest the historical objective response rates in the low to mid-single digits. And you may recall, at ASCO this year, we presented an analysis of SEER registry of Medicare data that showed that perhaps less than 20%, in fact 18%, of the third-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients were actually alive after a year. Let me move on to CheckMate -017. As you commented, the timing of the analysis on this study is event-driven. And that means that patients -- the patient mortality will determine when we do the analysis. As we've seen in previous I-O studies, the mortality rate continues to slow down. Our present projection -- and of course, this is a projection, but our present projection is that we will trigger the -- or the Data Management Committee will trigger an analysis at the -- towards the end of the year. And I think it's just worth commenting that, of course, there will be some time, some weeks while they do their analysis. So we remain on track to -- with the present projections to have a year-end triggering of that analysis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregory B. Gilbert - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First, 2 quick ones for Charlie. Can you just -- sorry if we missed this, but the other income line, can you break that up between the interest and other stuff? And then on revenue guidance, is Daklinza the offset to the BARACLUDE generic hit that I'm pretty sure wasn't in your guidance previously? And then lastly, I just had a bigger-picture question about the anti-PD-1 space. Are there any observations you can make about Merck's go-to-market strategy so far that sort of shaped how you're thinking about your Opdivo go-to-market strategy?","Lamberto Andreotti","Giovanni, why don't you take the Merck question first and then Giovanni -- and Charlie will continue with the rest.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. Good morning. This is Giovanni. With respect to the question on go-to-market strategy, obviously, our go-to-market strategy for Opdivo will be informed primarily by the very large experience we have with Yervoy and the fact that we have developed a very innovative customer model. When we launched the Yervoy metastatic melanoma, we've developed a very significant experience in terms of the ability to educate physicians in immuno-oncology. So we are obviously looking at building on the very significant experience that we have with Yervoy and further developing our go-to-market strategy with Opdivo when we get approved. I'll just remind you that as a result of, clearly, the strength of the data, the survival advantage of Yervoy and the strategy we followed to educate physicians in the academic setting and the community for Yervoy, we continue to see very, very strong trends in both settings. It's really too early for us to comment on the launch of Keytruda, but as Charlie said, our recent weekly trends in terms of sales continue to be very strong.","Charles A. Bancroft","Yes. I mean, just quickly on -- Greg and you can follow up with John and his team on the details of the other income. Our interest income expense in the U.S., that specifically is relatively the same as it was in the third quarter of last year. And as we've commented before, the transaction services agreement that we have with AstraZeneca pretty much just starts to wind down significantly by the end of the third quarter. So we really won't see much further income from that TSA income on a go-forward basis.","Operator","The next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, Francis, for you. Are you still committed to initiating a Phase III combo lung study, Yervoy, nivo and lung? And at some point, will you show us the data from that -- I guess, it's your -012 trial that I would expect you would use to determine which combination or which strategy to go forward with that Phase III trial? And then secondly, do you think that -- is there a read across from the third-line squamous to the second-line trial that hopefully reads out by the end of this year? And if you could kind of confirm whether or not we will actually see overall survival with the third-line squamous study next week.","Francis M. Cuss","Good morning, Jami. Thank you. So first of all, let me talk about the -012 study, which as you recall is a multi-arm study looking at different combinations in lung cancer. It's still ongoing. It's still producing clinical data that's informing our design of our Phase III study in combination. We have sufficient information to complete the design and we're heading towards completing that by the end of the year. I can't actually comment at this point exactly on the design, but you will be able to read about it in clinicaltrials.gov when it gets posted probably at the beginning of next year. As far as the -012 data, we've not yet decided the venue or the timing of the 1-plus-1 data, for instance, although you may see some of the data from the Avastin, nivo study at the Thoracic Oncology Study -- Symposium next week. As far as the read-through between the third line and second line, I think I would say that it is difficult to compare across different patient populations. To repeat, the third-line Study -063 actually includes fourth-line and fifth-line patients, patients who are actually progressing as they went into the study. The second line is a less severe population, although it does really include all comers both in terms of PD-L1 positive and negative. So overall, as we get more data, we remain confident in the Yervoy, Opdivo lung combinations and we're looking forward to initiating the study. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Timothy Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A few questions, please. Just hoping to clarify on the interim look. So on the interim or any interim looks that will be done on -017 and -057, will you have access to what the data shows? Or will you otherwise be informed in any meaningful way of those findings, apart from if there were to be early stoppage? Or is that something that only the DMC and potentially FDA looks at? Second question is I think you and your competitors monitor each other's moves very closely in the PD-1 space. I'm hoping you can give us your thoughts on whether Roche and Merck might be able to file their own products for approval in lung in early '15, which seems like it could be possible. And then just a clarification on the nivo plus Yervoy combo trial, should we assume that, that will be in PD-L1 negative patients or in all comers?","Francis M. Cuss","Tim, good morning. So let me just talk first throughout the interim data look. A trigger for this is a predetermined number of events, as I've already mentioned, that is slowing down. This is something we've seen before with Yervoy. It's, of course, good for patients and it will trigger the Data Monitoring Committee to do the analysis. We -- even though this is an open study, it's blind to us. We have no access to the data unless it hits the stopping rules, as you say. As far as the moves of our competitors, I'm totally focused on our program and I clearly can't really comment on what they may do or what they may not do. And as far as the combination time line, I would just reiterate that we're looking to have that -- in this, the study design and preparation completed by the end of the year and you will be able to read the fine details of that when it's posted to clinicaltrials.gov presumably in that first quarter. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had 2 here. First, you've expressed some excitement about the opportunity for PD-1s in hematologic cancers and whether you're seeing some initial data at ASH. So I look at these markets, we're seeing a rapidly evolving standard of care. Can you just talk a little bit about where you see the PD-1s ultimately fitting into treatment paradigms here? And the second question was on tax. The company has always done a great job and has one of the lowest tax rates in the group. In light of all just the recent tax scrutiny that's been out there, can you just talk about how you're thinking about your tax rate over the next several years? I know that those double Irish stuff, et cetera, may not apply. But just generally speaking, how do you think about your tax rate over time?","Lamberto Andreotti","Charlie. And not an expected question on taxes.","Charles A. Bancroft","Okay. Backing up, thank you, Chris. As you know, we're not giving any guidance at this point on any particular line item. We're in the middle our budget process and we'll talk about our '15 tax rate in January in the normal cycle. I would say, overall, and I've said this before, that our tax rate is primarily influenced by earnings mix, but also there are onetime items and also very importantly, our tax planning opportunities which allowed us, as you pointed out, to have a fairly good tax rate compared to our peers. And these tax planning opportunities are something that we will continually assess. So until we get to January, I don't think there's more perspective I can provide you on the tax rate.","Lamberto Andreotti","You were talking about the Irish tax double.","Charles A. Bancroft","Yes, I mean, we don't have anything related to the Irish double tax.","Francis M. Cuss","Good morning, Chris. Let me first say that we were very happy to receive Breakthrough Designation for Hodgkin's lymphoma from the FDA and are looking forward to presenting that data and the non-Hodgkin's data at ASH in December. This is clearly in a late-stage group of patients and it's -- you'll have to wait and see what the data is. But I think there is good rationale as well as the data we have to start out at the late stage, but I think it will be potentially attractive because of the potential for long-term survival and the underlying biology of hematological tumors. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","3 questions, please. Firstly for Francis, regarding the -017 trial, should I assume that the early stopping rule for the interim has a similar p-value or confidence interval compared to that of the final analysis? It obviously depends which stopping rule you are using. Second, could you remind us when we should expect the first CD137 data? And then finally, could you update us, please, on the filing strategy and timing for Yervoy in the adjuvant melanoma setting?","Francis M. Cuss","Good morning, Andrew. So I'm not going to get into the detail of the stopping rules either for the interim or the final analysis. As far as the 137 Urelumab data is concerned, those trials are ongoing and we will -- haven't yet decided when and where we might present that data. Certainly, we're considering, for competitive reasons, perhaps not being as forthcoming as we might have done in the past. And let me just move to our plans for the adjuvant melanoma filing. As you know, the data we presented at ASCO in the -029 study was actually quite strong and we are having productive discussions with the FDA and plan to file the adjuvant melanoma data for regulatory approval. As we traditionally do, we'll provide further information when it's accepted by the FDA. But we believe that adjuvant melanoma is a significant area of unmet need and is an important part of our strategy in melanoma.","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes. And this is Giovanni. And obviously, from a commercial perspective, adjuvant melanoma is treated in many of the same academic institutions where we have established a really strong presence through Yervoy. As Francis mentioned, it's an area of very high unmet medical need. And as we think about preparing for a potential launch, obviously, our focus would be on subpopulations of patients at high risk where we believe that Yervoy can have a very, very meaningful role to play.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with the ISI Group.","[Technical Difficulty]","John E. Elicker","Wow. That's a first.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, guys. Can you hear me?","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes.","John E. Elicker","We got you, Mark.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I apologize for that, John. Francis, thanks for all the disclosures. This call has been clear. I really -- I just really appreciate that. If I may ask just one more question on the -017 trial, can you just clarify, I wasn't sure from your remarks, it sounds like you'll have the data in-house, interim data in-house, by the end of the year. Are you still certain that you'll have -- you'll be able to disclose something to investors by the end of the year? And if indeed the trial continues, due to the fact that this is an interim analysis, can you help us out, when do you believe roughly the final analysis would be triggered, please? And then actually, one question for Lamberto, if I might. Just the M&A environment has heated up and cooled down, et cetera. Can you just update us on Bristol's willingness to think about doing an M&A transaction that might be on the larger side? So something that's clearly not defined as a tuck-in.","Francis M. Cuss","Good morning, Mark. So thank you for that question. And I do want to clarify this. We will not have the data in-house unless the study stops. So this is -- this data analysis is triggered by the event and it's performed by the Data Monitoring Committee. It looks like from our projections and of course, they're still a projection because the mortality rate is slowing down, that we will trigger that analysis about the end of the year. Then of course, there's the time for the analysis beyond that. So there will not be a disclosure when the analysis is triggered, it will be if and when the study has stopped, when the analysis is done. And as far as the final analysis is concerned, I mean, it becomes even less certain in a way because obviously, it's still an event-driven study. So we would imagine towards the end of next year, but that is a very distant projection. Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","So about M&As. It is right. There's a lot going on outside there and our point of view has not changed. We continue to look at opportunities of acquiring products, technologies, pipelines in areas that are significant and key to us. We do not consider -- we have never considered inversions that -- as a goal for us because, as I said, we are interested in products and technologies. In terms of size, we are looking at opportunities of a different size. And we believe that we have the financial capacity to go to a large-size operation if we find the opportunity worth investigating. But we are also continuing to look at smaller opportunities and we have announced some and we will announce some more in the near future. Charlie, you want to add something here?","Charles A. Bancroft","No, I mean, I would only add that if you look at our track record, we haven't really done anything of size, but we've always said we are agnostic to the type of deal, structure of deal and size of deal, I mean, just to conclude with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ronak H. Shah - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is a Ronak filling in for Vamil. 2 quick questions. One is on the patent side. Can you give us an update on your litigation against Merck related to Opdivo? And what are the relevant milestones we should be watching then in the time frame for resolution? And then second, just to get a better sense of your strategy in first-line melanoma, have you seen the results of CheckMate -069 at this point and have had any discussions with regulators on that data? And if not, how do you plan to leverage that trial moving forward?","Giovanni Caforio","Very quickly on the IP, we believe in the strength of our IP's position. We will continue to defend it and there is nothing new to announce here. We made it clear that we are not going to block anything that could be negative for patients, but obviously, we are going to defend our intellectual property rights and we are going to do it here and in Europe and elsewhere.","Francis M. Cuss","Ronak, good morning. We do have the data analysis in-house for the -069 study and I'm encouraged by the data. We are working with investigators to determine the venue and timing of the presentation and publication. But I would say that it's premature to disclose any details of our regulatory strategy at this time. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I have a couple of questions. First, what I have down on the time line for the -057 non-squamous Phase III trial is that the completion is estimated on clinicaltrials.gov to occur next summer, yet, you were, I think, speaking previously about an interim look early next year. So my first question is could you update us on those 2 time line events? Second, can you explain why the interim look is so close to the conclusion of the trial? And then my second question is a little bit longer -- or my next question is a little bit longer one and it's about Yervoy. So there are sort of 2 views about the outlook for Yervoy in the near term. One view from an expert that we had hosted is that Yervoy use in the community may step up because patients have to fail Yervoy before going on to Keytruda and thus, maybe the use of Yervoy could step up in the near term. A different view is that the threshold to stop Yervoy may be lower than before for some patients because there's obviously an alternative. And so for a patient who is struggling with the side effects of Yervoy, they can drop the therapy at the first sign of toxicity and switch to Keytruda so Yervoy sales could decline in the near term. Could you please give us your view on which scenario is more likely over the next few quarters?","Francis M. Cuss","Good morning, Dave. So let me clarify exactly what's going with -057. It's very similar to -017 insofar as it's an event-driven study and that the event rate is slowing down, perhaps it's slowing down even more than -017. So there is an anomaly there. As I said, the -- we will -- we're projecting an interim analysis in the first half of next year and of course, it would not be rational to expect a final analysis in the middle of the year according to clinicaltrials.gov. So it's -- like -017, the final analysis will also project out further as well.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, Dave. This is Giovanni. With respect to your question on Yervoy melanoma, obviously, this is a very dynamic marketplace with some events happening and we believe significant developments going forward. I would start from our current position. So when you look at Yervoy today, we have very strong trends. Over 60% of our business in the community is in the community and that is the most rapidly growing segment today. 70% of our use is in the first-line setting. And so the first point is that, clearly, the role of Yervoy in metastatic melanoma is very well established across first and second line and in both the academic setting and the community setting. We are also, I must say, seeing not only very high penetration in BRAF wild-type, but we've also seen a very good increase in the use of Yervoy in the mutant segment in the last couple of quarters. We've always said that it is possible that in the short term, there is volatility in the use of Yervoy. But remember, that the -- that Keytruda is approved in a very specific patient population, in patients that have failed Yervoy and that was confirmed recently in the latest update of the NCCN guidelines. And obviously, we are very focused on the medium and the long term. And there, we continue to be very focused on the fact that combination use in the first-line setting can provide very, very strong hope for a patient's survival in the first year after the therapy started. So hopefully, that adds a little bit on our perspective there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have 3, if I may, first 2 for Charlie. How should we think about royalties for nivo in Japan? I see it's registering on your financials this quarter. Could this be a meaningful opportunity for you? And then looking ahead, how should we think about your margins longer term? Obviously, Eliquis will be a drag, given the partnership structure, but your product mix tends to be shifting towards more higher-margin products. And as immuno-oncology becomes a larger contributor, is it fair to expect significant margin expansion opportunity? And then the last one for Francis. Based on everything you've seen so far, is there anything to suggest that more advanced lung cancer patients are more likely to be PD-L1 positive because of prior treatments? And just to clarify, will we have 2-year OS data from the -063 study?","Francis M. Cuss","Yes. So thank you, Alex. So on the Ono collaboration, as we've disclosed in the last quarter, we are partnering -- Ono had the rights to nivo in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and we partnered with them with 3 of our earlier-stage compounds to form an alliance, whereby, where it's in combination, we will share equally between the 2 companies and where that it's used in as a single agent, that the lion's share will go to each partner in which they share the product. So that's the Ono collaboration. As it relates to gross margin going forward, as you point out, we have Eliquis, which is below 50% margin based upon the deal that we have with Pfizer. And the rest of our products are slightly higher than our overall corporate margin. So you have to really look at the overall mix of products going forward.","Francis M. Cuss","So Alex, let me just comment that we don't have the PD-L1 status in this patient population. There isn't any particular reason to consider they'd be more likely or less to be PD-L1 positive or not. Certainly, we've seen in other studies that we seem to have that representational proportion of PD-L1 positive patients that are the same and more or less across them. As far as the landmark data in terms of 1-year or 2-year, you will see in the abstract and it's presented, published next week, sixth-month data, but the presentation will be on the 1-month data, so...","Giovanni Caforio","1 year.","Francis M. Cuss","I'm sorry. The quantitative data. So 6 months in the abstract, 12 months in the presentation. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen and Company.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 3 questions. There is an expectation that Bristol's long-term multiyear tax rate will be high teens. In fact, I think Bristol may have actually said that at one point. If not, please correct me. But has that expectation changed? Second, to hit the top end of Bristol's 2014 guidance range, Q4 EPS needs to be only $0.42, that's down 18%, making it by far the worst quarter of 2014. Other than BARACLUDE, which also impacted Q3, I'm not sure why this would be the case. So can you amplify? And then the third question. Bristol competitors talk a lot about OX-40 and GITR, yet Bristol doesn't have any at least later-stage programs in these areas. Is that because Bristol simply hasn't come upon a good molecule? Is it due to IP? Or does Bristol question the value of the target? And if it's the latter, why is Bristol skeptical?","Charles A. Bancroft","Thanks, Steve. Charlie. So I'll answer the first 2 parts of your question. So in regard to tax, yes, we previously have stated that we expect the tax rate, not indefinitely, but over the medium term, to be in the high teens. Clearly, that's a function of the factors that I mentioned before, which is earnings mix. And we did see a little bit of up-skew towards higher product earnings in the higher tax rate areas, so that's impacted it slightly. The Diabetes business going away actually hurt the rate a little bit as well. But on average, looking at all the different factors that I mentioned, including our tax planning strategies, yes, I still feel in the medium term that that's a good barometer to use. As it relates to trends, vis-\u00e0-vis, how we are looking through the 3 quarters and then in the fourth quarter, a few things to recognize. The bullets of the BARACLUDE impact is going to happen in the fourth quarter, where also as I mentioned earlier, the Diabetes royalties, the way they're structured and the -- so we get a pretty good royalty on the first $500 million. We really don't get much as we get to the balance of this year. We also have the transaction services agreement with AstraZeneca, whereby that pretty much drops off in the fourth quarter. And then we do have commercial investments that we are continuing to make in the business around Yervoy as we begin the preparation for the launch of Opdivo, Eliquis DVT. And also as you look at the R&D spend through the 3 quarters and what we see in the back half of the year, we do see, particularly in regard to I-O, expanded patient enrollment continuation of new study starts, including several clinical collaborations exploring combination regimens. And then we do have some costs related to comparator-arm studies. So by and large, we do see an increase in our overall expenses from a trend-wise in the fourth quarter.","Francis M. Cuss","Steve, good morning. Let me just reemphasize that we totally believe that combinations of I-O agents will play a critical role in bringing this potential long-term survival to the broadest number of patients. And of course, you've seen that in terms of our Phase III starts and potentially data over the next 12 to 18 months. We've also got early development, 3 early development combinations ongoing and our last portfolio in discovery and actually in preclinical development. And I think, notably this year, we've -- as broad as that is, we have actually supplemented that with some collaborations, most notably the Five Prime, the Dana Farber. So yes, we are committed to bringing forward a broad portfolio of potential immuno-oncology combinations. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin Bristow - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe switch gears to hep C. Can you talk about how you see your triple regimen being competitively positioned, especially in line with treatment landscape that's moving towards shorter-duration regimens? And then as you're assessing the market opportunity, to what extent do you see price being a competitive lever for those competitors who lack clinical differentiation?","Francis M. Cuss","So thanks, Colin. We're reviewing the recent emerging clinical data from our 2 global 3DAA studies, which you recall is UNITY 1 and UNITY 2 and that those will be presented as soon as the upcoming AASLD the meeting and we'll be evaluating our regulatory strategy in the U.S. as well as other countries in the context of this very fast-moving environment.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. I would say to answer -- this is Giovanni. Good morning. To answer your question on our strategy and particularly with respect to pricing, a couple of comments there. The first one is from a strategic perspective, our priority remains to identify areas of unmet medical needs, of high unmet medical needs and develop regimens that address those. And as we've discussed before, obviously, that is different, depending on the region and the market. With respect to pricing, I -- our belief is that the value continues to be the primary driver in this market like in other markets. And so we are very focused on delivering regimens that deliver high value from a clinical perspective. But obviously, we are working in Europe, in Japan, in other geographies with payers to ensure we work in partner with them to ensure that our products are reimbursed.","Operator","The last question today will come from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners.","Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Francis, just one somewhat broad question again on Opdivo. Certainly, at ESMO, there was a great deal of discussion around the theme of PD-L1 positivity, but more importantly, around enriching populations or trials related to PD-L1 positivity. And as you think about the combination trial, which you said would be announced at least early next year in Clinical Trials, but also in other data sets, what's your view around enriching for PD-L1 positivity? Or do you dismiss that theme totally?","Francis M. Cuss","Tony, good morning. Our approach to this has been -- and I think let me just zoom out a little bit to our biomarker strategy. The -- our entire development program has incorporated biomarker testing, as you know. And we want to understand better not just the objective response rate, but also the linkage of PD-L1 positivity to the overall survival. So all our patients have tumors tested and PD-L1 positivity measured. It's clear that in some cases, PD-L1 -- there is a better response rate with PD-L1 positivity, but also both in monotherapy and particularly in combination therapy, we've seen that patients who are PD-L1 negative do get responses. And we do know that those patients, the PD-L1 negative patients, do contribute to overall survival. So our approach to this is to collect the data, to do the study and we'll look at the data and put together our regulatory submissions based on what that data shows. Thank you.","John E. Elicker","Thanks, Tony. And thanks, everybody, for your questions. Lamberto, any closing remarks?","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you very much, everybody. We had a very good third quarter, good in terms of financial results as well as clinical results and regulatory milestones and we are working actively at delivering good to further in 2014 and beyond.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Bristol-Myers Squibb 2016 third quarter earnings results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session. John Elicker, you may begin your conference.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Tiffany, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call to discuss our Q3 results and additional announcements that you've seen reflected in our press release. Joining me this morning are Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Both Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks. In addition, joining Giovanni and Charlie for the Q&A portion will be Murdo Gordon, who's our Chief Commercial Officer; Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer; and, given the likely discussion we'll have in the immuno-oncology space, we also have Fouad Namouni, our Head of Oncology Development.","Before we get started, I'll take care of the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change.","We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to talk about this morning. So I'll start by summarizing my views on the performance in the quarter and then turn to our guidance for 2016 and our thinking about 2017. I'll share some thoughts about our long-term strategy and then hand it over to Charlie to provide additional details about our performance and operations.","So to begin we just finished another very good quarter. Our business fundamentals are strong as evidenced by our commercial performance. We delivered $4.9 billion in revenues, a full 21% increase over the last year, thanks to good business trends across our portfolio. We made important regulatory advances with Opdivo. We see the positive advisory opinion for the treatment of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma in Europe. Our application for advanced bladder cancer has been accepted for priority review in the U.S. and validated in Europe. And, in the next few weeks, we expect to get a decision on our application for Opdivo for head and neck cancer in the U.S.","We had disappointing results from CheckMate -026. The results of these trials do not, however, change our strategy. We've applied learnings from the trial to our entire development program, and we are advancing a broad set of opportunities for Opdivo. We see an even more important role for combinations. Continue to be excited by the longer-term follow-up from study -012 and believe study -227 has the potential to bring real value to patients.","More generally, we remain fully confident in our Opdivo development program, which is both broad and promising, with data expected from eight potentially registrational trials over the next 12 months. And, based on our current assumptions for 2017, we expect Opdivo sales to grow globally as well as in the U.S. The trends are good, and we feel optimistic about Opdivo in both the short and the long term. In light of our overall strong company performance, we are increasing our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance to between $2.80 and $2.90. Based on our current assumptions, we expect 2017 non-GAAP EPS to be between $2.85 and $3.05.","Looking forward, I believe that we are very well-positioned for sustainable growth, which over the next three to five years will be driven primarily by Eliquis, Opdivo, and Yervoy. Beyond that, we expect our overall marketed products to continue to grow, and we are excited about our early-stage pipeline and the progress it is making. Our strategy continues to guide how we think about the future and our long-term growth, and we are always looking at how we can stay ahead of the curve. Over the past year, we have started work on an evolution of our operating model, in order to ensure we increasingly focus our resources on our highest priorities, both from an R&D perspective as well as commercially. So we continue to effectively deliver on the potential of our business. To be clear, this process was started early in 2016, and I discussed this with our employees in June. I am excited with the results of our work and confident we can be even more competitive while effectively managing our total expenses.","Let me say a little more. As a company that has continually evolved, we are committed to operating in a way that puts resources against our most critical priorities. Over the next 18 months, we will evolve our operating model in four areas. We will prioritize resources to focus even more on a core set of key brands and a core set of key markets, positioned to drive growth over time. For example, there are about 20 markets which are critical for us, and we will continue to invest to be very competitive commercially. We will continue investing in R&D to ensure a sustainable pipeline of transformational medicines. We are improving our capabilities in R&D to ensure speed, adaptability, and flexibility. We will focus on accelerating development and delivering of our most promising assets. As an example, our R&D spend will increase in 2017 versus 2016.","We have made significant progress optimizing our manufacturing network, and we've continued to evolve it in line with our portfolio. Biologics are now about 75% of our development portfolio, so we will continue to invest in our biologics capabilities, as evidenced by our recent investments in Devens and Cruiserath. At the same time, we will realign, streamline, and simplify our small-molecule supply network. We will have a more streamlined G&A, more strategically aligned to the focused way we will run our business. My expectation is that, with a more streamlined infrastructure, we will be a more focused and nimble company, better positioned to deliver in the short and long term, better equipped to deliver our transformational portfolio of medicines. And we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to remain flat at 2016 levels through 2020. While transforming our company, we will continue to drive strong R&D execution and commercial performance. We know the importance of operating on two fronts, today and tomorrow. And that is exactly what we've been doing.","And, finally, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, with a commitment to the dividend and business development as a priority. Importantly, our board has unanimously approved an incremental $3 billion share repurchase authorization, and Charlie will comment on this in his remarks. But before handing the floor over to him, I just want to underscore how personally excited I am about all we are doing to build our future. And as we set our sights on the future, we see even greater possibilities for Bristol-Myers Squibb.","So with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was indeed an outstanding quarter operationally for the company. And that is particularly evident when you look at our commercial performance. We saw solid growth from our key products, leading to 21% sales growth and an almost doubling of EPS compared to Q3 last year. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02. As Giovanni mentioned, we saw strong commercial execution in the quarter.","Let me provide some color. Opdivo demand remained strong. In the U.S., we recorded $712 million of sales, up 11% sequentially. Opdivo-based therapy has become established as standard of care in the U.S. across melanoma, renal cell, and second-line non-small-cell lung cancer. While our second-line lung business will be under some pressure, we believe we have opportunities for growth in renal, melanoma, and Hodgkin's, as well as future indications such as bladder and head and neck. In addition, over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see important read-outs for several tumor types that we believe will position the brand for further growth.","Outside the U.S., we recorded $208 million for Opdivo during the quarter. This does not include approximately $150 million of gross sales for France and Germany in the quarter, which are being deferred. The amount we will actually recognize depends on the final price in each country, and we do expect to reach an agreement for both later this year.","From an operational perspective, we continue to see strong adoption in markets where Opdivo has been launched. For example, we continue to see 70% to 80% of PD-1 share in France and Germany. We have also made good process this quarter securing reimbursement among key EU markets such as Denmark and Sweden.","Looking beyond Opdivo, we are particularly encouraged to see Yervoy return to growth during the quarter, with sales of $285 million, up over last year and sequentially. The quarter saw stabilized sales trends outside the U.S. and an increase in U.S. sales, driven by higher demand for the regimen in metastatic disease and adoption of Yervoy in the adjuvant setting. All of this is in addition to a favorable inventory build of about $26 million. While the regimen continues to do well in the U.S., we're also seeing increased adoption of the regimen internationally. For example, during the quarter, roughly 40% of first-line melanoma patients in Germany were receiving the regimen.","Let me now turn to Eliquis. We reported a strong quarter for Eliquis, with sales of $884 million, up 90% compared to the same period last year and up 14% compared with Q2. Not only does Eliquis continue to be the number one new-to-brand NOAC in the U.S. and other markets, but this quarter Eliquis has also emerged as the leader in NBRx in the U.S. for the broader oral anticoagulant market. With U.S. sales over $500 million this quarter, Eliquis has established a considerable lead in terms of new-to-brand share of AFib and VTE, with 51% share, compared with 42% for Xarelto. Outside the U.S., we also saw solid growth, with sales of $372 million, up 68% compared to last year. Eliquis is now the leading NOAC in new-to-brand scripts with cardiologists in six countries in the EU.","Our hep C portfolio delivered solid performance, with sales of $379 million in the quarter. However, as we expected, the U.S. business has been under pressure following the launch of Epclusa in June. U.S. sales were $192 million, which is down $100 million from Q2. We expect an additional step down in demand in the U.S. in January, when new formularies will likely prioritize Epclusa. As we saw with the rapid decline in our Japanese business, we expect an impact on the rest of our international business once access is secure for Epclusa.","Now, I'd like to highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin continues to be strongly influenced by mix. During the quarter, it was down 170 basis points compared to Q2. This is mainly due to strong sales of Eliquis and lower revenue from hep C. Given that we expect these trends in our product mix to persist, we would expect our gross margin to be impacted going forward. Other income and expense was up approximately $150 million versus prior year and continues to benefit from royalties we now receive on Erbitux. Based on our strong performance, we are adjusting upward our 2016 non-GAAP EPS guidance range. Our view on revenue is favorable given the trends we are seeing in the business. And, as I mentioned earlier, we view our gross margin to be slightly lower, primarily due to product mix, somewhat offset by FX.","Today we've provided 2017 guidance, which takes into account the current strong business trends that we expect will support continued earnings growth through next year. As Giovanni mentioned, our view on 2017 assumes continued growth of Opdivo, both internationally and in the U.S. As is our normal practice, we will provide full line-item guidance in January.","As we look to the future, we feel very confident about the company's opportunities for continued growth. We're not providing any guidance beyond 2017, but as Giovanni said, our strategy continues to guide how we think about our future. We see tremendous opportunities in our I-O pipeline and are advancing our specialty portfolio. We are committed to putting resources where we can deliver the greatest value. We are evolving the company's operating model and believe these changes will help drive the company's continued success in the near and long term. Giovanni mentioned that we expect non-GAAP OpEx to remain flat through 2020, but this is not across the board. Our focus is on prioritizing resources where we see the greatest opportunities. For example, we expect to increase our investment in R&D in 2017, but that requires us to prioritize and drive efficiencies in other areas.","I'll finish up on capital allocation. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocations and have significant financial flexibility given our strong balance sheet. Business development remains our top priority, and we have also demonstrated our commitment to the dividend, with seven consecutive years of increases. Our board has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase, providing for additional flexibility to buy back our shares. We hope to begin executing the 10b5-1 plan as soon as this year and expect to repurchase $200 million to $300 million per quarter. We believe this approach gives us the appropriate flexibility moving forward.","Now let me pass it back to John.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay, thanks, Giovanni and Charlie. Tiffany, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A. And, just to remind everybody, in addition to Giovanni and Charlie, Murdo, Francis and Fouad are here to answer any questions you might have. Tiffany?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. At ESMO, you hinted at a possible early filing strategy with the combination. And I'm wondering if you can share any more details on what this could entail? I think a lot of investors believe this could happen by packaging -012 and -568 together. Would this be the most likely route to early approval? And then on -227, lots of consideration whether that design and that trial will change, and I'm wondering when you'll have more to say on that. And on cut-offs for the different arms, is it possible you could have a different cut-off for monotherapy arm versus the combination arm?","Francis M. Cuss - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning, Tim. Let me confirm that we did say at ESMO that we had identified a potential approach for an earlier submission. We continue to look at that, but of course it's dependent on data and the agreement of the regulatory authorities, but I'm not going to say more about that for competitive reasons at this point.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning Tim, this is Fouad. For -227, it's a large Phase 3 study, and as we said, you can think of it to be two large Phase 3 studies in one protocol. We are looking at the non-expressers and the expressers, and the study is continuing to recruit, probably for the next two or three weeks in the expressers. And the size of the study will certainly be larger than what was planned initially. We will be obviously looking at these patients in the expresser group before the non-expresser, given timing of the recruitment. This study gives us a lot of optionalities in terms of looking at different cut-offs, looking at different times in the study, and looking at different endpoints in terms of PFS and overall survival. So we do have \u2013 we believe we do have a very good optionality in terms of how we think about the steps of the study and how we think about the timing of the endpoints.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, Tim let me just comment. While we do have an approach for the potential approval combination next year, that's not included in how we think about our 2017 guidance.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Tim. Tiffany, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one is just coming back to the 2017 guidance. What gives you confidence providing this EPS range when we've yet to see the rollout of Keytruda in first-line lung and what that could mean for Opdivo? And could you elaborate a little bit more on the assumptions that you're factoring into this preliminary guidance? I guess specifically what gives you confidence that Opdivo can grow in the U.S. next year? My second question is just coming back to -568. I believe several of your Opdivo indications have been either filed or approved based on single-arm Phase 2 studies \u2013 I think like Hodgkin's as an example. How do we think about, just maybe more broadly, indications that you would be able to file on Phase 2 data versus indications where you're going to need fully controlled studies? Is this the size of the indication? Is it the lack of a standard of care, existing therapies? Is it the strength of the data? I'm just trying to put in context what we need to think about to look at Phase 2 data versus the broader Phase 3 programs. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Chris, this is Giovanni. Let me start, and Murdo will give you some comments on assumptions regarding Opdivo for next year, and then maybe Francis can answer your third question on regulatory strategies.","When we think about 2017, obviously we look at the totality of our business. There are very strong trends for our business, as you saw in Q3. We see Eliquis continuing to grow and continue to make inroads in terms of market shares in the U.S. and internationally. We see continued strong performance from our in-line business with Orencia and Sprycel, and we do see strong momentum globally with Opdivo, which includes clearly the three big areas we look at when we look at our business: the international launches that are progressing extremely well, an expansion of our business across multiple indications in the U.S., and then obviously the lung business, which as Charlie said, will be under some pressure. When we look at the totality of those dynamics, we feel fairly confident in the ability of Opdivo to continue to grow, and in the outlook for the total business.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, Chris, maybe just a little bit more detail. When we think about where we are currently in lung, we feel obviously very good about performance to date, with roughly 60% to 70% share overall in all-comers in second line lung. Now, clearly we're going to have competitive pressure with both the approval of pembro in first line and the reduction of that population of I-O-treated patients from the eligible second-line pool. That will be somewhat rate-limited by testing. We do anticipate that there will be an acceleration in the testing rate, but there's still a slope to that curve, and while Merck will rapidly penetrate that patient population, there will be a certain cadence to how that will occur because of the testing rates. Testing rates right now are about 50%, and we have seen a slight acceleration in that rate more recently.","When we think about the second-line opportunity, we continue to feel very good about our profile on the basis of -017 and -057, but clearly second-line shares are going to be under pressure from the advent of Roche in the second-line setting. The one thing I'll just clarify is while Merck were able to secure a label update in second line at the greater than 1% cut-off, that information was included in NCCN Compendia for many, many months now. So that's not necessarily a new competitive event for us in second line.","Overall, some of the things that we continue to feel good about in second line are just our competitiveness from a share of voice, as well as the breadth of indications across Opdivo. So while we expect some share pressure in second-line and lung, other sources of growth are other indications, namely the advancement of the regimen in melanoma and that upwards of 40% share first-line melanoma across both types of patients, BRAF positive and mutant. Renal cell carcinoma, our business continues to do well there. We're hopeful we'll have a head and neck indication soon. And then next year, hopefully also bladder in the U.S.","As Giovanni mentioned, we're also very pleased with the expansion of our business outside the U.S., where the clear demand trends are very good post-reimbursement events. You can't see all that in our revenue. As Charlie mentioned, we're deferring sales in France and Germany in the quarter, but really our shares are upwards of 70% overall PD-1 dollar market outside of the U.S. So really we're feeling good about a very balanced growth portfolio in I-O. And last but not least \u2013 it was mentioned by Charlie \u2013 Yervoy has returned to growth in the U.S., and in both France and Germany, where we have the regimen reimbursed, we've seen very good evolution there, too.","Francis M. Cuss - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning, Chris. So let me reemphasize that we are working with regulatory authorities to find strategies to accelerate our regulatory submissions, whether it's optionality in Phase 3 studies or in the striking data in Phase 2 studies, depending on the circumstances.","Just to talk for a moment about CheckMate -568, just remind you that it's a single-arm study looking at the combination of Yervoy and Opdivo in first-line lung. The primary endpoint here is response rate, and it gives us a lot of flexibility to look when and how often we look at the data, and I think we see it as complementary to the CheckMate -012 data. It's particularly useful to provide some information on current and future medical practice, particularly with an I-O\/I-O combination. We believe it'll be helpful in characterizing the high response rates we saw in CheckMate -012. And, importantly, it's evaluating the same dose as we've got in CheckMate -227. And we may continue to use -568 to obtain additional data and answer additional questions going forward.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Francis.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Chris. Tiffany, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First for Giovanni. You talked about learnings from the study that failed. Can you be more specific on what learnings you have applied to the rest of your Opdivo development strategy? Of course without sharing any trade secrets. Would love to understand what that means. Longer term on your OpEx goal of flat in 2020 versus 2016, Charlie, can you talk about the theme there? Is it sort of continuously growing R&D offset by shrinking SG&A, and within that, have you already made decisions about geographies or therapeutic areas that you've decided to de-emphasize? I think it would be a pretty big feat to keep OpEx flat over that timeframe when you're viewed as sort of an optimized, pretty lean model already. Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Gregg, let me just start by going back for a second about the operating model transformation, and then I'll ask Fouad to comment on learnings from study -026 briefly.","As both Charlie and I mentioned, continuing to evolve the way we allocate resources in the company is really driven by the opportunities we see in the portfolio. As we've said in the past, when you look at the next three to five years, we have a great opportunity for growth, which is really driven by the performance of our immuno-oncology franchise with Opdivo and Yervoy and Eliquis as significant drivers of growth. So that opportunity is quite significant. It's really concentrated in terms of the therapeutic areas and also quite concentrated in the top 20 markets around the world. At the same time, we are advancing an early pipeline, which continues to make progress. In that pipeline as time advances, there are programs that are emerging as very high-potential programs. And we are ready to make the investment decisions needed in order to accelerate those programs as the data evolves.","As I commented earlier also, we do see a continued opportunity to streamline our G&A, to streamline our infrastructure, to look at our manufacturing network all the time, driven by our portfolio. So I see that we continue to have significant opportunities to allocate resources strategically between now and 2020, and we're quite confident in our ability to do that.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","The learnings from CheckMate -026 \u2013 and I would add also other PD-1 data we have seen recently \u2013 and we believe that it is important that for a program to be successful at improving survival in first line non-small-cell lung cancer in this case, requires the following items. Response rates need, really, to be high. Response rates need to be fast and deep. More importantly, responses must be durable over time. And based on the nature \u2013 and of course I would add safety is extremely important for the profile of the program.","Based on this and based on the nature of the data we have from Opdivo plus Yervoy and the long-term follow-up that we disclosed recently for the combination of these two agents and from CheckMate -012, we believe that CheckMate -227 has potential to fulfill this criteria. Specifically when you look at Yervoy, which is a Treg depleting agent, optimally spaced at every six weeks with Opdivo, this really becoming probably or potentially a solid backbone moving forward. We view this not only in lung cancer, but we view this combination of immunotherapy agents also working and active in a variety of cancer.","I would finish by saying that each time we added a CTLA-4 blockade with Yervoy to PD-1 Opdivo, we have seen the activity increase and almost doubling in a variety of cancer \u2013 and importantly, with a long durability of the effect.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Gregg. Tiffany, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Your line is open.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks very much for the question. So a few here. Maybe first, can you guys discuss a little bit of how the imbalances seen in CheckMate -026 might have occurred? So as you kind of go back and review the trial conduct, have you identified how the imbalances discussed previously occurred, and then how you hope to and plan to avoid this in the CheckMate -227 study?","The second question is more for Charlie. As of the end of this quarter, could you just update us on how much has actually been reserved for in France and Germany? I know you guys update that in the Q every quarter now. And just a follow-up to that is, should we assume that's booked this year based on your comments? And does the growth outlook for Opdivo assume that those sales booked are in the base as we think about growth year over year? Thanks.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","All right. So let me start with your question on the deferral. So in the quarter, between France and Germany, as I mentioned in my comments, Seamus, we deferred $150 million. Year-to-date it's $265 million. You can think back to Daklinza last year in France, where we also had a similar deferral issue, which we then ultimately booked. As we think about the growth year over year moving from 2016 into 2017, we do assume that the net revenue that we'll book for France and Germany will be in our 2016 results.","Francis M. Cuss - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning, Seamus. Essentially we believe that CheckMate -026 was unsuccessful as a result of the stratification at the 5% cut-off rather than the narrower patient selection at the higher cut-off of 50%. And in the event of this, this was compounded by unfavorable patient selection and imbalances, as you mentioned, particularly actually that exploratory 50% cut-off. Now, this is a view we \u2013 it's now supported by a number of lung and statistical experts we've consulted. And basically we agree with the opinion of Dr. Socinski, who's you'll recall the presenter of the CheckMate -026, that had the Keynote -024 design been used with Opdivo rather than Keytruda, the result would likely have been similar.","So as we shift our focus towards CheckMate -227, we're confident that not only the profile of Opdivo-Yervoy regimen, but the lessons we've learned from -026 \u2013 and I'll ask Fouad to give you some of those very specifics \u2013 when applied to -227 will actually allow for a much better chance of success.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Francis. Good morning, Seamus. Two things to see and understand in -227 varying from -026. So first and foremost, going in in -227 with the combination data is different level of activity that we have seen with monotherapy in -026. It's higher response rate, it's much longer PFS with a solid follow-up at this time and an improved safety profile from what we knew in the regimen before.","Actually, we allowed the study in the expresser to continue to recruit, and I said earlier, it's nearing probably two to three weeks' time before finishing the recruitment with a larger number of patients than initially planned, and we would expect in the three arms that the size will be nearly doubling what we have seen in CheckMate -026. So this in itself is important to correct for the imbalances, the way we look at it.","And I would add obviously one more thing that is different in -227 is we did not build in a crossover like we did in CheckMate -026. And as practical matter, it means the patients that have been randomized to chemotherapy can receive the appropriate standard of care, including PD-1 monotherapy, in second line as and where it is commercially available. However, it's important to note that patients will not receive the regimen of Opdivo-Yervoy when their tumor progress.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Seamus. Could we go to the next question, Tiffany?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a couple follow-up questions on the same topics. What has been the feedback you've gotten from physicians on the fact that Opdivo is infused every two weeks versus Keytruda and now Tecentriq every three weeks? I would think that the longer infusion requirements would be an advantage, particularly in Europe, where they have limited budgets. And I'm just curious to know what your thoughts on that is and how that's going to play out. Also just going back to Seamus' question. I think one of the other issues, too, with CheckMate -026 and Keynote -024 is that both trials were recruiting around the same time, and there was a lot of overlap in clinical trial sites. You guys ended up with the B patients; they got the A patients. Is that a risk with MYSTIC and CheckMate -227? I mean, obviously AstraZeneca's running their own I-O\/I-O trial. And what are you doing just to avoid that? I mean, you sort of answered it, but do you have any control over the recruitment of imbalances in patients? Because I think, again, that was something that kind of came as a surprise. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jami, it's Murdo. I'll answer the first question and then pass it over. Feedback from customers has been very positive, actually, on our dosing schedule. There are some customers, to your point, where infusion capacity is constrained, and we've actually seen that improve over time since the launch. So, for example, in the early launch phase in Germany, infusion capacity was somewhat constrained, but it has grown since. So the three week versus two week tends to be an issue that gets considered later in the treatment consideration. So the first consideration's obviously efficacy, where the profile of Opdivo is very strong across all histologies and across all types of PDL-1 expression. And then the other thing that's really influencing treatment decision-making is the breadth of indications that we are now developing for Opdivo. And then I would say the dosing cadence comes into consideration. I'd also stress that in the community setting in the United States in particular, the dosing interval of two week versus three week tends not to be an issue.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And hi, Jami, this is Fouad. Let me answer the second question around competing trial clinical sites, the same clinical sites, and what are the implications for our combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. Actually, sometimes we do have competing trials, and probably you have seen this when we did the monotherapy experiments. What we are seeing in CheckMate -227, is slight difference with -026, is a large number of clinical sites are outside of the United States. We are not concerned about competing trial given the population of patients we are recruiting and given the size. We think the recruitment is going well with -227. The profile of the program in terms of safety and experience of the investigator has been good, so we feel confident that -227 is at the right site of investigation, and the investigator are doing pretty good job there.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank, Jami. Can we go to the next question, Tiffany?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Your line is open.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple questions. First for Murdo. How often do you expect PDL-1 testing to be repeated in the second line after being done in the first line, as opposed to testing only in the first line and then using that information as a guide to the second line? If another test is thought necessary but not elected, then that would be of course good for Opdivo's second-line share. If it weren't thought necessary, then Merck's position might be strengthened. So would like your thoughts there. And then the second question is, consensus earnings in 2020 are $4.46. To what extent do you believe it already reflects the impact of the operating expense guidance provided today? Not the guidance itself, but the impact of that guidance. So would like your thoughts there. Thank you very much.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Steve, thanks for the question. Maybe just a little bit of background on what we're seeing happening right now. Most patients are being tested in the first-line setting when tissue is available. I think it would be unlikely that they would be rebiopsied and retested in the second line, just primarily because of the trauma to the patient of actually obtaining tissue. And I think, in general, people believe PDL-1 status to be relevant even in old assays that are done. Albeit the newer studies have been done with fresh biopsies, as you saw in the Merck -024 study. We think second-line retesting will be a small percentage of patients. I will say, though, we have been focusing on the second-line-tested patients and making sure that oncologists understand the strength of our data in high-expressing second-line patients from -017 and -057, and we have seen significant increases in our share of that population in second line. We currently get about 50% of those patients and pembro getting the other 50%. So I think we're very competitive, even in a tested second-line patient population.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And Steve, this is Giovanni. With respect to your second question, we're not providing long-term guidance. As I mentioned before, we feel comfortable with our ability to evolve our operating model and manage expenses within the context I described. And in that context of flat OpEx, we are comfortable that we're going to continue to be very competitive in driving R&D execution and commercial execution at the same time.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Steve. Tiffany, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Couple of questions, please. Regarding the -027 guidance, should I be thinking it's based on the assumption that the negative impact in the first line from Keytruda isn't going to be seen next year, given the time taken for these patients to progress and therefore it's coming in 2018? And then, second, on CheckMate -026, Francis or Fouad, if you have to hand whether there was any notable differences in the investigator-determined PFS versus the independent-review PFS, particularly for the chemo arm? I'm just curious about the very heavy censoring that you saw in that trial. And then, sorry, one further question. The forest plot shows a difference between squams and non-squams. We never saw the Kaplan-Meier curves. Is that data of potential interest given what you saw in the second-line setting? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Andrew, thank you. Let me just start by answer your question about 2017 and 2018. And let me maybe step back and answer your question by saying we definitely see the lung market to be extremely dynamic. We have included the impact we think will happen in 2017 based on the penetration of Keytruda in the first-line setting in the segment you know and how that impacts, as Murdo says, the size of the second-line opportunity because of patients going through. And also, the competitive nature of second-line lung, in which, as Murdo said, we continue to be very well-positioned.","I personally think about the lung market particularly when it comes to first line as a very dynamic market, where obviously in 2017 there will be the use of Keytruda monotherapy in high expressers. But ultimately, beginning in 2018 and clearly going forward, I believe it is clear that this will be a combination market, and so you'll see rapidly evolving market dynamics in first-line lung, and over time those impacting second line as well. But those impacts are reflected in our 2017 guidance.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And for the PFS question, Andrew, the PFS was consistent between the investigators and the independent review committee, to answer the question around censoring.","For the question around the squamous versus non-squamous, yes, we have reported a better risk reduction on progression and survival in the squamous versus non-squamous as presented at ESMO. This is probably telling us that in the squamous biology of a very inflamed tumor that that's the type of tumor that responds to a PD-1 agent. In the non-squamous, there are tumors that are inflamed, and there are some groups that really see probably some level of inflammation like the squamous. And this could be detected by enriching in the PD-L1 biomarker to have as a marker the inflammation in the non-squamous.","In -026 really were broad. We stratified with a 5% cut-off; we may have less inflamed tumor in the adenocarcinoma group. And probably a much better enrichment for inflammation would have showed better results for the adenocarcinoma group of patients. So these are interesting data. The full data will be available at the time we publish it, so you'll have the opportunity to look at it.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Andrew. Next question, Tiffany, please?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. Obviously there's been a major change in the stock price, and I was curious, are investors missing something? What's not appreciated with respect to how you view things versus how other people are viewing things? Second, can you give us a breakdown of Opdivo revenues by indication like you usually do? And, third, what can we expect at the upcoming meetings for the rest of the year \u2013 ASH, lung? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Marc, this is Giovanni. Let me just go back and reiterate what I said earlier. From our perspective, our fundamentals in the business are very strong. We do have good trends across our business that will continue into next year. Obviously, we believed it was important to really understand the impact that the first-line lung dynamics next year would have on our business. We have reflected that in our 2017 guidance, and I feel very optimistic about long-term growth prospects for the company.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. And just related to your question, Marc, on the mix of our business by indication, I would think of it in these three buckets: about a third, roughly, I would say between 30% and 40% of our business currently is in lung in the U.S.; then about 20% to 30% of our business is other indications in the U.S.; and then 25% to 35% of our business is ex U.S.","Francis M. Cuss - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning, Marc. So we have a number of presentations regarding our new I-O agents at the upcoming SITC meeting. These will include safety and efficacy for lirilumab, the anti-LAG-3 for urelumab as well in these early studies, both alone and in combination with Opdivo, and both in solid and hematological tumors. Just to remind you, we do have a PDUFA date coming up for head and neck on November 11. We've had validation of our European submission based on overall survival. We will get \u2013 approval is expected before the end of the year in Europe for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, and obviously in the first quarter next year, we have a PDUFA date for bladder in the United States as well. So there's a lot going to be happening in the next few months.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Marc. Next question, please, Tiffany.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get some perspective on the second line. When you look at the potential for sequential I-O use, so Keytruda followed by Opdivo, for example, mechanistically it doesn't make any sense, but I wanted to ask whether it would be worth it to explore that in a larger study. And two, do you think payers could try to limit sequential use?","And then just as a follow-up on your OpEx guidance long term. Would you guys characterize this as a change in the R&D organization, having a more disciplined approach? For example, has the hurdle rate going into more expensive Phase 3 changed?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Geoff, let me start from the investment perspective in your second question. We see \u2013 first of all, our evolution of the operating model is very consistent in a way with what we've been discussing with all of you over the last few months in terms of allocating resources strategically, accelerating the pipeline, and generating the right leverage as we grow as a company. We've quantified how we can do that more and better today. And my perspective is that from an R&D point of view, it really is about having the resources necessary in order to invest in the highest potential programs. So I would not characterize that as having raised the hurdle. I would characterize that as having the ability to allocate the right resources to R&D in order to accelerate promising programs. And, as Charlie mentioned, as an example next year, we are increasing R&D spend because we see very strong momentum in the early pipeline and clearly with Opdivo and Yervoy.","Clearly, on the same side at the same level commercially, we built very competitive commercial organizations in the key markets, and that we continue to be really committed to. It's really about disproportionate resource allocation to the highest-priority areas. And there will be parts of the company in fact that grow or experience very little change, while we will be making decisions to reduce our focus in parts of the company like, for example, some of the G&A functions where we think we can become a leaner organization, actually accelerating the ability to execute at the same time.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And, Geoff, just on your other question about sequencing the treatment of lung cancer patients, what we've seen in the market to date has been really very predictable in terms of what the oncologists and payers are doing, is they're responding to data events that trigger NCCN guidelines and compendia updates and also are respectful of the labeled indications of the products. So I would say in our forecast, we have not assumed any retreatment of pembrolizumab first-line exposed patients in our second-line opportunity. We have taken them out of our second-line pool of eligible patients. And I would say it's very likely, given the clarity of the NCCN Compendium and the clarity of the pembrolizumab indications, that the pre-treated or first-line treated patient population will be very close to the label, greater than 50% expression, and so that limits the pool of previously I-O treated patients that get excluded from second line, at least quite a large pool of second-line patients that are still eligible for Opdivo treatment in the second line.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Geoff. Tiffany, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions. Just as a follow-up on -227, can you give any color on increased enrollment? Sorry if I missed this, but are you increasing enrollment across all PDL-1 positives or just at the highest strata? And just also, how will this impact the timing of the ultimate readouts and\/or early analyses?","On your guidance, it looks like from your prepared remarks and the cadence of share buybacks, you're anticipating around an $0.08 to $0.09 tailwind on EPS in 2017. Am I thinking about this math correct?","And then just lastly on Eliquis. Were there any significant wholesaler inventory changes in the quarter? Thanks.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay, thank you. This is Fouad. Let me start by answering the question on -227 first. So the recruitment was not stopped as initially thought of in scheduling, and the reason is really to increase the size on the expresser part of the Phase 3. And, as you probably know, the non-expresser part of the Phase 3 started a little bit later and is still recruiting. However, I think we believe we reached a level of confidence in terms of the overall number of patients we will have within the next two to three weeks, and probably the recruitment for the expressers will end by then. There is no real impact to the timeline, and I think we still have optionality on the timing of the analysis and the different looks and cut-offs on -227.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, I'll comment on your share buyback. As I mentioned in my comments, we expect to have a 10b5-1 program, which means we will be buying shares over time, which means that they all don't get retired at once. So I don't expect that kind of tailwind as you described it. I think it will be less than that.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, and just on the question on Eliquis. We're really pleased with the prescription share evolution of Eliquis. As Charlie mentioned, we've seen some really nice evolution in the Eliquis market share. And in our cardiology market share, we see an even wider gap with new-to-brand patients versus Xarelto. So that continued growth feels really good. In the quarter, we had sales increase about 15% or $68 million, and roughly $59 million of that was due to demand.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Colin. Can we go to the next question, Tiffany, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Your line is open.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the results. Just want to clarify on CheckMate -568. I guess back at ASCO in 2016, you indicated that that was a medical informing or medical affairs study, -568 was, and that -227 was the registrational trial. Since that time, it sounds like you've doubled the size of that clinical trial. Did you have discussions with the FDA where that now is a registrational trial, or is it still a medical informing study? And what's the pathway at least for that study and timing for that study relative to -227? Second question for Giovanni. With you keeping OpEx flat, you have a core set of assets \u2013 I'm not sure if they're still core or not \u2013 in HIV\/HCV. What are your thoughts around that area in terms of pipeline, optionality, divestiture? How are you thinking about those assets at least going forward? And then I'm not sure if you indicated at all on your sales to date, which are about $2 billion in the U.S., what percent of those revenue in lung cancer are between second-line and some first-line use that might have continued within the quarter? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. John, maybe let me start with your question regarding virology, HCV and HIV. We have communicated in the past that we no longer have ongoing discovery efforts in that area. So that's really not a new announcement. And we are continuing to be focused on the core areas that we've described in the past. Clearly, the focus for us beyond immuno-oncology is in heart failure. We have really interesting programs in fibrosis, immuno-science very broadly, some activity in the genetically defined disease areas with a couple of interesting programs. And that's really where we're focused.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","For the -568 question, as Francis mentioned earlier, this is a single-arm trial looking at Yervoy plus Opdivo in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer, primarily at the response rate, and which provide us with a lot of flexibility on when we look at the data and how often because it's an open-label, single-arm study. The increase in enrollment will provide us with more data for the spectrum of PDL-1 expression. In particular in the non-expressers and in the highly expressing patients. We view CheckMate -568 as being really complementary to CheckMate -012, and single-arm studies can help inform the current and future medical practice, as you mentioned and Francis mentioned earlier. We believe it will be helpful in reproducing the -012 data, and we will continue to use -568 to ask additional question and have additional answers to the first-line non-small-cell lung cancer subgroups.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. And just lastly, the question regarding first-line lung versus second line. To date, we have seen some limited off-label use of Opdivo in first-line lung, although it's very small compared to the total second-line business. And going forward, we've assumed very little first-line, off-label use in monotherapy. So any evolution in that would be an opportunity to our 2017 scenario, as was previously described. What we're really thinking about that will drive growth is our growth across the rest of the tumors in the U.S. and the growth in our business outside of the U.S.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tiffany, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Partners","Yes. Thank you. Two brief questions, if I may. Fouad, when you discuss durable response or durability, it seems to be a little bit subjective. And I'm curious if you would just spend one minute to define clinically how you and the rest of the community really look at what may be a durable response. And second, Charlie, just one housekeeping. When you think of the -265, ex U.S., Germany, and France, and you have to reverse that contra to revenue, do you have to do it in the same quarter as you get approval in those countries? Or do you have the flexibility to amortize that revenue accordingly? Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Let me start, Tony, because that's an easy one. The revenue recognition rules are that you have to recognize it once you do have the pricing agreement.","Fouad Namouni - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. For the durability of the response, Tony, I think \u2013 let me put this into context. We have been seeing a lot of therapies, whether TKIs or chemotherapy shrinking tumors, shrinking cancer, and fortunately for certain period of time and then the tumor grows again because of that short durability. Our experience with immunotherapy, in particular with combination immunotherapy agents like Opdivo and Yervoy, when patients respond, they respond for a very long period of time. And when I say very long period of time, if you look at our data, overall when we do not even reach median of duration of response. And why we look at that and why that's important because that's really a good surrogate for improvement of survival, and improvement of survival is an important endpoint to look at it for lung cancer because that's what basically we'd be looking at the end. So the more we see patients continuing to respond to our combination of immunotherapy, the more we think there's a potential to really show long-term survival in a variety of cancer types.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Fouad, thank you. Thanks, everyone. Again in closing the call, let me say we've communicated the results of important quarter. Our business trends are quite strong across the board. We've made a number of important announcements today. All of this speaks to two things: our focus on execution for the rest of 2016 into 2017, and our confidence in the growth prospects for the company.

Please go ahead sir.","John Elicker","Thank you Sandy, and good morning everybody, and thanks for joining the call to discuss our first quarter earnings. With me this morning is Giovanni Caforio, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Boerner, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Lynch, our Chief Scientific Officer. Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks and Chris and Tom are available for Q&A.","First, the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we'll make statements about company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in our SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.","Today, we'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial metrics, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you John, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to speak with you today about our strong performance in the first quarter and the progress we have made on our pending acquisition of Celgene. I am very proud of our team's focus and execution in the quarter to drive our business forward.","Let me start with some highlights from the quarter and a brief discussion of our key growth franchises Opdivo and Eliquis. Our results this quarter were driven by strong commercial execution across the portfolio.","Opdivo delivered a solid quarter and continues to perform well. As we look into the future, we recognize we are working in a very competitive space. However, we continue to see Opdivo as a growth franchise given the breadth and depth of our clinical program. Given the rapid update of new indications in I-O the growth of Opdivo going forward will be driven by new indications over time.","Specifically, I think about our growth opportunities in three areas. First is the opportunity in adjuvant where we have a robust program beginning to read out in 2020. We've already seen the potential in adjuvant melanoma where treatment rates have gone from 20% to nearly 80%.","The second area of opportunity is in the metastatic setting across a range of tumors, including upcoming readouts in renal and gastric cancers. And importantly, the third area is the near-term readouts in non-small cell lung cancer beginning this summer and into next year with 9LA.","Eliquis continues to drive significant growth to strong execution and a best-in-class profile. We are encouraged that the strength of the Eliquis profile continues to be reinforced by numerous new datasets and additional studies. For example, during the quarter the AUGUSTUS study was presented at ACC and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrating favorable safety results of Eliquis versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with both atrial fibrillation and ACS and\/or PCI. The study offers clarity for a patient population with high unmet medical needs for which the idea of a treatment strategy is not well understood.","We are confident that Eliquis will continue to be a strong growth franchise going forward. Charlie will discuss details of operating performance and the P&L in more detail.","Turning now to our acquisition of Celgene. Our entire team is enthusiastic about the transaction. We are creating a stronger more diversified company that is poised for growth and value creation. Let me step back and provide my perspective on why this is important.","We've been very successful establishing Eliquis and Opdivo as growth drivers for the company. We're conscious of the fact that in our industry, science is always evolving, product development cycles are long. And these products will eventually face loss of exclusivity, Eliquis in 2026 and Opdivo beginning in 2028.","By combining with Celgene, we've taken the right actions to ensure that we continue to have a robust pipeline for future growth. The combined company positions us well to do this from day one. We will have nine marketed products each with over $1 billion in annual sales, six product launch opportunities, and over 50 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical programs.","With a broader and deeper pipeline, we will have more registrational opportunities across our key therapeutics areas. And importantly, the acquisition of Celgene provides us with a more diversified portfolio of marketed products that has a more balanced payer mix, expanded treatment modalities and earlier life cycle. We believe this breadth will be important as we navigate an evolving and an increasingly complex reimbursement environment.","Our confidence in the transaction was enhanced by the milestones achieved by Celgene this quarter. First, the FDA accepted Celgene's NDA for fedratinib and granted priority review. In addition, ozanimod and luspatercept were both submitted to the FDA for review.","We also saw three important developments regarding Revlimid IP. The U.S. patent office's dismissal of two key patent challenges combined with the Celgene settlement with Alvogen have provided further clarity and security around the patent estate for Revlimid. These milestones are consistent with our due diligence and support our conviction in the transaction.","Now let me touch briefly on our long-term outlook post-acquisition. This transaction allows us to stay ahead of the curve and strengthens our future position. The combined company is expected to have sales and earnings growth every year through 2025, despite the erosion of Revlimid. This growth will be fueled by Bristol-Myers Squibb's strong foundational products, Celgene's current product portfolio, our life cycle management programs, and our six potential launch opportunities.","Looking to the second half of the next decade, our marketed portfolio has the potential to be earlier in its life cycle and more diverse within our areas of focus. Our early pipeline will have matured giving us the next set of registrational opportunities. We expect to have a strong balance sheet with continued flexibility to invest in innovation valuable and expanded technology capabilities and complementary platforms, such as cell therapy and protein homeostasis.","We are working on securing the required regulatory approvals for the transaction, and we remain on track to close in the third quarter of 2019. I fully recognize the importance and work required for a successful integration. We are putting the right resources in place to plan and manage this process, including Charlie's appointment as the executive lead for integration. And we are building in accountability for success, with senior management compensation metrics adjusted to reflect the importance of this outcome.","One of our guiding principles is to manage this integration with minimal disruption to our ongoing business and future value drivers. We have a head start in this because of the complementarity of our businesses. I am confident that we are appropriately planning for the integration, and Charlie will provide more details.","To conclude my remarks, I'd like to reiterate, I am pleased with our strong performance this quarter and excited about our opportunity to create a leading biopharma company. We are at the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Bristol-Myers Squibb, as we work to create significant value for our patients and shareholders.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Charlie.","Charlie Bancroft","Thanks Giovanni. Good morning everyone. As Giovanni said, this is another strong quarter for the company highlighted by continued growth across our portfolio of prioritized brands. Let's start with Opdivo.","During the quarter, we saw good growth up 19% compared to last year. Let me take a few minutes to discuss what we're seeing in the business today and the dynamics in play going forward. Firstly, with respect to lung cancer. With our commercial team continuing to execute well, Opdivo remains the leading I-O agent in second-line lung in the U.S. Within this segment, as we've been describing, the size of the I-O-eligible population is declining and continues to erode in line with our expectations.","Internationally, we also see Opdivo commanding leading share in second-line lung and though the size of the opportunity will also decline, we expect this to be slower due to first-line PD-1 adoption being gated by reimbursement approval.","And looking forward within lung, we have several important data readouts coming in first-line with CheckMate 227 Part IA and Part 2 this summer and CheckMate 9LA expected next year.","Secondly, in first-line renal cell, we continue to see our U.S. business doing well with share increasing above 40% during the quarter. Internationally, we are in launch mode as we continue to secure reimbursement and we've seen encouraging early signs for markets with access already in place such as Germany and Japan.","And as we plan for new competition from TKI combinations, we're also looking forward to seeing data for the Opdivo combo combination from CheckMate 9ER likely early next year.","Thirdly, we continue to be positioned very well in melanoma. In the metastatic setting, Opdivo alone or in combination with Yervoy is the leading treatment globally with more than 50% share in the U.S. and Germany.","And with respect to adjuvant melanoma, we also continue to deliver very strong performance. In the U.S., we maintain greater than 70% share despite recent competition in this segment and similar to first-line renal, we are encouraged by initial adoption and early reimbursement markets outside the U.S.","In summary, we continue to drive strong commercial execution with leading shares in key indications. We also recognize that the dynamics in first-line renal and second-line lung will continue to play out.","However, as Giovanni has mentioned, we continue to see Opdivo as a growth brand in 2019 and based on the breadth of potential registrational readouts that we expect across lung, other tumors, and especially, in the adjuvant setting, we continue to view Opdivo as a growth brand longer term.","Moving now to Eliquis, which continues to deliver exceptional commercial performance. In the U.S., Eliquis delivered demand growth of 30% versus prior year from a total scripts perspective and exited the quarter with leading share of almost 40% of total prescriptions for oral anticoagulants used to treat AF and VTE.","Compared to Q4, Eliquis also benefited from a lower coverage gap liability since we accrue this as patients enter the donut hole. With fewer patients affected early in the year, the liability increases as the year progresses. This will be an important factor for reported sales later in 2019 since the coverage gap liability increased from 50% to 70% this year.","For reference, the coverage gap impact for Eliquis for full year 2018 was roughly $550 million. Eliquis is now the number one OAC not just in the U.S., but also in many countries around the world including Germany, Canada, and Australia.","As our best-in-class clinical profile continues to be supported by real-world data, we see scope for further expansion of the NOAC class at the expense of warfarin with Eliquis taking a disproportionate share of the conversion.","And in the longer term, we see opportunities to continue to expand the use of Eliquis more broadly by serving those patients that are either not well-controlled on warfarin or untreated or are undiagnosed. Therefore, looking forward, we continue to see a very strong growth opportunity ahead for Eliquis.","Let me now turn to a few items in our non-GAAP P&L, starting with gross margin. Mix continues to be a key driver of our margin and during the quarter, we saw unfavorability primarily due to the strong growth of Eliquis.","Additionally, we saw a higher level of the Puerto Rico excise tax during the quarter that negatively impacted our gross margin and drove favorability in our tax rate due to dissociated U.S. tax credit. You'll note that our line item guidance for the full year for both gross margin and tax rate have been adjusted accordingly.","Turning to OpEx, during the quarter, R&D expenses were increased due to investment behind the portfolio and SG&A was impacted by several one-time items such as a true-up for the pharmacy.","With no change to our expected OpEx for the full year, we project more evenly phased OpEx in 2019 than in other years. As I've described in the past, our other income and expense this year will be affected by changes in diabetes royalties, increased PD-1 royalties, as well as reductions in pension income, and the expiry of the Erbitux royalty.","I'll now turn to some topics related to the Celgene acquisition that have been of interest in many of our recent discussions, starting with cash flow, balance sheet, and capital allocation.","We view the combined company as having potential for substantial cash generation with more than $45 billion of free cash flow projected in the first three years. Our priorities for capital deployment moving forward include rapidly paying down debt over the next few years, improving our credit metrics, and we expect to continue to increase our dividend.","Regarding business development, in the near-term, we will plan to continue to look for smaller and earlier deals. Once our balance sheet is reset, we will have the capacity for additional delay. And with respect to share repurchases, as we've already announced, we plan to execute an ASR at approximately $5 billion upon closing the acquisition.","Turning to integration, as Giovanni has outlined, we are very focused on successfully integrating Celgene and protecting the value drivers of the combined company. Integration leads for each company were identified soon after the deal announcement and teams are already working on integration planning. Because we are combining two midsized companies each with a lean employee base, limited manufacturing networks, and largely overlapping geographies, our plans can be more immediately focused on protecting and integrating core business functions than other large acquisitions in the past.","With the complementary nature of our businesses, we believe we can ring-fence key teams and functions to minimize distractions. For example with our critical mass in oncology being in solid tumors and Celgene's being in hematology, we expect to maintain focus and minimize disruption for the research and commercial function in each company.","Additionally, we've announced that we plan to maintain a presence in three strategic Celgene U.S. geographies; Summit, New Jersey which includes important scientific commercial and cell therapy manufacturing capabilities; San Diego, California as a research and development hub including protein homeostasis; and the Greater Seattle, Washington area as a scientific hub including cell therapy development manufacturing and commercialization. Accordingly, though there is a lot of work ahead to integrate the two companies we believe that we are off to a very good start.","Turning finally to the pro forma non-GAAP P&L. As Giovanni discussed, we believe that growth of the in-line and pipeline products of the combined company will offset the expected decline of Revlimid beginning in 2022 and drive continued annual growth through 2025.","From a cost perspective, we will include stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP earnings and with respect to synergies; we expect to realize 40% at the end of 2020 and 100% by the end of 2022. We expect that the growth in revenue and continued cost discipline including synergies will drive future margin expansion and annual growth and net income through 2025.","To conclude, we've delivered a strong quarter with continued robust commercial execution. Looking forward we are focused on delivering our own business and successfully integrating Celgene. Post-close, we believe we are poised to be an even stronger company with a significant growth outlook.","Now, I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.","John Elicker","Thanks Charlie. And Sandy I think we're ready to go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from Geoff Meacham at Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Thanks so much for the question. Charlie just on the integration what you just mentioned there there's a lot to work on. There's a cadence of cost synergies from a facility perspective, but I also wanted to ask you just about the investments and the launches Luspatercept and Ozanimod coming from the Celgene side.","And perhaps take two, maybe just give us some comfort in the level of investments that you need to make on the -- as an offset to the synergy. And then I wanted to also kind of dig into a little bit of the first-line lung commentary with respect to what you guys view as maybe a reimbursement maybe a shift in reimbursement or the comments I think that you guys made were that you're not seeing as much of a rollout due to first-line reimbursement access hurdles. Maybe just give us a little bit more color on that and what it means to second-line Opdivo adoption. Thank you.","Charlie Bancroft","Yes. So, Geoff maybe I can start just on your comments regarding synergy and value protection. As I mentioned in my comments, we're very focused on making sure that we ring-fence and protect the value drivers of both companies, BMS and Celgene, and we're very focused on the upcoming potential launches of both brands. And we've done I think a really good job of focusing on where we can drive value and not distract the organization from those launches.","But from an investment standpoint, I don't think you would see much different anything than what Celgene would have done on a stand-alone basis.","Chris Boerner","So this is Chris, and Geoff I'll try to take the second part of your question regarding the first-line dynamics and the implications on second-line. So as expected we continue to see the launch of I-O agents in the first-line setting continuing to have an impact on the size of the I-O-eligible pull in the second-line.","In the U.S. as we expected that's been a bit of a quicker decline in the second-line than what you will have seen outside of the U.S. So, for example, in the U.S. the use of I-O therapies in first-line is about 57%.","Today we see that having an impact on the size of the eligible pull and second-line continuing pretty much in line with what our expectations have been. About one-third of patients in second-line today are chemo-experienced patients and thus would be eligible for I-O therapy. And again that's in line with the U.S. expectations.","Outside of the U.S. because of the timing of first-line approvals for I-O agents and importantly how quickly those I-O agents then get access in reimbursement and thus drive utilization that's going to be a bit slower and we've seen that translate into continued fairly large pool of second-line patients who are eligible for I-O therapy outside of the U.S.","John Elicker","Sandy, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of Opdivo questions here. Maybe the first set of questions just on the RCC market and a bit more color about how you're thinking about the competitive landscape shaping up here as we consider Opdivo, Yervoy versus the PD-1\/TKI combinations.","And the second part to that RCC question is on 9ER, did the time lines push out there? And are there any interims that we should be thinking about that could allow for an earlier stoppage?","Final question was on Opdivo. Was -- just Giovanni maybe come back to some of those initial growth comments. At this point is adjuvant the larger of the opportunities relative to the remaining metastatic readouts? And in those adjuvants what are the ones you're most focused on or excited about? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio","Chris why don't you start?","Chris Boerner","So let me start, Chris. So we continue to see a very strong business in first-line renal cell both in the U.S. And while still early days, the early feedback ex U.S. has been very good.","In the U.S. we grew Opdivo, Yervoy share in the first quarter to just over 40%. That's mainly as a result of growth in the PD-L1 negative. As I mentioned its early days outside of the U.S. but the feedback from early launch markets like Germany and France has been very good. We've actually obtained access in the U.K., Australia in Canada and we expect other key European markets to come on later this year. And interestingly we've seen very rapid uptake in Japan where share is over 30%.","With respect to competition, look we've been preparing for the launch of I-O\/TKI since last year. As we said repeatedly, we believe that the I-O\/TKI combination is going to have an important role. There's certainly interest in this combination in the first-line setting and that's why we have our 9ER study. And undoubtedly that will put some pressure on Opdivo+Yervoy.","However, we also believe and what we are hearing from customers is that Opdivo+Yervoy is going to continue to be a standard of care in the first-line setting and renal cell as a result of the depth of responses that we see, the durability of those responses and importantly the quality of life and safety profile that we've seen with Opdivo + low-dose Yervoy.","The other thing that we're hearing as more of the data about Keytruda and Inlyta has come out from customers is that we really do need to unpack this data. We're talking about very different populations, so you can't really compare directly. About one-third of the patients in the Keytruda and Inlyta study were favorable patients.","If you compare that to the extent of -- the extended follow-up that we've seen with CheckMate-214 Opdivo+Yervoy has about twice the number of the percentage of complete responses relative to Keytruda plus Inlyta and those responses are very durable. About 88% of the patients getting a CR in CheckMate-214 continue to benefit and we simply don't know the durability of the data yet for Keytruda plus Inlyta.","So from a commercial standpoint, our focus very much is continuing to emphasize the value and long-term benefit of Opdivo+Yervoy to appropriately put the data in the space in context, and I have complete confidence in our team's ability to continue to compete in that space.","Tom Lynch","And Chris -- thank you. And Chris to address your two questions one on 9ER and then one on adjuvant. So with 9ER a couple of things about this study. This is our randomized trial looking at cabo plus nivo versus sunitinib setting and we expect that data to read out in early 2020.","The reasons for the slight push out of the time lines are the fact that we -- I felt it was important to accrue patients in Asia and we had some Japan accrual. We've actually increased the accrual in that study to -- from about 500 to about 700. This gives us a little bit more optionality in terms of looking at overall survival as a potential secondary endpoint. But remember PFS remains the primary endpoint of that study. So we look forward to seeing that data in the early part of 2020.","I think you've put in a really important point with adjuvant and I think one of the points that we have made consistently is the fact that we believe that the opportunity for I-O and adjuvant is extremely important.","When you're thinking cancer in general, you think that while many drugs have made impact in metastatic disease real breakthroughs occur when you can prevent disease from coming back. And I think that's true with Herceptin. I think that's true with adjuvant chemotherapy. And I think it's clearly demonstrated in the melanoma space with Opdivo in that setting.","So as you know we have nine adjuvant trials that will be reading out over the next three years in six important tumor types; melanoma, bladder, esophageal, renal, hepatoma, and the neoadjuvant study in lung.","I'm always hesitant to say, which trials are you most excited about. I will say a couple of things about one or two of them. The first is in melanoma, we've seen that Opdivo and Yervoy has improved outcome compared to Opdivo alone. And so I personally am interested in seeing, does this translate into a difference in the adjuvant setting? So the melanoma trial, which we believe will read out in 2020, I think will be important to look at in that setting.","I think the second place, obviously, is in renal cell. Opdivo, Yervoy has made a big difference in renal cell carcinoma. There really is no proven adjuvant therapy in renal cell carcinoma. This remains an important unmet medical need. Looking forward to see that.","And then the final one I'll call out will be bladder non-muscle invasive -- muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Again an important area of unmet medical need an area where I think I-O is going to make a difference.","John Elicker","Thanks, Chris. Sandy, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Arfaei at BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","Great, thank you. And congratulations for winning your shareholder support for the merger. A couple -- a little -- first one on the I-O franchise and specifically CheckMate-227 Part II. Can you give us your latest thinking there please?","Frankly you have sounded someone cautious about this trial, which is puzzling for investors given the amount of information you have both from your trials and your competitors. Is there any reason we should tamper our expectations for this trial such as higher expected crossover or any other variable?","Next on the merger. Celgene have provided their expectations for their big five assets by product. You have provided your estimates for an aggregate of six products including your TYK2. Can you please comment on whether you agree with Celgene's expectations for their big five assets as they have made them out by product?","And if I could just speak one more in, could you give us the latest estimated sales of Opdivo by indication? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Alex. This is Giovanni. So let me just ask -- answer the first two questions and then I'll ask Chris to give you an update on Opdivo sales by indication. So with respect to -227 readouts, as we mentioned in our remarks, we expect Ia and II in the summer. There is really no update there and no news there from our perspective. Obviously as you said very important data readouts and we look forward to seeing that data.","With respect to the Celgene, five launches as we've communicated extensively in the last few months, we provided an estimate of what we believe the peak sales for the six launches are in aggregate. Obviously as you know, we've included risk adjusted assumptions in our financials, but we wanted to provide that incremental disclosure as we were really discussing the value of the pipeline. As it relates to future guidance, we may provide for the combined company or individual assets we'll talk about that after we close the transaction.","Chris Boerner","Let me just hit on the allocation of business. In the U.S. lung is about 25%; melanoma is about 30%; renal is just over 20%; and all other indications are about 20% as well. The only comment I'd make outside of the U.S. is lung is about 45% and that just reflects the dynamics of lung being a bigger percentage in second-line just given the timing of indications.","John Elicker","Thanks, Alex. Sandy can we go to next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions. First one is kind of a higher level. So your stock has been in free fall for the last few weeks at least. In your opinion and based on your conversations with investors and analysts, why do you think this is happening? What are the biggest areas of concern that you hear about that you think are misplaced? That's the first question. Second question is Part 1 of -227 it actually has a monotherapy OPDIVO arm tucked within it. That tends to get overlooked. It's fairly large several hundred patients.","I think it's around 400. It's not registrational, but it seems like there could still be a chance for the product to redeem itself in front-line lung as monotherapy following the spectacular failure of -026 back in August. So I'm guessing you'd say the odds are fairly high that we see good competitive results from this often-forgotten-about arm and recognizing it's not registrational. Can you comment?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, Tim. Let me ask -- let me address your first question and I'll ask Tom to give you his perspective on the second one. So with respect to interaction with shareholders, obviously as you can imagine, we are continuing to interact with all of our shareholders. We are strong believers in the value of the company that we are creating and the opportunity to deliver significant value for shareholders in the long term. So our focus right now is really on making sure that the integration is successful and that we deliver the full value of the combination. I think that's where we can make a big difference as a team and that's where our focus is right now. And as we've discussed in remarks I think we're making great progress already.","Tom Lynch","And Tim thank you for your question on lung cancer. I just want to sort of put in perspective the totality of what we're doing in lung cancer and we've said all along that we have multiple different approaches to non-small cell lung cancer. And you'll be seeing the results this summer of -227 Part 1 which will be coming out; Part 1a which will be reading out in terms of overall survival and a group of patients selected by PD-L1 status. And I think that data is going to be important for some reasons.","You're correct in saying it will give us a look at the monotherapy arm, but it will also be able to allow us to understand better the overall data from TMB as well to get a sense of the interaction of the interplay of the biomarkers in trying to understand what's driving response in I-O, because I still think this remains a very important question. Now we'll also -- also this summer, we expect to see the results of Part 2 which is our chemo combo and then I want to also draw your attention to 9LA, which will be reading out in 2020.","Again, two cycles of upfront chemotherapy followed by OPDIVO\/YERVOY, which we think has the potential to establish a durability of response that we're looking for in that setting. So I think a number of very important readouts at lung cancer. And you absolutely point out that it'll be interesting to see how the monotherapy performs in that setting. We look forward to seeing all of this data.","Chris Boerner","The only other thing I would comment is that the use of monotherapy right now in the first-line setting tends to be dominated in the greater than 50% PD-L1 expression. That's almost entirely catered to monotherapy and the vast majority of the business outside of that setting has begun to evolve to a chemo combo.","John Elicker","Thanks, Tim. Sandy, can we go to next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Seamus Fernandez at Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Great. Thanks for the question. So just a couple here. Tom, you mentioned that the -9ER study the primary endpoint is progression-free survival, but the study has been pushed out to 2020 because of recruiting in some Asian markets. I'm just trying to kind of triangulate that and understand that better. It would seem like PFS would likely have the study finished sooner or at least at\/or around the same time.","So I'm just trying to get an understanding of did you guys alter the statistical analysis plan at all to ensure that you have overall survival as kind of part of the stopping rule? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of why this study would get pushed out if PFS is the primary endpoint as most of us understood it and then you're adding the Asian patients so -- in an event-driven study.","And then the second question can you just maybe update us on your thoughts on what we might learn about the competitive landscape and how Bristol is positioned at ASCO this year. Obviously, we have the approval of Merck's label heading into ASCO. I'm just trying to get a better sense of the areas of focus that you're going to be bringing in your discussions with physicians from the data that you present there? Thanks.","Tom Lynch","Seamus, thank you. So let me just reiterate on -9ER and there's been no change to the statistical plan. And it's not a dramatic push-out of the readout data. It's just a slight push out of the day. One we increased the sample size to give us more optionality around a key secondary endpoint, which is overall survival in this setting and we think that that's going to be important.","And then second is, it's important for our study to have global impact and global reach and we felt it was important to accrue sufficient number of patients in Japan to be able to address the needs of the Japanese market as well. So there's been no change in the statistical plan and we do believe that we will be well positioned to answer the important question to help us determine the role of OPDIVO and Cabo in that setting.","Now regarding ASCO this year, as we've said a couple of times on this call, a number of our important readouts are actually happening this summer and it won't really be available in time for ASCO such as Part 1 and Part 2. Now we hope that many of those will be available including potentially even an update of our head and neck data at ESMO this year.","I think we are very proud of some of the data we presented at ASCO, GU this year, which showed that OPDIVO\/YERVOY had activity in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer, particularly in a group of patients that had high TMB. Again, I think this is a good example of the productivity of our translational medicine group the fact that we're able to look at a group of patients with TMB defined by a different cut-off actually than the TMB that was used for lung cancer and find a really important group of patients who benefited from OPDIVO\/YERVOY in that setting and that was at ASCO GU.","Also at AACR, we reported data this year on some of the long-term benefit that we're seeing in patients with previously treated lung cancer. If you're a PD-L1 positive, a 19% four-year survival in second-line lung cancer, which is truly remarkable in that setting. So there'll be a lot of important data readouts and I think ESMO will be a good place to see some of the larger study again depending upon timing of data.","John Elicker","Thanks, Seamus. Sandy, can we go to next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Phipps at William Blair.","Matt Phipps","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So on OPDIVO, it looks like this is the second quarter in a row with a slight quarter-over-quarter decrease in U.S. sales I guess not -- unexpected with the second-line lung dynamics. But given that Keytruda approval in first-line RCC ahead of schedule, do you think that slight decrease in U.S. sales will continue? Or is there a chance for acceleration in the second half of the year? And then secondly, you mentioned 40% market share right now in first-line RCC I believe. Is that in the per label patient population of intermediate poor risk? Or is that across all first-line patients?","Chris Boerner","Thanks for the question. So let me just address OPDIVO growth. First, if you just put the OPDIVO story for the quarter in context it was a very good quarter. We saw strength really across all of our tumors outside of lung cancer. In fact, we estimate that sales in all tumors outside of non-small cell lung cancer grew quarter-over-quarter and that's really a function of the base business continuing to be strong. We still have leading shares in all of our promoted tumors.","And as I mentioned, we're seeing growth as expected in first-line renal cell as well as adjuvant melanoma. So overall, you continue to see very good strength across the majority of our businesses. The headwinds that we saw in the first quarter really were very much focused on lung cancer. As expected, we continue to see pressure in the second-line setting due to the decrease in the eligible pool of patients I referenced previously. That's very much in line with the expectations, but does impact quarter-over-quarter growth.","The second thing that we saw this quarter was we saw a decrease in OPDIVO monotherapy nonpromoted sales in the first-line setting. That had been running about 4% to 5% in the latter half of 2018. We saw that come down in the first quarter to about 1% and I would expect, it's going to stay in that range for the remainder of the year. And as we flash forward to the remainder of the year, I think that first and foremost we continue to see Opdivo growing globally year-over-year, but I think the dynamics that you saw in the first quarter are likely going to continue as we move forward through the remainder of the year. Just addressing the question in renal cell the 40% share the vast majority of that is in the intermediate and poor population. That is consistent with our label. We do see about 5% share in the favorable risk population, but that's relatively small in the grand scheme of things.","John Elicker","Thanks, Matt. Sandy, can we go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Vamil Divan at Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So one just around sort of dynamics around drug pricing reform and a specific question really just to this concept of international reference pricing for Part B. I think when that was first proposed I don't think investors and maybe analysts wouldn't get too much credit for that actually becoming a reality, but if it feels like in our conversation that there's maybe a growing sense that that may actually become a reality. So I'm just wondering, if you can share your expectations on some degree of international reference pricing being implemented for Part B and how that might impact Opdivo and Yervoy specifically and just I guess Bristol overall. And then my second question is just on the following-up on the Part 1a and Part 2 comments you had made. I know you can't control the timing of these event-driven trials. But given that the data is coming a little bit later than expected does that in any way sort of raise the bar in terms of what you need to show given the uptake Merck is already seeing with \u2013 through the mono-therapy and combination therapies in frontline non-small cell? So just wondering, if you have to show even stronger data displaces at that point? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks, Vamil. This is Giovanni. Let me just start with the question about pricing. So first of all, let me say as I've said many times, I think that from my perspective we are entering a period in, which we have to expect that the discussion about pricing and reimbursement will continue. I personally feel that, it will be an evolution over time, and I do believe that the pressure to demonstrate value and the focus of payers on pricing and access will continue in the U.S. And in fact, as you may remember, I really believe that one of the important things for us to be doing is to continue to accelerate strengthening and broadening the pipeline adding more growth drivers for the company diversifying the portfolio with a larger number of assets and having a presence at the company that spans across multiple payer segments. I think these are all things that in an increasingly competitive market from a payer perspective, which is what we should be expecting, will position BMS much better as a broader innovation company after the transaction with Celgene is completed.","With \u2013 now with respect to the IPI international referencing as you know we don't think that's a really good idea and we are really not supportive of that proposal. Because I think when you look at what is happening in many of the countries where they are included in that reference basket is that patients are not having access to new therapies, when you look at the approval of Opdivo and Yervoy in metastatic melanoma that's a transformational regimen as a standard of care in the U.S. It was approved in Europe in 2016, if I remember correctly. And I think in almost half of the markets included in the basket, it's not being reimbursed yet. I think the same is true for the adjuvant melanoma indication approved last year that are many of the markets that are included in the reference basket where that's not reimbursed yet. And almost half of the oncology products approved in the last few years are not reimbursed in those markets.","So we are proponents of policies that enable stakeholders to continue to work together to address the issues of out-of-pocket exposure for patients and affordability and access, but in a way that continues to reinforce and reward innovation. And clearly, that's not what that proposal does. It's difficult for me to handicap the probability that a radical proposal like IPI has in truly moving forward. What I can tell you is that as an industry we are in discussions with the administration and we are supportive of policies that achieve some of the goals of out-of-pocket exposures for patients, but in a way that rewards innovation.","Chris Boerner","Let me just quickly comment on the first-line opportunity. Undoubtedly, the timing of Merck entering first-line vis-\u00e0-vis data readout from us is an important consideration. It does frame the competitive context into which we would be launching. What I would say though is that, front-line lung cancer is a very large opportunity. There is still room to play, as I mentioned earlier, only about just over half of different line opportunities currently being addressed through I-O therapy. I don't think we think about this in terms of needing to hit a particular hazard ratio. Physicians are still looking for multiple options to treat patients in this space. They're looking for chemo sparing options, which is obviously relevant potentially to Part 1a. And what I would say is that from a competitive standpoint we know this space well and we know how to compete and we're looking forward to seeing this data readout.","John Elicker","Thanks, Vamil. Can we go to the next question please, Sandy?","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Scala at Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. It was said a couple of times that the CheckMate -227 readouts are due this summer. Previously the Opdivo plus Yervoy OS data was expected in the second quarter. And that was a push out from prior expectations, which at one point were late 2018. There appears to be obviously ongoing delays. Can you provide a range of possible reasons for the delays, which are now approaching over a year? There could be good reasons of course so maybe you can paint both sides.","And then secondly not all KOLs are fans of the KEYNOTE-426 data in the first-line arena. Dr. Lynch, I'm wondering if you can point out some of the lingering uncertainties and questions on the data beyond what Chris already identified. Or in your eyes is KEYNOTE-426 a clear win? Thank you.","Tom Lynch","Steve, thank you. First on the first point, regarding the lung readouts. Just a couple of things. One is these are event-driven studies, and they're large trials. And the events happen when the events happen and I think it's really important not to read too much into event rates. Because event rates can slow down because things are going really well, or they can slow down just because of the way people were accrued to the different arms. So I don't read anything into the event rates, and I think the event rates are what they are. We'll see the data this summertime in that respect.","I think the thing about renal cell carcinoma that I want to say, again, that I think is really important is that what you're looking at when you're comparing or looking at a regimen like Opdivo and Yervoy is looking at a regimen that's provided that we have excellence follow-up on now and we have a sense of what the duration of response and duration of benefit is, and that's something that's still a bit unknown with the TKI combination with Keytruda in that setting. And again, maybe fine, but it's unknown at this point. So you're comparing unknown very strong duration of benefit with one that we'll have to see how that data evolves. But although, as we pointed out we still also believe that the TKI plus PD-1 could be important. That's obviously why we have studied 9ER.","John Elicker","Thanks, Steve. Sandy, can we go to the next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Gerberry at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Gerberry","Good morning and thanks so much for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to follow up on the comment about Opdivo remaining standard of care in renal. Is your thought that this would remain the dominant treatment option in poor to intermediate? Or do you think that it's more of a shared market between I-O\/TKI and I-O\/I-O? And then as we think about the evolving second-line market in renal do you think the field will evolve to either I-O\/I-O followed by I-O\/TKI or vice versa given the lack of second \u2013 approving second-line options behind an I-O therapy? Thanks.","Chris Boerner","Yeah. Both very good questions and I think that to a certain extent the answer is going to be these dynamics are going to have to play out in the marketplace over the coming months. What I would say with respect to OPDIVO plus YERVOY continuing to be a standard of care in the front-line setting is I very much think that it will be one of multiple modalities that are an option for first-line patients. I would suspect that, the initial use of I-O plus TKI will likely be in the favorable patients, where we are not indicated. But I think you're going to likely see physicians make choices about, which option is best for their patients.","That then in turn will impact the second-line dynamics. You're correct in pointing out that you might continue to see the increasing use of combination therapy in the second-line space. We've begun to see an uptake in the use of OPDIVO plus YERVOY, for example, in second-line renal cell. It's about 20% now in the second-line setting.","And so, I think, you're going to continue to see physicians start to think through if they use OPDIVO plus YERVOY in first-line, thinking about a combination with TKI in second-line and potentially vice versa. Those dynamics are going to play out in the coming months and we'll obviously need to stay connected on those as the data continue to evolve.","John Elicker","Thanks Jason. Can we go to next question please, Sandy?","Operator","The next question comes from Navin Jacob at UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for -- two -- one for Charlie. Charlie, can you remind us about your dividend policy post the deal close? How do you think about the dividend from perspective of a payout ratio will be? Will you be maintaining the ratio that you had for Bristol stand-alone, which I think was roughly 50%? Maybe a little bit above that for 2018. Is that how we think about it over the next few years?","And then, a commercial question, if I may, for an upcoming trial that you have CheckMate 459 first-line HCC trial, which is interesting. How do we think about the size of HCC? Is that mostly ex-U.S. market, U.S. market? And are we talking about a $1 billion to $2 billion opportunity, or $3 billion to $5 billion? Any kind of color will be appreciated.","Charlie Bancroft","Hey, Navin, this is Charlie. So thanks for your question. On the dividend, as we discussed, and we said that we will continue to increase the dividend. We haven't said a specific payout ratio, as we haven't said with Bristol. Our payout ratio at one point was over 90%.","And as we continue to grow our earnings, we were more in line, I would say, with our peers. So I think on a go-forward basis, it will be the nature of the business, where is our business at that moment in time, how are we going against the -- a number of fundamental factors. So we have -- like, we have in the past, we give our dividend policy once a year for the next immediate year.","Chris Boerner","Yes. And with respect to HCC, HCC is obviously a particularly attractive market. We see considerable use of OPDIVO today in the second-line space with about 53% share. We also have good use in the third-line setting with upwards of 45% share.","In terms of the opportunity, I think, we're going to have to wait and see how the data pan out. And once we get that data we'll be able to provide a bit more clarity. But it's an attractive opportunity and we've seen I-O be very effective in the space.","John Elicker","Thanks Navin for the questions. Sandy, can we go to next question please? I think we have time for two more.","Operator","The next question comes from Umer Raffat at Evercore.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking our questions. First, we saw the Celgene settlement with Dr. Reddy's for the Canadian territory, not for the U.S. My question was, do you know if Reddy filed an amorphous form of Revlimid in Canada? That was the first.","And the second is, on the TYK2 program, I feel like Street focus will inevitably shift to this next key trial coming up, the lupus trial next year. And I have noticed there's a very specific forced steroid taper being implemented in that trial. Can you give us a little more details on exactly how that taper works on steroid? I'm just trying to understand, how to think about the placebo arm in that trial. Thank you.","Charlie Bancroft","Yes. So let me speak first about Revlimid. There're different patent regimes in Canada and the U.S., so you can't really read across from one jurisdiction to the other. I don't know offhand, quite frankly, if Dr. Reddy's had filed the amorphous claim or not, so we'll have to get back to you on that.","Tom Lynch","And, Umer, regarding TYK2, I think you pointed out, this is a compound that we're extremely excited about. As you know, it's a drug which looks like it has activity both through the Type I interferons as well as the IL-12\/IL-23 pathways.","We were delighted to see the data that we saw in psoriasis and we look forward to seeing those Phase 3 trials continue to mature. We also think this is an agent that could have benefit in inflammatory bowel disease and we're beginning studies in inflammatory bowel disease in that setting.","We do have a Phase 2 study in lupus, which is appearing. I think one thing to keep in mind with lupus is, how challenging of a disease lupus has been. And I think we saw that this year, with some notable shortcomings in other trials. It's a very difficult disease to treat.","It's also a very heterogeneous disease in terms of what defines the disease and what drives the disease. And so the purpose of the steroid taper is to be able to have a more objective look at the potential for the benefit of TYK2 versus the potential for the benefit of the steroid interaction. So it's really trying to reduce the number of variables that are present in an inherently variable disease.","John Elicker","Thanks, Umer. Sandy, can we go to our last question please?","Operator","The last question comes from David Risinger at Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Great. Thanks very much. I have two questions for Tom please. First, could you guys talk a little bit about similarities and differences between Part 2 of 227 and 189 and talk about your placebo expectations? And then second, with respect to adjuvant trial readouts could you just go through a little bit more specifics on the potential for the timing of some of the other trials that you highlighted as most important? Thanks very much.","Tom Lynch","David, thank you and a couple of things to start off with Part 2. So Part 2 is -- I guess, the biggest difference is the histology. Part 2 is an all-commerce histology. 189 is a histology that's driven by nonsquamous cell.","The interesting issue on the placebo arms we have noted for some time that the performance of the placebo arm at 189 was particularly poor, which I think led to a very extremely positive hazard ratio in that setting. I don't know what our placebo arm will -- how our placebo arm will perform in Part 2. Obviously, we look forward to seeing what that is and to seeing what benefit we can provide to patients in that setting.","I do think it causes some caution then in looking at hazard ratios as a way of comparing across trials. One of the things I always like to think about when I think about what makes a trial effective or what makes a treatment effective is, really to look at landmark analysis, how many of the people you treated.","And this is really the way that doctors think, how many of the patients you treated are -- have not progressed a year later or still alive, three and four years later. That's much more relevant. Patients never ask doctors what a hazard ratio is and what the hazard ratio will be with this given treatment. So I think that's something important to keep in mind when we look at the data from Part 2 and again when we look at the data from 9LA.","Regarding the timing of readouts, I can give you some estimates at this point. Remember, we're pretty far away. These are event-driven, so I think you have to be a little bit cautious about putting too much into the specific time line.","I mentioned the melanoma trial earlier that I was very excited about. We think that's going to read out second half of 2020. And -- but remember, that's a 2,000-person trial. So the readout could be quicker. It could be later. Again, event-driven trials. And in the adjuvant setting, the events obviously take longer to develop.","In our Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer, that's also second half of 2020. In our renal cell trial that I mentioned, that's the second half of 2022, at that point. And I mentioned our hepatoma, we have -- in hepatoma we have a 500-person randomized adjuvant trial, which reads out in the first half of 2022. So that gives you the scale of what we're thinking about in terms of when these read out. But again, I ask you to exercise caution, because of the size of the trials and because of the variability in readouts in those settings.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, everyone. In closing, this is a remarkable time for us at Bristol-Myers Squibb. We've had a strong quarter and importantly we've made progress with respect to the acquisition of Celgene.","We've maintained a strong focus on executing our strategy and driving the business forward and I'm really confident in the company we are building and the opportunities that we have ahead.

Thanks for joining us as we discuss our Q4 results as well as our 2016 outlook. With me this morning are Giovanni Caforio, our CEO, Charlie Bancroft, our CFO, Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer and Murdo Gordon, our Head of Worldwide Markets. Now, Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks and then we will go to your questions.","Before I turn it over to Giovanni, let me take care of the Safe Harbor language: During this call, we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.","Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Well, 2015 was a pivotal, very important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. We began a new chapter of growth and laid a strong foundation for our future. This was true across the complex. Commercially, we had $16.5 billion in sales, 4% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong, given the loss of exclusivity for Abilify early in the year. Regarding R&D, it was an extraordinary year with 112 product approvals, including 23 in major markets and 11 by the FDA alone. In addition, we also had three Opdivo study stops for overall survival.","Let me share just a few of our highlights and Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands. We are very encouraged by the global performance of Eliquis and I believe that we are well on our way to becoming the number one NOAC globally. Global sales for 2015 were $1.8 billion, which represents more of a doubling versus prior year. Our Hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance in 2015, notably in Japan, in certain European countries and most recently in the U.S., where we saw good performance in the fourth quarter. Overall, we had $1.6 billion in global sales. Obviously, we all know this is a very competitive and highly dynamic market. We do expect new competition to have an impact on our business as we are already seeing in Japan. Orencia also had a good year with almost $1.9 billion in sales, 14% increase over 2014.","Regarding immuno-oncology, it was nothing less than an incredible year. We exceeded expectations, thanks to important clinical results, earlier than expected launches and an unprecedented uptake in new patient share across multiple tumor types validating our development strategy, our belief in the importance of overall survival and our strong commercial capabilities. Commercially Opdivo performance was very strong. Nearly $1 billion in global sales.","In lung cancer in the U.S., we have approximately 60% of new patient share in non-squamous and around 70% in squamous. In melanoma, we are pleased to have a broad approach to this market with indications, ranging from the adjuvant setting with Yervoy to the metastatic setting with Opdivo. The adoption of our combination therapy, the first of its kind has been strong and we have approximately 20% market share. And in renal cancer, I am pleased to report that the uptake is similar to what we have seen in lung with new patient shares over 50%.","With respect to R&D, 2015 was an exceptional year and in fact we are already off to a very strong start in 2016. This morning, we announced the early stop of our CheckMate-141 study in patients with head and neck cancer. Our fifth early study stop with Opdivo. We look forward to discussing the data with regulatory authorities.","Last year, three of our key trials with Opdivo were stopped early because of a survival advantage versus the previous standard of care and we moved quickly and effectively with regulators receiving seven approvals from the FDA across three tumor types. Opdivo is now approved in 46 countries.","We accomplished much in lung. In the U.S., Opdivo is the only PD-1 indicated for all second line patients across all histologies and importantly regardless of PD-1 status. In the EU, we had received approval for squamous and are waiting regulatory review for non-squamous. And in Japan, Opdivo was approved with a broad label in December.","In renal cancer, Opdivo's approval came in the second half of the year, only one week after our submission was validated by the FDA, which demonstrates the importance of the data in an area where the medical need for patients is very high.","All-in-all, I am very proud of our accomplishments in immuno-oncology including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications. Going forward, we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. This year, we should see data from Opdivo trials in four additional tumors and in first line lung cancer and start to see some data from some of our early assets.","Finally, we expect three additional I-O assets to enter clinical trials bringing the total to eight clinical assets beyond Yervoy, Opdivo and Empliciti. I am confident we are making all of the right investments from a commercial perspective and from an R&D perspective to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.","Now, before turning the floor over to Charlie to provide our 2015 financials and 2016 outlook, let me say that I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb as we have entered a period of expected growth. Driven by the unprecedented success in 2015, we are in a position of strength with significant growth opportunities in I-O where we have advanced our leadership position in Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the number one novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong and we are advancing a diverse innovative and promising pipeline by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need.","And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you.","Charlie Bancroft","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will start with some comments regarding the quarter and then move on to our 2016 guidance. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter with very good performance across our key brands. Total revenues of $4.3 billion, up 1% over last year. With the continued strengthening of the dollar against most currencies, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of 5% in the quarter and approximately $0.08 on EPS.","Sales for Eliquis were $602 million, more than double from fourth quarter last year. Eliquis is now the number one NOAC in new to brand patient share in cardiology across 12 markets around the world and we continue to see strong demand trends from key markets such as the U.S., Germany and Japan.","Sales for our Hepatitis C portfolio were $458 million, with most of the sales coming from the Daklinza. U.S. sales were $212 million and we are seeing strong demand since the launch in Q3. Sales in Europe were $121 million with strong performance in Germany, France and Italy. In Japan, we had sales of $80 million, which is down significantly from Q3 sales of $175 million, as weakened trends reflect the pressure for new regimens that have entered the market.","Opdivo uptake continues to be very strong, with sales of $475 million for the quarter. As Giovanni mentioned, we are seeing rapid adoption in the U.S. with Q4 sales of $410 million. About two-thirds of Opdivo sales are within lung cancer, both squamous and non-squamous. We are also seeing an increase in melanoma with the approval and launch of the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen.","Our I-O portfolio now has the leading new patient share in first line melanoma. Opdivo has now been approved in 46 countries. The European launch for both first and second line metastatic melanoma and squamous non-small cell lung cancer is going well in the country where pricing has been secured, notably Germany where we are seeing rapid uptake in both lung and melanoma.","Sales for Yervoy were $266 million, down 28% from last year. There are two dynamics at play. With the U.S. approval and launch of the regimen in the adjuvant indication, we are seeing signs of stabilization there. Outside the U.S., the launch of Opdivo and Keytruda are having an impact on Yervoy where sales were down 40%. We launched Empliciti in the U.S. in December. We began commercial activities with just a couple of days and are in good position that drug. While it's early, we are seeing a high level of interest and recent trends are encouraging.","We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business. Sales of Reyataz and Sustiva down 14% and 23%, respectively. Recall that we transferred our rights to Erbitux on October 1 and therefore we no longer report revenues. In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux in both the U.S. and Japan were approximately $60 million and were reported in other income.","Now I will comment on a few line items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 78% during the quarter. Our gross margin varies primarily due to product mix and benefited from the divestiture of Erbitux and strong Opdivo and Hep-C sales. As you recall, we increased investments to support important growth opportunities in our portfolio, both commercially and in R&D. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, which now includes A&P, increased about 10% in the quarter due to the increased investments in key brands, primarily Opdivo. R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments behind I-O and Empliciti, which includes clinical trials and expanding our medical organizations globally. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.1%, which reflects the full year of the R&D tax credit which was permanently extended in December.","2015 was a very good year across the board and we are pleased that marks the year of both top and bottom line growth. We expect this momentum to continue in 2016 with revenues expected to grow about 5% and strong double-digit EPS growth. As you saw on our release, we are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $2.30 to $2.40. This range assumes current exchange rates. As Giovanni mentioned, we expect strong performance in Opdivo, given the strong execution in the U.S. and launches in more countries as we secure additional approvals with associated pricing and reimbursement Eliquis is also an important growth driver and we are seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue. Our Hep-C portfolio will continue to be a meaningful contributor to revenues though new regimens are already having an impact in Japan and we expect a similar situation in the U.S. later this year.","As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind which will have an impact on our 2016 revenues. As I mentioned, we are seeing stabilization of our Yervoy business in the U.S. but ex-U.S., we are seeing pressure, particularly in the EU and that will expand as PD-1's launch globally. Recall that the regimen at adjuvant indication are not yet approved yet by the U.S. which accounts for approximately 50% of Yervoy sales. So we do expect to continue to see the impact of PD-1's there. The HIV franchise remained under competitive pressure. Our mature products are a naturally declining business. In addition, the exploration of certain relationships with third-party supply agreements and the divestitures of Ixempra and some international products last year further impacts this category. As previously mentioned, we no longer record revenues for Erbitux. We will record royalties on Erbitux sales in other income.","As you all know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2015 average rates. Based on current FX rates, this is expected to negatively impact our 2016 revenues by approximately 2% and $0.10 to $0.12 on earnings per share, which is factored into our guidance.","To summarize our 2016 sales outlook, we are very pleased that our key brands that are important to our future growth are performing very well. Our underlying revenue growth excluding the impact of Erbitux, Abilify exclusivity FX is in the low-teens. Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix. For 2016, the loss of rights to Abilify and the structure of our copromotion agreement for Eliquis will put downward pressure on gross margin. Partially offsetting that will be the growth in sales of new products such as Opdivo and the divestiture of Erbitux. Additionally, FX favorability that we saw on international cost of goods in 2015 is not expected to incur in 2016.","Our operating expense projections for 2016 reflects investments that we began in the second half of last year that are continuing, particularly in R&D, which include additional clinical trial investments, increased medical resources and Phase IV studies. We will however continue to be prudent with commercial resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. As Giovanni described, 2015 was an exceptional year, which provides great momentum as we enter 20106.","Now we would be happy to address your questions.","John Elicker","Thank you, Giovanni and Charlie. Sean, I think we are ready to go to the Q&A session. And just as a reminder, in addition to Giovanni and Charlie, Francis and Murdo are here to answer any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and the comments. So I want to apologize, I missed some of this. But just a little more color on Opdivo and the trends you are seeing there. Obviously you have had the entry of Merck into the lung cancer kind of the beginning of the quarter, the holidays, near the end of the quarter. If you could just a sense of what you \\saw over the course of the quarter, maybe even a little sense of how things are going so far this year? Just so we can get a little better sense of the ongoing run rate in how we should look at your forecast in that product going forward? And then maybe the second one more from Murdo around the positive data on the head and neck side. Could you just give a little bit more color on how you see the commercial opportunity for that potential indication relative to the lung where a lot of the focus has been so far? How do you see this one stacking up and the importance within the overall portfolio? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Vamil, let me just start. So this is Giovanni and then I will ask Murdo to give you some more color on performance and answer your question on head and neck. We are very pleased with the performance of Opdivo in 2015 and particularly the acceleration we have seen in Q4. That's clearly the driven by the breadth of our label in lung cancer across all histologies, regardless of PD-1 status. It's driven by the high unmet medical need in renal and again the strength of our overall survival data and a very solid uptake of the regimen in melanoma given the efficacy profile. We have approximately 80% of value share of the PD-1 market and a very strong commercial execution.","Murdo?","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Thanks Vamil. I would add a couple of things to Giovanni's comments. Specifically in the lung area, we have been very pleased. As you know, we saw rapid uptake in squamous after availability of the 017 data and subsequent approval. And we have seen similar uptake now in non-squamous, where we are about 60% new patient share in second line. That profile is a very competitive profile for Opdivo. We have two strong indications that overall survival benefit and continue to see very strong receptive from oncologists because of the lack of a requirement to test for PD-L1 status in lung.","Now with the release of other data from our competitors, namely the 010 study, we continue to feel that that competitiveness in second line will continue. Given the fact that we have been able to establish superiority in squamous and non-squamous separately in all-comer populations and have a resulting indication for both histologies that reflects that, we feel really good. We haven't really seen a deterioration in our new to patient share with the advent of the 010 data set.","I think you also asked about head and neck. We see the opportunity in head and neck as really exciting. Obviously, when we see the actual full data set, we will know more about what to expect. But what I would say is, this is a high unmet medical need area and is one where Opdivo in second line represents a significant opportunity. That being said, it is a smaller tumor type. It is second line is between 5,000 and 10,000 treatable patients in the U.S., a little higher than that in Europe.","John Elicker","Thanks Vamil for the questions. Sean, could we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is now open.","Ami Fadia","This is Ami Fadia on behalf of Marc. I had two questions. Number one, on Opdivo you gave us a sense of some of the latest market share. Could you remind us what time period that was measured for and how do you see those market shares across the different indications play out in 2016? And the also sort of second part of the Opdivo question is, we are seeing pretty good strength in the U.S. In 2016, where do you see progress coming from outside the U.S.? Where do we have pricing already? What do we expect to change over the next few months? And then I have second question.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you. Let me just start answering the first part of your question. I will ask Murdo to provide more detail. As both I and Murdo mentioned in our remarks and the answer to the first question, there is really rapid penetration across all of the indications where we have a label, the two histologies in lung, renal and melanoma. The two most recent approvals where there is more dynamic growth in the fourth quarter, really were the uptake of the regimen in melanoma and renal. And we are very encouraged by both trends. Those trends will continue into 2016. We also see that in 2016, we will begin to see uptake in other European countries. The only country where we really have an uptake to-date is Germany and those curves are similar to the U.S., but we are making progress. We are negotiating pricing and reimbursement in many other countries around the world, mainly in Europe and we will begin to see the impact of our international business later in the year.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Thank you, Giovanni. The profile, as I mentioned, in lung for Opdivo in both squamous and non-squamous has shown to be very competitive in second line and we are seeing strong shares. We expect that that will continue. In melanoma, the Yervoy plus Opdivo regimen is getting about 20% of new patients in first line. It's early days and we have a newly expanded label to include all patients regardless of BRAF status and so we hope that that will continue to evolve in the U.S.","Now go back to comments that Charlie made ex-U.S. for Yervoy specifically, where we don't have a regimen indication nor do we have an adjuvant indication, we would expect to see Yervoy continue to feel the pressure of the advent of first line new patient share of Opdivo and Keytruda across Europe. So expect Yervoy to have some pressure going forward ex-U.S.","When it comes to renal cell carcinoma, the most recent approval for Opdivo, we are very happy and are seeing a rapid uptake like we saw in melanoma and in lung where we see roughly 50% new patient share. Now these percentages move around. They are from very small data sets. We use them as directional and we use them to estimate how rapidly behavior is changing in the market.","Ex-U.S., we are very happy with reimbursement evolution and we are seeing reimbursement authorities across Europe move quickly with us to find appropriate reimbursement for patients across Europe and we feel very good with the broad label that we have in Europe that includes both first line melanoma for Opdivo and squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we feel very good about our ability to negotiate good access for European patients.","John Elicker","Great. Sean, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jami Rubin","Thank you and congratulations on a terrific year. Charlie, I have a question for you on guidance. I am little bit confused about something. So you ended 2015 with 77% gross margins and the guidance for 2016 is for gross margins between 75% and 76%. I am assuming that you are just being conservative, since this is the beginning of the year and it probably proves or pays to be conservative at this early part of the year. But help me to understand, while I understand that Eliquis will get bigger and that puts pressure on your gross margin, the other line items of your business are growing. And when I think about the contribution of Opdivo and the expected growth of Opdivo in 2016 relative to the expected growth of Eliquis, I would think that mix should be in your favor. You also mentioned that Erbitux would be in your favor too. So if you could just explain why 75%, 76% versus ending the year at 77%? And then if you could also just address with respect to guidance, the guidance doesn't seem to imply much in the way of margin expansion. You had made some comments about that a couple of quarter ago. But where are we in terms of when we should expect to see meaningful margin expansion to play out? Thanks very much.","Charlie Bancroft","Okay. Thank you, Jami. Our gross margin, as I pointed out, has a lot to do with mix and I talked about the different products coming in and out. So Abilify going away, HIV pressure there. You are right, Opdivo is going to be a big year in 2016, Eliquis though does put a drag on that. I would say net net, a lot of our mix is almost makes off, but the bigger impact, as I mentioned in my comments is related to FX on international cost of goods sold. If you recall, the end of 2014, FX rates started deteriorating and the benefit that we got that flowed through our international cost of goods in 2015 doesn't repeat again, given the rates don't have that larger dichotomy year-over-year. So that's almost a 2% impact and also included some hedging gain that flow through cost of goods sold again in 2015 that [indiscernible] 2016.","In regards to operating margin, the way we are defining and most of all of you analyst define it is our operating income held for sale. So that's how we are looking at it and that's how we would talk about it going forward. We have addressed this and said that we expect leverage mostly beginning in 2017. As I look at how we finished 2015 at about 23.4%, we don't expect any decline in 2016. We should be flat or slightly above that as we look at 2016.","Giovanni Caforio","And Jami, this is Giovanni. Just to reiterate that Charlie just said. As you have seen in our guidance, we have initiated a number of really important strategic investments commercially in R&D in 2015. Those are continuing at roughly the same level in 2016. And just to confirm what Charlie said and we have said before, we are committed to increased profitability beginning in 2017.","John Elicker","Thanks for the question, Jami. Sean, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is now open.","Andrew Baum","Hi. Thank you. Two questions, please. Firstly in regard to CheckMate 026, your first line Opdivo versus chemo. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Obviously the initial experience with PFS was checkered because of pseudo-progression .Could you outline the measures you have taken to minimize the risk to using the PFS endpoints within this trial? Obviously I understand it's first line and therefore you need to do that, but have you manage to derisk some of the initial observations? Second, a strategic question for Giovanni. Your portfolio and approach is very heavily focused on novel checkpoints and specifics and obviously there were term asset classes within the I-O space where you are less active than some of your peers. So how are you thinking about either broadening out and I guess I think you have cancer vaccines or cell therapies and there are of course others, versus reducing the risk profile of the organization because of the short cycle time in immuno-oncology by bolting on an additional asset class outside oncology, especially given the rating of the sector and the availability of finding interesting assets to acquire?","Giovanni Caforio","So let me ask Francis to start and address your questions, Andrew, on 626 and then I will make some comments on your second question.","Francis Cuss","Well, good morning, Andrew. Let me first of all say I am really proud of R&D's performance in 2015. I am actually thrilled that we have showed survival benefits in the second line lung setting in a patient population of platinum resistance that frankly have no options. As far as, forgive my laryngitis, as far 026 is concerned, we have actually taken great care in the design of this study. We have paid real attention to the choice of endpoint, the optimal timing of the analysis, the role of the non-proportional hazard ratio and of course the role of PD-L1 expression and the sample size. And we have used a wealth of data both published and our internal data on Opdivo to help guide us. So we believe we really have got the optimum balance of speed and the design to deliver positive results in the widest population of first line lung patients as we have done in other studies of Opdivo recently. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","And Andrew, just a quick answer to your question on immuno-oncology breadth and the diversification more broadly. Let me say first, with respect to immuno-oncology, I feel very confident that we have a broad approach to immuno-oncology for the short-term, the medium term and the long-term. And when you think about our central pillar today, obviously it is checkpoint inhibition. We have two assets in the market and really exciting data with the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, which we are taking into more tumors.","We have an exciting pipeline of eight agents, early agents in the clinic and we have actually strengthened that approach recently last year in 2015 through a number of business development activities we have built to what I think is an attractive early pipeline addressing the tumor microenvironment, which is a new area for us. So we have a lot to do with continue to advance our existing portfolio combinations in early assets. Obviously as the leaders in the field, we always look at new platforms and technologies and as they become better established and we are interested in that data, we are very much open to making moves in that area.","Let me also say though, that beyond immuno-oncology, we actually are continuing to work to build a differentiated pipelines in other areas and we have made, again, progress in fibrosis in 2015. We strengthened our CV pipeline with a clear focus on heart failure and continuing to progress potentially transformative assets beyond oncology in every one of our areas.","John Elicker","Great. Thanks, Andrew. Sean, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A question that deals mostly with the timing of the data releases. So if I look at 026, your first line trial, clinicaltrials.gov says that recently got pushed out by, I think, three or four months to October. I look at the combo IPI\/NIVO data for CheckMate 227, that looks like it's slipped by eight months from 2017 to 2018. At the same time, it also looks like 141 slipped. That was pushed out by three or four months very recently. Yet today, you stopped that trial early. So on these other trial that I described, they are still very much the realm of possibilities that those could read out early on an interim and I guess of special importance would be the first line lung, given the fact that Merck results might be doing a similar timeframe. And then the second question on timing has to do with your later generation products. So in October in your earnings call, you talked about having data on things like lag and cure on CD137 late 2015 or early 2016 and now if I understand the guidance correctly, we are really looking at late 2016. So in a matter three months, the timing of data disclosures got pushed back by about a year. And I am wondering, if you can just articulate exactly why that's the case?","Giovanni Caforio","Good morning, Tim. So we expect to have data, as you say, towards the end of 2016 for the 026 study and we don't expect an earlier readout. There is no interim analysis on that study. As far as 227 is concerned, we are very happy with the progress of the trial. We are looking at the beginning of 2018. So that and as we move to the combinations, I think it's just worth pointing out that when we talk about I-O combinations, we already have a combination approved, two approve drugs. In melanoma, we have got it under review in the EU and we have got late stage studies in lung, renal and several other tumors.","So as far as the exploratory programs in novel combinations, we are getting data in-house now both the monotherapy and combination. If possible, we will present data later in 2016. And I think depending on what we see, we could move into larger studies by year's end or early 2017. But I want to make this point, we have a very high hurdle for bringing new assets forward because basically, it's got to be better than what we believe Opdivo, Yervoy is going to be which already, as far as I know, the only proven combinations of potentially similar synergy.","So we are very optimistic about the Yervoy regimen with Opdivo and we will be bringing forward data later in the year on the others. Thank you.","John Elicker","Thanks, Tim, for the question, Can we go to the next one, please, Sean?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Your line is now open.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for taking the questions. So a couple of quick questions, one for Francis and then one for Murdo. Francis, as we think about new areas for combinations, can you just help us understand where you really think the new combinations can be most impactful? As we look at it, I think many of us focus in on the lung cancer market quit a bit. And as I think about it, is it something like refractory lung cancer and then perhaps more broadly colorectal cancer, those are the big nuts that need to be cracked? How are you thinking about next opportunities for the overall I-O story at Bristol? And then, separately for Murdo, can you just help us better understand the transition that you think is going to be necessary as you shift from a broad marketing message for a patient in the second line setting to a potentially narrower PD-L1 biomarker driven message post a hopefully successful CheckMate 26 study? Thanks.","Francis Cuss","Good morning Seamus. So our strategy is to look at our combinations through the tumor lens. And as you mentioned, we are focusing on prioritizing those areas with the greatest unmet need. Since we believe that I-O combinations are the best way forward to try that long-term survival for patients, we are again looking at it IPI\/NIVO together in a number of trials at the moment. And then in those areas where, as you said, unmet need, those rapid regressive in lung and those that relapse in lung and certainly those tumors where there has been modest benefit for monotherapy, we think these is a particular opportunity as new and novel combinations come forward to perhaps meet the unmet need there.","So with our portfolio, as Giovanni mentioned, now of eight combination, eight assets with three more to come in this year, we think we are going to be driven by the science and the clinical data and of course should we see good data, we will be moving in these areas of unmet need. We will be moving it very quickly forward.","Murdo Gordon","And Seamus, with regard to your question of how do we transition from a leadership position that we will maintain and continue to grow in second line with the evolution of data sets in first line. I would say, first off, we have to look at the reasons why we are being successful in second line beyond perhaps testing or not testing. We have a very strong commercial and medical organization worldwide. We are seeing very rapid uptake across the board in the U.S. We are seeing it in Germany. We are actually it seeing in France as well. It's just not translating into revenue recognition there because it's in the ATU. We have a high degree of readiness in Japan.","But really, we have got clarity on our dosing. We have a strong customer centric organization, a breadth of indications beyond lung and a very strong clinical development program. One thing to keep in mind is, what we are seeing in the lung market is there is a slow moving but growing evolution of testing, particularly in first line. So testing in second line is a difficult proposition, as you know, because of ability to re-biopsy or assess tissue, but we are seeing first line testing in the range of about 60%.","And we are very, very focused on ensuring that the Opdivo biomarker PD-L1 test is available everywhere we want to market the products. So we think we will be in really good shape for a PD-L1 selected population in first line and I think we will have all the necessary commercial and medical capabilities for that period in time.","John Elicker","Thanks, Seamus, for the questions, Can we go to the next one, please, Sean?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Tony Butler","Thanks very much. One brief question please, on elotuzumab or Empliciti. Congrats on getting that out in the marketplace, but the label, as you know, is quite broad in multiple myeloma. And the real question is, where today are you seeing it used most? In failures first line, do you see the utility there as second or third line failures, that would be very helpful? And finally, John, I hope to do feel better. Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Tony, first let me say, as Charlie mentioned that the early signs from the U.S. market are encouraging, the very early signs. As you know, Empliciti is the first immuno-oncology agent to get into multiple myeloma. It's a crowded market, but one that continues to have a really high unmet medical need. And we think that that asset can play an important role. Let me ask Murdo to give you a little color on where it's being used. And remember, it is really early times.","Murdo Gordon","Yes, that was going to be my first comment. It's really early and it's difficult right now to so any kind of segmentation on the initial uptake that we have. We are very pleased with the uptake in the U.S. We are seeing nice trends. We are seeing good coverage in execution from the commercial organization and the medical organization being able to reach all key customers.","The team that is working on the promotion and education of physicians on Empliciti has been the team that had successfully driven Sprycel over the last few years. So this is a team that can execute very effectively. But it really is early to tell whether we are getting through relapsed refractory patients in second line or beyond. We will continue to monitor that going forward .But the early feedback, very positive.","John Elicker","Thanks, Tony, Sean, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hi guys. I appreciate you taking my question. And if I ask a question that's already been asked, please ignore it. I apologize, I was on an off the call, given today's carnage. But I was wondering, you guys, I believe, recently started a Phase II trial looking at Yervoy plus Opdivo in lung cancer that's running in parallel, I believe, with the registration trials. Wondering what you hope to learn from that Phase II? And why do it, given the Phase III is already ongoing and what you hope to learn and when Wall Street might expect some data release from that? And then I would love to ask Giovanni about capital allocation. I certainly felt like, please correct me if I am wrong, but you have signaled that diversifying the company, the I-O is kind of on autopilot and the company is really focused on it, but one of your goals as a relatively new CEO is to make sure the company was well diversified and you have mentioned several therapeutic areas you are interested in. You have done some smaller deals, but is this still a big focus for you? And how is your appetite for perhaps medium sized deals around the $10 billion mark that other companies have decided. Thank you very much.","Francis Cuss","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Schoenebaum","Good morning.","Francis Cuss","So this is my CheckMate 568 and so let me first of all say that we have full confidence in the 227 study as the definitive randomized study for first line non-small cell lung cancer in combination. That being said, we believe the experience from single arm studies of combinations like this can help inform future medical practice as part of our very expansive data generation that's going on in non-small cell lung cancer.","Giovanni Caforio","And Mark, this is Giovanni. Let me just answer your question on capital allocation, specifically diversification. So first of all, business development remains a top priority for us. I must say that when many of our deals last year were smaller deals on early asset, they all are extremely interesting from a scientific perspective. And actually 2015 was a year of unprecedented activity for us from a business development perspective.","First, we continue to be very active in immuno-oncology. I know you were joking when you said, it's on autopilot, but in reality we really feel we are at the very beginning of an extraordinary story in immuno-oncology and we continue to be very focused not only on delivering the value of the portfolio and pipeline we have but also continuing to strengthen that. And going back to what I said a few minutes ago, the agreements we reached in 2015 really have strengthened immuno-oncology, particularly in the tumor microenvironment.","Second, we are focused on diversifying beyond immuno-oncology. We have signed some important agreements last year that have strengthened our pipeline in cardiovascular medicines, where we now combining internal and external, we have a really attractive approach to heart failure. We are building a very differentiated early pipeline in fibrosis, continuing to advance interesting assets in immunoscience. And as you know, we have two genetically defined disease products in the clinic as well. So that coupled with the strength and performance of Eliquis provides a good platform for growth outside of oncology as well.","And with respect to your question regarding the size of the deals, as we said in the past, we are agnostic. We are really interested in deals that make sense strategically in terms of the therapeutic area feat, they are very strong in terms of the scientific promise and obviously makes sense financially.","John Elicker","Great. Sean, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions and congrats on the data. Two questions here. First on Eliquis, can you just talk about the strength in the quarter? I know last quarter was impacted by the donut hole, but can you just elaborate on the 4Q trends a little bit more? And my second question was on Opdivo, any update on duration of therapy that we have seen with patients in lung cancer so far? I guess specifically on nonresponders, are you seeing physicians discontinue therapy at time of progression? Or are we seeing some physicians continuing to treat through progression? Thanks very much.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Thank you very much, Chris, for the question. It's Murdo. Just I will go through Eliquis very quickly, but we are seeing strength in Eliquis across all major markets. Performance in Japan, U.S. and across Europe has been very strong. As was mentioned, we now lead in new to brand prescriptions in cardiology which we see as a leading indicator for the entire market across 12 markets. And we are seeing really, really strong demand in all of the major markets in our stroke prevention atrial fibrillation indications. And we have more recently launched the VTE treatment indication across Europe and in Japan. So we will see hopefully some continued accelerations of that.","You alluded to the donut hole effect in Q3. We did see somewhat less coverage gap impact in Q4 in the U.S. but we did nonetheless some of that in Q3. So we are very optimistic that we will continue to see strong evolution in Eliquis and along with our Pfizer partners, we feel really good about being able to drive Eliquis to become the number one NOAC, as Giovanni mentioned earlier in the call.","With respect to your question on Opdivo and DOT, duration of therapy in lung, really this is a very difficult number to get at so early after launch. It seems like longer, but we have only really been in the market in lung since March of last year. And you really need 24 months to have a 12-month look back to get to an accurate duration of therapy. So it's still difficult to elucidate that. So we don't a good number for you there.","And then you also asked about, are we seeing physicians persist when there is evident progression. I wouldn't have a good answer for you there, but we are seeing in the case of patients who are high expressers and the status is known, I would think that persistence there would be more likely than in low expressers.","John Elicker","Chris, thanks for the questions. Sean, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. With respect to Opdivo, I think that you mentioned that two-thirds of the sales in the fourth quarter were in lung. Could you further breakout kidney versus melanoma? And then second, could you just discuss the Opdivo Phase II trial readouts to watch this year in lymphomas and bladder cancer? Could you just frame those for us and talk about the evidence for likely success and your level of enthusiasm? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Francis, why don't you start on Phase II and then Murdo will cover the question on Q4 sales.","Francis Cuss","Good morning David. Just to say, it's a very exciting year for data this year. We have started well with head and neck. I think the Hodgkin's lymphoma, we have the data in-house and we are in discussions with the regulators about submission there. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we should see later in the year, the single arm study there. We are expecting data in bladder and we believe that no matter what the Roche submission does, we may, assuming the data is good, we will have an opportunity to go forward with that too possibly, depending on the data.","Murdo Gordon","Yes. Thank you. And question regarding mix, I mean we were really only generating significant revenue in lung and melanoma in the fourth quarter. We had about three weeks, four weeks of renal cells and really the very beginning of the uptake. So it's a two-third, one third split lung, melanoma for fourth quarter last year. Obviously that will evolve. We feel really good about the early penetration in renal reaching, as I said, in the early part of this month about 50% new patient penetration. So really what we are seeing are very similar uptake curves across all of the solid tumors that we have had approval in so far and that gives us confidence about Opdivo's outlook for 2016.","John Elicker","Great. Thanks, Dave. Can we go to the next question, please, Sean?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning guys and thanks for taking the question, yet another for Opdivo in lung. Just checking to see what type of share you guys have already in first line lung ahead of the data this year? And then a bigger question, I know data dependent, but is it your view that the science really has evolved to where I-O combinations with chemo may be as attractive as non-chemo in market such as first line lung and even bigger tumor types like breast and colon? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Just very briefly on first line, let me just say, we have a very, very little penetration, first line at this point. As Murdo mentioned before, we are really at the beginning of a very rapid uptake with high shares. Let me ask Francis to answer your question with respect to combinations.","Francis Cuss","Well, just to mention the combinations, Geoff, as I said, we believe the best opportunity for prolonging survival and responses is with I-O combinations but we have a very comprehensive program including both I-O combinations and also chemotherapy combinations, both in our 227 study in a community study and some exploratory studies. I think I would say the data to-date, data release than we probably have the most, but prolonged data doesn't support broad use of chemotherapy in combination, but I think we would see what the data shows. And there is a possibility that maybe some areas where that is beneficial. But as I said, I think our view is what science we have would suggest that I-O combinations are going to be perhaps the best for long-term survival.","John Elicker","Thank you, Geoff, for the questions. Sean, I think we have time for two more?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning folks and thank you for taking the questions. Your guidance states that you are cutting SG&A and increasing R&D, both are more than we expected. I am just wondering because previously you said that you were increasing marketing spend for Opdivo and Eliquis this year and so I am just wondering if you could kind of put that in context of SG&A coming down? And also the increase in your R&D spending, I am just wondering, to what extent is this indicative of increased concerns about competitive thrust to your I-O franchise? Or is it a function of new opportunities that have become available to you? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Alex, this is Giovanni. So first of all, let me say, we stack up our commercial investments behind the key growth brands last year, Opdivo and Eliquis, you mentioned and we are very committed to continue to invest competitively going forward including 2016. Obviously, we continue to look at our mature portfolio and the evolution of our portfolio overall and we have been and we will continue to be very disciplined in allocating all of our resources to the growth portfolio we have. So I just want to make sure that we continue to be very clear that Opdivo, Eliquis and all of our growth opportunities continue to be competitively resourced and supported in terms of their growth.","With respect to R&D, actually our increased investment comes from our confidence in our R&D strategy and the increased leadership position that we have gained in 2000, which makes us really confident given the number of successes we have to continue to broaden our development footprint. And when you look at the R&D spend, a lot is about development but we are also continuing to resource a very competitive medical organization and data generation activities across the board in support of many launches we have ahead of us in 2016.","John Elicker","Thank you for the questions, Alex. Can we go to our final question, Sean, please?","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks. A couple of questions on Opdivo there, a bit different. Is the net pricing across global regions holding steady as with your original intent? And if not, can you perhaps quantify some of the differences? And then secondly in the U.S., curious about your DTC campaign on Opdivo. I would have thought that the speed of uptake for these I-O agents and the market share dynamics would not really be affected by patient awareness that can be dealt with via DTC, but maybe you can share thoughts on the philosophy of DTC for this area? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Gregg, let me start with your second question about DTC and patient awareness. We made a conscious decision, an important decision to invest in DTC advertising for lung cancer because we feel that is a long history of treatment that have not delivered significant value to patients with lung cancer. There is pessimism for many patients. And the number of patients particularly in the second line setting that are not being treated as aggressively as they should be treated. So for the first time, we have been able to offer a really meaningful opportunity through Opdivo to patients, pretreated patients with lung cancer. We felt it was important to invest in a campaign and in many ways mobilize patients to seek treatment now that an option is available.","Charlie or Murdo, on pricing?","Charlie Bancroft","Yes. Gregg, on net pricing around the globe we are, as I mentioned before, really pleased with the recognition of the value that Opdivo represents and have been pleased with our discussions with reimbursement authorities. There have been positive assessments in France and in Germany for Opdivo. We are making good progress in the U.K. So we feel good about how net price will hold ex-U.S.","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks, everyone. Thanks for the questions. Let me just conclude by saying again that 2015 was a very important year for us at Bristol-Myers Squibb as we began a new chapter of expected growth. We have laid a very strong foundation for the future. Thank you.","John Elicker","Sean, thanks for helping coordinate the call and thank you everybody for joining us.","Operator","Absolutely, sir.

We had productive discussions with the FDA regarding the study and we will be initiating a rolling submission for this indication in the next few days. I feel extremely good about.","Having said that, we\u2019ll switch to our first quarter results \u2013 our good first quarter results. Our non-GAAP earnings per share improved 12% to $0.46, compared to last year. And our top line performance was meaningful. Excluding our diabetic franchise, sales increased 5%, while our new and in-line brands increased 8%.","Our core products performed well with double-digit growth in Sprycel, 19%; Yervoy, 18%; Orencia, 13%, and Baraclude, 11%. Sales of Eliquis topped at $100 million threshold with positive momentum in the U.S., as well as in other markets around the world. Last year, we identified and executed against some key opportunities to accelerate the growth of Eliquis, focusing on cardiologists, increasing our investment behind medical education, driving improvement in access and launching direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. Our increased investments are driving results as we see improvements in prescription plan in all areas.","Together with Pfizer, we are committing even more abilities to Eliquis this year, and we are pleased that the FDA approved Eliquis for the prevention of deep vein being promoted in Q1 and hope to be able to further expand the label in both the U.S. and Europe with the inclusion of VTE treatment later in the year.","As far as immuno-oncology is concerned, Charlie and Francis will give you details to how we are performing and what we are doing and planning. Let me just say that I am glad about how the Yervoy continues to grow around the world and that we had best quarter in the U.S. since launch with strengthened demand in our community oncologists and I\u2019m equally or even more excited about nivolumab.","During the quarter, we added new trials for nivolumab in mono therapy and combination in several new tumor types. and I\u2019ve already mentioned our decision on the rolling submission of 063. Also our earlier stage portfolio continuously advanced to our own R&D efforts and through external collaborations such as the recently announced agreements with Five Prime. In summary, we made meaningful progress across our growth IO portfolio and we continue to build in advance our leadership position.","Moving to HCV, hepatitis C, we also made good important progress. In fact, we had potential HCV approval for daclatasvir based regimen in all of the major regions before the end of the year, beginning with Japan and continually both Europe and the U.S. With respect to the U.S., our possible approval is based on the recent NDA submission that follows the breakthrough therapy designation for our dual regimen of daclatasvir and asunaprevir.","Finally, I will briefly mention our progress in the development of an early-stage portfolio addressing genetically defined disease or GDD. Our process on GDDs is part of the redefined R&D strategies that we announced in November of last year.","Our research and development teams are currently working to identify key targets to prioritize for future development and our business development people of pursuing the standard opportunities in this area. We\u2019ve just announced the acquisition of iPierian, a company discovering and developing the treatment of certain kinds of disease of the brain called Tauopathies is the first result of their focused areas.","Growing our marketed products and continuing to advance the development of our pipeline had been spend to our balanced approach of driving our results today, while setting the stage for tomorrow. The divestiture of our diabetes business to AstraZeneca that we completed in the first quarter is allowing us to further improve this approach, and accelerate our evolution through specialty biopharma.","Our operating model is getting simplified and streamlined throughout the entire company. At the same time, we are increasing investments and focus behind priority areas of anticoagulation, immuno-oncology and HCV, as well as in certain geographies wherever we can be more competitive.","Taking together, our first quarter results along with the work we have been doing to drive our specialty evolution, signifies a strong start, what should be an important year for us. For sometime we had been talking about our portfolio of the future, but many significant ways, that future has already started.","And many important things will happen for the company during the rest of the year, starting very soon with the presentation of a lot of data at ASCO, and continuing all of other potential developments that I mentioned with respect to Eliquis, HCV and immuno-oncology.","Some these developments will lead to increased sales in the near-term, while all of them should generate growth in the longer-term. We are working hard to continue to deliver success.","So with that, let me turn it over to Francis.","Francis Cuss","Thank you, Lamberto. Good morning, everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss the progress we\u2019re making within R&D including an update on our immuno-oncology portfolio. It\u2019s crucial for our R&D organization to execute on the near-term delivery of our pipeline, while investing to maintain a robust portfolio future opportunities. I\u2019m confident in the progress we\u2019ve made including the work we\u2019ve done to accelerate our Hepatitis C program with the potential for approvals in Japan, the EU and U.S. before the end of this year.","We continue to believe that we have some interesting opportunities in this very large market. Looking ahead, we have some important opportunities stemming from our decision last year to evolve our strategic focus in R&D, and moving to areas to support the company\u2019s evolution to specialty care biopharma company.","One new component of our R&D strategy is an explicit focus on genetically-defined diseases; by genetically-defined we mean diseases caused by mutation that we can identify and design the therapeutic approach specifically to address them by directly targeting the genetic basis of the diseases, we believe we have the opportunity to significant advance the standard of care.","We\u2019re developing an early stage portfolio that addresses the genetically-defined diseases through the identification of key targets. Our acquisition of iPierian and its lead Tau antibody, is actually a good example of this approach. iPierian's anti-Tau approach provides us with an opportunity to develop an innovative disease-modifying treatment that\u2019s certainly genetic-defined neurodegenerative diseases known as Tauopathies.","Our initial development focus would be in progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disease with Tau dysfunction, and this could possibly extend to other neurodegenerative diseases.","Let me now turn to immuno-oncology, I convinced that immuno-oncology could be transformation in the treatment of cancer with a potential for durable responses and long-term survival offering significant promises for patient. Building on the important body of research and the experience, we have with Yervoy, we have seen significant progress in our clinical development programs for Nivo, and the rest of our immuno-oncology portfolio.","Of the more than 35 Nivo trials ongoing in many different tumors, about a third are potentially registrational. Important datasets, are now maturing, and we expect significant data readouts over the next 12 months to 18 months.","We have the first such date to read out now. We have the data from Study 063, and as you know this study assess the highly pretreated patient population where there are no other approved or recommended treatment alternatives. Our review as a result of the Study 063 reinforces our belief in the potential of Nivo to offer durable responses and demonstrate an improvement in long-term survival.","We\u2019ve had positive discussions with the FDA regarding Study 063, and this study will be the basis for rolling submission that we will be initiating in the next few days. We expect to complete the rolling submission by year\u2019s end, which will allow the FDA to consider additional data that will become available in the remainder of 2014. We hope to present the data at the 2014 Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology in October later this year.","The results 063 marked the beginning of our data flow in lung cancer where our clinical development program has made significant progress. Our program in lung cancer addresses multiple lines of therapy, different histologies, the use of biomarkers and potential therapy with both monotherapy and combination regimens.","For example, there are two ongoing second line phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer, one in squamous and one in non-squamous, a recently initiated first line phase III trial with nivolumab monotherapy in lung cancer for PDL-1 positive patients and we plan to begin a phase III program to study the combination regimen of Nivo and Yervoy by the end of this year.","ASCO will be a very important meeting where we will present data from new studies, as well as more material data from ongoing studies. Specifically, there will be additional mono therapy and combination data for Nivo in lung, melanoma and renal as well as data for Yervoy adjuvant melanoma.","Looking to the second half of 2014, we expect to have data in house from our second line lung cancer studies. We\u2019re also looking forward to the first presentation of Nivo data in hematological tumors at ASH in December. Based upon the data, we believe there is significant opportunity for IO broadly across other tumor types. We\u2019ve started potentially registrational trails in follicular and diffuse B-cell lymphoma, as well as glioblastoma, colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer. We\u2019ve initiated signal detection trails in pancreatic, gastric, small cell lung and breast cancer.","For many of these tumors, we are exploring both Nivo monotherapy, as well as the combination regimen of Nivo plus Yervoy. We are also pursuing additional IO assets with different mechanisms in both monotherapy and in combination. Key clinical stage assets in our early portfolio include Anti-LAG3, Anti-KIR and Urelumab.","In closing, let me remind you that our goal is to deliver to patients the potential for long-term survival across a wide range of tumors. We\u2019ll continue to drive our programs and our trails forward as quickly robust as possible. Based on our investment, our leadership and our experience in this area, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to be well positioned to accomplish this.","Now, let met turn this over to Charlie.","Charles Bancroft","Thank you, Francis, and good morning everyone. Overall, we had a good quarter. First quarter revenues excluding diabetes were strong led by Eliquis, Yervoy, Sprycel and Baraclude.","Let me provide a few highlights from the quarter. As Lamberto noted, we are pleased by the progress we are making with Eliquis. The investments that we and Pfizer made at the end of last year, along with additional investments this quarter have accelerated Eliquis\u2019 growth around the world. In the U.S., net sales of Eliquis were $61 million, up 27% from the fourth quarter. We are seeing encouraging prescription trends in our new-to-brand share among cardiologists is now over 35%.","Outside the U.S., net sales were $45 million. In the EU, we saw particularly strong performance in Germany and had recent launches in Italy and France. Japan also had a good quarter as the prescription limitation was recently listed. Yervoy sales grew 18% to $271 million. U.S. net sales were $146 million. You will recall that there was a $25 million one-time reversal of a sales deferral during the first quarter of last year. On a demand basis, Yervoy had its best quarter in the U.S.","While Yervoy continues to grow at academic institutions, we are also seeing good growth coming from community hospitals and practices. In the EU, we saw strong performance in both France and Germany, where we have reimbursement in the first-line study. Orencia sales grew 13% to $361 million, while we continue to see solid growth; there is increasing competition for first-line use and switches, which lowered the pace of growth from the prior quarter. We are focused on improving our execution particularly in the first-line study.","One final note on sales, our U.S. business during the quarter was negatively impacted by wholesaler inventory work down, particularly with the Sustiva Franchise and Abilify. This impact was somewhat offset by an inventory build in Japan. We expect inventory levels to normalize over the next several months.","Let me spend a few minutes on the Diabetes Franchise and the impact of this quarter and the rest of the year. We completed the sale of our global diabetes business on February 1. Our first quarter results therefore, reflect one month of the historical diabetes business prior to closing and two months of impact to our P&L of the ongoing terms related to the transaction.","Let me provide some color. Total diabetes revenues were $179 million, including $153 million in product sales during January. The other $26 million for February and March is primarily related to our ongoing product supply agreement with AstraZeneca.","We expect these product supply sales to be about $10 million per month in 2014. We will report royalty income on sales made by AstraZeneca in the other income line of our P&L. These royalties were $48 million in the first quarter. We are also providing certain transitional services to AstraZeneca. These service fees were $31 million in the first quarter and are included in other income. The income from transitional services is expected to taper throughout the year and most services should be completed by year-end.","We will continue to conduct and fund certain predefined clinical trials and diabetes through 2016. The cost of these trials will be included in R&D expense. During the quarter, we received $3.3 billion from AstraZeneca for our global diabetes business. We also received an additional $100 millin in April for the approval of Forxiga in Japan.","This has significantly improved our cash balances, particularly in the U.S., which gives us increased financial flexibility. Now, let me highlight a few items from the rest of our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.8% during the quarter, up 130 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our diabetes business.","Marketing, selling and admin expenses were down about 4% as our increased investments in Eliquis, Yervoy and our pre-launched assets in immuno-oncology and hepatitis C were offset by reduced expenses in diabetes.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 23% during the quarter, which is higher than the same period last year. You\u2019ll recall that in Q1 2013, we booked five quarters of the R&D tax credit. This quarter does not include the impact of the 2014 R&D tax credit, and so that\u2019s not yet (expended) [ph].","Regarding guidance for 2014, we are adjusting our full-year 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.70 to $1.80, which assumes current exchange rates in the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. Now that we have closed the diabetes transaction, we are able to provide certain non-GAAP line item guidance, which you\u2019ll have seen in our press release.","Now, we would be happy to address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","John Elicker","Okay, Jamie, I think we\u2019re ready to go to questions for Lamberto, Charlie, Francis and Giovanni.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris T. Schott \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much. I just had two questions here. First on the 063 study, can you help frame our expectations for that data relative to the response rate and survival rates we saw from the 003 study last fall, just trying to understand how we should be, obviously heard positive data, but how should we be thinking about that? And then just on timing, can you just update on ex-U.S. filing from Nivo, any comments there as always filing timelines for second-line lung for Nivo, just latest thoughts? Thanks very much.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, Chris. Let me just reemphasize, we have productive ongoing discussions with the FDA. The 063 data will be the basis for the rolling submission that we\u2019re going to be initiating in the next few days; and we will expect to complete that by the end of the year.","You\u2019ll understand that, we don\u2019t normally talk about the data before we present it in a scientific forum, and we are planning to present this data at the Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology in October of this year.","But what I would say is, our review of the 063 data really reinforces our belief in the potential Nivo to demonstrate an improvement in the long-term survival, which we believe will be important to lung cancer patients.","And personally, I\u2019m very happy to be moving forward with our first submission. As far a program outside the United States, the whole nivolumab program is a global program, the requirements differ in different parts of the world, and we are looking at providing, we won\u2019t be talking about specific timing details, but we are looking at submissions, once we\u2019ve seen the data from the squamous and non-squamous, non-small cell lung second line data, which we believe we will get the top line towards the end of the year. Thanks, Chris.","John Elicker","Great, Chris. Thanks for the question. Can we go to next one Jamie please?","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Yes, thanks for taking the question. So the first one around Eliquis seems like you are making some traction there. Obviously, the news around Pfizer and Astra generated a lot of excitement and interest. What just your thoughts Eliquis and your commitment there. I think a lot of you are wondering would you do something similar to what you do with two diabetes products and giving to Astra any thought that Pfizer to put you on Eliquis would you go into give that back? and then the second one a little more general on the IO side, it\u2019s good news on 063, you are moving very quickly here, all of your competitors are as well. Just how comfortable are you with the decisions? For example, with the frontline lung cancer, you\u2019ve moved into Phase III? The amount of data and you want to diligent to or what you\u2019re before making these decisions to move forward, how comfortable are you with the amount that you have there relative to other programs or you can take a little more time and do a little more careful analysis before deciding to make such a big decision? So if you could just talk to that that would be helpful. Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","So Vamil, I will start a very easy answer to your Eliquis question. No, we are not going to sell Eliquis to Pfizer. Yes, we are very committed to Eliquis. We people see around this table follow Eliquis to a great attention. We are extremely pleased of how prescription trend is improving, we are looking with particular attention with new prescriptions in the field of cardiologists, because we believe that, that our primary focus now and by building a solid position of our product in that group of specialists will generate prescription also in primary care. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes this is Giovanni. Let me just make a couple of comments to go into some further detail on the performance of Eliquis in the first quarter. We had a really good quarter across the board in all markets, specifically with respect to the U.S. As Charlie mentioned, we continue to see really good trend in cardiology. We also are seeing a significant improvement in trends in the primary care setting. In cardiology, our new patient share is now at 37% and in primary care it\u2019s in the 25% range, and all of those represent significant growth versus the previous quarter, really good developments. We\u2019re obviously ahead of production in this setting and we are continuing to strength our position overall there. That\u2019s the result of the investments we made beginning with the second part of last year that are really generating positive momentum and good results for us.","With respect to international markets, I\u2019ll just make a couple of comments there. Germany is clearly one of our key areas of focus and we are seeing acceleration of our growth in Germany where our new patient share now is above products and growing very nicely. And then the third market I\u2019ll mention again is Japan where as of the end of February, our limitations in terms of reimbursement was lifted 12 months after approval. We\u2019ve seen a very significant acceleration of our growth in Japan where our new patient share is already above products. In the switch market, we have a leading share of new patients with switches coming from all agents that are currently in the market.","And then obviously we have a number of countries where we are launching. We\u2019ve launched more recently like France and Italy and the trends are quite solid in those markets as well.","Charles Bancroft","And we keep adequate.","Lamberto Andreotti","Daniel, thank you very much. I would say we\u2019re very comfortable with the work we\u2019ve put in our exploratory programs in lungs that to support the first line Phase III study. This comes really from the steps in the breath of our experience starting with the overlay, a very broad portfolio with studies, we now have with Nivo, specifically around lung cancer, as you\u2019re aware, we have four Phase III studies \u2013 sorry four registrational studies, three Phase III studies, two in line, one in first line, and one thing I\u2019ve learned in my career is that the time you spent trying to understand that the medicine at the beginning of the exploratory phase really does save time \u2013 save time later on.","And I would comment around the combination of Yervoy, Nivo in lungs that the 012 study continues, it\u2019s actually providing very important information for us to design our trial, and we are on track to start that fourth Phase III study by the end of the year.","John Elicker","Thanks, Vamil. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Francis, just if I could follow up please on the rolling submission of the 063. It sounds like, I mean as you said that that FDA will have the opportunity to consider other studies that are ongoing, the Phase III second-line study. What is the issue, do you think, because we had anticipated that with response rates to build response, safety, plus the ability to supplement 063 with the data from 003, what is the focus of discussion with FDA? Is it lack of statistical significance in ORR, given that this is a small patient population? If you can just, please provide us color on what precisely the FDA is looking at and what additional data you might be able to supply? And then secondly, do you have strategies in place to accelerate the melanoma indication? Thanks very much.","Francis Cuss","Thank you, Jami. I do understand your desire to understand our interactions with the FDA. and I\u2019m sure you will appreciate that since we have ongoing interactions, I\u2019m not going to talk about the specifics of this. But what I will say is our review of the 063 data does reinforce our belief in the potential of Nivo in terms of long-term improvements and survival in lung cancer patients. And there is considerable data, which is going to come from the Nivo clinical development in the second half of the year, which will provide opportunities for the FDA, should they need it to see that?","Turning to the melanoma program, we have a very comprehensive program, and it's progressing really well. As you know, we have three registrational studies. The second-line study of Nivo monotherapy post-Yervoy and two first-line, one with Nivo monotherapy and with Nivo and Yervoy combined. All the studies are focused on demonstrating the value of survival benefits, but we do have additional objective response, end points in all those studies and the option is doing interim analyses.","When we get the data from our interim analysis, if it should be favorable, obviously, we will be talking to the health authorities about that. Overall, I\u2019m very encouraged by the progress of the Phase III programs, and we are exploring all the opportunities we have for accelerating those filings.","John Elicker","Thank you, Jami. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead?","Tim Minton Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just going to ask one another question on 063. Can you at least rule out that the question at hand here is not related to biomarkers, and PDL-1, expression? And then on your general approach to looking at PDL-1 expression, is the current plan to stay with the exact same day go assay that you\u2019ve been using, I'm wondering if there\u2019s \u2013it\u2019s possible that you might change that assay, because the assay so far hasn't really seem to kind of show the same types of findings that we\u2019ve seen with Merck and Genentech.","And then on ipilimumab once we get PD-1 on the market, what are your expectations for how ipilimumab might be kind of the sequenced when physicians are trying to decide which drug to treat a new melanoma patient with?","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, Tim. First of all, let me say we have a comprehensive biomarker strategy where all the patients in our trials have tumor taken and positivity for PDL-1 taken. I think it's premature to make any determination yet about, for any particular tumor, about the relationship between PDL-1 positivity, and response, overall response. But our aim is to understand that better, so we can understand by monotherapy and the combinations across the entire population, not just the PDL-1 positive patients.","As far as the data or assay is concerned, we\u2019re very comfortable with our assay, it\u2019s performing well. We like very much the partnership with Deko, and I think it\u2019s the very different assays between us and everyone else, and I think it's premature to take any determination about which is best. We are comfortable with ours as far as our dataset is concerned. Let me pass it over to.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, Tim this is Giovanni. Just a couple of comments on, I guess Lamberto and Charlie mentioned we had a really strong quarter for Yervoy around the world. In the U.S., we had the strongest quarter in terms of sales since launch, and we are seeing a continuing growth of the use of the Yervoy in the academic setting, but an acceleration also, the growth of Yervoy in the community setting. And I think that\u2019s clearly the result of all the work we have done to communicate the value of the data supporting Yervoy.","Obviously, as you know at the beginning PD-1 agents in melanoma would be used primarily in the second line setting, positive Yervoy, and so in the short-term, we believe that there will be continued growing adoption of Yervoy in the marketplace, and the trends we are seeing today are quite consistent with that. Obviously the melanoma market will change significantly over the next few weeks for a few months, and next few years, but we believe that it will be continued need for the use of Yervoy and continued use in Yervoy.","Some of it may be in monotherapy, potentially Yervoy can have a really important role to play in combination with other agents in melanoma, and obviously, we will be presenting some data in the adjuvant setting at ASCO. And that is also a very promising area for us with Yervoy.","John Elicker","Thanks, Jamie. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead?","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swamm, LLC","Oh, thanks a lot. Thanks for the questions. So, maybe first off, as we think about the prospects of the survival study that\u2019s ongoing in squamous non-small cell lung cancer and non-squamous, can you just update us on the timing, do you still expect both studies to complete towards the end of this year in the head-to-head versus this type of study.","Can you clarify the primary end point in those studies? I realize that they are ongoing survival studies, but there, particularly the squamous study is quite small. So, I\u2019m wondering, if that primary end point is response rate there, if you can just clarify that for us.","And then, lastly, as we think about the expectations of what we could see disclosed and discussed as it relates to CheckMate 012 at ASCO. I think, really the question is, the reasons can you just offer us the reasons why CheckMate 012 did not make it as an oral abstract session presentation unlike some of your data in kidney cancer, and your data in melanoma. Thanks so much.","Lamberto Andreotti","Good morning, Seamus. So, as far as the survival the non-small cell lung second line squamous, non-squamous studies, the primary end points for overall survival, although, objective response rate is included in that. As you know, this is an event-driven study. But, our projection is that we will see top line data at the end of the year.","As far as, CheckMate 012 is concerned, I\u2019d just remind you that, this was an exploratory study. It had many arms as you know, it actually is still ongoing. And so in other order, the data is yet mature for presentation, and we took the view of separating the different arm to different treatments into different presentations to allow a little more detail to appear in the presentation.","What I would reiterate is that, it\u2019s a very important study for us in terms of designing Phase III combination study of Nivo and Yervoy. And we are on track to initiate that study in lung by the end of the year.","John Elicker","Thank you. Thanks, Seamus. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from John Boris with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","John T. Boris \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for taking the question. And it will be really just directed on ATV. I guess question for Lamberto, it would appear that you could be in a position to be able to launch not only in Japan, but potentially in Europe and U.S. Can you maybe just give some commentary on the readiness of your commercial organizational reports of this opportunity?","And then, more specifically for Giovanni in Japan, with your product concept has been of the combination agent that you have there and with the Japanese market being a more safety conscious market, how are you prepared to potentially position that compound in that marketplace, and the second part of it for Giovanni would be, on usefulness pricing, are you anticipating premium pricing going into that market, and what\u2019s the range that you might be able to attract on usefulness pricing.","And then, lastly, I think you have more than 300 reps in that market with the crossover with selling Baraclude in that market and are you rightly scaled? thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","Okay. Long question, but I mean, let me start and Giovanni will continue. I think we have a good opportunity in HC. I think we have a good opportunity in HC in Japan, but the more I look into the products we have, into data we have, the opportunity in the U.S. and Europe are significant and meaningful. We are ready to launch in Japan and we are getting ready to launch in although beyond the geographies. We are not going to talk about pricing. This is obviously some feedbacks. We will talk about only after we launch \u2013 of the day we launch, but we are ready. And we are \u2013 we believe that we have a good opportunity. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. So John, let me expand on what Lamberto said and start from more general comment about launch readiness. as you know, we have a very strong presence in biology. We have a global brands with \u2013 brand with Baraclude that has given us a lot of experience and with working in hepatology and obviously, have a commercial footprint, which is promoting our HIV products. That is the \u2013 really the core of the organization and the resources that we will deploy to launch the hepatitis C portfolio around the world.","But obviously, in every one of our geographies, we will make incremental investments strengthen and broaden our teams and investments to launch hep C when we have approval. That\u2019s very much the case in Japan. As a reminder, Japan is the really one of the most successful Baraclude markets for us. We have an extremely high market share and really good penetration in the marketplace there. And so the sales and medical teams that we have promoting Baraclude will be deployed to promote the dual when we get approval potentially later this year.","We also have incrementally staffed the organization in Japan by increasing the number of reps and added a team, in order to be a really well resourced and we are ready to launch from a commercial perspective. With respect to the profile of the product as you know, we have executed at Japanese specific development program for the dual with Japanese patients, we have strong dataset and at the same time, the thought leader community in Japan is very knowledgeable about this combination and the profile of the two products. and clearly, we are conducting testing to be ready for launch and the results have been encouraging. So, we\u2019re quite excited about the opportunity in Japan. As Lamberto said, it\u2019s too early for us to comment on pricing.","John Elicker","Jamie, can we go to next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Baum with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Yes, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions, number one, with regard to the adjuvant Yervoy data in melanoma. Do you believe this data is to find both, and just want to confirm that you have been the full date-of-death? Second, following on from that question, can you provide an update of the real world experience and related to immune-related adverse events with Yervoy. Although this move into the no advanced testing that has addition relevance. And then, finally, just on Japan, my understanding is Gilead is maybe, 12, 18 months behind, given the existence of new patients comparing with distance your regimen in Japanese patients with the genotype, should I assume the revenue window of 18 months you demonetized before has faced significant market share erosion? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Andrew. As far as the adjuvant melanoma study, we\u2019re actually very excited that this is part of the ASCO press program. I want to point out this is the first study that\u2019s been reported for checkpoint inhibitor in adjuvant therapy for cancer. And as you know, that\u2019s a limited other options in adjuvant melanoma for patients. I think it\u2019s premature we not even presented the data yet talking about filing. But we have an event in [best invented] (ph) ASCO and I\u2019m sure we look forward to more discussions then.","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more to add really about real world adverse events on IO, sorry in Yervoy that very consistent I believe with what we showed in our [dosie] (ph). And as far as the Japanese funding of HCV, personally I will say we\u2019re very encouraged about the progress with that filing looking forward to getting on the markets. And I think it\u2019s probably premature stuff talking about competition. We\u2019re very comfortable with the unmet needed needs and the profile of our dual.","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes, I\u2019m not going to add that. It\u2019s always interested to see our company trying to profile our own products and with prematurely probably based on lack of information. So we\u2019re very excited about our Japanese opportunity and very excited about it long-term.","John Elicker","We\u2019ll go to the next question please Jamie.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Mark J. Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Hi guys, I really appreciate you taking the question. Number one on hepatitis C, I was just wondering if you would be willing to comment on whether or not your FDA application on the dual includes a request for approval for use in combination with Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi, that would be DAC plus Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi if possible.","And second just to build on Seamus\u2019 earlier question, just to be really clear on this, will the Street \u2013 we actually show the primary end point data of overall survival from the second line Nivo lung trials to the street by the end of the year, or is that something that we might have to wait until ASCO 2015 to see? And then finally at ASCO coming up in the 012 trial, are we going to see data from the low dose one plus one arm of the 012 trial or is that arm just still just too early to see it. Thanks a lot.","Giovanni Caforio","So thank you, Mark. As far as the I was trailing in the U.S. for the dual, I\u2019m not going to go into details about that because of it\u2019s under view at the moment. But it\u2019s certainly we will be seeking approval for the dual in genotype 1b in the United States. I\u2019m not sure I completely understood your question about the survival data. We will be getting survival data on the two Phase III studies, second line squamous and non-squamous in-house by the end of the year. And as you know, our custom is to present these data for scientific meeting before we share it with Wall Street. So I think it\u2019s a reasonable expectation that this will be at ASCO next year.","As far as the CheckMate 012 study in the low dose as I mentioned little earlier the number of these arms are still ongoing and that\u2019s one that is providing important data for us as we design the Phase III study and is not mature yet to present at Otsuka.","Lamberto Andreotti","Mark just to add one thing on the disclosure of overall survival of top line data, we would work very closely like we always do with our general counsel securities lawyers and other people and senior management before we determine what disclosure was appropriate. So as usual we would just need to wait and see what happened and we would make the right decisions at that time. Can we go to the next question Jamie?","Operator","Our next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, sorry about that. I have a number of questions on the immuno-oncology, but they should be pretty brief. I guess the first question is, should we assume the breakthrough designation is unlikely for Nivo at this point. Second, with respect to 063 the primary endpoint was response rate yet, I think you\u2019ve only talked about long-term survival of Nivo and third line Squamous as long as being encouraging. So can you just review the study design for us for 063. Third, with respect to the Phase III second-line squamous, clinicaltrials.gov indicate that that concludes in August. So, is that just incorrect and what is the right pace to think about if that\u2019s incorrect.","And then finally, with respect to ASCO, the combo lung trial I think has a little bit over 250 patients with 14 cohorts. Maybe you could just help us to understand how important the Nivo plus Yervoy, cohort is assuming that it\u2019s less than 20 patients. How should we be thinking about how important that very small dataset is and what weight should we be putting on that small dataset when we see it at ASCO? Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, David. So, first we\u2019ll breakthrough designation, the FDA has many mechanisms so as to being development of oncology drugs and I think as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we have fast-track designations for lung for melanoma and renal and in fact we are eligible for a rolling submission which is what was started \u2013 which Ruby started in the next few days. 063 just a little word about the study, it\u2019s in a highly pre-treated patient population. It has at least, the patients have at least two lines of therapy full hand many of them have more than that. The primary end point is as you say projective response rate have that of course we will be \u2013 we are continuing to monitor the patients as the study precedes. As far as the Second Line Squamous, the non-Squamous studies, as I mentioned these are event driven studies and our projection is that we will have top line data, formal analysis and overall survival at the end of the year.","And finally I think the way to look at the 012 study is that it's extremely valuable for us. I want to reiterate that it's proving very informative the different arms particularly around Nivo, Yervoy, as we come to design our registrational Phase III study for the combination in lung.","Many of the arms are not mature yet, so one has to consider that when you look at the data at ASCO. But we are, overall, very excited about all the data and there\u2019s lot always at ASCO. Thank you.","John Elicker","Jamie, I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Yes, just on the base business, maybe you could give us an update on Sprycel and Orencia, a little more detail what was going on there and market share boos and stuff, and you had mentioned Orencia in your prepared remarks, I was curious, if you can give us a little more detail what is out there. Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you Marc. This is our product set we are very proud of, and why don\u2019t we start with Sprycel, Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. Let me start with Sprycel. We had a good quarter as Lamberto mentioned with Sprycel, with strong growth across the world, very good performance in the U.S., good performance in Europe and acceleration of growth in Japan. We\u2019re continuing to see gains coming primarily from the first-line setting in the U.S. and across both lines of therapies in Europe depending on the registration and local market dynamics.","We continue in the U.S. to be above Tasigna in terms of our market share and the evolution of that share, particularly in first-line. We have seen continued erosion of the Glivec trends in the U.S. over the last few months, but in the first quarter that erosion has slowed-down, and we see somewhat of an increase of payers paying attention really to managing this category, but we are in a really good position from an access perspective. And as I said, our performance with Sprycel continues to be strong.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Orencia?","Giovanni Caforio","Orencia also is growing quite nicely around the world, you would remember the launch of the SubQ formulation which is really the driver of our growth at this point happened earlier in the U.S. and later in Europe and Japan, so the trends of Europe and Japan where you see more robust growth has really influenced by the more recent launches of the SubQ formulation.","In the U.S. we have seen a somewhat of a decrease in our growth and our trends have been softer in Q1, as you know, there are new agents on the market that are also growing and making that space and particularly the first-line setting more competitive. This is a very crowded market with a lot of action from payers and so it is a very competitive space.","We as Lamberto mentioned we have good plans in place to continue to focus on positioning Orencia, as a first-line choice rheumatoid arthritis. We have plans in place to strengthen our execution, increase resourcing the brand, so we\u2019re confident that the good growth trends will continue. The first quarter in the U.S. was somewhat slower in terms of the overall trajectory of the brand.","John Elicker","Jamie, can we go to our last question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. First, on the competitive landscape, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re merged in a situation with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Obviously immuno-oncology is a big reason for it and we now have the potential to be a large competitive market. Do you believe you have the commercial scale to compete effectively in immuno-oncology if that merger were to go through or should we expect additional commercial build up? And my follow-up, for Francis, on your recent acquisition, could you comment on the expense, which you think you would be exploring to sell assets in Alzheimer\u2019s disease? Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","So Alex, as I talked, I think that we are more than ready to compete in immuno-oncology. And we obviously, are not only focusing on the possible new competitors that will come, but more eminent competitors are ready there. Yes, we are ready and we are ready in the U.S. and we are ready all around the world. So, nothing more to add there.","Francis Cuss","As far as the iPierian Tau monoclonal antibody is concerned, our primary focus is in PSP and potentially from (indiscernible) dimension, which also does \u2013 at least 57 patients have a genetic link. Clearly Tau may have a role to play in Alzheimer\u2019s. But I think in the first instance we are focusing on looking at patients who have particular unmet need that we can identify from their genetic mutations. So, now the nice thing about this asset is it fits well into an early stage portfolio that we\u2019re building in terms of addressing genetically-defined diseases. And in fact we are hoping it will be in the clinic by the end of the year or the beginning of next year. So we\u2019re very excited about this opportunity.","Lamberto Andreotti","So let me conclude. We have three comments on immuno-oncology. First of all, as I said at the beginning of this call, I\u2019m very happy that we will start very soon. There are information for 063. We are very much looking forward to ASCO and the additional need that we will be reviewing in the second half of this year.","And finally, we remain as confident as we\u2019ve been in the potential for immuno-oncology as evidenced by the scale of our program, the mid scale of our program and its continued expansion.","Thank you for being with us this morning to discuss our good first quarter and many other things to look forward throughout this year. Have a good day.","John Elicker","Thanks everybody. Thanks everybody for joining. If you have follow-ups, you should get a hold of Randy, Brian and I later this morning and through the afternoon.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Bristol-Myers Squibb 2016 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.","After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. John Elicker, you may begin your conference.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. With me this morning are Giovanni Caforio, our CEO; Charlie Bancroft, our CFO. Both Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks. And then joining us for Q&A as well are Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer and Murdo Gordon, our Chief Commercial Officer.","And before we get started, I'll cover the Safe Harbor language. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change.","We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We just finished another very good quarter. Sales across key markets and key brands were strong. We had important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio and an exciting ASCO.","We've entered the period of growth I discussed before, with 17% sales growth in the second quarter compared to last year. In fact, sales growth was 24%, excluding the impact from Abilify and Erbitux. On a non-GAAP basis our EPS of $0.69 represents a growth of 30% versus last year.","I will share a few of our highlights. And Charlie will then provide more details.","Starting with Eliquis. Global sales grew 78% from a year ago, as we continued to make progress towards our goal of becoming the number one novel anticoagulant. In the U.S. the second quarter continued the trend of strong Eliquis performance. For both AFib and VTE, Eliquis is the number one novel anticoagulant in total prescriptions among cardiologists and new to brand prescriptions across all physicians.","Outside the U.S. Eliquis is the number one novel anticoagulant in new to brand prescriptions in Japan and the number one NOAC in cardiology across a growing number of markets. We continue to see strong demand trends from key markets across the globe.","At the upcoming ESC Congress in August, we will be presenting additional real world data, supporting the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus other NOACs.","Regarding immuno-oncology, we've made great progress in transforming cancer care, with more than 80 global approvals around the world, including nine approved indications in the U.S. in less than 2 years. I am very proud of our accomplishments, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a","standard of care within its approved indications.","We continue to see strong execution from our R&D and commercial organizations.","During the quarter we saw strong sales performance for both Opdivo and Yervoy, with Opdivo growing 19% worldwide quarter over quarter. In the U.S. Opdivo sales were led by lung and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, Yervoy grew 32% versus last year, as the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen became the single most prescribed therapy in first line metastatic melanoma in the U.S.","In Germany we have seen strong uptake in first line melanoma and second line non-small cell lung cancer. In France we have approximately 80% of the PD-1 market. We are not yet recording revenues there, as formal reimbursement has not been obtained. And we are operating under an ATU. In Japan Opdivo became the largest oncology brand in June.","With respect to R&D, Opdivo is now approved in 54 markets worldwide. And we made some excellent progress in the second quarter.","In the EU Opdivo was approved for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and received expanded approvals for use in pre-treated renal patients, as well as broad use in pre-treated non-squamous lung patients.","The FDA granted a sixth breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for the potential use in previously treated patients with unresectable bladder cancer. And just last week both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency validated applications for the use of Opdivo in the treatment of head and neck cancer.","ASCO was a very important meeting for us. We presented broad data across 13 types of cancer, reinforcing our commitment to addressing significant unmet needs in a wide range of tumors. In first line non-small cell lung cancer, we presented unprecedented data from CheckMate -012, which strengthened our confidence that the I-O\/I-O combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy may improve upon long-term survival expectations for patients who express PD-L1.","In other tumors, such as small cell lung cancer and MSI high metastatic colorectal cancer, we presented encouraging data, which has the potential to broaden the benefit of Opdivo plus Yervoy. And we presented encouraging new data in bladder and more mature data in hepatocellular carcinoma, which speaks to the depth and breadth of our clinical program, as we establish the promise of I-O in additional tumor types.","I am confident we are making all of the right investment, from both an R&D and a commercial perspective, to continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.","Now before turning the floor over to Charlie, I want to highlight some news we shared earlier this week. Many of you know Fouad Namouni, as he has played a critical role in our immuno-oncology strategy so far. Fouad has been appointed to head of oncology development, reporting directly to Francis. In his new role Fouad will focus on our comprehensive portfolio strategy for oncology and on driving product development plans from the early development stage to commercialization.","We also announced that after more than 17 years Michael Giordano will be retiring from Bristol-Myers Squibb. I want to personally thank Michael for his many contributions since joining the company. Michael and his teams have led the development and approval of more than a dozen medicines, marking a successful drug development career.","Now looking ahead, I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. We have a significant opportunity for growth, driven primarily by Opdivo and Eliquis between now and 2020 and an exciting early portfolio of medicines with the potential to drive growth well beyond 2020.","Now I'll turn the floor over to Charlie for additional comments. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter, driven by strong demand from our key products, leading to 17% sales growth and 30% non-GAAP EPS growth over last year. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of about $0.02.","Let me start with a few additional comments on our sales performance. As Giovanni mentioned, Eliquis continues to do very well, with Q2 sales of $777 million. We continue to see strong TRx growth trends quarter on quarter, some of which was offset by the workdown in the quarter from the Q1 inventory build in the channel, as well as a higher Q2 Medicare liability.","Opdivo has become a foundational immuno-oncology agent. And that is reflected in its continued strong performance. Physician adoption of Opdivo remains strong in markets where we have launched and have reimbursement, with PD-1 shares of approximately 80% in the U.S. and in key international markets. With approvals now in 54 markets, international sales for Opdivo grew to $197 million in the quarter.","Sales in the U.S. grew 8% sequentially over first quarter, driven by strong demand growth, which was partially offset by wholesaler inventory movement of approximately $45 million.","Yervoy sales were down 19% versus last year, driven mainly by pressure internationally from the launch of PD-1 agents. In the U.S. Yervoy was up 32% compared to last year, driven by regimen use. We expect pressure to continue internationally, until we secure reimbursement over the next year, following our approval of the regimen in Europe for metastatic melanoma.","Daklinza had another good quarter, with sales driven mainly by strong demand in the U.S. and Europe in the genotype 3 patient population. We expect that competition from recently approved therapies will significantly impact the U.S. business in the second half of this year. In Europe we also expect significant impact once access is secured.","Empliciti sales in the U.S. were $33 million, as we continue to focus on gaining new trialists and driving demand in a very competitive relapsed refractory market.","Now I'll move to our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.3% during the quarter, down 100 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is primarily due to product mix, including the strong performance of Eliquis and the U.S. Abilify contract expiration.","MS&A was up 9% versus last year, driven by our investments behind new brands, including Opdivo, Eliquis, and Empliciti. This was partially offset by lower spend on established products.","R&D expenses were $1.1 billion in the second quarter. The increase in spending was primarily due to grants, Opdivo study supplies, and other immuno-oncology investments.","Other income was approximately $90 million, up versus prior year, which benefited from royalties we now receive on Erbitux, R&D expense reimbursement from our deal with ViiV, and higher diabetes royalties. This was partially offset by the writedown of our uniQure equity investment of $45 million.","As I mentioned last quarter, diabetes royalties are higher in the first half of the year, due to the tiering structure of our agreement with AZ. We therefore expect overall OI&E to be slightly lower in the second half of the year.","Business development remains a key priority and a strategic source of innovation for our company. During the quarter we announced the acquisition of Cormorant Pharmaceuticals and their novel antibody program targeting IL8, as well as four clinical collaborations that support our combination strategy for immuno-oncology.","Switching to guidance. We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.55 to $2.65. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen, we now expect the impact of foreign exchange on EPS to be $0.05 to $0.07.","I know our MS&A expense was higher than many of you expected during the quarter. This was primarily due to the timing of investments behind Opdivo. And we still expect MS&A to decrease in the low single digit range. We now expect R&D spend to increase in the mid-teens range, driven by investments in Opdivo and other immuno-oncology programs. This also accounts for the increased spending related to business development transactions completed this year.","The effective tax rate is now expected to be 22%.","As Giovanni mentioned, we are very pleased with the strong performance across the entirety of our company. And now look forward to your questions.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Giovanni and thanks, Charlie. Jamie, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A now. And just to remind everybody, in addition to Giovanni and Charlie, Francis and Murdo are here as well to answer any questions you might have. Jamie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Thank you for the questions. Three, please. First one to Francis. Given the CMM \u2013 CMII (sic) [CMMI] initiative for Medicare Part B, we're hearing there's some potential the program could be made voluntary. I'd be interested to know what you're hearing, given how it impacts reimbursements and potential use.","Second, CTLA-4 seems to be associated with more late response and pseudo progression than perhaps you see with PD-1. Thinking about your CheckMate -227 trial, how do we think about that within the context of PFS as a primary end point? Obviously the Merck data is supportive in this indication. But here we have the potential increased risk of pseudo progression. Again, just focusing on PFS.","And then finally, there was some provocative data from one of your competitors in third line metastatic colorectal cancer, non-MSI patients, combining a MEK and a PD-L1 agent. I think you're the only major PDx sponsor that doesn't have a MEK inhibitor in your portfolio. I understand there's lots of opportunities. But is this an area of interest? And are you pursuing such a combination with a MEK?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Andrew, this is Giovanni. Thank you for your questions. Before Francis addresses some of your I-O question, let me maybe just take the CMMI question. As you know there has been a draft proposal made, published by CMS. There have been a very large number of concerns raised and questions and comments made that are being reviewed.","And while we don't have an exact timeline with respect to the publication of a potential final rule, obviously that is what we are waiting for.","I would say that what many stakeholders really have been concerned about is the possibility that changes that are suddenly introduced in the reimbursement mechanism for part B products may have an impact in where patients are treated and may lead to a reduced capacity to treat patients in the community, which obviously would not be good for patients and would create significant burden for hospitals. And so that is one of the elements we will be looking for, because obviously it's critically important for patients.","With respect to the rule becoming voluntary, that we will have to see. Clearly this is a time in which there are multiple other pilots in the market. And therefore, a voluntary rule may enable physicians to participate in one pilot and not have a very complex set of schemes they have to operate under at the same time. So I would leave it at that.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Andrew. As you correctly note, pseudo progression was an issue in the early days of I-O with Yervoy. But because we've generated a lot of data now with Yervoy monotherapy \u2013 and of course with the combination. Of course we have the benefit too of looking at that data before we designed our -227 study. And I can assure you we've taken it into account as we've set up the designer study. So we don't believe there will be an impact on the way we've done our study here.","Talking about CRC, we're focused on diversifying across a very broad range of differentiating mechanisms of action and evaluating different combinations with I-O. Based on those where we have a biological rationale, in particular tumors, and particularly where we're not seeing sufficient activity with Opdivo monotherapy or Opdivo\/Yervoy regimen \u2013 and that would include colorectal cancer.","Now as you said Roche presented phase 1 data in combination \u2013 of their PD-L1 in combination with the MEK inhibitor. And I agree. While the data was early and the size of the study was small, the combination did appear to show activity.","We continue to look for combinations both externally or internally with our several early stage assets, which would help us to identify patient populations and mechanisms. And certainly CRC is a focus for that.","I would just comment that we presented in the MSI nonstable or the MSI high patient population. Very interesting data, not just at monotherapy but combination at ASCO. And so there are some parts of CRC where we think our regimen will have an effect. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, with respect to U.S. Opdivo sequential momentum, could you just talk about some of the pushes and pulls that will influence the third quarter Opdivo U.S. sales sequentially, versus the second quarter that you just reported?","And then with respect to the upcoming first line trial results, assuming that Bristol hits on the first line trial primary end point in high expressers, how would that impact I guess the likelihood of hitting on the secondary PFS end point in all positive patients? And could you also please talk about how you're thinking about the OS assessment in this trial and some of \u2013 maybe you could just provide some color on whether you think you can hit on OS if you hit on the primary and secondary end points of PFS? Thank you.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Dave. I'll take your first question and then pass over to Francis for the second question on the first line study. We're very pleased with the quality of the earnings in the second quarter and very pleased with the demand performance of Opdivo. And seeing strong \u2013 continued strong demand trends across all of our approved indications, as well as seeing really high quality execution gives us confidence that we'll be able to continue strong demand moving into the third quarter.","Obviously there are some dynamic events that will occur throughout the back end of the year, including first line lung data evolution as well as head and neck indications, which have PDUFA dates for us and our competition in the second half of the year. We also continue to look to prepare the market as we focus on PD-L1 testing for that first line commercial execution later in the year.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, David. So let me just take you through the analytical hierarchy here in the -026 study. So as you recall, if the primary end point of PFS is \u2013 in the strongly expressing patients is met, we will then also look at the total randomized population. That includes all those that expressed a greater than the 1% level, which represents about 70% of the first line patient population.","If we hit PFS at the greater than 1%, we can then test for OS in both strongly expressing and the greater than 1%. Now just to remind you, overall survival is a secondary end point in CheckMate -026. And we can still file without a positive OS result.","Now the selected population of high expressers is not 50%. So we should be able to describe the effect at 50% cut off, once our analysis is complete.","And just to finish, as I've noted in the past and I'll note again today, I'm confident in the study design of -026. And I look forward to seeing the data in weeks, not months.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, David, for the questions. Can we go to the next one, Jamie, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just another one on I-O combos. You guys have done a great job going back and optimizing the Opdivo\/Yervoy dosing schedule, which I thought was evident at ASCO. So couple questions. How much of a priority is this over other more novel I-O combinations? Would you go back and maybe repeat some of the earlier phase 1\/2 studies? And then the third part of is, how much recent payer push back have you seen on the cost benefit of this combo in melanoma for example?","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Geoff. So first of all, let me say we were very gratified at the progress we've been seeing in the regimen in a number of tumors now. As you saw at ASCO, in many cases where we see benefit with Opdivo, we see further benefit with the regimen. So we \u2013 this is a high priority for us to expand our understanding of where the Opdivo\/Yervoy regimen will play.","As far as the dose is concerned, it's becoming evident that not all tumors have the same dose. We're not altogether certain what the biology behind that is. But we think it's significant. And we are paying great care to the dose, because we believe it will be relevant in terms of delivering the optimal value of the regimen, which as you see in the -012 data we presented, really does lead to fast and rapid responses, which in the past in melanoma has led to prolonged survival. So we're very optimistic about that.","Now that being said, we are not trading off our excitement about the Opdivo\/Yervoy regimen against the next wave. And we are certainly accelerating our efforts, bringing more compounds into the clinic and are looking particularly in areas where Opdivo monotherapy and the combination are not as effective as we would like.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","And, Geoff, your question regarding payer push back on the combination of Yervoy plus Opdivo in melanoma. I can tell you we've been really pleased in the performance of Yervoy plus Opdivo in first-line melanoma. And now we are the most frequently prescribed regimen or treatment in first line melanoma \u2013 metastatic melanoma setting.","In the U.S. we enjoy very, very good access, greater than 90% open access to the combination. And in fact, the reimbursement process with the regimen is going \u2013 for melanoma is going very well across Europe with recent positive recommendations in the U.K. in NICE, which as you know is a very, very high threshold. What's driving that obviously is the very strong efficacy and the appreciation of the durability of the long term survival benefit.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a few questions. Charlie, first maybe for you. Can you elaborate further on the $45 million channel draw down in Opdivo? That's just surprising given the \u2013 we're in the early days of what has been a very rapid launch. And I'm kind of surprised to see a draw down. Can you explain why that happened? Because if you look at IMS and Symphony data, U.S. sales should have been running around $680 million. So yeah. How we should think about that?","Secondly, maybe to \u2013 I don't know who can take this? But Lilly on their call the other day said that they thought that front line lung is already 20% penetrated by PD-1, specifically in squamous lung cancer. Are you seeing off label use in front line lung? And if so, is that about the level that you're seeing?","And then, thirdly, maybe for you, Francis. When should we expect an interim look for CheckMate -227? And on that note, is there the opportunity for publication of CheckMate -012? And is that \u2013 would that be included in guidelines? Thanks very much.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jami, this is Charlie. I'll take the first part of your question. So related to Opdivo sales in the U.S., our out movement, so our sales to the channel, was 17%. So that's indicative of how we view demand. And as we look at the inventory with our wholesalers, that actually on a per month basis dropped slightly from what we had on a percentage basis from in the first quarter going into the second quarter.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. So we're seeing strong demand there, Jami. And we feel good about the out movement from wholesaler into the different channels that we serve.","When we look at the data that other companies like Lilly have reported on their performance in front line squamous cell carcinoma \u2013 and just a reminder, that's the smaller segment of the front line market, representing about 25% to 30% of total front line patients. We are seeing a bit of off label usage there. We've maybe got penetration in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% by our calculations and estimates, from some very thin data that we look at that tracks that. And then in non-squamous, I would stay it's much lower. It's about 5% in front line off label use.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Jami. So first of all, let me say that we will be publishing the -012 data. But we don't see that as our definitive registration opportunity.","Of course, -227, the situation there is we have estimated the final read will be in early 2018. But like all our studies we have a good \u2013 we've built in optionality. There is, as you know \u2013 well there's basically two studies there, one that's in expressives and one in nonexpressives. We are very happy with the recruitment. And it's likely that the expressive will read out first. And since it is a dual end point of OS and PFS, we've certainly \u2013 should the data be positive, would possibly have an opportunity to look at PFS somewhat earlier.","So the way we've set up the studies gives us a lot of optionality and a lot of opportunities to take good data that we see earlier, should that be the case. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Can we go to the next question, please, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions and good morning, everyone. Just maybe following up on one of the questions earlier around the -026 study and the PFS and the OS discussion. Maybe if you can \u2013 I know you expressed high confidence in the study being successful and the parameters that you'll do in terms of statistical analysis. But if you only were to hit PFS and not hit the overall sideline (30:22) point, can you just talk about how you think about that from a commercial perspective? Given what \u2013 we haven't seen the data yet, but at least the press release from Merck suggesting that they were able to achieve PFS and OS in the population that they studied.","And then second, I was just \u2013 separate topic on Orencia. Was just impressed by the performance there. And I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the underlying trends that you're seeing with that product? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, good morning. This is Giovanni. Let me just make a couple of comments, and then maybe Murdo can address your question specifically with respect to Orencia.","Let me just go back and say that first of all, I'm very pleased with our performance in lung cancer in the U.S. and internationally. When you look at our quality of execution, the penetration in both squamous and non-squamous, and the market share we have in second line, there is clearly broad acceptance of Opdivo in the physician community and familiarity with the use of the product, based on the strong data. And I think that will be a really important point for us going forward, because in lung cancer, Opdivo clearly has become the foundational therapy.","We're also very pleased that we are seeing similar dynamics happen in every international market in which we have obtained reimbursement at launching. And overall, we continue to maintain a very high percentage of total PD-1 sales in the 80% range.","As we think about our lung cancer strategy going into first line, as Francis mentioned, we are very confident in our understanding of the disease, of Opdivo, and in the design of the clinical trial. And overall, I would say in the long term we're also very comfortable with our strategy that has a really strong pillar in monotherapy. But then over the next year or so, we'll transition into the potential use of the combination therapy.","So we feel we are very strongly positioned in first line today. And we have a really solid strategy for maintaining a leadership position going forward, as immuno-therapy moves into the first line setting.","We will have to look at the study once we obtain the results of the study to really understand the data. And as Francis said, we are weeks away. We're not months away. And we'll be obviously prepared to communicate the data when we have it.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes. And, Vamil, related to Orencia, we're really pleased with how we're seeing Orencia evolve. At the beginning of last year we launched a campaign to focus on the early rapidly progressing patient. And given the size of this market, it takes some time for a new focus patient type to really take hold in the marketplace.","And I can see now across the world, emerging strengthening trends in Orencia. In the U.S. in particular, we're seeing very good evolution of our subcu formulation of the product. And in major markets across Europe we also see good acceleration of the subcu performance.","We have an additional catalyst for growth in Europe with new labeling that allows Orencia to be promoted for methotrexate-naive patients with moderate progressive disease. So that also gives us an opportunity in the latter half of the year.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. If I could go back to -026 trial and the topic of first line lung. I know we haven't seen Merck's full results. But did it surprise you that Merck hit both PFS and OS in their first line trial? And do you have any visibility on the degree of crossover that you have in your trial that could naturally impact the achievement of overall survival? And another question on this topic is, is ESMO still the most likely venue?","And last question has to do with the cutoff. You haven't been willing to reveal that in the past. I'm wondering why? I understand it's a 5% cutoff. I think the market assumes 10%. I'm wondering if you're kind of keeping that close to the vest to allow you the flexibility to actually change that cutoff point before database lock?","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Tim, Good morning. A lot of questions there. So let me start. As far as Keynote-024 is concerned, it's hard for me to comment without having the trial design and the enrollment details in terms of the crossover. Just to remind you, both studies allowed for PD-1 therapy after progression on chemo. And we're not actually aware of any technical differences that would create a difference in the crossover.","Now as you know, there's always a possibility that OS may be compounded in an open trial. And that's why we paid a lot of attention to the timing of the analysis. I mentioned that over the last few months.","We also made sure that the CheckMate -026 protocol that the patients on chemo were required actually to have their progression confirmed centrally before they were allowed to receive Opdivo. That's important, because that reduced the amount of wobble around that.","So again we think it's always an issue. But we think we've minimized that in terms of getting a potential result, both in terms of PFS and of course OS.","We will as usual be looking for the earliest opportunity to present the data at a conference and publish it. And I'll say again, we're not going to talk about the high expressor cutoff at this point. But you obviously will have an opportunity to see that when we talk about the data. Thanks very much.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Tim. Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Your line is open.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the questions. Just a couple here. Maybe just \u2013 can you guys \u2013 I mean this question is for Charlie. Can you just remind us where you book royalties from Ono for Opdivo Japan? And what that actually contributed in the quarter to international? It actually looked quite strong. So just wondering if that was a meaningful contributor.","The second question, in terms of the France sort of reimbursement delay but active treatment. When would you anticipate having active reimbursement? And should we expect that to be a bolus payment, similar to what we saw for Daklatosphere (sic) [Daklinza] I believe it was last year.","And then the last question. If we think about the PFS benefit and having success on a PFS endpoint, is it a natural conclusion that OS would have a very good chance of succeeding at the same time? Or is it possible that the study could continue to track for overall survival? And perhaps the PFS end point succeeds, but you're directionally positive on OS, but not yet statistically significant? That's the last question. Thanks.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Seamus. This is Charlie. So we book the Ono royalties in revenue under what's called alliance revenue. And the amount for the quarter was approximately $150 million (sic) [$50 million].","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. Your second question, Seamus, related to France is actually just a clarification. So we do have funding in France for Opdivo across our labeled indications. What we haven't done is negotiated a final price to formalize the reimbursement. And that's why we haven't recognized revenues yet.","And you're correct in recalling Daklinza. It's a very similar situation. Once we establish an agreed upon price with the French reimbursement authorities, we'll recognize that revenue. And it would appear as a single bolus number.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Seamus. So let me say we do understand of course that OS and PFS tend to go together, but it's not a foregone conclusion that PFS and OS will go the same way. Although we do understand and have set this up with every possibility that that would be the case. And we \u2013 of course we hope that it will be.","As far as weight \u2013 and I would just add that obviously we've had approval based on PFS alone. So there's \u2013 and that was the case with the combination melanoma. So just having PFS alone certainly gives us a good opportunity to make a submission to move very quickly.","Just as far as I think it's unlikely, but certainly not impossible that one won't \u2013 that it's unlikely that we would get OS later if we don't see it at this point. But of course we continue to follow our patients over a long period of time, and we will be following that.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a few quick ones here. Maybe first on just the -227 enrollment. I guess when do you expect enrollment to be complete here? And has the expressor arm of that study, is that fully enrolled at this point?","My second question was looking ahead to the commercial dynamics of the PD-1s in front line lung. How do you see testing requirements impacting the rate of uptake in front line? Should we be thinking of this similar to some of the prior indications, where PD-1 use quickly moves up to like 60% or 70% usage? Or would we expect this to be a bit more gradual ramp, as physicians need to think about adopting the PD-1 testing? Thanks.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Chris, good morning. So just to remind you, the -227 is really two large, separate studies, expressives and non-expressives. We've been very pleased with the enrollment. And the express \u2013 enrollment is indeed complete.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. And, Chris, on testing. As you know right now, testing in the overall lung market is quite low, with about a third of patients being tested overall. Two-thirds of those patients are front line patients, because of difficulty in sourcing tissue availability in second line treatment.","We do feel that it is the intent to prescribe a PD-1 that will drive PD-L1 testing. And given that the label for at least both us and our competition will require PD-L1 testing, we do feel it will drive quicker in front line than it has in second line. You've got tissue availability, and you've got a need to test.","As far as using analogs for it, I'm not sure I can guide you on that, given that in the immune checkpoint inhibitor market in general, we have seen fairly rapid evolution. So I would say I would err on the side of a very fast uptake of PD-L1 testing in front line.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And maybe just, Seamus, to add on a related topic. My perspective is that when you look at what our experience has been in second line, I believe that going into first line, it will continue to be extremely important to have data and the label that enable physicians to treat the largest patient population that can benefit from a product like Opdivo.","Because what we have learned in second line clearly is the desire of patients to move up, away from chemotherapy, and physicians to treat lung cancer patients with Opdivo. Going into first line, having a data and potentially an indication in a significantly broader patient population will continue to translate into an important element for us. And I agree with Murdo that given strong data, we don't see testing as a limiting factor in first line.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just on the HCV franchise. I wonder if you could just talk us through a little bit about your thoughts, particularly on the ex-U.S. sales for that franchise over the next few quarters? And how we should think about that? It was obviously a bit stronger than expected today.","And then secondly, earlier today on their call AstraZeneca were talking about I-O combination pricing, hinting that they think the I-O biologics combination, that the PD-L1 part of that, the price may be set. And it may be the CTLA-4 side of it that they think, if I-O combinations in lung cancer for example become much more common, that that takes the hit from a pricing perspective. I wonder if you can just give your thoughts around that? How you may want the healthcare system to deal with pricing of I-O combinations? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, let me just take the I-O combo pricing question, and then Murdo will give you some perspective about dynamics in HCV.","I will go back to what we said a few minutes ago at the beginning. Our experience is that given strong data and significant patient value, payers are providing access to combo regimens in I-O.","And when you look at the evolution of combination regimens, depending on the dose of different agents and the frequency of those, the incremental cost to payers is very sustainable. Because when you look at our regimen in melanoma for example, during the phase of induction, which is the 12 weeks in which two products are used together, the cost of induction is only 6% higher than monotherapy.","And then when you look at the regimen that we are taking into -227 for lung cancer, there is a lower dose of Yervoy, which is administered every 6 weeks.","So all of that to say that at this point we continue to think about the regimen that has the strongest data in the label and offers the most value to patients and the one that is reimbursed. And one that is reimbursed by payers and adopted in the marketplace.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Jeff, regarding our Hepatitis C franchise, we have seen a maturation of our business in Japan. New competitive entrants have significantly reduced our performance there.","In Europe however, we continue to sustain a very high penetration of the genotype 3 patient population with market shares in the range of 70% to 90%, 90% being in France.","However, with the advent of velpatasvir combination with sofosbuvir, as they secure reimbursement, we would expect downward pressure on our business across Europe as well.","And I know you didn't ask about it. But in the U.S. that would be a similar theme. We would expect in Q3 a decline in our Hep C business. I will say, very proud of the teams at BMS who work in this franchise and what they've done. They've shown outstanding execution and real focus and really making a very de-prioritized, let's say, opportunity, that some people may have looked at into a very good one for the company.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. A couple of clean-ups for Charlie. First, can you provide what you'd call a normalized Eliquis sales number for the U.S. in the quarter, excluding those variables you mentioned?","And on Hep C in the U.S., does the second quarter sales level reflect some inventory pruning ahead of the hit that you expect? Or could we see a very dramatic sort of hit in third quarter, well beyond just what scripts would suggest?","And perhaps for Francis. Maybe you could offer some context around your recently announced new study for your products combined with Rova-T? As well as when some of that key data may read out. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","So thanks for the question on Eliquis. Total prescription volume for Eliquis grew 14%. So that would give you a good demand indicator. We did have some inventory movement quarter over quarter. But given the strength of the TRx demand performance, we're seeing a very good trend there on Eliquis. And we think that we'll continue to drive a very strong back half of the year.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And, Gregg, on Hep C, as aclusa (48:10) continues to get formulary listings, we expect a fairly dramatic drop off beginning in the third quarter.","Let me just correct something I said earlier. The Opdivo sales in Japan that we book is about $50 million in the quarter.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Gregg, thank you for that question about Rova-T. So small cell lung cancer is a very important part of our broad lung cancer strategy. And as you saw we have some very interesting data that we presented at ASCO around monotherapy. And particularly the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy together.","And we're actually very pleased about the collaboration with AbbVie, because we \u2013 it's exploratory in nature. But we're exploring the safety and the activity and the sequencing of Rova-T together with Opdivo alone and Opdivo\/Yervoy in patients who have previously failed platinum treatment.","And I think there is \u2013 like many of these early studies, there's no specific timeline that one could point to. But obviously if we see promising data in a disease that really does need more options, we'll obviously be looking to move quickly into potentially registrational studies.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And, Gregg, let me just add to what Murdo had talked about on Eliquis. You may recall from my comments last quarter that we had an inventory build of about $40 million on Eliquis, which we worked down in this quarter. And we also had a $25 million adjustment to the coverage or pharmacy.","And we also in this quarter had a little slightly higher Q2 Medicare liability related to the donut hole. So there's a number of ins and outs related from the first quarter to the second quarter. And that's why I think Murdo, as he referenced, prescription trends is a better barometer for Eliquis.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. Two quick ones, if I may. One on Empliciti. I just wanted to investigate or at least get your comments on maybe the trouble that may be occurring, certainly getting Empliciti to patients having multiple myeloma. Is it because it's getting pushed later and later? And that is maybe even beyond third line? That's the first.","And the second. Francis, I've heard you mention the combination Opdivo\/Yervoy obviously being the hurdle to beat for other combinations. And I'm curious to date if you continue to believe that's the case? Obviously that combination are the data we have to date. But I'm curious if you would still say that's really the dogma at Bristol-Myers today? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah, so the first question on Empliciti, Tony, is \u2013 basically what we're seeing is a lot of competition with a lot of new entrants and new data coming into the multiple myeloma market. I would say we're still getting our indicated population. We are still seeing some second line relapse refractory patients, as well as later lines. We're watching this market closely. And we're being very specific in describing the patient type that benefits from Empliciti. So more to watch. This market's still very dynamic. And there's more that will happen there obviously in the future.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Tony, thank you. That's a good question, because clearly our aim is to develop regimens that really push out survival for patients as long as possible. And doing it with \u2013 as well as that great efficacy potentially, but also with a tolerable regimen. And I think we're beginning to show that that's certainly possible with Opdivo and the Yervoy regimen. And it's possible across many tumors, but not all.","But in our recent reorganization, this week actually, we are sort of facing the innovator's dilemma. And we certainly see the opportunity to take the next wave of combinations. And we've sort of separated out the group that will look at that, indeed to try and beat monotherapy \u2013 I'm sorry, to beat the Yervoy\/Opdivo combination.","So we're certainly not being complacent at all about this. And we're trying to set up a situation where overall we would want to have options for patients and certainly bring forward the best combination. And if we can beat Opdivo\/Yervoy or make it better in some way, we'll certainly be prepared to do that. And that's exactly what we're trying to do.","So we're not just putting our eggs all in one basket. We're keeping a very open mind and trying to drive forward to the great opportunities in I-O, which we think there are. And beyond I-O as well into other combinations.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And let me just add to what Francis said. Because I think this is a really important part of our strategy as a company. First, I would say we're very pleased with the potential of Opdivo and Yervoy. And it's clearly at this point, the only combination regimen that has demonstrated significant efficacy and an acceptable safety profile.","We started that work in melanoma. We've clearly in R&D expanded and progressed that work very significantly in lung cancer. I believe that the doubling of response across all levels of PD-1 expression versus Opdivo monotherapy in lung cancer in study -012 is extremely promising. And we are also challenging ourselves, and we have challenged ourselves to find the regimens that are tolerable, which we believe we have with the new regimen in lung.","At the same time we are taking this combination regimen to many more tumor types. And the data continues to be extremely promising. So it's really not a dogma. But in reality it is a proven mechanism of treatment of patients that is demonstrating clinical trial, at a clinical trial to have a really big role to play.","As Francis said, our objective is at the same time to continue to accelerate new mechanisms of action into the clinic. That's why we have eight immuno-oncology agents into early development. And we will continue to work to raise the bar beyond what we think is already a very important accomplishment with Opdivo and Yervoy.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jamie, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","I'm sorry. Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. It's great to have Tim (55:24) back in IR.","Francis, I was going to ask a question a little bit of a different way. A year ago I think you were in my office with a group of investors, when they were extremely nervous \u2013 or maybe it was 2 years ago. They were extremely nervous about the second line trials. They weren't big enough. There wasn't enough \u2013 all kinds of stuff. And you basically said, look \u2013 what I remember is you basically said, look, these trials, we think they're designed well. We don't think they're risky.","I'm just wondering if your confidence level in -026 is similar for the all-comer population to that? And then also do you have any information on second line duration? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Francis first.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","So I can \u2013 it's a very short answer actually, Mark. Yes, I am confident in that we've done everything to do that.","I just want to take the \u2013 I think there's another part, which I just want to take an opportunity to call out the \u2013 our development, regulatory, and filing teams. Because I think there's another dimension to this, which is the speed aspect. And as you said, 2 years ago we were wondering how we'd deal with everything.","Now I think we've seen these teams deliver nine approved indications in 18 months. And what would be an exceptional performance for anyone else has become the norm for these folks. And I just know they're relishing the opportunity to get their hands on the data for -026 and to maintain or even exceed the performance they've already done.","So it's a very \u2013 they're a very excited team. And we're very confident in them to move this quickly forward. Thanks, Mark.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","And, Mark, on your question regarding second line duration of treatment. As I've said before, we need about 2 years of end market experience to determine what our actual duration of therapy is. So we're still light on that.","But we continue to use clinical trial experience and our PFS curves to estimate the number of months before a patient progresses. That's what we continue to use in all our forward-looking assumptions.","John E. Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Okay, Jamie. Thanks. Can we go \u2013 I think we have time, Jamie, for two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I was wondering if you'd be willing to give us a breakdown of Opdivo sales? And what indications it's coming from?","And second, outside of Opdivo and all the potential new indications, can you talk about what are some of the other updates on the pipeline that you can give us? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Marc, this is Giovanni. Let me just say on Opdivo, it's very difficult to give exact numbers by indication. These are relatively small data sets. They're very dynamic. Trends are clear. But we're not breaking down sales by indication by quarter.","The market share evolution, which we've communicated consistently in every one of the tumor types, represents a much better indication of where we are with penetrating every one of the opportunities.","Let me just ask Francis to give you a perspective on the rest of the pipeline outside of oncology.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Thank you, Marc. So while we have actually a sharp focus obviously on maintaining our leadership in I-O, we're also committed to having a diversified portfolio.

We've got a portfolio of now about 15 assets from preclinical through to mid stage. Many of them have the potential to be first or best in class.

Elicker - Senior VP-Public Affairs & Investor Relations","And can we go to our last question, please?","Operator","And your last question comes from Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the quarter. So a couple of quick ones. On the next wave of I-O assets, such as Lirilumab and Urelumab, can you just remind us of the timing of upcoming readouts?","And then secondly, on business development outside of I-O, just wanted to get \u2013 what are your therapeutic areas of priority right now? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Colin. Good morning. So basically we said we are going to talk about some of our next wave assets in the second half of the year. I can now confirm that we will be making disclosures at ESMO around the safety of Lirilumab in combination with Opdivo and Yervoy in advanced \u2013 in a number of advanced refractory solid tumors. Also the safety and preliminary efficacy of Fucosyl GM1 in relapsed refractory small cell lung cancer.","And we will actually talk about the FRACTION trial design. We'll talk a little bit about this adaptive phase 1\/phase 2 approach to speeding up our combinations.","And then after ESMO of course, you know there's SITC. There, we'll be talking about Urelumab \u2013 I'm sorry, Lirilumab and Urelumab, safety and preliminary efficacy of the combinations with Opdivo. And we'll talk for the first time about anti-LAG-3 safety and PK monotherapy in combination with Opdivo.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Colin, maybe let me just make a comment on business development before we close. Our areas of focus for business development, which as we mentioned at the beginning, remains a really important priority of the company. And really the therapeutic areas in which we've decided to focus our internal R&D effort.","So outside of oncology, which clearly is the priority, there will be cardiovascular medicine, immuno-science portfolio, fibrosis, some of the genetically defined diseases. Those are the areas in which our business development teams are active.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So with that let me close the call and thank all of you for participating. Again we had a very strong quarter. I'm very optimistic. It continues to validate our strategy, demonstrates the ability of the company to execute at very high level. It positions us well for the rest of 2016. And clearly at the beginning of a period of growth, it creates a really strong platform for future growth and success. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"4450":["Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Elicker","Thank you Greg [ph], and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining the call today. We do have a lot to discuss including the quarter, our full year results, 2019 outlook as well as some additional perspectives on our announced acquisition of Celgene. We will be using a slide deck today, so we did email it to you about 15 minutes ago. The slides are also available on our website.","Joining me today with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our Chairman and CEO, Charlie Bankcroft, our CFO and Chris Boerner, our Chief Commercial Officer, Tom Lynch is our Chief Scientific Officer and will also be here for Q&A. You\u2019ll see on slides two and three of today\u2019s presentation our legal disclosures. And with that on slide four, I will turn it over to Giovanni.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you John and good morning everyone. I am proud to speak to you today about excellent results in 2018 and the exciting outlook for the company in 2019 and beyond. As John said, let\u2019s start on slide four. Today, we will cover our 2018 financial results, the planned Celgene acquisition and how we are thinking about this in terms of the financials of the acquisition and the value we are creating for shareholders.","Before we start, I\u2019d like to address today\u2019s announcement on our FDA application for Checkmate-227 in high TMB non-small cell lung cancer patients. As you saw in our press release, we have decided to voluntarily withdraw the application. This is because following recent discussions with the FDA, we believe it is important to further characterise the interaction between the two biomarkers of TMB and PD-L1 in these patients in order to understand their relevance to overall survival in this setting. To do this, we will need data from Part 1A of CheckMate-227 that will not be available during the review period for this application.","I would like to emphasize that we continue to believe that TMB is scientifically important and we look forward to continuing to advance our research in this area.","Turning now to slide five and our 2018 results. I could not be prouder of our very strong performance for the quarter, which wraps up a very good year for the company. This was driven by excellent commercial execution on our priority brands and disciplined expense management that has driven improvement in our operating margin.","Commercial execution was strong across the portfolio with significant growth driven by our two key franchises, Opdivo and Eliquis. Our I-O franchise performed well throughout the year in highly competitive markets, and we have consistently demonstrated very strong launch capabilities.","During 2018, we saw very significant growth coming from Adjuvant melanoma and First-Line RCC in the U.S. And we are now working through the launch process in Europe having received approval for First-Line RCC in that market. Charlie will talk more about Opdivo a little later, and I will tell you that based on this strong momentum in the 18 [ph] business we expect to see growth for Opdivo in the U.S. and internationally in 2019.","Turning to Eliquis, we continue to see robust trends with Eliquis as the established number one NOAC globally and the number one OAC in the U.S. As I\u2019ve said before, we see considerable room for the market to expand with continued increased adoption based on the superior profile in atrial fibrillation that has made it a leader to date. Eliquis will continue to be a strong growth franchise for our company in 2019.","In addition to strong commercial performance, we have exercised disciplined expense management across our P&L, supporting significant earnings per share growth of 32%. Our focus on prioritizing investment in the most important opportunities will continue as we look to the planned integration of our company with Celgene.","Our 2018 results and the approach that guided them provide a solid foundation for future success. You\u2019ll see today that we have provided additional line item guidance that shows expectation of sales growth in 2019.","As I look back at our company\u2019s performance, I am pleased not just with our results from last year, but over the past several years. As I\u2019ve said many times, I believe a key part of our success has been our ability to execute very well against a consistent strategy.","Let me remind you of the key features of our strategy and explain why acquiring Celgene fits so well within that framework. Looking at Slide six, this is a slide you\u2019re very familiar with, because it\u2019s the strategy we\u2019ve been executing for over 10 years. Central to our strategy is bringing together the best of biotech, namely innovation and agility with the best of pharma, the resources and scale to create a leading biopharma company.","As I\u2019ve said, this strategy has enabled us to be very successful over many years and has delivered strong performance. And I like to take a few minutes to explain what I mean by that.","Now to Slide seven, an important component of our strategy has been to ensure that we are constantly operating ahead of the curve. We took a very focused approach to creating the company we are today with an unwavering focus on science and innovation. We exited primary care and focused on specialty care and unmet medical needs. We designed a strategy to externally source innovation, to build our priority therapeutic areas.","Importantly, the actions we\u2019ve taken have led to innovations that have helped transform diseases like atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, melanoma and RCC, and resulted in strong earnings growth. The innovation cycle that led us to Eliquis, Opdivo and Yervoy has delivered for patients, and at the same time has also delivered financially.","We believe that now is the right time to move to the next exciting chapter of our company with the acquisition of Celgene. It allows us to become an even stronger company for the long term bringing a breath to our business while remaining focused in key therapeutic areas that we know very well.","Slide eight is a slide you\u2019ve seen before, when we announced the acquisition of Celgene in early January. It provides an overview of how I am thinking about the combined company we will create, and I would like to call out the highlights.","We will create a top five immuno science and inflammation franchise, with Orencia and Otezlathe and two near-term product launches. We will have the number one oncology franchise with leadership in haematology and a pipeline that would sustain that leadership for the long term, along with a growing solid tumor franchise with Opdivo and Yervoy.","We are doubling our Phase I and II pipeline for many more possible new medicines. And we will gain platforms and capabilities important for scientific leadership in the future. None of this would be possible without the people of BMS and Celgene. We are creating a science leader, a leading scientific and innovation based company that we believe will be a destination for talent moving forward.","Moving on to Slide nine, I want to explain how I view this transaction from a financial perspective. As I\u2019ve described to many of you over the past weeks, we see an opportunity to create value for shareholders from day one. Let me walk you through these key points.","I believe, the combined company provides value to shareholders through a robust and complementary marketed medicines portfolio. The near-term launch of six new medicines, the doubling of our pipeline assets and the opportunities for synergies. The strong cash flow of the two companies would allow us to delever our balance sheet and strengthen our credit profile within two to three years, enabling a stronger balance sheet and increased flexibility.","As we modelled the combined company, I see sales and earnings growth now through 2025. Overall, I believe that the combination of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene will create a company that will be well-positioned for the second half of the next decade, better than each company alone.","Now let me turn it over to Charlie to walk you through our financials in more detail.","Charles Bancroft","Thank you Giovanni and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10. We believe this transaction will bring significant financial benefits to shareholders of both companies with three defined sources of value.","First is the value from the in-line portfolio of marketed products. This includes Revlimid which I know many of you have questions that I\u2019ll try to address in upcoming slides. The second source of value are the cost synergies of approximately two and a half billion that can only be achieved by combining the operations of the two great companies.","These two sources in total are substantial when you consider the transaction in aggregate. Lastly, we see significant opportunity in the Celgene pipeline, which includes five phase III assets, which are positioned to launch in the next 12 to 24 months, and a significant number of assets that are in phase I and II that will bolster our existing pipeline in oncology and INI as well as complementary platforms such as cell therapy and protein homeostasis.","Turning to Slide 11, when you look at the combined company on a pro forma basis, we see a stronger, more diversified set of opportunities that will enable us to drive growth, both on the top, and bottom line through 2025.","We see complementarity in the combined portfolio with near-term growth, driven mainly by the Celgene assets and subsequent growth driven mainly by BMS assets, particularly from I-O. This speaks to the strength of our in-line businesses, the short term growth potential from launches of new medicines, together with lifecycle opportunities from our I-O portfolio and a stronger late stage pipeline. The combination results in a much more balanced company, better positioned for the latter end of the next decade.","As we move to slide 12, the combined company will generate substantial cash flow that will allow us to reduce debt to quickly delever our balance sheet and strengthen our credit profile, while always subject to board approval, we have modelled continued dividend increases as well. So when I step back and think about the broad financial benefits of this transaction, I see a definitive path for value creation. The company that has significant growth potential over multiple periods and in a few years a reset balance sheet that allows us to complement our stronger internal R&D efforts, with a continued sourcing of external innovation from business development.","Quickly on Slide 13, we\u2019ve outlined a few assumptions in our models with respect to Revlimid and how we accounted for the pipeline assets. From an accounting perspective, we will include the Celgene stock based compensation in our non-GAAP P&L.","Now let me spend a minute discussing how we think about Revlimid and the outlook of our I-O franchise, since I know many of you had questions on each of those. Turning to Revlimid on slide 14. It\u2019s important to know that we performed extensive due diligence on the Revlimid IP situation, both independently and as part of the diligence process with Celgene.","We also had the opportunity to review confidentially the Celgene Nacho settlement and its impact on various litigation outcomes. With that in mind, we considered two bookend scenarios for Revlimid, one in which there is an early at risk launch, and another that is reflective of sell side consensus representing gradual erosion starting in 2022.","We believe both of these scenarios have a very low probability. In between these bookends, our several other litigation outcomes or potential settlements that could play out and in our view each are likely to have somewhat comparable implications on the Revlimid revenues in the near-term.","Our analysis assumes a more conservative approach than sell side consensus and results in lower sales between 2022 and 2026. Through any of these scenarios we see the combined company generating significant cash flows that will enable us to delever while delivering returns for our shareholders.","Now moving beyond Revlimid and the combination with Celgene, let me turn to page 15 and our I-O business going forward. As we think about the combined business, we continue to see Opdivo as a key growth pillar. But let me take a few minutes to lay out the opportunities ahead of us.","We\u2019ve demonstrated excellent launch execution and have driven growth through a broad set of new indications. Two launches that exemplify this high level of performance, our Adjuvant Melanoma and First-Line RCC in the U.S. Even with today\u2019s announcement, we still see Opdivo growing in the U.S. this year as our teams are well resourced to drive performance across key indications. As we think about our ex-U.S. business, while the dynamics are a bit different, we see growth there given the new launches in Adjuvant Melanoma and first-line renal.","Turning to the long term growth outlook for I-O, as I mentioned, for our clinical stage opportunities, we risk adjust the revenue potential. Given the breadth of opportunities, you can see on this slide, we see significant growth potential for Opdivo with the growth trajectory be determined by the cadence of new indications. Naturally for 2020, the growth outlook will depend on the data we see this year in lung and in other tumors. Now I\u2019m going to hand it over to Chris who will share his view on this six phase III assets that we\u2019ll be launching over the next few years.","Christopher Boerner","Thanks, Charlie. Turning to Slide 16. You\u2019ve seen this slide before. It shows how the combination of BMS and Celgene will create an exciting industry leading, late stage pipeline, including six near-term launch opportunities with more than $15 billion in non-risk adjusted revenue potential.","Three of these products are substantially de-risked, because the pivotal data are known or regulatory filings are well advanced, and the majority of these products are either first or best-in-class providing a meaningful opportunity to help patients across a number of disease areas.","To put this potential set of launches into context, I want to provide you with some background as to why we are excited by them and why they give us the basis for sustained leadership in key therapeutic areas moving forward. In INI we will be moving from being two companies each with a single product to one INI franchise delivering Orencia and Otezla right away with the potential of adding ozanimod and TYK2 in the near future.","And in haematology, we see for assets that form the first step to building on the current capabilities that Celgene brings with this Revlimid business today to establishing sustained leadership in this space. We view these near-term launches as exciting opportunities and key drivers of value in the combined company. And I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to walk through these six up upcoming launches in more detail.","Let me start with Luspatercept on slide 17. A very exciting compound from our perspective which is a potential first-in-class Erythroid Maturation Agent to address chronic anemias. As you may know, chronic anemias present a serious, unmet medical need across various indications and Luspatercept is a compelling new mechanism for treating these patients.","The data presented at ASH have demonstrated that Luspatercept provides very good efficacy in MDS patients that have failed EPO as well as beta-thalassemia. These are populations with very few treatment options today beyond often chronic blood transfusions and these data are expected to be filed with the FDA soon.","Beyond these indications, important lifecycle management trials are already underway including in the much larger first line in the U.S. population where Luspatercept will be tested head-to-head versus EPO. Finally, based on the mechanism, we believe there is potential for this medicine in other indications involving ineffective erythropoiesis.","Turning to Slide 18, Fedratinib is a second important near-term launch. This asset has potential to establish a position for the company in myelofibrosis most likely in the population of patients that are intolerant to, or refractory to Jakafi.","As you can see on the slide, many patients are either not well controlled or resistant to Jakafi. For these patients, there are limited treatment options. Fedratinib has demonstrated strong efficacy in these patients, including splenic volume reduction and improvement in symptoms.","As you know, Celgene has already confirmed that the NDA for Fedratinib has been recently submitted to the FDA.","On slide 19, the CAR-T Platform for Celgene has built \u2013 Celgene has built is an important and differentiated capability driving value for the combined company. We view CAR-T as a very exciting opportunity for our oncology franchise, given the unprecedented efficacy data that has been demonstrated with this modality.","In order to unlock the commercial potential of this platform, we believe there are a number of conditions necessary and we feel good that we will satisfy them. First, the specific products need to be differentiated, and I\u2019ll explain in a moment what we see as the advantages of liso-cell and bb2121.","Second, we need to have an access in reimbursement infrastructure that is appropriate for this modality. With that in mind, we feel that we have a leading capability and value and access of BMS particularly within the oncology space and this capability would be critical in shaping and navigating access for these platforms.","Third, we need to see these products being used by more physicians to benefit more patients. This will require the right products from a safety perspective and leveraging Celgene\u2019s leading capabilities in haematology commercialization.","And finally, we need to move these products beyond the current very late line settings where they are used today to earlier lines of treatment. And we see that there are already trials underway to make this happen.","Taken together the capabilities of the combined company will be primed to commercialize these differentiated products successfully. With that in mind, let me discuss how we see the positioning of the two lead CAR-T assets.","Turning to Slide 20, Liso-cell is a CAR-T asset which has the potential to be the best-in-class anti-CD19 CAR-T for B cell malignancies. We believe this product will be differentiated in the marketplace with efficacy at least as good if not better than KYMRIAH and the YESCARTA in heavily pre-treated DLBCL.","Importantly, the rates of cytokine release syndrome are far lower for liso-cell compared to the currently marketed CAR-Ts. We believe this safety advantage is differentiated and potentially enables an expansion in both the treating physician base and the patients considered eligible for CAR-T therapy.","Liso-cell is currently in development for earlier lines of DLBCL as well as for potential use in ALL and CLL. Now looking at slide 21, bb2121 also has the potential for transformative efficacy as a first-in-class and best-in-class BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of refractory multiple myeloma.","Looking at the efficacy data, on the left side of the slide, and acknowledging that this dataset is from a small study, it\u2019s clear that the depth and rate of response with this technology against this target is compelling compared to current treatments. With patients in this setting historically having very few realistic treatment options, we believe these data are very exciting and we are looking forward to a potential filing early next year.","As I also mentioned you can see on the right side, trials are already underway to move into earlier lines of treatment. We see this as a very important potential option for multiple myeloma patients, a market that Celgene knows very well.","I\u2019ll move to INI on slide 22 with Ozanimod, a therapy that has the potential to play an important role in two very large markets. Ozanimod\u2019s initial indication will be in relapsing and remitting MS as the first selective S1P. Here it has the potential to play a role as a safer option than either or the two leading currently marketed world therapies. We expect that the resubmission is on track for later this quarter as Celgene has said, with the potential for a launch next year.","Beyond MS Ozanimod is also being developed an inflammatory bowel disease and even more commercially interesting market given the treatment options at launch, will likely include biologics, and JAK inhibitors. Based on the Phase II data so far, we see this mechanism as having potential in IBD and the Phase III trials are already underway.","Commercially, Ozanimod could have a competitive advantage with the potential to offer an effective option for patients seeking an oral therapy that doesn\u2019t come with the safety concerns of a JAK inhibitor.","I\u2019ll now turn to TYK2 on slide 23, an important agent that has demonstrated a biologic-like efficacy in Psoriasis with upside potential to address multiple autoimmune diseases. Here, you see the data published in The New England Journal in September. The data are strong, and Phase III trials for Psoriasis are on-going with proof-of-concept studies underway in Crohn\u2019s and Lupus. We\u2019re planning additional Phase II trials that will allow us to determine future registrational programs.","In the meantime, we believe, we have a very compelling opportunity in Psoriasis as we believe the existing dermatology capabilities that Celgene has established with Otezla will be beneficial in ensuring a successful launch of TKY2 in this market following completion of Phase III trials.","Stepping back, I\u2019m very enthusiastic about the breadth of launch opportunities we expect as a combined company. Our commercial organization has clearly demonstrated that we can launch very effectively, and together with the assets, capabilities, and talent that Celgene brings to the table, we are well-positioned to deliver some very exciting opportunities for the combined company.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Giovanni.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Chris. Now turning to Slide 24, as I looked at what we are creating for the short and long term for 2025 and beyond, I feel really good. We\u2019ve discussed in detail why the transaction makes financial sense. We talked about six near-term launches and as you know we\u2019re also strengthening our early stage pipeline and platforms. This is a transaction that allows us to stay ahead of the curve and provide value for the long term. When I look ahead to the future, I feel very good about the position of the company. We will have a younger portfolio of market and medicines providing a more balanced payor mix, supporting a stronger reimbursement position for our medicines. These in an access and reimbursement environment that we believe will continue to evolve over the coming years. Our early pipeline will have mature giving us a diversified portfolio of late stage assets providing the next set of registrational opportunities.","We\u2019ll have a strong balance sheet with continued flexibility to invest in innovation. We would be in a strong position with a broad portfolio and deep pipeline and significant financial flexibility. I\u2019m confidence in the company we are building and the opportunities ahead.","Now, I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.","John Elicker","Thanks, Giovanni. Grey, I think we\u2019re ready to go to the Q&A session with Giovanni, Charlie and Chris as well as Tom here for Q&A as well. So, Grey.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll now take our first question from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alex Arfaei","Great. Thank you very much and thank you for the additional color. First question for Giovanni or Charlie, as you mentioned the combined company with Celgene should generate significant cash flow. I appreciate the general comments you made about the dividend increase. But as you look at some of your payers and your current payout ratio would you be able to I guess provide additional color. Would the payout ratio that you would expect for the combined company given the earnings accretion be similar to what you have right now?","And as a follow-up could you comment on your Opdivo lifecycle planning, specifically what\u2019s the development or what is latest on the development of subcutaneous Opdivo with your collaboration with Halozyme? And could that be used to extend the Opdivo patent life beyond 2028? Thank you very much.","Charles Bancroft","Yes. Thanks. This is Charlie. In regard to your first part of your question, as I mentioned in my comments we have model dividend increases throughout the planning period always subject to Board approval of course. I don't want to comment on the payout ratio at this particular time because as you know we don't do it based on any one particular year. We look at it over the longer term, but needless to say, we did model increases.","Christopher Boerner","Thank you, Alex. Regarding the product formulation, from an R&D standpoint we think it's very important to be able to create products that can be used in a variety of settings. And our relationship with Halozyme as you point out we think offers a very important opportunity for Opdivo, Opdivo, Yervoy and up to six to eight additional IO targets to be looked at in formulations that could be given subcutaneously. We think in many markets around the world and many places in the United States the ability to give a subcutaneous treatment with an IO agent or IO combination even offers a very distinct advantage. So we think that there's a lot of promise there. The implications of that on the IP, I think we have to defer that, to see how that topic evolves with time.","John Elicker","Grey, can we go to the next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Great. Thank so much for the questions, so just two quick ones. The first one in the past Tom, you\u2019ve given us information with regard to whether or not interim looks have been passed in particular trials. I think we have passed that in Part 1a. So Part 2 for OpdivoPlus Chemo we know is on-going is expected to finish midyear this year. Can you just tell us whether or not the interim look has been passed or not at this point?","And then the second question, can you guys give us a little bit of a better sense as we think about products like bb21 and liso-cell, one of the key feedback areas that we get is the challenges that hospitals are facing when delivering in CAR-T therapy and the issue around hospitalization and the costs associated with it. So, it's not profitable today for hospitals to be able to do this. In fact they\u2019re losing quite a bit of money. Just wondering how you guys see that dynamic evolving as you seek to launch both of these products in the next couple of years assuming the Celgene acquisition closes? Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio","Seamus, thank you. This is Giovanni. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll ask Chris to comment on the CAR-T question you had. There is no news with respect to the rest of our first line lung cancer program. We\u2019re not commenting on interim analysis.","Christopher Boerner","Yes. So, thanks for the question, Seamus. Let me talk a little bit about how we see CAR-T evolving and the important role that the two agents we talked about will play in terms of potentially expanding the opportunity for CAR-Ts generally. You\u2019re absolutely correct that existing CAR-T therapies have struggled a bit both with respect to logistics in the hospital as well as with respect to access in large part because of the profile of these drugs. As you know existing CAR-Ts are administered in the hospital setting. Today patients must remain in the hospital often in the ICU for treatment as well as monitoring.","And one of the things that we find really exciting about particularly an asset like liso-cell is that with no significant Grade 3, 4 toxicities with the CRS rate that significantly lower than both KYMRIAH and YESCARTA around 1%, patients could potentially be monitored in the outpatient setting, and that actually bridges to your question about access. Because these patients have had to be managed in the inpatient setting the cost associated with CAR-T therapy has been very substantial above and beyond the list price of the drugs. You\u2019ve seen some improvements in access and reimbursement for these agents over time. About two-thirds of commercial patients payers are now have put in place policies that cover these therapies.","That said, anything you could do to potentially move these agents into an outpatient setting would do a number of things. Would bring the overall cost of these therapies down, it would increase the value of these assets. And importantly as I mentioned in the prepared remarks it would be an opportunity to expand the physician base who are using these agents outside of a large academic centers to potentially community centers and then ultimately expand the patient pool considered eligible for these therapies, and that's a potentially important opportunity that we see with the differentiated profile particularly of liso-cell.","John Elicke","Thanks Seamus for the questions. Grey, can we go to the next one please.","Operator","Thank you. We can now take our next question from Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. Couple of questions. I realize this will be a difficult question to answer, but many have wondered if Bristol's buying Celgene is an attempt by you to prevent another company from potentially acquiring Bristol. So my simple question here is whether this played any role whatsoever in your decision to acquire Celgene? Second question, you sit in front of three sets of results in non-small cell lung with Opdivo, Part 1 or Part 2 and 9LA. Can you tell us which one of those you have the greatest confidence in and which ones you have the least confidence in? My guess is you would probably rank order those. Part 2 is being most likely to hit, 9LA would probably be beneath that and Part 1 is probably at the bottom. If you only hit Part 2, would you be willing to say that Opdivo will grow in 2020?","Giovanni Caforio","Tim, thank you. Let me just try to address both questions. To your first question, I hope that through many of the discussions we\u2019ve had since the announcement and clearly today we been able to communicate a strong strategic rationale of the combination and the value it generates for shareholders and patients. So I -- my answer is we are creating a great company with complementary franchises of marketed products, an opportunity to launch six new products in the next 24 months and doubling the size of our early pipeline in therapeutic areas we know well. We\u2019re really excited about the strategic and financial value of the transaction.","With respect to your second question, my perspective is that as we\u2019ve said many times we have multiple opportunities to play a role in lung cancer. I think we need to see the data readout to understand the data. And as you mentioned Study 1a, Part 2 and 9LA are all important components of our lung cancer program. We\u2019ve communicated before our expectations with respect to the timing of those programs and there is really no change there. But more importantly as Charlie mentioned when we think about the Opdivo business this is a growing franchise. And you've seen on one of the slides we presented today, the breadth of opportunities that we have over the next few years with over 20 registrational trials ongoing.","There are clearly a number of opportunities in lung cancer this year. We have an exciting and very broad adjuvant program to drive growth in the medium and the long term. And I would say that with any franchise the growth expectations in the short-term depend on the data readouts that are coming in the next few months and that's true for us as well. But my confidence is that this is a growing franchise with multiple opportunities for growth and this is what we've modeled as we thought about the total company.","John Elicke","Thanks for the questions Tim. Grey, can we go to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We can now take our next question from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for questions and for additional color on the call. I guess my first question was just going back to slide 11 and that pro forma look at the company, I guess investor are trying to get their hands on the growth of the non-Revlimid portion of the pro forma company. Is there any color you can provide as we look out to 2025, what percent of that pro forma company sales and net income is coming from the non-Revlimid business, so just kind of think about the growth of that piece of the business separated from Revlimid?","My second question was then coming back to the Revlimid assumption. I think you mentioned that Revlimid is modeled more conservatively relative to consensus. Is there any more color you can give on those assumptions, I guess specifically how much of a delta versus the street are you thinking about? And is that delta particularly pronounced in certain years over the planning period relative to the other years in that planning period? Thanks so much.","Charles Bancroft","All right, Chris thanks for your questions. I think that we probably can get more too much more color on. I think as it relates to 2025 in particular regarding your question on split between Revlimid and non-Revlimid. We don't go that far out as we talk about [Indiscernible]. I think what you will see in the proxy, you will see the split between the two company sales and you can get a sort of a baseline there. As it relates to how we think about specifically Revlimid versus consensus. Again, I think this is more -- we did multiple scenarios and as I mentioned we did book-ins. There\u2019s a number of scenarios in between. There\u2019s a number of other things that still have to play out both at the District Court level and at that the patent office level, so for us to get into declare at this point I think is premature.","What\u2019s important to me, Chris is that, if you look at this slide and if you think about the way we think about the company between now and 2025 we have rapidly growing businesses driven by many of our inline franchises. The opportunity to launch six products in the next two years and a pipeline that will continue to advance and will generate incremental launch opportunities between now and 2025. And then when I think about 2025, we will have not only a business that will have grown, but also we will have a much more diversified company, a significantly higher number of opportunities across multiple diseases to derive the growth of the company in the second half of the decade. So, I think beyond the contribution on the individual components the breath of growth opportunities across different parts of this growth period is what's really complementary and exciting about the new company.","John Elicke","Thanks Chris. Grey, can we take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Jason Gerberry of Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess first question is just for Tom. Just thinking about the upcoming readouts at the ASCO, GU, I\u2019m curious, it seems like the advantage of Opdivo, Yervoy and front-line renal really is the longer-term follow-up survival data versus competitors who likely have immature OS data. So just kind of curious you guys have a longer-term follow-up study. It\u2019s about 30 months of follow-up, but it was about 25-month of follow-up at ESMO 2017. So just kind of curious why this upcoming follow-up isn't longer-term follow-up and what that suggests regarding the durability of the Opdivo Yervoy benefit beyond 30 months?","And then my second question is just regarding Revlimid. Have the parties of you guys in Celgene pre-agreed already on what would be acceptable settlement terms with some of the outstanding generic challengers. Just sort of curious how you guys navigate some of the upcoming legal update? Thanks.","Charles Bancroft","Jason, thank you for your question about renal cell. So, couple of things about renal cell. First, we are extremely happy that Opdivo, Yervoy has become the Standard of Care in many settings in the United States. And also very happy that just recently we received our full approval in Europe as well. So we look at that is a great endorsement of the value this combination provides. We look forward to updating survival as we always do with the most recent database lock and we continue to update that data.","Now, when I think about this combination, as you point out, I think about something which could be distinguished and again we haven't seen all the data from our competitors yet, but could be distinguished on durability of response. And I think that\u2019s one most important thing to keep in mind that durability of response can play a very important role. And so we look forward to seeing that data emerge and the comparative data sets emerge over time. But also remember that one of the other key things is we also believe that there may be a role for TKIs with IO and we have our study 9ER which will be reading out with Cabo and Opdivo as well looking at that, and that\u2019s a little bit later in the timeframe, later this year. But we look forward to being able to play a role both in across the spectrum of patients with renal cell carcinoma.","Christopher Boerner","Yes. I would just on the Revlimid settlement with generic filers. I think it would be inappropriate about how we are thinking about that other than for Celgene in particular. I would say that we do have consultant sort of perspective or overview with the process with Celgene and the generic filers","John Elicker","Thanks Jason. Greg, can we take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thank so much for taking my questions. So, I wanted to focus on lung cancer for a minute. And maybe just so I understand the regulatory status exactly on what's happening. It seems to me that once the overall survival data and the TMB lows the hazard ratio is about the same as the hazard ratio in TMB highs, maybe FDA was no longer comfortable with TMB to begin with? Is that is that a fair way to think about it? And perhaps is that why there\u2019s sort of now more and more focus on PDL-1 positive cohorts specifically? And on that note, I recall the expectation for overall survival data in PDL-1 positives of 227 was by late 2018 early 2019 and I saw that it's now obviously pushed out and 9LAs pushed out a little bit as well. So I\u2019m just trying to understand the broader dynamic here? And also understand how FDA is looking at TMB and whether TMB ever happening or not from their perspective?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. Umer let me start and then I\u2019ll ask Tom obviously to answer your question in more detail. First of all, as Tom will describe the issue that is important really is the interaction between various biomarkers. I think we\u2019ve been very clear since October that this was a complex file. You've mentioned that the overall survival data we disclosed in October with this respect to low TMB patients and obviously we been in discussions with the FDA on these applications. Tom will give you his perspective about that.","If you go there at our lung cancer program, nothing has really changed with respect to the importance of Study 1a, Part 2 and 9LA. We've always said these are event driven trials and the timing is impacted by the evolution of events, but we continue to look forward to seeing the results of this study. It is a broad program and we would see the data. We believe that based on that program we have a real opportunity to play a role in lung cancer. And as I said earlier that's part of a much broader set of opportunities for Opdivo. Tom?","Thomas Lynch","Thank you, Giovanni. Umer, I think just to give you little more emphasis there. I mean, obviously I don\u2019t know what the FDA thinking. I can tell you what I\u2019m thinking about TMB. And I feel that TMB will continue to be important. I think the broad genomic profiling will continue to be important in the way we approach patients with cancer. I just think its early days in trying to understand that. I think if you look at the totality of data, data from us, data that just published last week from Memorial and from Merck. Data from Roche, data from AstraZeneca, whether you\u2019re looking up blood, whether you're looking at tumor, what you see consistently is TMB is a marker for response often for PFS and we don't yet have evidence or data that\u2019s as confirmatory around survival, much of that I would argue is around the way these studies have been designed, data collection and I think it remains a very important part of how we move forward.","I want to make one important comment about 227. As you know we believe it's very important to understand the interplay of the various different biomarkers of PDL-1 and of TMB and how they may work together. We know that TMB predicts for PFX benefit in patients who are high TMB with Opdivo, Yervoy compared to chemotherapy, but as you mentioned we also found evidence that the survival trends were very similar whether you were TMB high, TMB low, and to really further understand what that means to be able to give guidance to treating physicians, I think you really do need to see the totality of survival data which will be available hopefully recently shortly with when 1a comes out.","One comment just to finish on the timing of data release. As you know these are inherently event driven phenomena and it\u2019s very difficult to be able to predict with exact precision when the events will occur that will trigger the ability to readout. And again, both these studies are slightly prolonged, but again we have to wait for the events to occur and as soon as they occur we will analyze the data.","John Elicker","Thanks for the question, Umer. Grey, can we take the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. We can now take our next question from Matt Phipps of William Blair.","Matt Phipps","Thanks for taking my call. Follow-up to Umer\u2019s question, do you think the subsequent usage of PD-1s in the second line from patients that were high TMB might influence that survival where those chemo patients ended up maybe doing really well in second-line PD-1 and therefore kind of confounded the OS results in particular. And subsequently if Part 1a is positive for the PDL-1 positive patients do you really consider pursuing TMB or would you consider looking at a pan tumor high TMB type of indication similar to the MSI high if you\u2019re really confident of this biomarker?","Charles Bancroft","So, two questions, Williams \u2013 Matt, thank you, couple of questions \u2013 couple of answers. First is, I do think that PD-1 treatment in second-line makes a big difference and provides great benefit for patients. We've shown that and have led in that area of second-line lung cancer. So I do believe that that can obscure the ability to look at potential survival differences. I think you also to remember that the group of patients who are most likely to develop the most impressive responses are those patients who are high TMB. So -- and I think that true in second-line as well as we show the study 026. So I think that's really important.","The second part of your question regarding if 1a is positive how would we approach that from a regulatory standpoint? Giovanni made that really clear earlier when he said, you really have to see where the data takes us. So we have to look at the data, see what the data shows us. As you know we have not seen survival data from Part 1 of the study. So, we need to be able to look at that, to be able determine what\u2019s the best way to determine the patients who get the most benefit and importantly the largest group of patients that we can benefit as well in this setting.","So again, really hard to comment on what the regulatory path would be until we see these data sets. I think as Giovanni said, we\u2019ve got three important data sets maturing in the next three to 12 months and we\u2019re going to need to look at the group of them to be able to make the most important strategic decisions from a regulatory standpoint.","John Elicker","Thanks Matt. Can we take the next question please, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala of Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you so much. What are the dynamics that led to essentially flat Opdivo sales quarter over quarter? And related to that the Bristol business has good momentum, but the 2019 EPS guidance suggest mid-single digit growth X Celgene and growth was further lowered by the Q4 beat. So maybe you could talk about that dynamic?","And then secondly, would you like to call out any design differences between the Opdivo, chemo, arm of Checkmate 227 and Keynote-189 that might influence the results. For instance, Roche notes greater chemo dose intensity in power 132 relative to keynote-189 among other differences? Thank you.","John Elicker","Yes. Chris, why don\u2019t you start with performance of Opdivo.","Christopher Boerner","Yes. Thanks Steve. Thanks for the question. So overall sales for Opdivo were quite strong ending the year, while we grew sales outside of the U.S. as you point out and that sales were relatively flat in the U.S., Q3 to Q4. There were couple of unique factors that affected the quarter. First, we had an inventory build in the government channel in Q3 that had to be worked down in Q4. And second we had slightly higher sales in PHS and Medicaid which had a modest impact on gross to net. Those two things notwithstanding, we did actually see demand growth of about 3% for the quarter that was just offset by these other factors.","But if you step back from the quarter we actually ended 2018 very much in line with expectations. In the U.S. second-line lung share is holding around 30%. We continue to see the percentage of IO eligible patients decrease, but that's very much in line with what we expected and where we expected to be at the end of the year. We\u2019re holding leading shares in first-line metastatic melanoma as well as in second-line renal cell. And as we look forward we still see growth opportunities albeit more modest in the U.S. coming from adjuvant melanoma as well as first-line renal cell.","You\u2019ll recall that we drove rapid uptake in the U.S. in these indications in 2018. We still however see opportunities to continue to grow in first-line renal particularly in intermediate and poorest patients. We've got a great story to tell there in terms of the strength of our OS and as Tom mentioned on the previous call the durability of the data that we\u2019re seeing there. And we\u2019re also benefit from full-year sales in adjuvant melanoma in the U.S. and of course outside of the U.S. we\u2019re still very much in the early stages of the launch of both of those indications. So if you added up we see a good opportunity for growth in 2019 and good momentum globally coming out of 2018.","Charles Bancroft","Yes. Steve, just a couple things and maybe to remind you of one, I would call it maybe one-off item related to our 2019 guidance. So we announced in December the sale of our book of business that we expect to close in April of 2019 that has about 480 million of full-year sales in 2018 and we already indicated that\u2019s $0.04 diluted to us on 2019 basis. We also announced our pension derisking back in November of last year and that shows up in other income, but that's also $0.05 diluted to us in 2019. And then we\u2019ve talked about before that Sanofi alliance income ended in 2018.","Thomas Lynch","And Steve just to answer quickly your question about 227 versus 189, except for the obvious difference which you would note about histology is being different that 227 was [Indiscernible] and 189 was a non-squamous. And except for the fact that the 189 control arm performed particularly less well than some of the other control arms that we've been seeing from both our studies and competitors trials, I think it\u2019s really difficult to make those comparisons. I think we have to really see \u2013 until we see what our data 227 look like both from Part 1 and Part 2 of those trials and to see how they emerge.","John Elicker","Thanks Steve. Grey, can we take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So, maybe one on Celgene and then one other one. So just on the Celgene you obviously see stock was trading quite at discount before the deal was announced. I think the market has not been as bullish on the late stage assets as you are. So maybe just under three weeks you\u2019ve been having a discussion with investors. What do you think that investors are most missing about these pipeline assets? And what should we be getting more excited about? Appreciate the detail on the call, but any further insight would be helpful.","And then changing gears to Eliguis. So we saw from Johnson & Johnson relative sales relatively little late this quarter. And obviously there\u2019s lot of volume growth in the class, but just wondering about the pricing side of that equation. So can you just comment on the discount you\u2019re seeing and maybe the impact that the donut hole had enough products this quarter? And how you think about the donut hole will impact next year given your views about -- percentage of the sales covering more sales there? Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. This is Giovanni. Let me just start answering your questions. So first all let me say that we\u2019ve just reviewed in some detail with you some of the key drivers of value of the acquisition of Celgene and specifically with respect to the value of the pipeline assets. If you think about that and as we said in the past we see non-risk-adjusted sales at least for the six assets we discussed today at least $15 billion in sales and we are having good discussions with investors about the strength of the combined company, the key value divers, the opportunity for growth that these assets provide and then obviously the strengthening of the rest of the pipeline.","Charles Bancroft","Vamil, just to add from an R&D standpoint, I just want to share, it\u2019s obviously very hard for you or for anyone to model the particular value of a pipeline assets that\u2019s very early, but I can tell you the enthusiasm that our group at BMS had, if we look at the depth and strength of what Celgene has in their pipeline particular around the concept of protein homeostasis. Chris mentioned earlier the incredible technology that\u2019s been developed in cell therapies that we can \u2013 we\u2019ll make a difference. And overall, when I look at this company, I see a company that\u2019s done for myeloma. What we have done for renal cell and melanoma. They\u2019ve absolutely transformed the disease by understanding the biology and by developing treatments, which exploit the fundamental biologic differences, and so there I think you see a lot of similarities between these two companies.","Christopher Boerner","Chris, let me let me touch on Eliquis. So a few points [indiscernible]. Thanks for the question. So first, we\u2019re still very bullish on the business with Eliquis, both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. We grew sales in the fourth quarter 27%. We saw TRx volume was up 36%. In the U.S. we extended our leadership position as the number one OAC across all specialties of indications, and we still have room to grow in the U.S. Outside of the U.S. we\u2019ve seen strength in a number of key markets, notably the U.K. and France. And in fact in France, we became the number one OAC in the fourth quarter.","So the base business and the fundamentals look really good across the board. We did see an impact on higher rebates in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, and in Q3 rebates were around 185 million. They increased to 278 million in the fourth quarter. There were two things really driving that. There was a onetime true up of 36 million, but as you point out, we do have a higher volume of patients running through Part D channels and those are highly discounted channels.","As we take those dynamics and look forward, I think there are a few dynamics that you need to take into account with Eliquis. First, the donut hole rebate is increasing from 50% to 70% that\u2019s going to put price pressure on that price. Second, we have a differentiated profile and as a result of that, we\u2019ve strengthened our access position in Part D, that is going to lead to higher gross to nets over time. And then importantly, we have significantly increased the volume going to Eliquis. We did that in 2018 based on the strength of the business. We have every expectation to believe that we\u2019ll continue to grow this business in 2019. And that will drive more volume through highly discounted segments, and thus increasing gross to net.","What I will say, is in spite of these drags on net price, our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to grow net sales. And that\u2019s a result of having a differentiated product, good underlying strength in the business in the U.S. and ex-U.S. and frankly the quality of the commercial execution that we\u2019ve seen on this brand.","John Elicker","Thanks, Arnold. Greg [ph] I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. We can now take our next question from Geoff Meacham of Barclays","Geoff Meacham","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just have a few. On Revlimid, I think investors are struggling with the erosion curve beginning in 2022, and the pro forma model, and then the pricing environment longer term. So I guess the question is how much value is given for 2121 in earlier lines of therapies, say first or second line myeloma or Revlimid has pretty meaningful share.","And then on the first line lung application, does it make sense to wait even longer say for part 2, of 227 or even 9 LA to ensure a broader label, I\u2019m just, I guess I\u2019m struggling with how you balance speed to market and sort of data differentiation in IO versus science behind TMB versus PD 1 better? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks. Let, let me. Sorry, Geoff, let me answer your first question. So as we\u2019ve discussed bb2121 and other assets, our current forecast includes the lead indication, in that case obviously we see significant potential for further expansion into earlier lines of therapy.","Christopher Boerner","And Geoff, just to come in on the first line lung application obviously we want the speed-to-market is important. I think you\u2019re right, or and bring up a very good point that we want to see what the data shows us, and that will really determine how we proceed from a regulatory standpoint.","And you know, I just want to emphasize that part 1 A, part 2 and 9 LA are three distinct separate studies. And it may be that we get a very strong signal from one of them, that allows us to proceed with a regulatory filing. So I think we\u2019ll have to take that and follow the data as you point out.","John Elicker","Thanks Geoff. We\u2019ve got our last question please Greg [ph].","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Yes. Thanks very much. My first question is just a follow up on Eliquis, and thank you for the color. I think the comment was that you expect growth going forward, but I believe the Street expects substantial growth going forward. So could you just provide some level of color on the outlook for growth relative to the growth that you reported in the fourth quarter for Eliquis.","And then second, pivoting to novel I-O pipeline candidates, that was mentioned earlier in the call. Could you just discuss if there are any key readout to watch in 2019?","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks very much, David. Thank you. This is Giovanni. So let me just start. As Chris said earlier, we are very bullish on Eliquis. Performance is strong around the world and particularly in the U.S. there is strong momentum in the brand. It\u2019s one of the key growth drivers for the company. So let me just reiterate we\u2019re very bullish on the prospects for the asset, and Tom on data readouts.","Thomas Lynch","And Dave, a couple of things on data readouts. First, when you think about what we have in the established products looking up David, we\u2019ve talked in detail about lung cancer. We do know that we\u2019ve got data reading out this year in Hepatoma and possibly some data and mesothelioma and head neck later in the year.","You specifically asked about novel compounds, so and I think that\u2019s an area of great excitement from ours -- from our standpoint. First, we hope to have some data later this year with our lag 3 compound to get a better sense of how this unique molecule that approaches that concept of lymphocytes exhaustion might be able to play a role in cancer.","The second is you\u2019ll see more evolution of data with our combination between OPDIVO and Nektar as the year progresses. We\u2019re very excited about the potential for this combination to be able to improve outcome and provide a unique therapeutic opportunity for patients. And then again, CTLA-4 is a really really important compound and its important target.","And so the two compounds that we\u2019re excited about are the pro body that we\u2019re doing with CytomX as well as the both of which are moving through phase I this year. In fact this year, we hope to advance a product compound close which would be the pro body of the non-fee cost related formulation. So again, combining those two technologies looks particularly exciting. So a number of important early signals, I would say from some of our novel I-O agents, and then of course we talked earlier and you saw the slide, slide 15 in the deck which looks at the timing of some of the established readouts which we look forward to in the next 12 to 24 months.","John Elicker","Thanks Dave. Turn it over to Giovanni for some closing comments.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you John and thanks everyone. So as we close let me just reiterate this was a very good quarter in which capped a really great year. Our performance was driven by strong commercial execution with good momentum in the business going into 2019. We\u2019ve made important progress in our pipeline and we have demonstrated disciplined management of our P&L.","And these will create a strong foundation as we enter into 2019. This will be an exciting next chapter for our company as we plan on the integration of Celgene and I\u2019m confident we are creating value for BMS as shareholders. I\u2019m excited about the prospects we had, we have as a leading scientific company, and I want to thank everyone for participating in the call. Thank you.","John Elicker","Greg. I think that concludes our call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"4341":["Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Tracy, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call today to review our third quarter earnings. With me are Giovanni Caforio, our CE; Charlie Bancroft, our CFO. Both Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks. And then, as well, Murdo Gordon, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Tom Lynch, our Chief Scientific Officer are here for Q&A.","Take care of the Safe Harbor language first. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.","These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date.

We'll also focus our comments on non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.","Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I want to say a few words about the situation in Puerto Rico. As you know, this is a significant humanitarian issue, and we are very focused on ensuring our people are safe and that we support ongoing efforts to provide disaster relief.","We have two manufacturing plants as well as commercial operations on the island. Our first priority following the hurricanes was to make sure our people were safe. And I'm pleased to report we've accounted for 100% of our colleagues on the island.","With respect to our operations, we do not expect to have any supply disruption. There's been a tremendous effort by our teams to make this happen, and that effort is ongoing. They've done a great job executing against our contingency plans, despite very difficult operating conditions. Going forward, it remains essential the infrastructure is restored as rapidly as possible.","Now, getting back to the quarter. I'm pleased that we had another good quarter, with continued strong performance across the company. We grew our revenue by 7%, with double-digit growth for Opdivo, Eliquis and Orencia. In oncology, Opdivo had another very good quarter. Despite increasing competition, Opdivo's performance across all indications continued to be very strong.","Globally, we delivered a 38% increase. In the U.S., we maintained a strong share of the second line lung market in the high-30s. We are also seeing really good performance in other tumors, with strong shares in renal and melanoma. Outside of the U.S., we are seeing strong performance, as we move along the launch curve in those markets.","Our regulatory and clinical achievements positioned us well for continued growth of our I-O portfolio. We secured FDA approvals for Opdivo in both liver and colorectal cancers, as well as an approval in Japan for gastric cancer. And the FDA also expanded the Yervoy indication to include pediatric melanoma patients. Our sBLA for Opdivo in adjuvant melanoma was granted priority review and given breakthrough designation.","We announced the results from CheckMate-214 in renal cell cancer, which was stopped early for overall survival in intermediate to poor risk patients. We believe this is an important result that validates the rationale for combining Opdivo and Yervoy.","We presented important data at World Lung (04:40) on TMB in small cell lung cancer, and we're looking forward to presenting new data on our IDO at SITC.","Looking ahead, there are a number of milestones with the potential to significantly expand our efforts, to bring the benefits of immuno-oncology to a broader set of patients. We expect to see the final results for the combination in first-line non-small cell lung cancer from CheckMate-227 in the first half of 2018.","We are also looking forward to seeing data for Opdivo in first-line HCC and for the combination in head and neck and small cell lung cancer next year. And our next wave I-O agents have tremendous opportunity to build further approaches, to expanding the number of patients who benefit from combining I-O agents within our portfolio. I'm really looking forward to the initiation of registrational studies for IDO and LAG-3.","Outside of oncology, our portfolio performance was strong, with Eliquis delivering 39% growth. We see continued growth opportunity for Eliquis where real-world data is reinforcing its important role in reducing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. We're looking forward to additional real-world data for Eliquis later this year at AHA.","I'm very encouraged to see our diversified pipeline advance, with good progress on our FGF21 agent in NASH. We are in discussions with the FDA and plan on beginning the next phase of our program in 2018. We're also progressing our pipeline in immunoscience, where we expect two early-stage assets, our BTK inhibitor and our TYK-2 inhibitor to deliver proof-of-concept data in the coming months. These are promising medicines in areas where there is an important need for new treatment options.","During the quarter, we pursued several strategic business development deals, to further build our portfolio and pipeline, specifically in immuno-oncology. We acquired IFM, which expands our assets in innate immunity, an area of promising early science. We also signed an agreement with Clovis to start a joint development program for its PARP inhibitor. And our agreement with Halozyme positions us to enhance the delivery of our cancer treatments. I believe we have the most promising early pipeline we have had in a long time, and our capabilities to deliver that pipeline are evolving significantly.","We have strengthened our investment in translational research, tumor biology and real-world data, as a part of our integrated R&D approach. As Tom can describe in more detail, we believe that these capabilities position us well, to continue to demonstrate the value of our medicines and regimens for patients.","And so, with that, I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. This was another important quarter for the company, with strong sales growth across our key brands. Let me begin with a brief discussion of product performance starting with I-O. As Giovanni mentioned, we delivered strong commercial performance, as we maintained leading share in the U.S. for Opdivo in second-line lung and renal. We also drove continued adoption in melanoma and other indications.","International growth was robust, and we achieved additional reimbursement approvals, including non-small cell lung cancer in the UK and lung and renal in Australia.","Looking forward in building on our strong foundation, we believe we have meaningful opportunities ahead with potential approvals in adjuvant melanoma and first-line renal cell. For Yervoy, we see near-term market dynamics as somewhat mixed. We expect some pressure due to adoption of Opdivo in adjuvant melanoma, but potential for extended use of the regimen in intermediate poor risk first-line renal cell.","Our strong commercial execution across the portfolio was also driven by exceptional performance for Eliquis, which saw a 39% worldwide growth in the quarter, bringing the product to almost $5 billion in annualized revenue. As we described in the past, the impact of the U.S. coverage gap increases considerably in Q3 and Q4 compared with the first half of the year. Though this put a headwind on U.S. sales during the quarter, the 8% sequential increase in TRx reflects strong underlying demand growth.","Globally, Eliquis is the number one NOAC in the U.S., Japan and Canada and is the leading brand in terms of new-to-brand scripts in important markets such as Germany, the UK and Spain. With Eliquis continuing to extend its lead within the NOAC class and the category poised for continued expansion, we believe that Eliquis is well-positioned for growth going forward.","Orencia and Sprycel delivered strong performance during the quarter, delivering year-on-year growth of 10% and 8%, respectively. This is meaningful growth for products at this stage of their life cycle and illustrates the very good commercial execution we've seen across the portfolio.","Turning to our non-GAAP P&L. I'd like to start by discussing our gross margin. While we are pleased by the demand trends and our performance during the quarter, gross margin was pressured due to product mix, particularly the strong growth of Eliquis, coupled with the declines in virology. We also took a one-time, $70 million inventory charge related to HCV, given the competitive dynamics we are seeing globally. Going forward, we expect mix will continue to be the main driver of gross margin.","With respect to OpEx. We are delivering on the approach we outlined about a year ago. We've been investing in R&D while finding efficiencies across the rest of our business. Because of the importance of our pipeline for realizing our long-term potential, we continue to view investment in R&D as a key priority.","Regarding our tax rate, during Q3, the tax rate was unfavorably impacted by both a reduction in expected credit for the Puerto Rico excise tax from hurricane-related operational disruptions on the island, and from adjustments to our prior year tax liability.","Briefly with respect to capital allocation, business development remains a top priority, and Giovanni outlined several key transactions that we executed during the quarter. Additionally, we bought back $225 million of stock during the quarter, and we plan to buy an additional $250 million for the end of the year.","Turning to guidance for the remainder of 2017. We are revising our tax rate to 22%, mainly due to Puerto Rico, and I expect our gross margin to be towards the lower end of the range. Having said that, we are encouraged by the business outlook going into the fourth quarter, and we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS range to $2.95 to $3.05.","To close, our year-to-date performance has been very strong. Across the company, we've continued to execute and deliver outstanding commercial performance and made important progress in advancing our pipeline. We believe there are tremendous opportunities across our portfolio of marketed products and pipeline assets, and are well-positioned for future success.","I'll now turn it back to John for Q&A.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Charlie. Tracy, I think we're ready to go to questions. And just as a reminder, in addition to Giovanni and Charlie, both Tom and Murdo are here. Go ahead, Tracy.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now take our first question from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I had a two-part question on tumor mutation burden. First, on the CheckMate 9LA trial, is the type of TMB test that you're using similar to what was done in CheckMate-026? I'm just trying to understand, what's the base test that you intend to use in that trial and perhaps other trials.","And then, second, not on statistical plan, but can you confirm that there's been no change to the primary analysis of CheckMate-227? Thank you very much.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Umer, thank you. This is Tom. Thank you very much for your question. And I think the part about TMB is a very interesting one and I think that what this indicates is how we're learning so much more about lung cancer. When you think about lung cancer, it used to be a disease where it was just squamous cell and adenocarcinoma.","Now, you have a disease where it's EGFR and ALK and ROS1 and RET fusion proteins and PD-L1 and increasingly, we're starting to understand that TMB is also an important potential biomarker in lung cancer. And you saw three important data sets that we're very happy to present.","The first was our CheckMate-026 data that you alluded to at AACR this year, which showed that you could select a group of patients that seem to benefit from Opdivo monotherapy. We showed similar data in bladder cancer, and then, of course, at the World Lung Cancer Meetings last week in Yokohama, we showed data that in small cell lung cancer, we could select patients for both Opdivo monotherapy and Opdivo and Yervoy combination therapy, using TMB as an important biomarker.","So we think this is something that's important for us to look at in many of our studies, in a wide variety of tumors. Now, your specific question about how do we measure it, I think, is a very good one. And I think this is a field that is evolving. When you think about how we did it with CheckMate-026, we did whole exome sequencing as a mechanism for doing it, and our plans for CheckMate 9LA will be to use the FoundationOne panel that's a sequencing set of a defined set of genes.","And both \u2013 the good news is that, as we showed at ACR, whether you do whole exome sequencing or whether you do the Foundation panel, there appears to be excellent concordance between the two types of assay. You don't get the exact same result, but the results are very concordant with each other. I do think this is an area that's going to evolve over the next several years, as TMB becomes a more important marker.","I also think it's important to think about, how does one measure TMB? Will it be all tumor based, will it be serum-based, I think that's another area of great interest, and where our translational medicine teams will be putting a lot of their attention.","Your second question is regarding the stat plan. And I think I just want to say one thing about CheckMate-227. We really aren't going to be talking about the statistical plan of CheckMate-227. As you know, we have co-primary endpoints of PFS and OS, and we have the optionality of looking at that, but we're not today going to talk about the stat plan of CheckMate-227. But I think your question on TMB is quite important, and one that we continue to look at with great enthusiasm, across a broad variety of tumors.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks for the question, Umer. Tracy, can we go to the next one please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just if I can follow-up on Opdivo. I think Giovanni, you said that the CheckMate-227, we would see the final analysis during the first half of 2018. Can you confirm whether or not there will be an interim \u2013 has an interim, in fact, happened and already passed? Is that still a possibility?","And then, secondly...","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jami, we lost you.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you hear me?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","There you go. You're back.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened there. Anyway. As we think about trends next year, you will have hopefully frontline renal, adjuvant melanoma, which are two very important, big opportunities. At the same time, the dynamics will start to change in second-line lung as KEYTRUDA has been used in the frontline for over a year. So can you just sort of high-level help us to think about the pushes and pulls to the Opdivo franchise next year? Bottom line, will sales be up, flat, down, just sort help us to think about that. Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jami, this is Giovanni. Thanks for your questions. So with respect to my comment, let me just say, we've consistently said the final analysis for CheckMate-227 and the timing in the first half of next year, that's really not changed. I'll ask Tom to give you a perspective on interim analysis, and then, maybe Murdo to give you his perspective on current trends for Opdivo. We are, obviously, not going to give any perspective at this point on 2018 more specifically. It's premature to do that, but it's important to discuss existing trends.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And Giovanni, thanks, and Jami, thanks for your question about the interim. So what we said about the interim is that, and as you know, it's event-driven. And you really can't \u2013 you don't know when events are going to happen. You have to wait for the events to actually happen and that could be extremely frustrating, because you'd love to be able to say on date X, we're going to have all the events, but they happen when they happen.","We predict based on looking at things. We think that the interim will happen either at the end of 2017 or early in 2018, and that's when we expect the interim analysis to happen at that point. But as we've said all along, we expect to have data on CheckMate-227 in the first half of 2018 and we're looking forward to being able to share that data with you when we have that.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And Jami, thanks for the question related to trends on Opdivo. We're, obviously, really pleased about the performance year-to-date on Opdivo and the source of that growth that we're experiencing having stable trends in second-line lung cancer in the U.S. and good growth and penetration of the same opportunity ex-U.S. as we've secured reimbursement, and most recently, seeing reimbursement for Australia and the UK come online ex-U.S.","Now, in the U.S., beyond lung, we also continue to hold really high shares in RCC, despite having some strong competition in cabo in second-line. And we also are doing well across our I-O portfolio in first-line metastatic melanoma.","And if we look at catalyst for growth going forward, clearly, we're excited about the great data from Opdivo in the adjuvant setting and the NCCN guidelines were updated to reflect those data, so that could lead to some NPS in the near term.","We're also hopeful that the strong data from the CheckMate-214 first-line renal cell carcinoma trial, the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, will be submitted quickly and reviewed quickly, hopefully, for the benefit of patients looking to experience an OS benefit in first-line renal. That's another strong catalyst for growth.","And we're just recently launching in hepatocellular carcinoma and the anecdotal early feedback on that is also very strong. So I know there were questions on whether or not we would grow this year in the U.S. I think we've been very good in terms of the commercial and medical and customer facing execution and I feel that we would do everything we can to have a strong performance next year. But obviously, there are a lot of variables and a lot of data sets still to read out and we'll be talking to you over the quarters as we go.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tracy, can we go to next question, please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Three questions, please. From memory, I think about 65% of patients in CheckMate-026, you had access to TMB baseline levels, I'm obviously thinking about missing data. What percentage should we be thinking about for CheckMate-227?","Second, just to confirm that if, as we believe, the TMB baseline part of your final (22:15) analysis, I'm assuming I would say (22:18) by definition has to be part of the interim and you can mark that in a theoretical way of ex U.S. (22:22)?","And then, finally, would you like to share with us any of the differential activity (22:30) combination strong (22:33) CheckMate-012 and CheckMate-568 also with the combination compared to NIVO plus chemo? Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Andrew, Tom Lynch. Thank you. I did not hear your second question. I'm sorry, I got the first and the third. Just repeat the second?","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Sorry, I'll repeat that. Sure, of course. So I was saying that assuming that TMB \u2013 patient selection base from TMB baseline today is (23:02) part of your final analysis. One, should we assume that, by definition, it also has the full part (23:08) of the interim OS analysis?","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you. Okay. So let's talk \u2013 Andrew, thank you for your question and let's talk a little bit about where we are with CheckMate-227 and the study.","I think a couple of things to say. And as we pointed out for quite some time, CheckMate-227 is not just one study, it's a family of studies. It's a study in expressers, it's a study in PD-L1 non-expressers, and it's a third study in all-comers. And this family of studies, we think, is going to be more than \u2013 we think we know is more than 2,400 patients with advanced lung cancer. It's going to give us a lot of information about how to treat patients in first-line non-small cell.","When you think about the amount of data that will be coming out in 2018, both from us and from other companies and corporate groups around the world, I think a year from now, we're going to have a much better idea about how to treat patients, how to identify subsets of patients who are going to benefit, and have to really learn how to give patients the best options for treating patients in that setting.","Now, your first question comes down to the point about TMB. And you mentioned that we're able to look back in study CheckMate-026 and get about 60% of patients that were able to have a viable (24:30) TMB. And I think one of the things we've said for quite some time is we will continue to do as much work as we can with our studies, retrospectively, looking at TMB when possible. And as we've said, we believe TMB is an (24:44) important enough that we're going to be looking at it in study CheckMate 9LA, and we'll be looking at it in CheckMate 9LA at that point. So we think TMB has potential as a potential biomarker.","Your second question is about the concept of looking at TMB in an interim analysis. What we've said about the interim analysis at our last earnings call is that overall survival would be looked at in the interim analysis and that's the extent that we can comment on the stat plan and the interim analysis at this point was just to disclose what the endpoint is for the interim analysis that will be done when the events occur.","And then, finally, your question on IPI and NIVO in CheckMate-012 and CheckMate-568, I think a couple of things about the IPI and NIVO. One is, this has been a really important year for IPI and NIVO. It's been a year where just in the past five months, we've seen great confirmation of the value of this combination. It works in melanoma, it works in patients with renal cell, we could not have been happier with the results of study CheckMate-214, and those are studies where we've shown survival advantages in that setting. And we've got five additional tumors where we see clear response rate benefits to the use of IPI and NIVO compared to monotherapy.","We await, obviously, PFS and survival benefits in those trials where we've only seen response rate data thus far. So we believe this combination has great potential benefit for patients with cancer. So one of the reasons we did study CheckMate-568 is to get more experience with IPI and NIVO in that setting.","So we believe we have a family of studies in lung cancer, which are going to help define the best way to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and we really look forward to sharing that data in 2018 as it becomes available.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tracy, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. So first off, just wanted to ask on next year, as we think about 2018, Charlie, can you just give us a general sense of the pushes and pulls as it relates to the gross margin? The commentary on $70 million of inventory write-down was certainly helpful. But just trying to get a general sense of what you see as the key pushes and pulls around the gross margin and overall mix for 2018. And then \u2013 and maybe Murdo can comment on just sort of the dynamics that he thinks would be the big contributors there as well.","And then, on TMB, just wanted to get a better sense of whether or not the blood-based FoundationOne test already has a validation set. So I know that you've got the ability \u2013 typically, what I think the FDA requires is there is an exploratory data set followed by a validation data set. And I'm just trying to understand if you can comment on whether or not Bristol considers the blood-based FoundationOne test to be a validated test to apply, whether it be as part of CheckMate-227 or how are you using it in the CheckMate 9LA study? Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. Charlie?","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. Thanks, Seamus. For 2018, by and large, our gross margin has been impacted by mix, notwithstanding this particular quarter where we had the HCV inventory write-off of $70 million. And going forward, it will be guided by mix.","And as you know, Eliquis, which has been a nice growth driver for us, has a margin below 50% given the structure of our P&L and our relationship with Pfizer. So you can think of it in the sense of Eliquis growth, although really good on the top line does have a headwind on the margin side. And we're also, although, towards the end of HCV, by and large, we do lose Reyataz and Sustiva in the U.S. at the end of this year and also very high-margin products.","So I would think about it in the context of Eliquis being a drag. We are losing some higher-margin products. So you can think about the mix being the most important factor in our gross margin going forward.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And Seamus, just on trends, obviously, we're really pleased with Eliquis demand trends that we're seeing. We're up 8% sequentially quarter-over-quarter in TRx demand and up 37% over same quarter prior year in demand. So the top line demand curve for Eliquis looks very good. As Charlie said, obviously, it has had a lower gross margin than some of our other products.","Just another couple of dynamics within Eliquis to keep in mind and I can make a comment on this year, and that is for the third quarter, we did see an increase in the number of patients entering the coverage gap, so that showed some decline in net sales for the quarter in terms of percentage quarter-over-quarter.","But overall, we are stable to some slight increase in our gross-to-net, partly due to DoD channels and some strengthening of our access position in the marketplace with some strategic contracting that was done. So overall, Eliquis looks really good.","I-O is just really difficult to pin down, because of the number of new data sets and events, both for us and our competition, so we are holding a wide range of potential scenarios for 2018. We, obviously, are, as I said to Jami, we're very pleased with our trends and the quality of execution around the world, and we have some very new Q4 catalyst for growth that should help us pin down what 2018 looks like. But clearly, we feel good about what we've been able to do despite competition in the marketplace with I-O.","And as Giovanni mentioned in his opening comments, rest of the portfolio with both Sprycel and Orencia have good trends for (31:01).","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And Seamus, just to answer your question on the blood-based Foundation test, as you know, the three data sets that we reported on tumor mutational burden have been tumor-based evaluations, and that's been in study CheckMate-026 in our bladder cancer experience, and then, also in study with small cell. So those are blood- and (31:24) tumor-based.","My recommendation would be to ask the folks at Roche and Foundation. As you know, at ESMO, Roche presented data looking at serum-based and blood-based mutational assays. And I think you'd have to ask them any specific details about where they stand in terms of the validation of the serum-based assays.","What I had mentioned earlier was that I personally think that there is a real interest in looking at these. I think these might be very promising and the early looks at them have shown that we seem to be getting very interesting signals from the blood-based assays, and whether these complement serum-based assays \u2013 tumor-based assays, or whether they are used instead of, I think, will be an interesting question to find in the next coming years.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tracy, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A few questions, please. Can you just [Technical Difficulty] (32:26) maybe by mid 2018 [Technical Difficulty] (32:31) on I-O drugs.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tim, you're really breaking up.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can you hear me?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","A little better.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Is this any better?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, that's a little better.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can you just [Technical Difficulty] (32:49) perhaps which non I-O drugs [Technical Difficulty] (32:54) is, as more time has elapsed, you still kind of 100% confident [Technical Difficulty] (33:05) biomarker assay, [Technical Difficulty] (33:09)?","And last question, again, tumor mutation burden. Do you have any prospective data at this point with TMB, whether it's been released publicly or not? Looks like all the analyses are really done on retrospective data sets. [Technical Difficulty] (33:29), out of Roche analyses and out of even your analyses of CheckMate-026 [Technical Difficulty] (33:37) consistent OS benefit, there's a clear PFS benefit [Technical Difficulty] (33:41) in either your data from CheckMate-026 or Roche's data, if you can kind of explain that?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tim, this is Giovanni. So unfortunately, you were breaking a little. First question, I believe, was about non-oncology assets and opportunities for potential registrational study starts going into 2018. As we've mentioned before, we are working actively on advancing three important programs, LAG-3, IDO, and our FGF21 program in NASH.","Over the next few months, we will also see proof-of-concept data on the BTK program and the TYK-2 program. And we look forward to seeing that data as well. So the pipeline in oncology and outside of oncology is progressing.","You had two questions. One was whether there is any updated perspective on our PD-1 test, I believe, and the answer there is, I don't think we have really any news to report there, but I'll ask Tom to answer that question, and also give you a perspective on the potential availability data with respect to TMB.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yes. Again, Tim, our apologies, it was very, very hard to hear that question. I'd say, regarding the PD-L1 test, we presented data at recent meetings. It shows that we do believe the PD-L1 test we have is reproducible and is similar to that which is being used by other companies evaluating their drugs.","I think your second question about TMB and its ability to predict response rate PFS and overall survival, that's what sounded the question was about. I would say that, as with any biomarker, all those endpoints become incredibly important. And we will look at response rate PFS and overall survival in any group of patients we would look at, in any given data set that we would look at, to be able to determine which is important.","I think the relative balance between PFS and OS immuno-oncology is one that is incredibly important. And we love studies that show OS benefits. I think, as many of our agents are beginning to show excellent second- and third-line activity in other areas, PFS may become something that we will look at more often. And I don't think there's any reason to believe we wouldn't look at that in a group of TMB patients in the future, as we would a group of PD-L1 selected patients in the future.","And I'm sorry if that's not exactly what you asked, but that's the best of our ability to hear.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tracy, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Tony Butler from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, this is Daniel (36:41) for Tony Butler. Could you tell us a little bit about what data we can expect at SITC from your IDO1 inhibitor program? So, would we see some initial efficacy data and, maybe in general, do you see TDO1 or IDO2 as a problem when it comes to IDO1 inhibition?","And then, second question concerning TMB, given the fact that mutation frequency in non-small cell lung cancer is highly variable across individual patients, what do you think is the proportion of patients in non-small cell lung cancer that are TMB high? Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So Tony (sic) [Daniel] (37:30), this is Tom. Thank you. I'll answer the first two questions on IDO. I think I'd say a couple of things about IDO in general. We think IDO is an important target, and we felt this way at Bristol-Myers for the past two to three years.","As you know, we purchased the compound from Flexus that is now the BMS IDO inhibitor, and we have a strong partnership with our colleagues at Incyte, which we're working with as well. And, as you know, we presented data with our IDO inhibitor at AACR this year. This suggested that there may be some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages to our IDO inhibitor. We see excellent inhibition of kynurenine levels and we're able to see good receptor occupancy at doses that appear well tolerated in patients.","Now, whether those PK\/PD dynamics will be differentiating to the agent, I think we don't know. I think only clinical trials will tell us if it matters for patients. But we think IDO is an important endpoint. We think so much about it that we are proceeding with two separate lines of registrational studies, and we've talked about our plans with Incyte, and we also have plans to begin our studies in melanoma and in non-small cell lung cancer, with the Bristol IDO.","Now, as you mentioned, we will be presenting our first clinical efficacy data on IDO at SITC this year, and we look forward to seeing that data at the SITC meeting. I want to say a couple of things about what to expect. You have to remember, this has been a remarkably quick development of this agent from Phase I, all the way into the point where we're now beginning registrational studies.","And so, the data does take time to emerge. You will be seeing some efficacy data on one or two tumors at SITC, but most importantly, you'll be seeing some safety data, which we think is very important to get out there at the SITC meeting as well. So some efficacy data and some safety data will be presented at SITC coming up this year. So again, that will be our first important IDO data on our drug. And as we mentioned, we expect to have our studies with our drug registrational studies beginning at the end of this year.","Second set of questions comes down to TMB, again, and thinking about what the mutational frequency will be in non-small cell lung cancer. I think it's safe to say that we believe that this is something which is still not what 100% known at this point. I think until you do prospective studies like we're doing in CheckMate 9LA, where you really have a sense of what the overall prevalence of different stratifications of TMB will be, where I think it's safe to say at this point is we think it's a substantial portion of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and that this is an important group of patients to treat.","I really do think that you need to see what the TMB percentage is in a group of prospectively treated patients. To really know what the final number is, whether it's 40% to 50%, I think those bands are fairly generous at this point and I think one really wants to see what that looks like. I think what you can say is it's definitely an important percentage of patients with non-small cell lung cancer that may qualify as having elevated or higher TMB.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks. Tracy, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. First on the Opdivo-Yervoy combo in renal, can you just, A, talk about the commercial opportunity here as we think about both products? And B, I know it's a different indication, different dose, but any learnings from that study that influence either your thinking or confidence, whether it's around CheckMate-227 or some of the additional combo studies that you're running in different tumor types.","My second question was coming back to TMB. I guess how do you see this balancing relative to PD-1 status, which also seems to predict response in some tumor types, as we think about using these as predictive markers going forward? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Chris, thank you. So I'll ask Murdo to give you some perspective on renal, and then, there are a couple of questions for Tom.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. When we think about the total renal opportunity for our I-O franchise, we're really excited about the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen in frontline. Just scale-wise in terms of patient population, the frontline opportunity is roughly twice the size of the second-line opportunity in terms of treated patients.","So if you think about the second-line size of patient population being about 8,000 per year, you're about to double that in the U.S. in the first-line RCC treated setting. So I think what we've been able to demonstrate in that trial is compelling overall survival data and obviously, there'll be an update for that presentation at SITC in a little while.","And I think depending on labeling, et cetera, that could be a very, very interesting opportunity for us. We have done a nice job in second-line share versus TKI's over 50% right now and holding. And because this is a slower-moving malignancy in terms of progression, the effect on second-line will take longer to materialize than you might see in other malignancies. So at least for next year, you're going to have a nice overlap of an uptake in first-line, if all goes well, and a continuing robust business in second-line.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And Chris, I'll follow-up now with some comments on lung cancer. So the first question is what can you read-through from renal to lung from CheckMate-214 to CheckMate-227. And I think, as I've said in the past, it's very difficult to read-through on efficacy, because you're really looking at different tumors and slightly different schedules.","But what you can read-through a little bit on, I think, is tolerability. And I think what we're so happy about CheckMate-214 is that it was a well-tolerated regimen in CheckMate-214 and patients were able to tolerate the regimen. As you know, the CheckMate-227 dose is very similar of Opdivo-Yervoy, with Opdivo being three (44:14), Yervoy being one. Although in the lung cancer regimen, Yervoy is given continuously as opposed to the renal.","So there's slight differences in the length of duration, but the toxicity of the early part of the regimen looks very similar and tells us but (44:30) it gives us confidence that the tolerability will be good. And so, I think that that's important. And tolerability is critical, because obviously, if you can't get dose into patients, you're not likely to see the benefits. So it's good to see tolerability in that setting.","Your second question is a really good one, which is how does TMB relate to PD-L1 as a marker. And this gets me thinking about how important it is to do good translational medicine studies and the translational medicine and science is really at the heart of what we're trying to do at Bristol-Myers Squibb from an R&D perspective.","Six months ago when I started, I told you it's going to be important for us to invest in our translational medicine capacity. We've done that. We're beginning \u2013 you can see our work on TMB as a good example of that. I ask you to look at the SITC meeting, and you can see a lot of very interesting preclinical data looking at drugs like OX40 and IDO, and LAG-3 in terms of how they worked mechanistically.","And also, this year, we're very happy to announce the appointment of Dr. Saurabh Saha, who is now our new leader of translational medicine at Bristol-Myers Squibb, and he brings a wealth of experience in terms of thinking about how to design drugs, both in the cancer space and in the non-cancer space which brings me back to the question of how do TMB and PD-L1 relate to each other and will these be separate sets of patients?","And again, great question. And again, as a lung cancer person, I think about the diversity of tumor markers that we have in lung cancer. We have ALK, we have EGFR, we have RET fusion, we have RAS, we have ROS, we have TMB, and we have PD-L1. We know already that while EGFR and ALK don't usually occur together, we certainly can have situations of co-mutation.","We think that RAS tends to be exclusive, but we have seen episodes or examples where you can see both of them. These are the kinds of questions that we're going to need to define prospectively what that relationship between TMB and PD-L1 are, to help us define the groups of patients that are going to benefit most from our drugs. So really interesting questions to look at in the next couple of years.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tracy, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much and thanks for providing all the details. I wanted to just ask a couple of follow-ups on CheckMate-227. So could you just clarify your message on CheckMate-227, please? Specifically, is TMB going to be used as part of the primary endpoint analysis and if you set, what TMB high versus medium versus low means?","And then, second, given the materiality, should we expect a press release on the CheckMate-227 interim once the look occurs no matter what the results are? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","David, this is Giovanni. Thanks for your question. Let me just say, the discussion we've had today on CheckMate-227 is really very consistent with what we've said before with respect to the timing for the final analysis, the potential and timing for the interim analysis, the flexibility we retain with respect to the statistical plan. And at this point, we are really not in a position to provide any additional insight on the study.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And I think, David, with regard to our press release, we'll evaluate that at the time. I think it's premature to speculate on that. Tracy, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So one question, just following up I think on the prior comments, regarding CheckMate-214 and the read-through to lung. And you mentioned you likely saw (48:41) on the safety side. I'm just curious, we did still see I think it's about 22% of patients that discontinued due to side effects in CheckMate-214. Is that level of discontinuation due to the adverse events okay in lung cancer or do you think you need to have a better profile when we see that data?","And then, second, with all the focus on the combination, I was just curious maybe you can give us a little more color on what's going on in the market right now with melanoma and just in terms of the percentage of use that's with PD-1 monotherapy, how much if it's a (49:13) combination with Yervoy? Is there a difference in terms of community-based doctors versus academic centers or U.S. ex-U.S.? Just how to think about where the use of the combination maybe more and where is monotherapy doing there? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So Vamil, thank you for your first question. Again, it's a very interesting point you raised in terms of what level of drug do you need to get into patients to see a benefit. It's really hypothetical, but it's impossible to know at this point what the level is. What you can say it in CheckMate-214 is, is that that level of discontinuation did not force the survival benefit that was seen in renal cell. Whether that is seen in lung or not, we really can't answer until we see the data, but it's a very valid question.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. And Vamil, just on metastatic melanoma, we continue to see really strong first-line marker (50:14) shares for the regimen. So roughly 30% of all new first-line metastatic melanoma patients receive Yervoy plus Opdivo in combination. And then, if you add up all the remaining monotherapy, it's about another 40%. So you've got a large percentage in combination, a large percentage in Opdivo, and then, the rest made up of KEYTRUDA.","We're also seeing some changing dynamics in the adjuvant setting, so that will also change some of what's happening in metastatic, with the update to the NCCN guidelines and hopefully, in the future an approval from the FDA, we would expect rapid uptake of Opdivo in the adjuvant setting, which will change dynamics on Yervoy.","So if you're just looking at Yervoy sales, the dynamic underneath Yervoy sales will be declined to some extent on the off-label 3-milligram use that's currently in adjuvant, being replaced by Opdivo 3-milligram and then, continuing to be used in combination with Opdivo in metastatic. So just a dynamic to keep in mind as you think about total melanoma going forward, but we have some strengthening trends on our Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen, and we're very focused on trying to improve our performance in BRAF patients.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Vamil. Can we go to the next question, please, Tracy?","Operator","We will now take our next question from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, folks. I have a few. Tom, I know you'll say it depends on the data, but how important do you think Incyte's IDO readout in melanoma is in the first half of next year, both in terms of melanoma, but also read across to other settings?","Secondly, on the NASH compound, are you confident that you have FDA's buy-in yet, as it relates to this compounding Phase III ready, based on how you did Phase II? And just a cleanup one on the Halozyme collaboration you mentioned, is this just a chair time benefit, sort of shorter infusion time angle, or is there more to that story? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So Gregg, thanks for your question. So first, regarding the Incyte, I will give you a little more color than saying it depends upon the data, because one of the things that I think that we have, one of the things that's influenced our decision-making about IDO as a class, are some of the interesting data that we've seen with our own drug, with epacadostat. What we've seen with epacadostat and Opdivo, we've seen very promising data with epacadostat and Opdivo. And so, I think that looking at the readout that comes from Pembro and epacadostat, I think will certainly be of interest to us as we go forward.","Now how this relates to other tumor types, melanoma and \u2013 I mean, how it relates to lung cancer and kidney cancer and neck cancer and whatever other cancers we look at IDO in, I think that's very difficult to know. But we will, obviously, be paying attention to that.","I think there's a couple things you have to remember between \u2013 with antibodies, when you think about the difference between antibodies and small molecules, antibodies are remarkably specific and they have high specificity for their targets. Small molecules do differ, and they can differ by a methyl group here or there that could explain both differences in activity and differences in toxicity. So I think we have to be a little careful about looking too much across readouts of different agents and, ultimately, at the end, it does depend upon the data, so you're correct about that.","Second question comes down to where we are with FGF21 and NASH. And again, this is a really important area, something that \u2013 an area that we're very excited to be in. It's an area of tremendous excitement and, as I'm sure you know, last week were the big liver meetings, and these were terrifically important meetings where data from a number of companies, including ours, were presented, and we presented an update of our data at an oral session at The Liver Meeting showing that our FGF21 drug is able to reduce hepatic fat.","We're in the middle of discussions with the FDA, in order to be able to design the appropriate studies to be able to register our drug, and we look forward to coming up with what the final study design will be in consultation with them.","I think one thing that is important to note is that we do believe that biopsy will be necessary in a Phase III trial, to be able to demonstrate efficacies, that indirect or surrogate markers like hepatic fat or Pro-C3 probably won't be enough, and the FDA said as much last week at The Liver Forum that they had, where they basically said they'd like to see more biopsy data from companies, and that was not specific to Bristol-Myers, that was a comment to all the companies that were developing drugs in that setting.","So we're looking at our options in terms of how to operationalize this, and we look forward to being able to announce, on clinicaltrials.gov, our plans for moving forward with the timing of FGF21. But you're correct, it will require biopsy as an endpoint in those studies. And I'll turn it over to Murdo on Halozyme.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. On Halozyme, we're really excited about this opportunity to partner with them on their technology. And yes, you highlight, there's definitely a large patient convenience and infusion chair time benefit to having an injectable version, versus an infusion version of our products.","But we also have to think beyond this, in terms of where site of care may take place in the future. It is possible that site of care may move from academic hospitals, academic cancer centers, to more office-based treatment, particularly if patients are on these treatments beyond a one-year timeframe and they have large travel distances. So that's one area.","The other thing to think about is, at least in the U.S., an injectable product will be reimbursed through a different payment channel, so that's something to think about as a potential advantage in the future. And last but not least, we have over 11 different assets in this agreement that we could use potentially in combination with one another in different ways, that this technology might allow us to improve again how patients receive their administrations.","Now, this is also something that is related to new payment models going forward in terms of outcomes for patients. And I think patient reported outcomes and how they experience treatment could be important. So there's a number of different strategic advantages to that agreement.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Gregg, let me just add on that, because I think it's really important as part of our strategy as a company, given the number of assets we have in development, the potential for combinations, to continue to lead in terms of innovating delivery models. Murdo's comments are really important in the U.S. A significant part of our business is outside of the U.S., where the constraints with resources at hospital level and the number of distribution on oncology sites is, in some cases, a limiting factor.","The other thing I would say is that one of our key priorities across multiple tumor types has really been, from the beginning, to accelerate immuno-oncology into the adjuvant setting. And clearly, when you look at patients that are healthy and (58:09) in the adjuvant setting, clearly, thinking about different delivery models is going to be very important for us as well.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Well, Tracy, we're coming up to the bottom of the hour, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys and thanks for the question. I just have a couple of quick ones. You guys are committed to CTLA-4 as an important mechanism in I-O. Would it make sense to make next gen CTLA-4 as the foundational combo going forward? I wasn't sure what further de-risking is needed for that program.","And then, on the quarter, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question on second-line lung trends. Opdivo sure looks to be largely stable in the U.S., but what can you tell us on overall patient flows and new start trends? Is KEYTRUDA used in first-line having an impact downstream? Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So Geoff, thanks for the question on CTLA-4. We believe CTLA-4 is incredibly important to us. It's a mechanism that we think, again, as I said earlier that the Opdivo-Yervoy combination has delivered and continues to deliver and continues to improve impact for patients broadly.","Now, we do believe that there is some opportunities for looking at our next gen CTLA-4 compounds. And there are two of them. One is the non-fucosylated formulation, which seems to have greater potency and that has entered clinical trials this year. And the second is the Probody technology that we're looking at with our partner, CytomX, again, that looks very exciting and we hope to begin clinical trials in that very soon.","So I think with either of those two approaches, once we see evidence of both the safety and efficacy, we would certainly be inclined at that point to move those agents forward as a partner for Opdivo. I do believe that they have the potential \u2013 just like CTLA-4 is foundational to us now, they have the potential to offer that kind of benefit to patients down the road.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yes, and Geoff, just on second-line, the shares, as you mentioned, are holding up nicely. That's a very strong performance commercially and with our medical organizations. We are seeing slightly lower impact on the second-line eligible pool of immuno-oncology patients. So that percentage reduction is roughly in the neighborhood of 5% in terms of volume of patients who have not seen an I-O agent in first-line before. So that's a little bit less of a reduction than we'd anticipated, so that's helping Opdivo.","We're also holding onto some first-line non-promoted share (01:00:47) and that is also stable. With respect to the penetration of Pembro in first-line, it's as we expected.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So thanks, everyone. Just in summary, at the end of the call, let me just say this was a good quarter for us. I am pleased with continuing strong trends with respect to commercial execution. We made good progress on a number of fronts in the R&D pipeline and execution overall.","We have a number of important events ahead of us, which have the opportunity to continue to broaden the set of opportunities we have ahead of us. And I look forward to continuing, obviously, to talk to all of you.","Thanks, again, and have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's call.","John E.

It is a privilege to be here as CEO to lead today's call with you, and to tell you how excited I am about our future, about the opportunities we have before us.","Building on our success over the past few years, we are beginning an exciting new chapter. One characterized by the opportunity for growth, for leading a transformation in the way cancer is treated, and for strengthening and expanding our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. And we are starting this next chapter from a position of strength.","We have an established proven strategy. We have a strong portfolio of marketed products. We have a promising pipeline, and exceptional talent.","I am fully confident that we are well positioned to build on, and further strengthen, our leadership position in immuno-oncology through Opdivo. I'm also confident we can deliver on the promise of our portfolio and our pipeline, within immuno-oncology and beyond immuno-oncology.","As I mentioned, we are about to begin a period of growth. Over the next five years, we expect growth to come primarily from Opdivo and Eliquis with important contribution from the rest of our existing portfolio of innovative medicines.","With Opdivo we will leverage our leadership position in lung, melanoma and renal cancers. In non-small cell lung we are extremely well positioned, given the two positive Phase III studies demonstrating improved overall survival. In melanoma, Opdivo and Yervoy are currently marketed, and we believe the combination regimen will be an important treatment option for patients.","In renal cancer the early stop of study 25 announced this Monday due to an advantage in overall survival confirms the promise of Opdivo in this important disease where unmet need remains high, and where we have a significant time advantage versus other competitors.","This morning, we announced that the European Commission validated two Opdivo applications, one for non-squamous cell lung cancer and the other in combination with Yervoy for metastatic melanoma. Additionally, as you know, our Opdivo development program is extremely broad with a number of ongoing studies across many tumors. We are confident this will add to the opportunity over time.","With Eliquis, given the breadth of its label and the strength of its prescription trends, we are very encouraged and look to build on our momentum. And regarding the rest of our marketed products trends are good, and we have the right resources in place to continue to compete and grow.","Longer term, we are committed to diversified portfolio. This starts with, and includes, diversification within immuno-oncology, into new mechanisms and new combinations, as well as outside of I-O, in key areas such as fibrosis, heart failure, immunology and certain genetically defined diseases.","Over the last several months I have reviewed our growth opportunities. And they are for us unprecedented. I have also focused on what we need to do to maximize them. And I am fully committed to making the right strategic investments.","In that context, and as indicated in April, we have identified areas of incremental investment beginning in the second half of the year. Investments in commercial to make sure we are well resourced globally to compete, specifically for Opdivo, Eliquis and Elotuzumab. And investments in R&D particularly in I-O, in development to accelerate and broaden programs where possible, in early discovery to accelerate new mechanisms and combinations, and in our medical organization in terms of new data generation and increasing field medical resources.","Now with respect to our second quarter. I am very pleased with our performance. Sales were strong, and we had significant and meaningful clinical and regulatory milestones in the quarter. We delivered 7% overall sales growth year-over-year, demonstrating the strength of our products across all markets. Charlie will describe key elements of our performance in more detail.","Let me spend a moment on immuno-oncology. For Opdivo we have had an incredible year so far with three early study stops, significant data presented at ASCO, three filings, three approvals and commercial launches in both the U.S. and Europe.","In the U.S., we are seeing early encouraging trends for Opdivo in terms of access, reimbursement and adoption, and I feel really good about where we are headed. Lung cancer is a very important opportunity for our company. We were first to market with squamous cell, and Opdivo has already been added to NCCN guidelines for non-squamous. In Europe we have received approval for Opdivo in both first and second line metastatic melanoma. Just this week, we were also approved for squamous lung cancer.","While the vast majority of data from our programs seeking (8:15) in I-O today has been positive, we know that not everything we study will be successful. As evidenced by the two studies for Yervoy in prostate and small cell lung cancer that did not meet their primary endpoints. Francis can comment further as we are firmly committed to Yervoy, which is an important part of our immuno-oncology strategy in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors.","Just a couple of additional immuno-oncology highlights. In the coming weeks, we expect to complete the filing of 57 data in the U.S. and Europe. And we are working on submissions for Elotuzumab based on ELOQUENT-2.","I want to spend a moment now on Hepatitis C. Here, we had a very strong second quarter. Performance was good in both Japan and Europe and we had a one-time impact from previously deferred revenues in France. Additionally, we have made significant progress in the U.S. We have filed Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 3 patients, and our PDUFA date is August 13. And we plan to add supplemental filings later this year in other difficult to treat areas.","The Hepatitis C market continues to evolve rapidly. Given our focused strategy and the evolving competitive landscape we do not plan to seek regulatory approval for our triple regimen or TRIO in the U.S. or Europe. We will continue to evaluate our filing strategy on a country-by- country basis and we'll make decisions based upon the specific needs of patients in each country.","Going forward, we expect competitive launches later this year to affect our business, particularly in Japan. That said, we will continue to execute our HCV strategy focused on addressing the needs of specific challenging to treat HCV populations which may vary by market.","So with all of that, let me now turn the floor over to Charlie who will walk you through key elements of our performance in Q2 as well as the financial implications reflected in our updated guidance.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you Giovanni, and good morning everyone. As Giovanni mentioned we had a very good quarter which was driven by strong sales growth of 7%, or 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.06.","Let me provide a few highlights. Eliquis sales were $437 million, up 23% sequentially from the first quarter with good growth both in the U.S. and international. We continue to see strong new to brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians across the broad market.","Opdivo sales were $122 million for the quarter. We are seeing strong performance metrics with the approval in lung cancer with encouraging early trends in terms of access, reimbursement and abandonment of chemo in second-line squamous lung cancer in the U.S. Additionally we received EU approval in both first and second line melanoma last month, and have launched in Germany where early trends are strong. And, as noted by Giovanni, we just received approval for squamous lung cancer in the EU as well. Opdivo has now been approved in over 30 countries.","Yervoy sales in the U.S. were $136 million in the second quarter, a 21% decrease from prior year. Outside the U.S., sales totaled $160 million, which is a 28% increase excluding FX. As expected we are seeing an impact on Yervoy from the PD-1 class in the U.S. This will likely continue in the short term until the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination regimen is approved later this year. Longer term, we believe Yervoy could have an important role to play in combination with Opdivo in multiple tumors.","Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at $479 million. Included in sales for the quarter is a one-time positive impact of $170 million related to an early access program in France that had previously been deferred until pricing was finalized. This now happened in Q2. Hep C sales performance in Japan was strong, but as you know the competitive landscape continues to evolve.","We continue to see solid growth from both Orencia and Sprycel which grew 15% and 10% respectively. HIV sales were down 14% as the HIV market is increasingly competitive and having an impact on our business.","Now let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was favorable 80 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to positive impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by product mix related to higher sales of Eliquis and lower sales of Abilify. Compared with our first quarter gross margin is down 360 basis points. Recall that last quarter we had a one-time benefit of previously accrued royalties and a full quarter of Abilify sales.","Operating expenses were somewhat higher than last year as we have been investing behind Eliquis, Hep C and Opdivo. Our tax rate for the quarter is 2 percentage points higher than last year. Our quarterly tax rate will fluctuate based on earnings mix, and remember that the R&D tax credit has yet to be passed by Congress.","Now let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. For revenues we have increased our guidance range based on strong overall sales trends with our key growth products, including Eliquis, Hep C, Orencia and Opdivo. In thinking through sales for the remainder of 2015 I would like to highlight a few dynamics. In Hep C, I mentioned there was a one-time positive impact of $170 million from France. This will not recur. Additionally, Hep C will become increasingly competitive for us, particularly in Japan where we expect a significant impact on our sales going forward.","And as I commented earlier on Yervoy, we are seeing an impact on the U.S. business from the PD-1 class. Also remember that we've restructured our Erbitux agreement. We expect Lilly to take over full commercialization in October at which point we will no longer book sales, but will instead record the royalties we receive in other income.","I will now move on to operating expenses for the remainder of this year. As Giovanni mentioned, we are committed to making the right investments to capitalize on what we think are real growth opportunities. And as you recall, I mentioned in April that we were in the process of reviewing additional new investments. We have since made strategic choices to invest in programs that we feel are necessary to maintain the leadership position of immuno-oncology as well as to support other important growth products including Eliquis and Elotuzumab. These investments are included in our revised guidance. Commercially we are adding resources globally to fully support the launches of Opdivo and Elotuzumab and also behind Eliquis to support continued strong growth.","For Opdivo we are making additional investments in R&D, medical, A&P, and we are increasing investments to accelerate Opdivo development programs where possible, and also to accelerate the development of new mechanisms and additional combination regimens. We are adding resources in our medical organization which include additional trials to generate data and also increase to field medical resources which will be important for driving awareness of Opdivo both in the U.S. and around the world. These investments are not discrete. These are programs that are beginning in the second half of this year but will continue into 2016.","In summary, we are encouraged by our good clinical results and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook, and in order to capitalize on our growth tonight we are making the right strategic investment.","Be happy now to address your questions.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks Charlie and Giovanni.","Mike, I think we are ready to go to the Q&A. And let me just remind you that in addition to Giovanni and Charlie, both Francis and Murdo are here to take any questions you might have. Mike?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","The first question is from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a couple questions. First in Bristol's all-comer trials versus its PD-L1 selected trials, is there a meaningful difference in the rate of patient enrollment? And if yes, is that due to challenge of finding patients who have that level of selectivity, or is it due to physician reluctance to do the screening for expression in the first place?","And secondly, Roche implied this morning that the chemo-combo data they will show at ESMO will continue to show strong results. Has Bristol considered taking another look at chemo-combos based on Roche's continued success with those combinations? Thank you.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Well, good morning Steve. It's Francis Cuss here. So thank you very much for that question. We have not seen any difficulty in recruiting patients for any of our studies with Opdivo or indeed the combination. And certainly it's not related to the ability to look for PD-L1 expression or not.","I would say as, a physician obviously the less one has to do to be able to treat the patient and really have a good idea of the benefit, that makes a lot of sense. So we are very happy that we're heading towards broad labels for the tumors we're looking at, and we've fully characterize the PD-L1 expression.","Moving to the combinations with chemotherapy, we believe we have very comprehensive data set now with various chemotherapy Nivo combinations \u2013 probably with the longest follow-up in the industry. Based on our comprehensive data from CheckMate-012, combinations of Opdivo with conventional chemo regimens may sometimes achieve high and durable responses. But we've seen with longer follow-up that the survival at a year was actually no different for Opdivo combinations with chemo compared to Opdivo monotherapy. In effect what we saw was additive but non-durable response rates at the cost of additional toxicity.","Now just to put this in context we showed at ASCO last time, one year survival for Opdivo mono-therapy of about 70% to 85% regardless of PD-L1 expression. So we are focused on the Opdivo Yervoy combo and we'll in addition continue to explore other scientifically driven combinations to advance our first line strategy and our position. We are additionally interested in nontraditional chemo-combo regimens including innovative approaches to sequences and maintenance.","So let me just remind you, our strategy for first line is to improve survival and replace (20:31). And to do this we are exploring multiple Opdivo combinations as well as mono-therapy. And earlier I-O assets targeted therapies and chemo, both internally and externally. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Steve, let me just add to what Francis just said. This is Giovanni. With respect to your first question, we're actually very excited that we are enrolling ahead of schedule, as Francis said. And that's clearly an indicator of the interest in the first line trial with Opdivo.","And with respect to your chemotherapy question, just to add again to what Francis said. What's really interesting that we are seeing in the marketplace, in the very early days of our launch in second line, is the speed at which chemotherapy is being abandoned. There's clearly concerns with the limitations in terms of long-term efficacy, and obviously the side effects are something that physicians and patients are actually being really excited about abandoning as well. So I think that's an important first early learning from the marketplace.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thank you Steve. Mike, can we go to next question please?","Operator","Next question is from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi, I have three questions, if I may. Firstly I'm just interested in your reaction to the negative news in relation to the Yervoy trial in small cell lung cancer. My understanding is the tumors have very high mutational loads. Plus smokers, they may have had prior radio therapy. I mean, all of the factors that you may increase the providency of response. So any additional insights you have on that, and what it means will be interesting.","Second, I saw some commentary that potentially the ARISTOTLE data may allow for approval in some sub-types of viselar (22:26) AF which is not possible for your competitors in that space. To what extent do you intend to prosecute this? And could it be used as an additional competitive tool in that market?","And then finally, your guidance, although raised continues to look at more than achievable. Are there any additional headwinds that perhaps we ought to be considering that we're not taking into account? Many thanks.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning Andrew. Obviously I'm disappointed that the studies in small cell and prostate didn't meet their primary endpoints with Yervoy. And I think it's really important to say, we never expected that every I-O agent in every tumor was going be successful. But again we're here to follow the science and generate the data. Now I think it's also fair to say that based on the pre-clinical science and the promising clinical data we've seen, our strategy is rapidly evolving to studying combinations of Yervoy and Opdivo in multiple tumors.","So, just to talk about small cell for a moment, we presented data at ASCO \u2013 that's the CheckMate-032 study that showed activity in platinum sensitive and resistant patients in both mono-therapy, but even more interestingly in combination. And with very good tolerability. And I think it's also important to say we've shown activity in prostate cancer with Yervoy even though we didn't actually meet our primary end points.","So let me say that I think we believe in the importance of the complementary mechanism of action in I-O. We are firmly committed to Yervoy, which I think is a very important part of our combination strategy, combined with Opdivo in multiple tumors. And I think it's important to say that we're making very good progress at the moment in melanoma with validation of our EU combo filing just this week. And we have the upcoming PDUFA date at the end of September for the U.S. 069 filing.","Turning to the ARISTOTLE data. I'm not going to get into the details of our regulatory strategy around this but we are looking at every opportunity to use what we believe is a very important data set. Talking to KOLs and the regulatory authorities in terms of providing additional information for this very important area.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Andrew, this is Charlie. I'll briefly touch on your guidance question. We raised guidance because we feel very strongly and encouraged about our sales trends about the key products that are \u2013 not just for us now, but as we look into the future. We did have some one-off items where the French ATU, which helped us in the first half. And remember that we had Abilify in the first \u2013 basically in the first quarter that doesn't replicate.","I would also mention that gross margin, the first half of the year we were averaged at 78%. I've guided to 76%. We're starting to see the unwind of the favorable foreign exchange we see in the first half. And also remember that the expenses that both Giovanni and I spoke about earlier by and large accrue to us in the second half of this year.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","And just to add on that, Andrew, I would say, as I mentioned at the beginning, we really are entering in a period of exciting growth. I am very encouraged by the fact that we have very strong clinical momentum, good progress on the regulatory front. Commercial execution is strong. And you'll see the trends for our growth products continue. Obviously Charlie described some of the dynamics in the second quarter. But we've made a decision to make a number of strategic investments at a time in which we really are in a position of strength, beginning an important phase of growth. And I think I'm really confident in how this chapter that I describe between now and 2020 will play out for us.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew, for your questions. Mike can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks so much for taking the question. Two if I could. So one is you mentioned the diversification that you want to do both within I-O but also outside of I-O. And I guess my question is given how large most of us feel the I-O opportunity's going be for you, to remain well diversified outside of I-O, I'm curious if you feel you need to do some sort of larger acquisition in order to gain a presence in some of the areas that you talked about that matches up to sort of what you're going to be getting in the I-O side of things\/","And then second, just you touched on this a little bit earlier, but in terms of the combination approaches in the front line setting for lung cancer. Obviously a lot of focus has been on Opdivo and Yervoy. Can you just at a high level, Francis, maybe just give us a sense of some of the other combinations that you're working on? Which ones are you most excited about? I know you have a number that are in progress. But based on your early data, kind of which ones would you say that you'd get as the most optimism for potentially giving us positive data in future? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Yes, Vamil. Thank you. This is Giovanni. Let me just answer the first question on diversification. And then Francis will make some comments on combination strategies.","So my perspective is that obviously at the center of our strategy is immuno-oncology. And as I said at the beginning, when we think about the next period of growth between now and 2020, the next five years, our growth will come disproportionately from Opdivo and Eliquis. And within Opdivo, obviously there is an element of diversification as well because our staffing strategies are really focused on lung, and melanoma and renal cell. But then we are expanding into a large number of other tumor opportunities.","Longer term, we believe we have an exciting early pipeline within immuno-oncology, and in a select number of areas in which we are focused that can drive our growth in the medium and the long-term. And the areas are the ones we've discussed before. So CV with a focus on heart failure, immunology, and the areas of fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. In all of those areas, we have ongoing programs which are early, but are potentially transformative. And with respect to how we complement that, our business development strategy is \u2013 does not change, and it's really the strategy that we've articulated before.","I think that one of our core strength as a company is really our ability to complement internal R&D with business development. We've clearly demonstrated that in fibrosis with the recent agreements we had. And even in CV through our deal with uniQure. So you will see us continue to execute our strategy in business development to complement our internal programs there.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning. So let me just draw you back a little bit just to talk about our first line lung strategy because I think it's very important. We have two studies in first line, two registration potential studies. One in mono-therapy U026 in PD-L1 expressing patients, and this provides the quickest way to bring Opdivo to first line patients. And I think based on the data we presented at ASCO that, that we're very enthusiastic about that study.","As you noted, we do have a registration study of Opdivo and Yervoy together which is started in both expressers and non-expressers of PD-L1. And that's the next likely potential positive study. So we believe that Opdivo will be foundational, and that the Nivo combos have the best potential to further improve survival, and to replace chemotherapy as Giovanni mentioned earlier.","Now obviously earlier we have a LAG-3 program in combination with Nivo that's in early stage testing. We hope to see some data on that next year. And behind that, we have a bold initiative to bring forward six additional assets into the clinic in the next 18 months. And some of these would be certainly natural to expect to combine with the Nivolumab. So we have a near medium and long-term opportunity to look at different approaches to first line lung cancer and replace chemotherapy. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Great. Thank you Vamil for the questions. Mike, can we go to the next one please?","Operator","Next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Charlie, this is for you. First are you signaling higher levels of investment spending now because you think that the opportunity set for I-O is even bigger than you had originally imagined? Or is it because the market has become more competitive?","And secondly, can you commit to investors that we will see significant bottom line leverage? Because it sounds like you're pushing that out a bit. Is that the right way to look into this? Is that going to be next year? Is it going be in 2017? And again does the renewed higher level of spend delay the margin leverage or does it actually accelerate the margin leverage? Or strengthen it rather. Thanks very much.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jami. I think the I-O opportunity as we see it, with the continued good clinical outcomes, stoppage of trials. I think we mostly see it as our opportunity to just continue to reinforce our leadership position in I-O. Clearly we recognize that I-O is immensely competitive and that has a small factor, but I think it's largely due to how we see our competitive position within the overall I-O space.","As it relates to the bottom line and how we potentially see leverage. To seize on that opportunity as we continue to see the evolution of that, and not only that, but our performance in the market, we see that it's required to continue to invest to maximize that opportunity. And I don't necessarily see that the leverage \u2013 I can't comment on 2016, but as I look further out to the back end of this decade, I will see that that will ultimately improve our leverage.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Let me just, Jami, just further reinforce the point that Charlie has made. When you look at our immuno-oncology opportunity there is very strong momentum from a clinical perspective. I think it's fair to say our strategies have been validated clearly this year. There is extremely good execution from a regulatory perspective, not only in the U.S. but in Europe and internationally as well. Commercial execution is strong. The early indicators are encouraging. And I think that our decision to incrementally invest is really one that starts from our position of strength, and the confidence we have in the magnitude of the opportunity in the medium and in the long term.","And as I said at the beginning, for us this is an unprecedented set of opportunities, and we're making the right investments behind them. Obviously we are very conscious of the comment you made with respect to leverage and increased profitability. And I think as we look at this period we see that happening, as Charlie said.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Jami. Mike, can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Next question is from Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A few questions on immuno-oncology. Can you talk about how you think the PD-L1 bio marker will play out in Europe, in the near or intermediate term? There's been several companies that have commented that they think European payers and maybe even regulators will be more aggressive in pushing the bio marker as a kind of a treatment decision tool in lung cancer.","Second question is in first line lung in PD-L1 negative patients. Do you see any opportunity for PD mono-therapy? Or at this point is it really only looking like combination is going to be the path forward again in bio marker negative patients? The reason I ask is obviously there's some divergence in how it seems to be working in second line, versus how it may work in first line.","And then Opdivo pricing in Germany. Can you just mention where you are relative to the U.S.?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Yes. Tim, let me just start on the first part of the question. Murdo will further expand on Europe, including the pricing in Germany, and then Francis can answer your comments on first line.","I think we're in a very, very strong position globally in having a data set across all patient populations that enable us to describe to physicians and patients and payers, the role of bio markers. And I think it is important that our strategy there has been validated. The roll of biomarkers is different, it depends on the line of therapy, it depends on the tumor. But we have the right data sets to have those discussions. We are receiving strong feedback from physicians including in Europe regarding our strategy. And I'll ask Murdo to give you some more insights there.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yes, thanks, Giovanni. Thanks, Tim, for the question. We are as Giovanni highlighted hearing from European thought leaders that consistent with some of the perspective of U.S. thought leaders post ASCO, that the role of PD-L1 is unclear in selecting patients. So that consistent perspective has been played back. That being said, given the nature of the healthcare systems across Europe, we could end up in discussions with payers in Europe where they are seeking to restrict Opdivo in second line patients in lung cancer. So we will work obviously very closely with each of the payers in Europe to help them understand the full breadth of the data as Giovanni has highlighted. We are in a position to describe the efficacy of Opdivo across a broad range of second line patients, across a broad range of histologies.","In Germany we've been fortunate, we've had a very quick start. As you know, reimbursement is not a barrier to initial launch in Germany. And we have a tacked (37:48) well, a public price of \u20ac7,421 roughly per month, and that was listed July 15.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Tim. I think it's absolutely clear that the bar is higher in first line because of the benefits seen with double-up therapy. And as a result, we have focused on the PD-L1 monotherapy population and our combination therapy \u2013 sorry, our Yervoy Nivo combination study, we have looked predominantly at that.","That being said, we do believe we've seen some interesting data we've presented at ASCO in terms of durable responses in PD-L1 negative patients in first line. Don't think we've got to a point yet where we're comfortable understanding whether it's appropriate to go directly against the platinum doublers (38:47), but of course there's lots of other combinations too, as I mentioned. Beyond IPI\/Nivo there are earlier I-O assets, target therapies and these nontraditional chemo-combo regimens I talked about. So I think there's a lot of opportunity. We're looking at all of them. But we're leading off with the Yervoy Opdivo combination in the negative patient population. That's the nearest term for us. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","And Tim, we feel very strongly about our first line lung strategy. As we said at the beginning in answering the first question, the enrollment of the monotherapy trial in PD-L1 positive ahead of schedule. As you know we've posted the combo trial on ClinicalTrials.gov, and that study on the combination is one that is clearly very, very important for us. As you know, we've done a lot of early work in that space in understanding the regimen, the combination regimen that can be most effective in patients in lung cancer. And I think you'll see some of that data when we go to the lung, the World Lung meeting in September from further analysis of Study 12.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks Tim for the questions. Mike, can we go to the next one please?","Operator","Next question is from John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. First one just Opdivo related on renal cancer. Just any \u2013 I know it's probably early since you just top-lined, but any thoughts around the publication and presentation strategy along with your regulatory strategy for renal?","In addition, would seem like \u2013 can we get an update on your hematology glioblastoma multiforme head and neck trials. It seems as though those trials seem to be enrolling with potentially data sometime in 2016. So any update there?","On HCV on the $170 million, can you provide any update on what the price was per patient that you secured in the French market? And then lastly on Eliquis, just any quantitative metrics that you have on the new to brand share in cardiology and primary care would be helpful? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Sure. So why don't Francis start with your questions on renal and hematology and then we'll take the Hep C questions.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, John. We were obviously very excited when the study was stopped early based on the top line data from the interim analysis. And the fact that Opdivo demonstrated an improvement in overall survival versus the standard of care (41:26) we believe from previous studies is just about unique. Can't talk more about the data before it's presented, but I will say we're working with the investigators on a future presentation and a publications results as soon as possible.","As far as the \u2013 our regulatory strategy I'm not going to go into detail, but I think as you've seen we've shown recently in melanoma in lung we can work together and very quickly with the FDA and other health authorities. And we'll be looking to submit that data as soon as possible.","Let me just talk about the other data that might be coming out. I think in addition to the nine registration studies in the last year that we've had positive data, we have a further 25 either ongoing or planned. You mentioned some of them.","As we look forward, obviously it depends on the data, although I will say recruitment is going well, but we may see information next year in 2016 in Hodgkins, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and bladder potentially. And potentially some others. So it's going be \u2013 we're going to continue seeing differentiated data, which is what we're trying to do. But I think in the near term, with all the differentiated data we've had, we're certainly focusing on getting those submissions in and getting the broadest label we can as quickly as possible.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","And, John, the other question you asked regarding the ATU in France it's a program that was open from beginning of March until the end of October. We accrued roughly 4,000 patients in that program. And the price for a 12 week supply was \u20ac25,500, and that's public.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Great. Thanks John, for the questions. Can we go to the next one, Mike, please?","Operator","Next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Oh, hey guys, just a couple questions. One, on World Lung we're obviously going to see the updated data from the Nivo\/IPI Phase II that presumably informed the dose selection for Phase III. And I was wondering, I realize you can't give us any data, but I was just wondering if we would see one year overall survival data from the Phase III regimens. And if so, should we hold those data to the benchmark that you provided for Nivo monotherapy which you stated was 70% to 85% overall survival in the first line setting?","And second of all, this has sort of been asked by other analysts, so I don't mean to be redundant, but there's been so much deal activity out there this year, especially gobbling up some of these biotechs. And you guys have chosen generally speaking to do smaller stuff. I'm just wondering is that because \u2013 is that your strategy to kind of do generally speaking smaller stuff, or do you feel that there's a valuation disconnect in this mid-cap biotech universe? I ask this because an hour ago John Lechleiter over at Lilly actually stated on his earnings call that he thinks mid-cap biotech is in a bubble. Thank you.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Mark. First of all, as you say, you'll be glad to hear \u2013 finally you will be hearing about the 012 data on the combination. These are the combinations, the regimens that we have taken forward into our trial, the 227 trial. I will say we're excited about it. We've consulted obviously with thought leaders and they also recommend that we should go forward with these. I'm not going to talk specifically about the regimens, but what I will say is these are pretty large studies, of large numbers of patients for an early study, approximately 50 per group. We have data on all patients up to about six months, but obviously as you appreciate as these mature, some of them are further out and they will continue to inform going forward. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait for specifics until it's presented.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Mark, on business development. Let me just reiterate what I said before, our strategy does not change. We are indifferent with the size of the opportunities, but I will ask Charlie to comment further.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I would just say that, John, we have a lot of balance sheet flexibility to do deals of various sizes. I think our sweet spot if you look back historically has been in the smaller type deal. I wouldn't necessarily say that that's all we look at. We look at a number of things.","As it relates to mid-cap biotech prices, if you look at how they've performed over the last several years comparative to larger cap pharma or to the S&P, significantly outpaced. So there is a significant valuation. I'd hate to call it a bubble, because who knows how long this may last. But it is, I would say, well out-performed the market.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Mark, for questions. Can we go to next one, please, Mike?","Operator","Next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus C. Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks. I have a couple of questions. So first, as we think about the CheckMate \u2013 012 data, Francis can you just give us just generally what features really drove the recommendation internally and by your thought leaders to really utilize this data set, the 012 data set? Because I think we're all wondering how should we think about this and how did it inform 227? In terms of response rate, survival duration, depth of response, what were the features that you think were differentiated?","Separately, your comments on the data sets in combination with chemotherapy are helpful, but when might we actually see that data really showing the diminution of the durable responses over time?","And then the last question just in terms of how uptake is actually occurring in the market today, what data, if you do have it available, can you share with us with regard to the mix? So what percentage of Opdivo patients are melanoma patients? What percent are squamous lung, and what percent are non-squamous?","And then if I could just one final question. There was a second kidney cancer study that announced data and provided the data in their press release with regard to overall survival. How do you see Opdivo competing with that asset, Cabozantinib, in the public market? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Seamus, why don't we start with the \u2013 your questions on 012 and lung broadly for Francis, then we'll go to Opdivo uptake and, Murdo will give you some insights there.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Okay. So good morning, Seamus. So when we look at the data set we have, where obviously the focus is really on maintaining the kind of efficacy we've seen in the combination, but wanting to get as close in terms of tolerability to Nivo monotherapy. And so the first thing to look at in these two will be the tolerability. As far as the efficacy's concerned, as you know, we've focused pretty much on the durability of responses, or overall survival, or one year landmark survival. And as I said we had six months survival for all patients in this study and it's maturing. So it's really about this therapeutic index both tolerability and efficacy.","In terms of the chemo data I believe we have presented some of that. Obviously as is important with these exploratory studies the data matures and continues to become more informative with time. Can't tell you exactly when we will be presenting it but we will be sometime in the future.","And just an R&D comment on the Cabo data. Obviously we haven't seen the full data set but I think if you look at our Phase II monotherapy data for Opdivo in renal cell, I think we showed superior efficacy to TKI's [tyrosine kinase inhibitors] with also TKI \u2013 sorry, with superiority in terms of tolerability also.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Murdo?","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","And, Seamus, your question regarding uptake, we're really excited about what we're seeing in the market with Opdivo. The initial launch in melanoma was a strong launch. Obviously in second line what we are seeing now is that we are about at parity with Keytruda in the community setting, and we're gaining good market share in the institutional setting.","I will say in melanoma we're also seeing some off label usage since ASCO of PD-1 inhibitors in front line, as you recall from Charlie and Giovanni's remarks that's put some pressure on Yervoy, but Opdivo is seeing lift in a non-promoted setting there. And in lung we've really had a very rapid penetration of the squamous second line market. We're getting about two-thirds of new patients there, and that happened very rapidly. And then since NCCN updated June 12 post-ASCO we've also seen a very nice uptick in lung overall. Clearly that's another off label indication given that we're only promoting in squamous right now. So I would say very soon we'll see lung eclipsing our melanoma business and we'll see some nice growth out of Opdivo this year.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Yea. So it's early days but the trends we are seeing are really encouraging. I should say that our launch in Germany as we mentioned before is off to a really strong start as well. It's even earlier there but execution so far has been very strong.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Seamus, for the questions. Can we go to the next one please, Mike?","Operator","Next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple additional follow-up commercial questions on Opdivo. Can you just elaborate a little bit more in terms of the lung adoption so far? Just where are you seeing that in terms of community versus some of the major kind of medical centers? Are you seeing good community uptake already in lung? Or is that still to come?","Second, on the European side of things, just can you elaborate how you're thinking about the ramp ultimately in Europe? Any other hurdles we should think about? Just how should we just think about the broader dynamics beyond Germany over time?","And then the final question was just on the non-traditional chemo dosing with Opdivo in lung. Just any more color of specifically what you're looking at there and when we could see any initial data? Thanks so much.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","So, Chris, let me take the first couple of questions and then I'll pass it over to Francis for your last one. In the U.S. we are seeing very balanced uptake. So we're seeing very rapid adoption in second line squamous in the community and in the academic setting. As you may recall, we did a large amount of education around immuno-oncology when we launched Yervoy and I think having a broad understanding of how the immune check point inhibitors work, the safety profile being particularly good with Nivolumab has helped us have a very rapid penetration in the community. And so I think we'll expect that to continue with broadening indications.","In Europe, we're very encouraged by what we've seen as Giovanni mentioned in Germany. I would say that the enthusiasm and interest in second line squamous and in first and second line melanoma is very high. I think obviously as you know the rate limiter in many European markets will be how quickly we can secure market access, and we have a lot of people on the ground working very closely with the payers and reimbursement authorities across Europe to expedite that as best as possible while still securing a good reimbursement price.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","So I would say you'll probably see obviously, as always in Europe, a very similar sequence as we saw for Yervoy and we see for other new products with rapid launch and uptake in countries where that process is short. But continuing significant number of launches over the next 12 months to 18 months across all European markets.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Chris. So the thinking really behind the sequencing is, there's sort of two potential hypotheses. One is that you might generate more antigens from cytotoxicity of the tumor, and that might be a good thing, and you might want to get that in before the I-O. The opposite one is that you might actually be causing some immune suppression with chemotherapy, and actually reducing the benefits of I-O. And, of course, what we have seen is probably better one-year survival in our exploratory studies in first line with Opdivo than with second line. Might be other features involved with that, too.","So we think it's very important to understand, as we are with I-O agents, the sequence and actually explore exactly what the right approach to this might be. Those studies are ongoing. We don't have any plans at the moment \u2013 we have no data, but no plans to present yet. But obviously sometime in the future we will be doing that. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Chris, for the questions. Mike, I think we have time for one more. We're at the bottom of the hour here.","Operator","The last question is from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Just a couple quick ones. First, Giovanni, just so I'm clear on your theme of diversification which has been quite clear since you took over. It sounds like you think the portfolio will naturally diversify as it is now, combined with your pipeline and licensing efforts. Am I missing something? Are you suggesting that Bristol needs to do more of something to diversify faster than it already is? I just want to be clear on that.","And my second question on Opdivo. I'm curious if any payers have tried to get you into a contracting environment yet with two similar therapies out there now, albeit with different data sets, and others to come. Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Okay, let me comment quickly on the diversification issue. I think that when we look at our business, the period between now and 2020, the next five years, the growth as I said is clearly \u2013 will clearly come disproportionately from the growth of Opdivo and the potential of Eliquis. Within Opdivo there is a degree of diversification.","Long term as we think about a second cycle, we are thinking about our early pipeline generating opportunities that are more diversified for us within immune-oncology, because as Francis mentioned, we have clearly assets in the clinics; we're bringing six more assets into the clinic. So there is an element of diversification which is already within immuno-oncology, but then we have exciting early programs in the other areas.","So it is a concept that does not require us to change our approach, and in fact what I mentioned at the beginning, importantly, is that our business development strategy remains pretty much the same. Let me ask Murdo to make \u2013 to give you some perspective on payers.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Thanks, Giovanni. Thanks, Gregg. We've really been fortunate with the quality of data that have been generated behind Opdivo. The value that we've been able to establish for patients with metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, and I think that's been recognized by payers. We've established very broad and very rapid access in the U.S.","The breadth of indications that we hope will follow will also further strengthen our ability to weather any attempt that any payers may have to try to restrict these agents, which is very difficult to do in the oncology area with drugs like Opdivo with overall survival benefits. So we feel very good about our current access and our ability to sustain that going forward.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","So thanks, everyone. Let me just close the call and say again, we had a very strong quarter. We have good momentum with our long-term growth drivers, significant clinical progress, strong regulatory developments, very good commercial execution and trends in the marketplace. We are making the right investments. It is clear to me that we are well on our way and entering an exciting period of growth for the company.","So thanks everyone. And have a good day.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Okay. Thanks, everybody. Mike, that's going to conclude the call. As always, if you have follow-ups you can reach me or Randy or Bill later today or tomorrow. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Public Affairs. Please go ahead, sir.","John Elicker","Thanks, Aaron, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining the call to review our Q2 results. Before we get started, let me take care of the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we\u2019ll make statements about the Company\u2019s future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company\u2019s SEC filings.","These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change.","We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.","With me this morning, we have Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Both Lamberto and Charlie will have prepared remarks, and then joining for Q&A Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer and Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Commercial Officer. Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. Well, we just completed another good quarter of Bristol-Myers Squibb, good in terms of financial performance and good in terms of clinical results and regulatory milestone. Overall, revenues were 3.9 billion, a 7% increase over the last period excluding the diabetic business that we still had in the second quarter 2013. We delivered strong growth of our key products in particular of Eliquis and Yervoy. For Eliquis, we continue to execute against our strategy to clearly capitalize on a differentiated and unique profile. And we continue to improve the persistent trend generated by the increased resources, we and Pfizer have been devoting to direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and to sales force expansion and peer-to-peer medical education activities in all countries.","We also make good improvement in access, and the level of Eliquis is expanding beyond atrial fibrillation. We just received a positive recommendation for approval in Europe for the treatment of recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism and subsequent approval the final registration should be formalized in August. The same indication is under regulatory review in the U.S. Yervoy also had a very strong performance this quarter. Best quarter ever with $321 million in sales, a 38% increase over the last period. We continue to see strong demand worldwide.","As we advance and expand our immune-oncology leadership position, we continue to view Yervoy as an important component of our strategy both in mono-therapy and in combination regimens. With respect to other regulatory developments, the big news this quarter was our recent Japanese approval of our hepatitis C dual regimen, daclatasvir and asunaprevir. Because of significant development for the 1.2 million hepatitis C patients being in Japan, many of whom currently have no treatment options. It was also significant for our company for Bristol-Myers Squibb. This was the first approval of our dual regimen anywhere world and this is the first time the first approval of one of our product and in fact two products at the same time occurred in Japan, something that underscores the global nature of our company.","And while the Japan approval was the first, we also expect important news in other key markets starting with Europe where the CHMP has given daclatasvir a positive opinion for use with our agent. This has also been a very important quarter for Opdivo or nivolumab with key data presentation, new regulatory development and new collaborations that enhance our global development portfolio. We presented important data at ASCO regarding renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer and melanoma as monotherapy and in combination regimens. ","A double blind Phase III Opdivo study in melanoma was stopped for a very good reason. The data was too good to keep patients under treatment with the traditional chemotherapy to which it was compared. ","In the U.S. we recently announced our plan to seek marketing approval for Opdivo in advanced melanoma with the filing with the FDA in the third quarter. This is an addition to the raw information in lung cancer that we are previously initiating and that should be completed by the end of the year.","For Europe we have just received confirmation this morning that the CHMP Daklinza accelerated assessment formula static melanoma, we expect to complete our European metastatic melanoma submission in Q3. And yesterday we completed a strategic collaboration with Ono pharmaceuticals to help address the unmet medical needs of patients who have cancer in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.","This follows the approval Ono received for Opdivo in Japan making it the first PD-1 approved anywhere. We will have more important milestone for our immuno-oncology program in the coming months including regulatory submissions and data readouts. We are definitely uniquely positioned and we believe we can realize the potential immuno-oncology without our deep and large portfolio and our experience and committed people.","Taken together this was a good quarter one that reflected our balanced approach for delivering strong results today while building a solid foundation for tomorrow. And now I will turn the floor to Charlie. ","Charlie Bancroft","","Thank you, Lamberto and good morning everyone. Overall, we had a very good second quarter with strong growth across most of our key brands. Let me provide a few highlights. Eliquis sales were 171 million. As Lamberto noted, our continued investments are building momentum for Eliquis around the world. In the U.S. net sales for Eliquis were 94 million up 54% from the first quarter.","Our new to brand share among cardiologist has grown nearly eight share points since the start of the year. Outside the U.S. net sales were 77 million up 71% from the first quarter. In addition to Germany where Eliquis used to remain strong we are seeing robust growth elsewhere in Europe, especially Italy and France following recent launches there. We are also seeing very good growth in Japan. We continue to make progress in broadening our label, we launched our Ortho indication for deep vein thrombosis in the U.S. in mid-April and expect regulatory decisions for BTE treatment in the U.S. by late August and in Europe by the end of the year.","Yervoy sales grew 38% to 321 million, U.S. sales were 173 million, Yervoy\u2019s best quarter since launch. Sales outside the U.S. totaled 148 million led by market such as Germany, France and just recently the U.K. where we have reimbursement in the first blind study. We also reported strong sales in Australia, Brazil and Canada. Driven by our execution in the markets we are seeing increased awareness about immunotherapy and more community oncologist prescribing Yervoy for the first time.","Orencia sales increased 14% to 402 million. Orencia had a solid quarter due to higher demand in the U.S., Canada and South America. Orencia SubQ has growing 60% worldwide since the same quarter last year and 18% sequentially from the first quarter as we continue to improve our performance in the first blind study. SubQ now accounts for 40% of all Orencia sales even as the IV remains strong.","We did see softness in our Virology business in the quarter. In our HIV franchise, we are seeing increased competitive pressure for Reyataz and the continued impact of last year\u2019s loss of exclusivity for Sustiva in Europe. For Baraclude, sales were down 1%, strong sequential and year-over-year growth for Baraclude in the U.S. and Europe was offset by lower demand in China and inventory work down in Japan.","Abilify sales were 555 million during the quarter including 97 million in Europe. Recall that our rights to Abilify in Europe expired on June 11. As a result we no longer had any commercial interest in or obligations to Abilify in Europe which has accounted for the majority of our Abilify sales outside the U.S.","Before moving to the rest of our P&L, let me remind everyone how we account for the diabetes transaction as this is the first full quarter since we divested our diabetes franchise in February. We record diabetes related royalties in other income. Due to tiered structure of these royalties we recorded the largest royalty income for 2014 in Q2. These royalties are expected to decline as the year progresses. ","Our other income line also includes transitional services income from AstraZeneca of over 30 million in the quarter. We expect this income to taper off between now and the end of the year. We also expect to book diabetes product supply revenues of about 30 million per quarter through yearend. For details about our diabetes royalty tier structure and other diabetes related revenues and expenses, please see our SEC filings.","Now, let me highlight a few items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.5% during the quarter, up 110 basis points compared to the same period last year, mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our diabetes business.","Marketing, selling and admin expenses increased 9% as our increased investments in Eliquis, Yervoy and our pre-launched assets in immuno-oncology and hepatitis C were offset by reduced expenses in diabetes.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.3% during the quarter compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. The difference is due to earnings mix plus the exploration of the R&D tax credit, which has not yet been extended.","I want to spend a few moments discussing business development. Our approach has not changed. We continue to view business development as a top priority for capital allocation and we will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our commercial and R&D portfolios. These opportunities must meet three criteria. They must be aligned with our diversified specialty biopharma strategy. They must have a strong scientific rationale and they must have the potential of providing the meaningful return to our shareholders.","Since last quarter, we have signed several agreements to strengthen our global IO development portfolio. As Lamberto mentioned, yesterday we announced an agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical to jointly develop and commercialize Opdivo, Yervoy and three of our early-stage IO assets in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. This agreement significantly enhances our ability to pursue combination regimens with Opdivo as the foundation since Ono previously owned exclusive rights to Opdivo in these markets. Similarly, our recently announced agreements with Incyte and Celldex will expand a number of clinical trials involving Opdivo and other immunotherapy.","I will conclude my remarks on 2014 guidance. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.70 to $1.80 is unchanged. Our guidance assumes we retain exclusivity on Baraclude quick sales in the U.S. at least through the end of 2014. It also assumes that the R&D tax credit will be extended this year.","Now, we'll be happy to address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Although, first the Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a little more on the business develop priority front, given the increasing competition in the IO space and how leveraged you are to the story, has this changed your appetite or how you\u2019re thinking about doing deals within IO versus diversifying into other therapeutic areas? ","Number two on Eliquis, congrats on the results this quarter; can you just give us a little more color on what\u2019s going well, whether there is still room for improvement? ","And then just finally if you could just give me a bit more color on what we should expect from you between now and yearend in terms of data readouts and any color around as international would be helpful? Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Okay a few questions. Let me start with BD and I don't know Charlie if you want to add something to what I am going to say, but on BD, the criteria that Charlie mentioned in his remarks apply to both immuno-oncology and other areas. So to answer your questions, we\u2019re looking at opportunities in both immuno-oncology and other areas, and the concept is always -- the goal is always to add things that make our overall portfolio stronger which is a selective integration of external R&D and internal R&D.","Charlie Bancroft"," ","Anything I would add in regard to IO, we are pioneers in this space. We have a lot of assets. We have deep knowledge and great scientists. So, we tend to be a strong partner of choice within the IO space and we will continue to look for deals in that area that makes sense that meet our criteria. And we continue to at look at ideas across the spectrum outside of IO. As you know, we signed the iPierian deal earlier this year which is one indication of things that we\u2019re looking at.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","So let\u2019s move to Eliquis, we always note that the strength of the Eliquis clinical data is really unmatched among the novel anticoagulants, and we are glad that this strength is increasingly understood, and it\u2019s increasingly appreciated by physicians. And the (dataset we have generated in a team) [ph] is clearly being reinforced as we bring additional indications to the market. Do you want -- Giovanni do you want to say a few more things about or few things about [indiscernible]?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, thank you and good morning. So we indeed had a good quarter with Eliquis. In the U.S., we had a very good quarter in key international markets and I\u2019ll make a couple of comments about both areas. In the U.S. we saw good progression and trends with a 40% increase in NBRx volume and a 50% increase in TRx volume versus the previous quarter. Interest in notably in cardiology which is really our area of primary focus, our NBRx share grew to 38% but interestingly we also started seeing really good trends and progression in primary care where our NBRx share grew significantly to 28% versus the previous quarter.","What\u2019s driving our performance in the U.S. is really first what Lamberto mentioned the strength of our profile and our clinical data, second, solid execution of our strategy and I'll point to a few things. First, we clearly have set an objective to continue to strengthen our access position and in the second quarter we were able to continue to make progress with formula relisting of Eliquis in now over 90% of our target hospitals. Second, on the access side, we were able to add a preferred status with approximately 20 million incremental license in the U.S. we had good success with Caremark and well point and now we have very strong preferred access to the tune of about 60% on the commercial side and 80% on the Medicare side. And this obviously is a development that will continue to generate growth going forward. ","We have very competitive investment levels in the U.S. and leading share of voice in cardiology and primary care and we continue to make investments in medical education and in DTC advertising. ","Thinking about the U.S. as Lamberto mentioned, we had an ongoing file with the FDA for BTE treatment and we think that is a meaningful opportunity going forward first broadening of our label, reinforces the strength of our profile, it also continues to result in growing our prescribers base and we consider that to be very important.","Just a couple of comments outside of the U.S. we have strong performance in European in those markets that were reimbursed first like Germany, we continue to make key inroads against Pradaxa and Xarelto in other markets like France that launched recently enjoyed very strong initial uptake. ","Outside of Europe and Japan which is another one of our priority markets, you will remember that at the beginning of the year, our initial reimbursement restriction was lifted following that we had a very rapid acceleration of our growth and I am really happy to report that in terms of the dynamic segment Eliquis is now the leading agent in terms of the ability to capture new and switch patients in the market we are leaders with a 40% share in the total dynamic segment.","We are leading in terms of the switch share and approaching Xarelto in terms of the new patient shares so very strong performance there as well.","Charlie Bancroft"," ","Good morning Colin. We have an exciting second half of the year in terms of data flow. We have the O-63 results [indiscernible] results coming up with the multidisciplinary symposium in forensic oncology in October. We are very excited about our hematological malignancy data in both non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma which we would be presenting at ASH in December. We clearly have data coming in house for O-17 and O-57 and during the next few months O-69 and as far as the CheckMate 37 and CheckMate 66 in melanoma, we are talking at the moment to our investigators to determine exactly our presentation and publication strategy but we are very excited about the data and we are looking forward to sharing that with the medical community over the next few months.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Okay, Aron can we go to next question please.","Operator","","Yes, sure we will go next to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein ","","Thank you, couple of questions please. Last quarter when you announced the plans for rolling submission with needle online there were lot of questions about additional data FDA might want to see and that sort of thing and it felt like there wasn\u2019t much that you could say at that point but here we are three months later I\u2019m wondering if you have any new information you can share. ","And then a separate question is kind of going back to M&A, in terms of target sizes that Bristol is considering, I\u2019m wondering if you can bracket those for us, some companies have said that they will only be pursuing small bolt on targets I don\u2019t think Bristol has ever really used that language and related to this topic is tax conversion, realistic possibility for something that you may be seeking in any potential acquisitions?","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Good morning Tim. Let me say that risk rate, we have started the rolling submissions we expect to complete it by the year\u2019s end. The base is all the submission is O-63 data but as you appreciate there is substantial data that will share during the second half of the year that would be available to the FDA but beyond saying that we've had regular and productive discussions with the FDA, I won\u2019t comment further on our regulatory timing or our strategy.","So about five M&A to a never made statements about small size being our target and we are not going to make it today, so we continue to use the criteria that Charlie described and looking at different sizes of opportunities. And going back again to the criteria that Charlie described, financial criteria including that criteria is important, but for us technology products are important and therefore tax inversion per se is not an individual target that we are going after.","Charles Bancroft","Yes, I mean, I would just add that while we do understand the rationale for tax inversion strategy including the potential tax rate improvement and increased balance sheet flexibility. There are several things from our perspective that we would consider, and one is our tax rate is already low on a relative basis, two, future legislation is unclear and hard to predict in this area; and three as Lamberto mentioned tax is not the primary driver of our M&A strategy. I mentioned our criteria in my remarks and I would say that only transactions that fit all three we would pursue.","Operator","We'll got next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thanks you. Francis, there is a couple of questions. Your plan to file nivolumab this quarter for previously treated advanced melanoma, is there an opportunity to seek a broader melanoma label and then it seems you have additional from your earlier Phase I trials that could support a broader label. ","And secondly on CheckMate-069 which I think you briefly mentioned that\u2019s the combination Phase II study, my understanding is that, that trial is expected to end this month and that you\u2019ll have access to that data, is there an opportunity to use that data to supplement your Phase III melanoma trial to include the combination? Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Okay, you asked the question to Francis and Francis will answer the question. I just want to ask Francis also to speak about European submission because Jami you\u2019re referring to the U.S. submission, but the news of the morning is that we are filing this quarter also in Europe and the CHMP gave us accelerated review status for our submission. Francis?","Francis Cuss","Thank you, Jami. Good morning. So first of all, let me talk about our submission in previously treated melanoma both in the U.S. and in Europe. In the United States, the basis of our submission is the CheckMate-37 data. And while the 066 data, we believe is very important, as you appreciate, this was a study that was characterized and designed together with the CHMP. It was conducted in Europe and Canada where the comparator was first line therapy.","It is very striking that it shows a survival benefit against the comparator. And of course we will be sharing with the regulatory authorities because we do believe it\u2019s important. ","As far as Europe, the basis of that submission in the third quarter will be the CheckMate-37 and the CheckMate-66. And then you mentioned about CheckMate-069, we don\u2019t have the data. As I said, we\u2019ll be getting the data in-house in the next few months. I think it\u2019s premature for me to speculate what we will do with that data until we have it and we see what it is. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink","Thanks for the question. Actually I have a couple of quick questions. First off can you update us on trends in the HIV market and what\u2019s happening specifically with Reyataz? We're seeing some fairly precipitous declines in Reyataz sales and just wanted to get an update on what your thoughts are on the market there particularly considering that product runs out to 2018? ","And then separately, as we think about the -- I just wanted to clarify a couple of things, CheckMate-057 the non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer study, Francis, I believe you said that 057 could have data in-house towards the end of this year, is that an interim look at 057 and I know that it's event driven, but is that an interim look at 057 or is this actually the final look? And could that be something that actually occurs next year? ","And then my last question is, we just noticed on ClinicalTrials.gov, you did initiate an expanded access or a program with the combination of Yervoy plus Opdivo in melanoma, just wondering how that expanded access program works into your long-term strategy in melanoma, is this designed to really educate more physicians or is it going to be rolling out with the same clinical trial sites. Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio ","","Seamus, this is Giovanni. Let me just take the question on HIV first. Obviously this is a market where we have strong presence, we have over 35% of all the markets through regimens and it is a very competitive market where we've seen the entry of a number of new competitors that are impacting the dynamics and trends there. With respect to Reyataz, we have seen a decrease in our volume and TRxs in the U.S. are down 8% in the quarter versus previous year.","That\u2019s driven really by two factors, its driven by the launch of new STRs and the increased penetration of STRs in early lines and the night setting where the share of Reyataz has traditionally has been quite strong and also it\u2019s been driven by an acceleration of the growth of integration inhibitors. We obviously have a number of programs in place to continue to support our program we just point to the U.S. filing for our FDC of Reyataz and Cobicistat we think that\u2019s a meaningful opportunity. It under review of the FDA and obviously we're very focused on that.","Outside of the U.S. we see some similar trends in Europe but also I would say that year to year comparison for the international business which is down 16% versus prior year are really impacted by timing of significant tenders in our business in Brazil that are impacting both the Q2 to Q1 comparison and substantially the comparison to previous year.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Thank you, Seamus. Let me just say that the O-57 non-squamous study, it is as you say an event driven study the timing of which is around about the end of the Eliqus does depend a lot on the events and as you appreciate as patients go longer and hopefully get more survival benefits, the exact of that depends a bit on what\u2019s happening in the study but it is an interim analysis. ","As far as the EAP for the combination is concerned, as you noted that is now open, its CheckMate-218 and it is the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in untreated melanoma patients and that of course is to try and meet the need of patients following the excitements around the CheckMate four days that was presented at ASCO and the unprecedented prolongation of survival in that exploratory study.","I do want to add however that in addition to the last question about O-69 there is also we have O-67 CheckMate O-67, which is a phase III study in combination, there is a big focus for us in the combination because we think it has the potential to offer unprecedented not just duration but increase the number of patients that might have benefit. That is a phase III study comparing Yervoy, Opdivo and the combination primary end point of [indiscernible] like most of our phase III study has the optionality to look at shorter end points.","So, EAP program is part of just a broader approach to both monotherapy and we think importantly combination therapy. Thank you.","Operator","","Yes, so we'll go next to Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen","","Thank you, I have three questions. First, Bristol typically announces NDA acceptances and not filings. So, assuming that it is ultimately accepted, you anticipate telling us that the NDA for nivolumab in previously treated advanced melanoma has been accepted in Q3, implying the filing is very near term given the 60 days spread between acceptance and filing? So that\u2019s the first question.","Second, sorry if I missed it but is Bristol still on track to initiate the phase III trial of Nivo plus [indiscernible]. ","And then thirdly, when we think about the O-17 trial and the severity of patients enrolled, how should we think about the survival in the docetaxel arm. Recent trials with [indiscernible] people have shown docetaxel delivering overall survival of nine months yet the label says four to eight, any perspective or color would be appreciated. Thank you.","John Elicker","Hey Steve, it\u2019s John. I'll take the first question. We usually do like you know when we are planning our submissions but our formal communication with the press release you are correct is when we issue a press release just when those filings are accepted so the next you'll hear from us on the U.S. filing is when that filing is accepted.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Good morning Steve. So, first of all let me say that the CheckMate 12 study is ongoing and is informing us with in house data about the design for a potential upcoming study in lung in the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy and I will say it\u2019s informative and we are still on track to initiate that study before the end of the year. As far as the O-17 study, I think you have to be careful, we all have to be careful about comparing different patient populations in different studies because it can often be misleading. ","So for instance you brought up the example of the REVEAL study. And I think in the REVEAL study the patient population that is normally contraindicated for angiogenesis therapy was actually not included in that study. That was about, we believe about 25% of the lung cancer population has a lower functional ability and might well explain if that's excluded why Docetaxel actually look better in that study. But I think the general message is we are comfortable with the population we have in the 017 study, we think it\u2019s a good population to represent the potential we believe Opdivo has for prolonging survival and showing overall survival in lung cancer. Thank you.","","Operator","Yes, sure we will go next Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","The first one, you really hadn\u2019t had we tend to get all the attention at (CEBIT) [ph] looks like you will be major player in the U.S. market within a year or so. So I was just wondering if you could in some kind of a general sense talk about your philosophy on using price to compete in the hepatitis C market if that\u2019s possible? ","Second question please if I may is I believe you\u2019ve talked a little bit about publically now about the statistical techniques being used in the squamous second line nivolumab trial that may increase the probability of detecting a signal [indiscernible] that is increasing the probability of success. Perhaps you could explain that to us what that statistical technique is and why it might enhance your ability to detect the late tail. ","And the third one is just very simple. You mentioned non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at ASH this year. Just wondering if you could tell us without -- obviously without any details in there but if you could tell us whether or not you think you\u2019ve seen a convincing signal in NHO or not, that would be interesting. Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","","This is Lamberto. Giovanni will tell you a few things about our plan for FC, but it's one thing for sure that we'll not tell you is about anything about prices, Mark. It is clear that we will not disclose anything about prices until we reach the market and there is a lot of attention we are giving to this subject internally before we reach a final decision.","Giovanni Caforio ","Yes, Mark, just a couple of comments, and this Giovanni. Just a couple of comments on hep C. So as we\u2019ve discussed before we have clearly a global strategy in hep C that\u2019s centered around daclatasvir as an ideal component of multiple regimens, but we also have in that context specific regional strategies and we\u2019ve made progress across the board during the quarter. So obviously Japan is the number one priority for us because of the approval of the dual and the significant unmet medical need in genotype 1b patients in Japan. ","We are conducting as we speak pricing negotiations in Japan and we are confident that we will be ready to launch at the beginning of September and that clearly we see as a very significant opportunity for us. We received CHMP positive opinion for the use of daclatasvir in Europe in combination with multiple other agents and we believe that our opportunities in Europe with daclatasvir because of the existence of segments of the population of high unmet medical need that are particularly well suited to the use of daclatasvir in combination with sofosbuvir and potentially other agents and obviously we're getting ready to launch in Europe. And as you know, we do have an ongoing filing with the FDA for our dual regimen and we are -- we see that as an important event as well.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Good morning, Mark. I think there is elements to the analysis question and both of which have been much informed by our long experience with Yervoy. The first one is the timing of the analysis and the other as you say is the analytical model. Let me take the analytical model first of all. Traditionally, median overall survival is being used to measure the effects on the Kaplan-Meier curve. ","As we've shown with Yervoy, we are beginning to see now is Opdivo much of the benefits if you are looking for (durable) [ph] responses and overall survival is seen in the bottom part of the curve later on in the clinical trial. So we use the proportional hazard ratio to make sure we capture that survival benefit. ","Now the other issue of course is if you don\u2019t wait long enough for patients in the study, you run the risk of missing that benefit, because you\u2019ve analyzed it too soon. So again our experience here is very important both to understand the model and [indiscernible] the right time to do the study and of course that was why we moved back the indication of the timing because we are able to shift our model and understand how to do that. ","As far non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at ASH, let me make a general comment that we are getting increasingly excited about our portfolio in hematological malignancies, certainly in terms of Opdivo, you will be seeing data at ASH for non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. I think you have to make your own judgment about that, but what I will say is we were interested enough, excited enough by that data to start up mid stage studies, which I will say are recruiting very well. But we also have the combination study ongoing with Sprycel in CML. And of course we have our elotuzumab which again in multiple myeloma that gives us a real opportunity. So we're very excited overall about the expansion of our position in hematological malignancies. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking the question. So just on the Nivo, you mentioned interim looks for 017 and 057, just my question is, are there futility analyses incorporated into those interim looks or can they only be stopped if there are clear signs of security for the activations? ","And then second one just one hep C, congrats there again the Japan news you mentioned, just you talked a lot about the near-term opportunity but just longer term, if you can touch on what you see as a longevity of the market. And do you see yourself being a player over the long-term in that space, and if so, do you need to do further investment in terms of maybe acquiring new or some other assets beyond what you\u2019re have in your control right now? Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","So, I do want to start with hep C. We consider virology as one area of focus for us in terms of our presence in HIV, our presence in hepatitis B, and our presence now in hepatitis C. And it is clear that we continue to look at opportunities also in that team that area. And I think I don\u2019t want to repeat again but I will, but we have the [indiscernible] that Charlie mentioned before that if we keep in mind and they apply also to biology. Biology remains an area of focus for us.","Charlie Bancroft"," ","All our large studies have data [indiscernible] committees in them who would obviously look at safety of the product and of course in the case of 066, they were looking to adapt and it turned out to be stop because Opdivo was actually superior. What I would say, and I think it\u2019s a very important point is even though this in ClinicalTrial.gov says it\u2019s an open study, we are keeping blind to this, so we do not see what is going on in the study and I think that\u2019s an important point. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","The first one is, as we think up to the Opdivo launch next year in melanoma and lung, can you just help us think a little bit and frame this comparing and contrasting how you see this launch and its dynamics relative to we start with Yervoy in melanoma back in 2001, I am just trying to understand how you\u2019re seeing those two launches comparing to another? ","The second question was maybe just if you can elaborate on some of your earlier comments regarding increased usage of Yervoy with community oncologist. Can you just update us a little bit in terms of the mix of usage you\u2019re seeing here in terms of community versus the center is, maybe also a breakdown of frontline and second line? ","And then finally just a third quick one, 2015 expenses, is there any factor we should keep in mind as we're thinking about our model here. I guess specifically, should we think about a lot more in the way of SG&A as you prepare for the Opdivo rollout. I'm trying to get my hands around how you're thinking about spending going forward. Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio ","Yes this is Giovanni, let me start on Yervoy and Opdivo launches. So, maybe I'll start from your second question regarding the performance of Yervoy. The community business in the US specifically now represents approximately 60% of our sales, it is continuing to grow significantly and it actually accounts for a meaningful part of the growth we've experienced in the quarters. Lamberto and Charlie mentioned in the introductory remarks, we had a very strong quarter in the US, the strongest quarter seems launch with very good growth versus last year but also versus Q1. ","With respect to the use of Yervoy today, I would say that we have approximately 40% share of the market when you look at the totality of the market, our share is significantly higher in the bit of well tight segment of the market where virtually all of our uses in first line and obviously our share is lower in the bit of mutant segment of the market where we see more Yervoy being used in second line. ","Thinking about the launch of Opdivo next year, in lunch and melanoma, I think there are a number of parallels to the launch of Yervoy because we have developed a really good understanding of how to affectively educate physicians in the community setting and in the academic institutions about the use of immono-oncology agents. We've been very successful in doing that with the Yervoy and clearly have developed the ability to do that when we launch Opdivo as well. There obliviously will be some differences because the prescribing population for lung for example is broader, it\u2019s a larger number of physicians, they tend to be based more in the community versus melanoma and they have not had as much experience with immuno-oncology agents.","So, we obviously will do the same thing we did in 2011 when we launched the Yervoy, we will begin to educate physicians on the value of immunotherapy options to long term survival opportunity and we will follow the same model. ","Within melanoma obviously prescribing physicians are very knowledgeable, they are prescribers of the Yervoy believers in the Yervoy we have a good organization in place that can begin to promote Opdivo when that is approved.","I will just mention that obviously we are making all of the right investment, will increase the size of our teams and we are preparing actively for launch for Opdivo.","Charlie Bancroft"," ","Just quickly on 2015 expenses as you know we don\u2019t give out forward guidance but I would say though that we are committed to making all the right investments as we think about our business moving forward particularly as you think about IO and hepatitis C both on the R&D side and as Giovanni just mentioned on the commercial side. We also always are looking at where can we find savings across our P&L that really aren't directly focused on the areas that we think are going to drive long term growth.","Operator","","We will go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies ","","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one is just around 2015 earnings, see the consensus is looking for EPS around 171 next year, this is a 178 this year in consensus now. Given the repeated comments you'd be making regarding SG&A what you have already cut from behind Abilify, do you think consensus is fully appreciated these given the sell side models that you see? ","And secondly I just wanted to also ask because I haven\u2019t really heard you specially talk about what you think Roche might be moving forward quite rapidly in the triple negative breast cancer segment with immuno-oncology with their PBO-1, is this an indication that you've looked at, and anything could be interesting for ipilimumab. Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","2015 is a bit too early to speak about it and we will issue guidance as usual at the right time, so apologies but we'll not address your question 2015.","Charlie Bancroft"," ","I think in terms of our ongoing studies Jeff, we have a lot of studies early on, triple negative breast but also in GASTRITIS, in terms of surely pancreatic and so on and so forth. So, we acknowledge there is a lot of medical need and a great opportunity to go through with it. So, we are looking at all of these and obviously we'll move stuff forward as we already have in the last few months if feel as a real opportunity there, thank you.","Operator","","We'll go next to Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS ","","Same kind of question a little bit differently, when you think about R&D and investing in R&D over the next couple of years obviously we're going to have the sales line starting to ramp up with IO and FC, so are you going to take advantage of that opportunity and increase R&D more or do you have feel like that mid-single digit growth in the next couple of years is probably appropriate? ","Second question is, can you just help us on the tax rate and how we should think about third quarter versus fourth quarter and the dramatic difference to kind of get to your 18th guidance?","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","I don\u2019t know if Francis asked you to ask this question about if R&D budget for the next two years but for sure we will continue to invest in all opportunities we find. We're investing in we have done it for the last few years we continue to do it so, our idea is not to decide on R&D expenses based on the percentage of sales that we can afford but on the value of our programs. You want to speak about that?","Charlie Bancroft"," ","Yeah, I will just briefly on Marc, regarding the tax rate. Our tax rate is primarily a function of earnings mix but I would say for 2014 a big component is the R&D tax credit which hasn\u2019t been extended yet by Congress. So, that\u2019s why you will see fluctuation so through the first two quarters it doesn\u2019t reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit, will only reflect that once that legislation is passed.","","Operator","","We will take our final question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","","Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick follow ups, have you picked the dose for the Yervoy Nivo combo in the phase 3 non-small lung cancer you mentioned that, you are following CheckMate 12 but I am just wondering if they are closer to finding the right dose there and could you comment or elaborate a little bit more on the hep C opportunity in Japan with some more specifics, it looks like you have the market to yourself for about a year, if I recall some more advanced cohort of patients with greater unmet needs. So, if you give us more color on how we should think about that opportunity in the near term, it may be great. Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti"," ","Alex, thank you very much. Basically as I said the CheckMate 12 is very informative, we are designing the study we are on track and I think you are going to read about the study design and the dose in ClinicalTrials.gov when it\u2019s actually published. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","And with respect to -- this is Giovanni, with respect to the hep C opportunity in Japan, yes we are very focused on it, it is a meaningful opportunity. We are first in the market. The unmet medical need is very high approximately 1.2 million patients in Japan, 70% of them with genotype 1b. A population that is disproportionately elderly and intolerant to interferon in Japan. We are launching the dual starting from a very strong position because of our leadership position in hepatitis in Japan and the very high market share we have with Baraclude. That\u2019s one of the largest markets around the world for us for that brand and we\u2019ve made the right investments in order to have the right organization in place to launch.","We believe that our dual is particularly well suited to address the unmet medical need of patients in Japan. As I said, we are negotiating pricing. Obviously, we will be targeting at the beginning those patients that are already being diagnosed, that are already actively seeking treatment. There is approximately 150,000 patients that are currently seeking physicians and are seeking a treatment option. There is a second segment of the population of approximately the same size which is also diagnosed but not actively being seen by physicians. That\u2019s an opportunity for us as well and obviously in the medium term, the full population represents a significant opportunity for us as well, but we will be rethinking about the different stages of the launching very rapid sequence there.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, Giovanni. Well, again, we had a good second quarter, good in terms of financial performance as well as clinical results and regulatory milestones.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to John Elicker. Please go ahead, sir.","John Elicker","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us to discuss our Q4 results. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer; Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer and Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Commercial Officer. Lamberto, Charlie and Francis will have prepared remarks and Giovanni is here as well to take any questions you might have.","Before I turn it over to Lamberto, let me cover of the legal requirements. During the call, we'll make comments or statements about the Company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company's SEC filings.","These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change.","We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. Well our fourth quarter completing a year, a good year it was very significant with respect to the evolution of Bristol-Myers Squibb into a specialty care Biopharma Company. We transitioned away from Plavix and Avapro. We continue to grow our key brands. We shifted our strategic focus in early R&D, while advancing nivolumab, the SD portfolio and the rest of our late stage pipelines. We announced our geographical balance and we initiated a sale of our diabetes business.","Taking together these developments and changes, not only the set the stage for 2014, importantly they also represent the foundation upon which we continue to build our future as a specialty care leader. I know well that everybody\u2019s attention is understandably on our immuno-oncology assets and programs. And so Charlie, Francis and I will talk about them. And together with Giovanni we will answer your questions.","But I would like first to take a few minutes to speak about the rest, starting with some of our foundational products all of which are growing in importance and growing in terms of global reach.","Sprycel and Orencia both had a spectacular year. Last quarter they grew by 30% and 22% respectively despite very competitive markets. For the full year, Sprycel sales increased 26% and those of Orencia increased 23%. And for Sprycel, we presented important Phase III data in December at the American Society of Hematology.","Also Baraclude added strong performance with 10% growth for the year and 14% during the fourth quarter. As we move into or we\u2019re moved into 2014, we will continue to invest behind these three assets; Sprycel, Orencia and Baraclude.","We also remain firmly committed -- very committed to Eliquis and together with Sprycel, have decided to increase our resources behind it. We\u2019ve been seeing encouraging trends for Eliquis in the U.S and internationally with strong growth in the last quarter and we\u2019re confident in its potential.","And we\u2019re also hoping to expand the label of Eliquis. In Europe DVT and PE prevention has already been approved and we are expecting approval for VTE treatment as well. In the U.S., we\u2019re expecting approval for both indications this year.","And finally to comment -- to complete my comments on key market brand, our immuno-oncology product, Yervoy had a strong year with 36% growth. Based on the strong performance as well as the long-term survival data we presented last year, we increasingly believe in the transformation of potential of immunotherapy and Yervoy as a cornerstone of that approach.","On the regulatory and clinical development front, I\u2019ve already mentioned the development for Eliquis in the hepatitis C area in Japan. We filed late last year our dual regimen containing daclatasvir in our protease inhibitor asunaprevir. I hope we will soon get trade names here. It\u2019s easier to pronounce its generic names, which we give up the opportunity to bring the first oral hepatitis C regimen to market in Japan.","We also recently announced the filing of daclatasvir in U.S and we expect to file in the U.S by mid year. Francis will talk soon about our good achievements and exciting plans in immuno-oncology where we want to achieve and maintain a leadership position.","Taken as a whole, I\u2019m optimistic about our business and the opportunities we have. We will manage the diabetes transition and all the other many changes we\u2019re implementing while executing against a number of operational priorities, namely building on the launch of Eliquis and on the double-digit growth of Yervoy, Orencia, Sprycel and Baraclude.","Continuing the good performance of our other in-line brands such as Reyataz and Sustiva, investing to deliver our late stage immuno-oncology and SD pipeline and launching new products, and continuing to date a disciplined approach to capital allocation.","In so doing, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach that is at the center of Bristol-Myers Squibb success, a balanced approach of delivering today was setting the stage for tomorrow.","So with that, let me turn it over to Francis to talk about immuno-oncology.","Francis Cuss","Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning everyone. Today I will provide an update on immuno-oncology. During the fourth quarter, we presented some early, but encouraging data in lung cancer at the World Conference on lung cancer. Long-term follow-up results from the lung cancer cohort of expanded Phase I dose ranging monotherapy study that\u2019s 003 showed sustain activity in heavily pre-treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer with one and two-year survival rates of 42% and 24% respectively, across dose cohorts.","These early data support our approach and belief that durability of response and long-term survival are important measures for patients and a key in characterizing the benefits of immuno-oncology agents. We expect to present updated data for lung cancer and other tumor types at ASCO this year.","Let me broadly review our strategy in lung cancer. Our approach in lung cancer is to include multiple lines of therapy, different histologies, the use of biomarkers and potentially therapy with monotherapy and combinations, all of which together resulted a very comprehensive development program. We expect to have data in the first part of 2014 from our third line Phase II study in squamous non-small-cell lung cancer for which there is no defined standard of care.","As we\u2019ve said before, if the results of the study demonstrate a favorable benefit risk profile, we plan to discuss the data with the FDA and other health authorities. We expect to have data later in 2014 from two ongoing second line Phase III trials in non-small-cell lung cancer, one in squamous and one in non-squamous.","And finally, as many of you seen, we recently posted on clinicaltrials.gov a first line Phase III trial with Nivolumab monotherapy in lung cancer that will start soon. With regard to the Phase I combination trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab, its worth noting that this is a Phase I trial that\u2019s still ongoing in multiple cohorts of patients and with several dose combinations being evaluated to determine how we could move forward with a combination regimen for lung cancer.","Based on our assessment of the preliminary data that we now have in-house, we will continue to cohort patients with lung cancer treated with ipilimumab and Nivolumab combinations before beginning a registrational study. Our next steps include waiting more mature data from additional cohorts in the study and potentially exploring different doses and regimens and specific patient populations.","In summary, in lung cancer, we continue to progress a very comprehensive program that will generate important data from three potentially registrational trials during 2014. In addition, we continue to explore combinations as well as initiating the first-line Phase III monotherapy study that I mentioned earlier.","Our melanoma program is ongoing with three potentially registrational trials currently underway, one in Yervoy failures and the other two in previously untreated patients as monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy with a focus on demonstrating value through survival benefits.","In renal cell cancer, our Phase III trial is focused on metastatic disease comparing Nivolumab to everolimus in patients who have received prior therapy. Earlier trials are exploring the potential role of biomarkers in this tumor type as well as ipilimumab combinations in first-line renal cell cancer. We have some initial data through Phase I study of Nivolumab and Yervoy. We're encouraged by the results which we plan to present at ASCO, and we believe that we are close to determining a dose and schedule to use in registrational trials.","In addition to Nivolumab programs I've already highlighted, we continue to explore to use an additional solid tumor types and in hematological malignancies. As you may have seen in ClinicalTrials.gov, we're initiating large Phase II trials from glioblastoma and in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","We also have a broad portfolio of exploratory immunotherapeutic agents with varying immune mechanisms of action that allow us to explore multiple combinations, including our anti-LAG3 antibody which entered the clinic in the last quarter.","So in closing, let me reiterate our excitement about the possibilities in immuno-oncology. I believe that we are well positioned with a broad and comprehensive program. I'm looking forward to seeing more data as the year progresses. We'll certainly know a lot more about Nivolumab a year from now. At the same time, we'll continue to invest significantly in the multiple opportunities we see across our broader immuno-oncology portfolio.","Now, let me turn it over to Charlie.","Charles Bancroft","Thank you, Francis. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid fourth quarter which gives us the strong foundation for our future as a specialty care biopharma company. Let me provide a few highlights.","Yervoy sales grew 23% to 260 million. In the U.S., quarterly demand reached its highest level since launch and we are seeing encouraging and weekly trends as well. Despite the multiple clinical trials enrolling melanoma patients, U.S. sales rose 14% from the previous quarter to 148 million.","We are seeing particularly strong growth in the community setting which represents about 60% of Yervoy sales in the U.S., as a growing number of physicians appreciate Yervoy's long-term survival benefit.","In Europe, we are seeing strong uptake particularly in France, Italy and Germany. We expect a November EU approval for the first-line use in advanced melanoma to allow a broader set of patients to benefit from this innovative medicine.","Eliquis sales were 71 million. We continue to make significant progress among cardiologists. Overall, in the U.S. access [ph] is in a much better position as we entered 2014 for both commercial and Medicare Part D plans.","Eliquis also performed well outside the U.S. with international sales reaching 23 million in the quarter. Following several key reimbursement decisions in Q4, Eliquis is now available and reimbursed in every major market in Europe.","Our increased medical education activities and DTC advertising which will continue in 2014 are helping us educate physicians about Eliquis' differentiated profile. We will be making additional investments this year as we prepare for potential expanded indications in VTE prevention and treatment.","Orencia sales grew 22% to 397 million. Orencia continues to perform well in the U.S. and Europe even as the RA market becomes increasingly crowded. Growth in the SubQ formulation has been strong for several quarters and we are also investing appropriately to continue driving the IV business.","Orencia SubQ is now the third most lively prescribed SubQ agent in the U.S. with sales up 51% versus the prior year's quarter. Sales growth to Europe was also strong as we continue to build on the SubQ launch.","Baraclude sales grew 14% to 412 million. Sales were strong across the globe. Despite growing competition, Baraclude remains the standard of care in naive patients in chronic hepatitis D and is particularly important in Asia, due to the epidemiology. Our success with Baraclude demonstrates our ability to leverage our expertise in virology to develop and commercialize innovative medicines at a global level, a capability that is important in establishing our hepatitis C portfolio.","Sprycel sales rose 30% to 365 million. We continue to see sales growth being driven by the same adoption in first-line setting as well as by our leading share in the second-line segment.","In addition to the solid sales performance of our key brands, revenues benefited from several one-time items, including a 38 million adjustment to our managed Medicaid approval, mostly for Plavix as well as a 30 million year-end true-up of our share of (indiscernible).","To wrap up sales, you are all aware that we expect this will be the last time we report a full quarter of sales for the diabetes franchise, due to the expected closing of the diabetes divestiture to AstraZeneca later this quarter. Moving forward we expect that substantially all royalties we receive will be included on the other income and expense line.","Now, let me highlight a few items from the rest of our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 73.6% during the quarter which is down 280 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is mostly due to the change in our contracted share of Abilify revenues in the U.S. and to a lesser extent product mix.","Gross margin also benefited from some of the one-time items that impacted revenues as well. Marketing, selling and admin expenses were about 1.1 billion, down 7%, as our increased investments in Eliquis, the diabetes franchise and pre-launch assets in immuno-oncology and hep C were offset by steeper declines in the pharmacy, our share of expenses for Abilify and lower spending on more mature brands. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.9% during the quarter.","Moving to guidance, we are confirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.80. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance assume that the sale to the diabetes business to AstraZeneca closes during the first quarter.","We are not able to provide line item guidance at this time but expect to be able to do so once the diabetes transaction has closed. This will happen during our Q1 call in April. Qualitatively, as I've indicated previously, while total commercial costs in 2014 are expected to decrease compared to 2013 due to the diabetes transactions, we will be making significant incremental investments behind our key and future growth opportunities, including immuno-oncology, Eliquis and hep C.","Now, we'd be happy to address your questions.","John Elicker","Thanks, Charlie, Francis and Lamberto for the remarks. Shannon, I think we're ready to go to Q&A now. I'd just remind everybody that in addition to Lamberto, Francis and Charlie, Giovanni is here as well. Shannon?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Tony Butler with Barclays.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Thanks very much. I'll leave immuno-oncology to others and ask about elotuzumab, Francis, and would we anticipate that Phase III readout in relapsing patients in multiple myeloma to occur at ASCO? Second question is actually around, and I apologize for the second question [Technical Difficulty] margins, Charlie, and is there anything that you could say about that in the post diabetes world? Thank you.","Francis Cuss","There will be an update to that, I believe, on the Phase II study (indiscernible) on multiple myeloma at ASCO, but we\u2019re expecting data on the Phase III study later of course.","Charles Bancroft","Yes, I think I understood your question Tony regarding gross margin moving forward. Gross margin is always dependent on product mix and you recall that the diabetes business was a relatively low gross margin business because we paid the share of margin through the cost of goods lined to AstraZeneca. So we therefore expect our 2014 gross margin rate to benefit going forward. But again depending upon the timing to close that may impact it, but I would imagine it's going to be in the neighborhood of slightly above 75%.","John Elicker","Thanks Tony for the questions. Can we go to the next question, Shannon?","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thank you very much. In the past you\u2019ve kind of described PDL in expression of maybe not in relevant partly because the combination of Nivo with other agents might make that assay not clinically meaningful, and at the same time in October at World Lung your data showed no real difference based on biomarker expression. Yet here you are now starting CheckMate 026, I am trying to kind of square why you\u2019re initiating this new trial. And then, can you tell you what percent of non-small cell patients are high expressers of PDL-1 using your cutoff criteria. If I look at the Merck and Roche data it suggests maybe it's 25% and then building on to that if PDL-1 expression ends up being a predictive biomarker wouldn\u2019t it be reasonable to assume that this could end up limiting the number of patients that would be deemed eligible for therapy?","Francis Cuss","Thank you Tim. So, let me say that, first of all to say that us starting up the first line study non-small cell lung biomarker rich is very consistent with our overall very broad lung strategy that I just articulated. In addition, I think we\u2019ve always said in terms of a biomarker strategy that we would look very carefully at all patients and we collect tumors from all patients and we do PDL-1 expression on that. And our goal is to better understand the impact of PDL-1 expression not just on the overall response rate, but on overall survival. And while I think that has been this directional data that shows the PDL-1 expression tends to be related to higher response rates. It's certainly by no means clear to all of us, all the time that we just don\u2019t have the data about whether that will hold for all lines of therapy and all in different tumors. But I think in the case of this first line, it's very important for us in this study to enrich the patient population for this particular study. And as you're well aware we have second line studies ongoing where we were also collecting PDL-1 expression data and it's very important for us to try and offer opportunities for patients who aren\u2019t just PDL-1 positive, so of course that will provide the data for that also. I am not going to comment on our particular percentages. Obviously different biomarker, even Histochemistry maybe slightly different between different companies; but again I want to reiterate that our long-term aim in our lung cancer program is to offer if the data supports it, the opportunity for all patients whether PDL-1 positive or negative to have the opportunity of immuno-oncology treatment whether it's smaller therapy or combination. Thank you.","John Elicker","Thanks Tim. Next question please, Shannon.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. So, I have a question on PDL-1 for Francis. I am just hoping to better understand the assessment process you\u2019ll go through with CheckMate 012 and so I guess two specific questions on that. First can you talk about the addition of the lower dose Nivo plus Ipi one milligram plus one milligram cohort last fall, and whether you really need to see those results before you can start Nivo plus Ipi Phase III combo in lung at some point down the line. And then second, what data should we expect as ASCO from CheckMate 012, and also in other cancers beyond lung?","Francis Cuss","So David, let me say that we added the additional 1mg and 1mg cohort back in September to ensure that we would have the full compliment of safety and activity data across multiple doses. And as I said we will be assessing that dose together with the potential other regimens and patient populations before we determine how to proceed into registrational studies with the combination. Regarding the data at ASCO there will be data in CheckMate 012 which on this combination of the different cohorts depending on how it matures, and I\u2019ll just remind you of course that this is an ongoing Phase I trial where we\u2019re going to continue the cohorts to collect data. So we will be updated at ASCO and there will also be data at ASCO on the 003 study, the update on that. There will also an update on 004 which is the combination in melanoma as well as data on the renal cell carcinoma both our Phase II study and the data on the combination that I just talked about. So it will be a considerable amount of information at ASCO across many of our ongoing trials and some you\u2019ll be hearing for the first time.","John Elicker","Thanks Dave. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Francis is there any question in your mind as to whether or not you move combo lung into a Phase III trial or it just you\u2019re still assessing what you have to multiple cohorts in that trial and at some point you\u2019ll make the decision. But I am just curious to know is there a risk that you don\u2019t move forward at all with that. And then secondly on the hematological indications, I noticed you just started two Phase II studies. Can you give us some sense as to your confidence level on that new indication I suppose that\u2019s based on the Phase I trials that you started last year, and when do you think we will see data in hematological indications; will it be some time this year? And maybe if you could comment to on, the market has been very focused on renal lung and melanoma. What other tumor types are you guys most excited about there?","Francis Cuss","I\u2019ll see if I make sure I get to all those. So, just to be clear; I don\u2019t think the data we are indeed assessing the data before we can decide how to proceed into registrational studies. I don\u2019t think the data to date changes our belief of the potential for combination somewhere in a broad lung program. I don\u2019t think it has a data to be sure exactly where that is at the moment, but that\u2019s evolving. As far as the hematological studies, the data that we will presenting data at ASH later in the year on those exploratory hematological studies and I think there\u2019s the \u2026","Lamberto Andreotti","The other tumors.","Francis Cuss","Yes. So beyond those other tumors, as you know we have a lot of exploratory studies at the moment. I think I would say that we are very encouraged by the hematological less the fact that we have studies and larger Phase II studies reflects I think our interest in that area. And of course the unmet need around glioblastoma multiforme again is reflected going forward with the study both looking at, seeing if mono therapy or combination there. Thank you.","John Elicker","Thanks Jami. Can we go to the next question please, Shannon?","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann","Thanks for the questions. So, again I\u2019m not going to continue on immuno-oncology but it is pretty important. As we sort of think about this, the kidney cancer opportunity particularly in combination, the bar in the front line setting seems to be relatively high at least in terms of response rate and even the durational effect. So, given the fact that your communication on the combination in kidney cancer appears to be a little bit better formed than your conclusion in lung cancer, can you just update us and maybe give us a little bit of your thoughts on the kind of benefit that you would hope to see from a frontline kidney cancer combination given the current standard of care?","Francis Cuss","Let me say that you'll have the opportunity to see the data when we share it in ASCO. Clearly, the bar is high for first-line treatment but we are encouraged by the data that we've seen and in due course will be initiating a trial in a potentially registrational trial in renal cell. And obviously we're going to be very thoughtful about which line of therapy that will be applicable to. So I'd suggest you should wait and see what we saw at ASCO, because I think that will be very informative.","John Elicker","Can we go to the next question please, Shannon?","Operator","We'll move next to Mark Schoenebaum at ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hi, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question and thanks for tolerating all of us pounding on immunotherapy. I think I might do the same. I appreciate it. Are you able to tell us in any qualitative sense, Francis, whether or not you saw an enhanced efficacy in one or more of the Yervoy plus NEVO arms in the '012 trial, just any kind of qualitative sense? I interpret your continuing those arms as an optimism \u2013 as a remark reflecting some optimism, but I just wondering if you could just confirm that there was to some degree enhanced efficacy and obviously we'll wait to get the details. And then on the World Lung data \u2013 this will be the last question for me, on the World Lung data, I know it was a while ago now but I'm not sure I've ever got your perspective on this but the one-year 42% survival, but especially the two-year 24% overall survival, what is your view on that 24% number in particular versus what one would expect typically? Thanks a lot. I really\u2026","Lamberto Andreotti","Mark, while Francis gets ready to answer your question a little bit on that, let me tell you that this morning, John and others have asked me to keep quiet during this call and be very understanding, the importance of the immuno-oncology in the number of questions which will be asked today. So, it is important \u2013 we understand the value of immuno-oncology and the value of immuno-oncology to Bristol-Myers Squibb. So we are very open to answer questions, but obviously we cannot always go into the many, many details that you would be interested in knowing but that it is probably premature for us to disclose. And again, we will continue to make available as many comments as possible but we will decide to stay away from commenting on bits and pieces of information. We remain very, very proud of the breadth of our program and the importance of what we are doing here. Now, Francis, back to you.","Francis Cuss","So, I won't comment on the \u2013 anywhere on the (indiscernible) combination in CheckMate '12, but to your point about the World Lung data, I think because of the time and I'll say it again we were encouraged about that survival date, the landmark survival data of two years particularly because it was across all doses. I missed the end of your question but I think what you were asking was how that might relate to other studies we have ongoing and I think it's sad to say that it is very difficult to extrapolate simply because the patient populations are quite different. So let me stop there.","Giovanni Caforio","This is Giovanni. The only thing I would add is clearly lung if you compare it a little bit with melanoma is a much larger population of patient, very diverse population of patients, young medical need is very high and you know all of the data and combination approaches that have sales over the last many years or so, we see that as a very significant opportunity and given the size and complexity of the disease, there is a significant commercial opportunity when looking differentially at different segments in line with not only first-line but also later lines of therapy, different histologies in different patient groups that are all very meaningful commercial opportunities even when you look independently.","John Elicker","Thanks, Mark. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","We'll move next to Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew Baum - Citi","Good morning. A couple of questions. To what extent do you see emergent in the diagnostic enable you to select out a group of patients for whom the combination makes sense both from a safety point of view as well from an efficacy point of view? Second question is perhaps you could give us some timelines on when you think you may be able to initiate a Phase III trial for the combination? And then finally, with regard to the choice of a PDL1 population for your Phase III, to what extent does PDL1 expression increase after subsequent lines of therapy, i.e. you need to enrich in the frontline because treatment by patients may have lower levels of PDL1 expression compared to patients that have got chemo, radiotherapy, is there any evidence for that in lung?","Francis Cuss","So to just go back to your first question is about the \u2013 how we selected the combination based on the diagnostic, I think as I mentioned we are collecting information in both PDL1 positive and PDL1 negative patients, and of course that's part of the assessment at least in these preliminary studies to try and understand where the safety and efficacy goes as far as that's concerned. I'm not going to talk about the timelines of the potential progression in the combination of the lung simply because, as I said, the trial is still ongoing. We're still assessing the data and of course it will depend on that data as to what we do next. I think it's a good question about what does line of therapy do to the PDL1 expression and certainly we are collecting that data to try and understand that better. I don't think we have that information laid out at the moment, but I do think it will be important to see. And of course we do have the opportunity because we are looking very broadly, first of all, across lung but actually against many other tumors as well to try and begin to understand some of the kinetics of PDL1 expression focused with other non-IO therapies and with IO therapies.","Andrew Baum - Citi","Thank you.","John Elicker","Thanks, Andrew. Can we go to the next question please, Shannon?","Operator","We'll go next to Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS","Good morning. First on Eliquis in the U.S. and obviously a big jump from last quarter to this quarter, I was just curious is that all demand or was there anything else going on in the quarter? Second, on Sprycel, obviously very strong growth there. Can you give us a sense of what's going on behind the scenes with market share? Is that where the growth is coming from or what would you contribute it to? And then on hep C in Japan, you had mentioned \u2013 obviously we know that you filed already. What is your expectation for when that will be approved in Japan and start to have sales? Do you assume sales in your guidance for this year?","Lamberto Andreotti","Giovanni, why don't you take all three questions?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, let me start from the performance of Eliquis. We had a strong quarter in Q4 that was clearly through in the U.S. We had good developments outside of U.S. as well. With respect to the U.S. what you saw in terms of the numbers broadly reflects an improvement in performance and demand. And when you look at TRx, growth in the U.S. in Q4, our TRx volume grew by 66%. Our NBRx volume grew by 50% versus the previous quarter and we saw a good increase in shares, particularly in the cardiology setting. So I would say that the performance is really related to demand and it is the result of the acceleration plan that we put in place beginning in August which we discussed before, which was really centered on strengthening and focusing our strategy and messages, significantly increasing our investment in medical education and third, initiating in September a very broad DTC campaign in the U.S. All of those things seem to have had an impact on performance in Q4 was a good quarter. With respect to Sprycel, we do have very strong performance and good trends across the world, in the U.S., in Europe. We had a very, very good quarter in Japan as well. And that is coming from two things. First of all, from a total market perspective, we continue to see a decline in the use of Gleevec and the growth of the second generation TKIs. Among second generation TKIs particularly in the U.S., in the last quarter Sprycel was the fastest growing agent and we continue to have a leadership position in first line and second line across among the second generation TKIs. We have a strong presence in second line, but a lot of our growth is really coming from increased penetration and increased market share in first line. With respect to Japan and hepatitis C we communicated where we are with a -- from a regulatory perspective. All I can say from a commercial perspective is that we are working as a priority to be ready for launch when we get approval, obviously we will be executing very rapidly the launch in Japan.","John Elicker","Thanks, Marc. Can we go to the next question please Shannon?","Operator","And our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan","Right. Thanks very much. Just two ones coming back on Nivo. First, on the one combo should we think about additional cohorts being added to CheckMate 12 based on this data that you\u2019ve recently received or at this point are we just really waiting for data from the existing cohorts before making a decision on potentially moving that forward. And second question was on Nivo with Avastin, is that something you -- that you have seen at this point and how you\u2019re thinking about the potential of the use of Avastin with Nivo in lung? Thanks very much.","Charles Bancroft","So as far as the lung combo cohorts, it is possible we may add more cohorts Chris, but that\u2019s under consideration. And I think I will say just a general comment about combination -- while obviously we focus very much on immuno-oncology combinations, we haven't certainly ruled out having combinations where we feel it's appropriate and there could be some benefits.","John Elicker","Thanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question please, Shannon?","Operator","We will go next to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just to clarify one thing for me. In terms of the CheckMate 063 data, is that something you have? And I'll say this point and I know \u2013 I think you mentioned before because it maybe registrational and we get a top line press release on that? Would you do a top line whether you do or do not decide to file that, just trying to get a sense of expectations on that? Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","So just to clarify, you\u2019re talking about the third line Phase II study in non-small-cell lung squamous, right?","Francis Cuss","Yes, I think that\u2019s yes.","Lamberto Andreotti","Oh sorry, okay. So as I\u2019ve said, but let me reiterate, it\u2019s important, we\u2019re in regular contact with the FDA. We are expecting the data in the first half of this year, depending on the data and we will obviously be having further discussions with the FDA. But the hope would be for a submission assuming the data is appropriate.","Francis Cuss","And I think from a disclosure standpoint Vamil, we have to wait and see what the data looks like, there is a materiality discussion certainly with our General Counsel and legal group, there is a need to preserve the ability to present at ASCO. So there is coordination with ASCO and then there are competitive dynamics as well. So I think it\u2019s premature to commit to any kind of disclosure one way or the other.","John Elicker","Can we go to the next question please, Shannon?","Operator","We will go next to Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregg Gilbert - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thanks. I have two. First for Lamberto, clearly immuno-oncology is exciting for your Company, but I think it's also fair to say your market cap assumes pretty significant success in future years already. So my question is, do you see as CEO an opportunity to use your significant market cap to diversify into other exciting areas, if the right opportunities come along? And my follow-up for Charlie is about your mature and other products line, obviously a pretty big chunk of business. Any key variables we should think about within that over the next year or so? Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","Well, you see we have been saying that business development is top priority for capital allocation. Soon we will receive if at the closing with the deal with AstraZeneca we received significant amount of money here in the U.S. from AstraZeneca, well there is an upfront payment plus the milestone related to the approval of our figure in the U.S. So, we would have additional cash available for business development as you correctly said. We have shares that are valued say nicely, and therefore we could use those shares also for BD. We will continue to -- we continue, its not something about the future, we continue today at looking at various opportunities and various opportunities are in both, immuno-oncology and outside of immuno-oncology. So, when you think about our priorities, the priorities in business development are in the same areas where we are developing our own programs. What I guess, I\u2019m very close to both areas. Charlie, on the mature brands.","Charles Bancroft","Yes, so Gregg on mature brands it is a catch-off for all of our non sort of core promoted brand\u2019s and we have the normal older sort of off patent as well as some OTC brands particularly in Europe and the markets there is France. But we also have some growth products relating in that form in China, for example. We record SYMLIN sales there which will go away with the diabetes business. And we also recorded things like our Medarex royalties that we get from that acquisition. And then also we have a couple of collaborations with rackets for some OTC brands in Latin America and medicines' company which was our (indiscernible) business. They have their own lifecycle and some go as those deals come to a close. That will have a more significant impact on the mature brands. But generally this is a declining business.","John Elicker","Thanks Gregg. Can we go to the next question please, Shannon?","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning and congratulations on a great 2013. Francis on CheckMate 026 many experts think that PDL-1 expression is dynamic. So the question is; have there been any advances in being able to reliably identify PDL-1 positive patients. And a follow-up if I may; can you please give us more clarity on the timeline for the LAC-3 data, we know you sort of mentioned it into the clinic last quarter, perhaps more clarity on the timeline for the other immunotherapies to answer this question? Thank you?","Francis Cuss","Thank you Alex. So talking about the first line lung, I think the goal of making a PDL-1 positive is to enrich the population. And of course obviously if that changes subsequently that will be taken into account in terms of what the data is at the end. But I think we have the opportunity here to as I said I\u2019ll go back, there\u2019s a very broad strategy around biomarkers here. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about biomarkers, we\u2019re learning all the time. I think we have a great opportunity over the next year or two as our data matures, have a much better idea of the kinetics of the PDL-1 expression and how it might relate to overall survival not just response rate. And I want to reiterate, again I think it's important that our aim is to be able to provide if we have the data supported a treatment for patients who are PDL-1 negative also whether in lung, non-lung or any other tumors. So it's a very broad program, we\u2019re generating the data and I think it's rather early yet to speculate too much about what might happen. We want to get the data. Now as far as our other IO combinations, many trials are ongoing. As I mentioned LAC-3 into the clinic last quarter I think that\u2019s very early to make any predictions yet, but obviously it's very exciting. And perhaps more importantly we have combinations of Nivo with L-21 and or anti-care monoclonal antibody. And so I think we will be seeing data over the next year or two on those, but it's too early to give you an exact timing.","John Elicker","Okay, thanks. Shannon, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","We'll go next Steve Scala with Cowen & Company.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Company","Thank you. And I have two questions. So, Francis, in your prepared comments, you referred to Yervoy as the cornerstone of your immuno-oncology franchise. And I am focusing now on the word cornerstone. I think most immuno-oncologists view PD1 as necessary and fundamental to modulate, and therefore the cornerstone. So it seems to me that Bristol is not absolutely convinced that PD1 is a key component and a cornerstone. I mean, am I correctly characterizing the Bristol view? And the second question is on the settlement with Apotex for Sprycel, can you be more specific on when generics can launch? Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","So, Steve, this is Lamberto. My Italian accent should have been recognized by using the expression cornerstone for Yervoy, and it was probably not appropriate to say the cornerstone. I don't know if I said that, but to deem [ph] a cornerstone now. To answer your question more directly, PD1 is a cornerstone for immuno-therapy and we are very committed to it and we are very convinced that we can deliver wholesome data with PD1 in the various tumors that we are starting. Do you want to add anything?","Giovanni Caforio","I would just add that I fully agree with Lamberto's characterization of the promise of PD1, so you shouldn't misunderstand how excited we are. But on the other hand, Yervoy is approved and I think the \u2013 I've been in this business long enough to know that a bird in the hand is always worth a lot and so it's very good to have in the hand and it gives us a lot of opportunity to build on that, I think, in terms of the broader IO benefit to patients.","John Elicker","And Steve on the Sprycel, I think we have at least 10 more years of market exclusivity related to that case for Sprycel in the U.S.","So with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Lamberto. Thanks everybody for all your questions and I'm really glad that Francis was able to join us this morning.","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes. Francis will leave now in a couple of hours. All right, and let me close this call by saying that again 2013 was an important year for us because we are evolving into a new leading specialty care biopharma company. I think that the solid performance last year and the development and changes that we have delivered put us in a strong position. We have talked a lot about immuno-oncology this morning. We are very excited about what we have in immuno-oncology. And as I said before, we intend to maintain our leadership position in the area. But we also want to continue to evolve the other important assets that we have in cardiovascular, in hepatitis C, in virology in general and the other areas where we are operating. So, thank you for being with us this morning and have a good day.","John Elicker","Thank you, Shannon.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Before we get to the call, let me take care of the Safe Harbor language.","During the call we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date.

And then joining for Q&A is Francis Cuss, the head of R&D, and Murdo Gordon, our Head of Worldwide Markets. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong. And we had some important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio.","We have entered the period of growth I've discussed before. We had $4.4 billion in sales, 9% growth over the previous year, which is especially strong, given the loss of exclusivity for Abilify in April last year. And the fact that we no longer book sales for Erbitux due to changes in our agreement with Lilly.","Let me share just a few of our highlights. And Charlie will then provide more details about our key brands.","Starting with Eliquis. Global sales for the quarter were $734 million, more than doubling sales from a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter growth was more than 20%. And we continued to make progress towards market leadership in key markets globally.","In the U.S., Eliquis is now the number one novel anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions for both AFib and VTE across all physicians. Beyond the U.S., Eliquis is the number one NOAC in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists in 12 markets around the world. Based on this performance we are well on our way to becoming the number one NOAC globally.","Our hepatitis C portfolio delivered strong performance as well with $427 million in revenues in the first quarter. I'm very pleased with our strong performance, particularly in the U.S. This is however, a very competitive and highly dynamic market. And we do expect competitions to have a significant impact on our business in the U.S. for the rest of the year, as we've already seen in Japan.","Orencia and Sprycel also had good quarters. Orencia had revenues of $475 million, up 19% from a year ago. Sprycel posted sales of $407 million, up 9% from last year.","Regarding immuno-oncology, we've had a very strong start of the year, building on our leadership position. Commercially, the launch of Opdivo continues to accelerate, based on continued approvals and new indications around the world. First quarter sales were $704 million.","The recent adoption of Opdivo remains strong in markets where we have launched with PD-1 dollar shares of more than 80% in the U.S. and comparable shares in other key markets, including Germany, France, and Japan.","In lung cancer Opdivo remains the clear leader across histologies. Our key competitive advantages remain, our overall survival data, and the fact that physicians can treat patients with Opdivo, regardless of PD-L1 expression.","In melanoma we have the broadest portfolio of treatment options in both the adjuvant and the metastatic setting, including the first immuno-oncology combination with Opdivo and Yervoy. Opdivo based treatments are the leading treatments in new patients in first-line melanoma in the U.S., driven by strong adoption of the combination regimen. The adoption of our combination therapy has been strong in both academic and community settings.","And in renal cancer overall survival and durability of response with Opdivo are recognized by prescribers. And Opdivo is the leading treatment for newly diagnosed second-line patients.","With respect to R&D we are already off to a good start in 2016. Earlier this month the European commission approved expanded use of Opdivo in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer and in advanced renal cell carcinoma. And we received a positive CHMP opinion for our Opdivo plus Yervoy combination for the treatment of melanoma.","In addition, we have received breakthrough designation for our Opdivo filing in the U.S. for the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Our filing has been granted priority review by the FDA, and the EMA has validation our application. Overall, Opdivo has the potential to become the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in a hematological malignancy in the U.S., in Europe, and in Japan.","Earlier this month at AACR we presented data from our CheckMate -141 study in patients with head and neck cancer. The study, which was stopped earlier this year, is the fifth tumor type with overall survival data for Opdivo, compared to a standard of care. And earlier this week we received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA in head and neck cancer.","We also presented for the first time two-year overall survival data from our Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen, CheckMate -069, in patients with advanced melanoma. We continue to believe that the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen provides the best opportunity for patients to benefit from the long-term survival opportunity that immunotherapy offers.","Looking ahead, ASCO will again be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting longer-term follow-up from some studies that have previously been presented, including the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in non-small cell lung cancer from CheckMate -012. In addition, we will be presenting data in new tumor types for Opdivo monotherapy. And we are looking forward to presenting new data from studies of our Opdivo plus Yervoy combination, including data in new tumors not previously presented. And lastly, you'll see the data from registrational studies, including Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck.","All in all, I am very proud of our accomplishments within immuno-oncology, including our ability to establish Opdivo as the leading immuno-oncology agent, one that is foundational and a standard of care within its approved indications.","Going forward, we remain fully committed to further strengthening our position. I'm confident we are making all of the right investments. From both a commercial and an R&D perspective, continue to execute our strategy in immuno-oncology and further strengthen our leadership position.","Before turning the floor over to Charlie, let me say that I am very confident and optimistic about our future here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our increased sales and EPS guidance reflects the strength of our overall business. We have significant growth opportunities in I-O, where we have advanced our leadership position with Opdivo. Eliquis is well on its way to becoming the number one novel anticoagulant. The performance of our underlying portfolio remains very strong. And we are advancing a diverse, innovative, and promising pipeline by combining our internal R&D efforts with a continued focus on business development, seeking to develop transformative medicines for patients in need.","And with that I'll turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. As Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong performance across our key products. Overall, FX had a negative 2% impact on sales and about $0.03 on EPS. Giovanni covered the sales performance highlights from some of our key growth drivers. I will just add some additional color.","Eliquis continues to do very well. Sales in the U.S. were $468 million, which includes a one-time positive adjustment related to the Medicare coverage gap of $25 million. We continue to see strong performance for Opdivo across the three tumors. Opdivo continues to be the most prescribed drug for new patients in lung cancer. Renal has also seen strong early adoption. And in melanoma the strong performance of the Opdivo\/Yervoy regimen is contributing to the growth for both Opdivo and Yervoy.","Opdivo has now been approved in 50 countries. International sales in Q1 were $110 million. Until recently the EU approval was in squamous lung cancer and melanoma only. Pricing and reimbursement for melanoma and squamous lung cancer has been secured in most of the major markets and uptake remains strong, notably in Germany and France, where we are operating through an early access program.","Additional indications for renal and non-squamous lung cancer have now been approved in the EU. The CHMP has also granted a positive opinion for the Opdivo\/Yervoy regimen in melanoma.","Yervoy sales in the U.S. grew 10% over last year, based on the strength of the regimen, which as Giovanni mentioned has seen strong adoption in first-line melanoma. Internationally, sales were down over 50% as Yervoy monotherapy remains under pressure from Opdivo and Keytruda. We expect that to continue until the launch of the regimen, which should take place over the next year or so.","Our hep C business was strong in the U.S. and Europe, where Daklinza is holding up well, primarily in the genotype 3 patient population. We do, however, expect competition to significantly impact the business in the second half of the year. In Japan, where we are competing in a genotype 1 population, new competitive launches have led to significant drop-off of our business there.","The launch of Empliciti in the U.S. is going very well, with sales in the quarter of $28 million. We are seeing good usage in key accounts in the U.S. In Europe, we have a CHMP-positive opinion and hope to gain approval later this quarter. We do think reimbursement will be a bit more challenging there, given that multiple myeloma is a longer-term treatment and combining novel therapies could be challenging for payers.","We continue to see competitive pressures on our HIV business, with sales of Reyataz and Sustiva down from prior year. Recent competitive launches are expected to further impact the Sustiva business in particular.","Gross margin was 76% during the quarter, down 370 basis points compared to the same period last year. You will recall that we had a favorable FX impact on international inventories sold last year. In addition, our gross margin was impacted by product mix, driven by Eliquis and the loss of Abilify, where we had full quarter of sales in the first quarter of last year.","MS&A, which now includes A&P, was up about 4% due to investments in Opdivo, Eliquis, and Empliciti, offset by lower spend on older products, including Erbitux, which is now fully supported by Lilly. Additionally, there was a $36 million favorable adjustment related to our prior year pharmacy based on the actual invoice received.","R&D expenses were up 17%. The increase in spending was due to higher clinical costs, including study supplies, new business development and research alliances, and I-O trials. We also had higher medical investments, including data generating studies and field support.","Other income and expense is up approximately $160 million versus prior year. Diabetes royalties are higher due to increased sales and the transfer of future Amylin related royalty rights, which will lead to increased royalties over the next few years. Recall that due to the tiered structure of the agreement with AstraZeneca, the diabetes royalties are somewhat front loaded and will decline throughout the year. In the quarter, total royalties for Erbitux were approximately $60 million and were recorded in other income.","Moving to guidance. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.20. Our new range assumes current foreign exchange rates. With the dollar weakening against the yen and euro, we now expect the negative impact of FX on EPS to be between $0.06 and $0.08. This is approximately a $0.04 improvement since original guidance, of which $0.01 has already been realized in Q1.","We raised revenue guidance due to the strong trends across the business, primarily Opdivo and Eliquis. The negative FX impact on revenues is now expected to be approximately 1%. We are increasing our guidance on MS&A, mostly due to higher commercial spending on I-O, including additional DTC spend.","The increased investments in R&D are primarily for clinical study supplies, new BD [business development] alliances, and the development of additional biomarkers and diagnostics in oncology.","Overall, a strong start to the year, which provides us with great confidence in how we see the full year. Now we'd be happy to address your questions.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thank, Giovanni and Charlie. And, Tiffany, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A. Just to remind everybody that in addition to Giovanni and Charlie, both Francis and Murdo are here to handle any questions you might have. Tiffany?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...much. And then congrats on the strong results here. First question is can you talk about the commercial ramp of Opdivo in Europe in lung cancer now that you have the broader label? Are you expecting similar dynamics for the U.S. in terms of rapid uptake? Or do you see any hurdles being put in place that could limit use in for example PD-L1 positive patients?","The second question was just on the timelines for Opdivo in first-line monotherapy in lung. And you've been talking about a readout late this year, I think it's about 18 months from the time your study completed enrollment. I'm just trying to get a little color as to what's taking so long in terms of getting the data here? In that it seemed like much of your control arm would have progressed well ahead of that target? Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Chris, thanks. This is Giovanni. Murdo will address your question on international Opdivo sales. Let me say that we are very pleased with how reimbursement negotiations and activities are going internationally. That really reflects the value of Opdivo and the data. And then Francis will cover your question regarding timing for first line.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yeah, thanks, Chris. Overall we're feeling very good about what's happening in Europe. Our performance in Germany and France has been very good. France is hard to see, because we're currently not recognizing those sales until future price negotiations. But we are doing very well across the indications that we have. If you will recall we have our indication in metastatic melanoma, squamous lung at the beginning of our uptake curve, and then recently additional approvals coming in that are yet really showing in our demand curves.","We've also seen, as Giovanni mentioned, very good response to the value of Opdivo in terms of our reimbursement negotiations. Many of those negotiations and discussions with the various governments in Europe have gone quicker. So we now enjoy good access in Germany, France, as well as recently Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. We're continuing to work with \u2013 and these are relatively \u2013 these are all broad indications. No restrictions on PD-L1 status. And we're working on additional things for the new indications in non-squamous when we have those discussions.","The other thing I will say is that we are still working through the HTA markets, so Canada, U.K., Australia. And as anticipated those will take a little bit longer. I will turn it over to Francis.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Chris. Given the success we've had with our clinical trials, we're actually very confident in our ability to determine the appropriate time to perform the analysis of I-O studies. You'll appreciate this a result of having developed the broadest I-O dataset in lung cancer and having considerable experience now with applying non-proportional analyses to PFS and OS curves.","Now regarding CheckMate -026, we said that both the events and the timing of the follow-up were important considerations for the timing of the analysis. And I want to say that based on what we now know about the progress of the trial and the current event rate, we believe we could have the results from CheckMate -026 in the third quarter, which as you appreciate is earlier than we had previously estimated.","Now I just want to emphasize, there are always risks inherent in clinical trials. But this change in timing of having the data does not increase it for the CheckMate -026 study. Thanks.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks for the question, Chris. Tiffany, next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Your line is open.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Hello. Thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick questions on the increase in R&D spending. Can you just help us understand the quality of the increase? And what drove the increased guidance for R&D spending? Just it's noteworthy that you recently started the phase 2 FRACTION lung study, which includes your LAG-3 antibody, as well as Sprycel. So just interested to better understand the R&D spend increase. And if that's driven by the promise of I-O combinations?","And then the separate question on FRACTION lung specifically. Is it possible that this study \u2013 given the fact that it incorporates and includes immunotherapy refractory patients, is it possible that it could be utilized as an \u2013 for an accelerated path to approval, should it show impressive results? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Seamus, thank you. Francis will address your questions on R&D broadly.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Right. So let me just say, Seamus, that \u2013 let me give you a little bit of background on FRACTION. This is an innovative Phase I\/Phase II design for early combination trials. And as you appreciate we have a number of potential combinations at the moment.","And this allows us to look at promising signals of activity, to actually also test hypotheses about the underlying biology of combinations, and you know we're \u2013 as well as checkpoints, we have a number of non-affecter (22:01) mechanisms as well. And of course to generate data to inform future combinations.","So therefore, the FRACTION trial should allow us to efficiently identify the activity of promising novel combinations and quickly move them into potentially registrational trials.","Now as we've said, data from our early assets have started to come into house this year. And we're moving forward with the anti-LAG-3 antibody refraction study, as we think there is an opportunity to improve upon Opdivo monotherapy or the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, particularly as you say in those patients who don't respond initially or who relapse.","I think the important thing to say and to put this in the context, the broader context, is that we are very confident in our broad strategy in first-line lung. And we want it to address a very broad population.","Now we clearly have emphasis on first line. We already have second line. But we do believe that the Opdivo\/Yervoy regimens could further improve overall survival. And I want to note that we're really looking forward to presenting additional data from [CheckMate] -012 at ASCO.","So overall, we want to ensure that as many lung cancer patients as possible can benefit. And whether that's with monotherapy, combination Opdivo\/Yervoy, exploring other combinations, which FRACTION will allow us to do more quickly and efficiently, and whether that's targeted therapies or indeed chemotherapy. So very broad program. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And let me just \u2013 Seamus, just a couple of points on the R&D line. So in the quarter we were up 17%. But there are timing issues that relate to any quarter year to year.","For the full year, as I mentioned in my comments, we are raising guidance slightly. We were at high single digits for R&D, and now we're in low double digit. Part of it's some of the things that Francis had mentioned and what I mentioned in my comments regarding clinical study supplies, some of the new BD things that happened since year end, and additional biomarker diagnostic work in oncology. They're the main elements.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Seamus. Tiffany, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a couple questions for you, Francis. The first one is more related to the near term. Obviously investors are very focused on the upcoming front-line lung studies from both Merck and you guys. Can you compare and contrast the two first-line monotherapy trials of Opdivo versus Keytruda? Since that's obviously what we're focused on?","And I think that investors seem to have more confidence in the Merck trial, because they are looking at the highest expressors of PD-L1 expression compared to your trial. So I think there's more confidence that they're going to hit on PFS versus Bristol-Myers. Plus, there's also worry out there about PFS being a challenging end point, just given that chemotherapy works pretty well in front line lung. So if you can address that first.","And then secondly, a more, bigger picture strategy question for the long term. Obviously monotherapy Opdivo is doing extremely well. But as you know doctors prefer combination therapy in treating cancer patients. And they also want to move away from chemotherapy. So can you set the stage for Opdivo combination strategies? And the outlook over the next couple years? Given that a number of companies have chosen the different path, which is chemo combo. Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jami, this is Giovanni. Let me just start with your second question and give you my perspective on strategy in first-line lung cancer. Francis will add to my comments and then answer specifically your questions about study design.","I feel very strongly, and I am very optimistic about our strategy in first line. Because we obviously have a lot of experience in lung cancer through our second-line registrational strategy, which has given us not only a very broad approval, but also very clear insight into physicians' prescribing behaviors, the adoption of Opdivo, the speed at which chemotherapy has been abandoned. And while there obviously are differences between first line and second line, we really think we have developed a deep knowledge of this market, specifically as it relates to immunotherapy.","So when you think about our strategy, our approach is broad and informed by science. We have, I am convinced, the right approach of investigating monotherapy, both in a broader population of PD-L1 positive patients and in a subset of patients that express PD-1 at a higher level. We have advanced a really exciting combination strategy through Study -012 and obviously the Phase III study on going. And we are also investigating the right combination of chemotherapy in the right patient subgroups.","And so when you look at the totality of our first-line lung strategy, we believe it is the broadest approach. It is informed by data and science and a really strong understanding of market dynamics.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Giovanni. Good morning, Jami. So let me emphasize. We've really taken great care in the design of Study -026, in its choice of its end point, the optimal timing of the analysis, which I just mentioned, the role of non-proportional, the hazard ratio, the role of PD-L1 expression, the sample size.","And we've used the results of many of our published and unpublished data to look at this. And essentially we remain very confident. We think we've got the optimal balance of speeds and design. And to deliver results, not just in a narrow population, but in the widest population of first-line lung patients, as we've done with other studies of Opdivo recently.","Just to be very specific, in the trial design we're looking at both strongly expressing patients and patients with any level of expression. We have not actually disclosed the actual level of what strongly expressing PD-1 is, but it's lower than 50%.","It's not clear to us that you need to have very high levels of PD-L1 expression to benefit from treatment. And if you'll recall the OS curves from -057, the shapes of the Kaplan-Meier curves were similar across the 1%, 5%, and 10% cutoffs.","So overall, everything we know has gone into this study. We're very happy with the way it's progressing. As I said without additional risk to the analysis, we were able to bring forward the analysis this summer. And we look forward to seeing that data then. Thanks.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Jami. Tiffany, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. So on the CheckMate -568 study, to what extent do you see this data set, along with what we'll have from CheckMate -012, facilitating addition to the treatment guidelines ahead of formal regulatory approval?","And then in terms of CheckMate -012 and the data at ASCO, can you give us some sense of the incremental duration of data we'll see, versus what was presented at World Lung?","And then just finally, Eliquis, clearly a great quarter. Where do you primarily see growth from going forward? And how do you see the approval of an antidote to impact the growth of this class, given there's one currently under review? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Murdo, why don't you start with Eliquis? And Francis will cover -","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Sure. Thanks, Colin, for the question. Yeah. We're really pleased with the Eliquis performance across all of our worldwide markets, inclusive obviously of the U.S. More than doubling our volume from first quarter last year. So really, really strong.","We're seeing this growth really across all markets, in cardiology, in hospitals, and in the community setting. So we have very strong new-to-brand prescription shares evolving. We're now the number one NOAC in the U.S. in atrial fibrillation and VTE treatment. So we're very, very pleased in new-to-brand Rx there. That's a 47% share. And we're now within 10 points of our closest competitor, Xarelto, in TRx share in the U.S.","So we've got nice leading indicators. We think we will continue to evolve that market share in cardiology and in primary care across all of our major markets in VTE and in AF. So really that's going to be a continued trend that we're driving. We see very good leading indicators, as I've mentioned before. We see cardiology as that leading indicator. And we see our hospital business there. So we're feeling quite good about it.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Colin. So I think it's interesting, in first-line lung most companies are taking a fairly similar approach to monotherapy, as we've heard by looking in the RITs population. But on the other hand the strategies with combination regimens like the Opdivo\/Yervoy one that's we'll see in [CheckMate] -012, approaches there are quite different. Some are focused as you know on combinations with chemo. Others are looking at combinations for low or PD-L1 non-expressors.","We actually believe our strategy is quite differentiated. And we believe that \u2013 and I want to reemphasize this \u2013 that I-O combinations, specifically Opdivo\/Yervoy, is the best way to improve upon survival expectations for the patients over the long terms.","Now we're very encouraged by the safety and efficacy of dosing of the regimen in non-small cell lung, based on the data we presented last year at the World Lung Conference. And we're really looking forward to presenting an update of the CheckMate -012 at ASCO in June. So that will be a more mature dataset. And of course it's under embargo, so I can't say anything more about it now.","But we are looking forward, with that and everything else in June, to really an exciting ASCO for us. Because as well as the updates on existing tumors, we're going to be looking at new tumor \u2013 effects in new tumors and data from registration studies in Hodgkin's and head and neck.","So let me just finish by talking about the CheckMate -568 study. And I want to really emphasize that we have full confidence in the CheckMate -227, which is the definitive randomized registration study for first-line lung in non-small cell lung. So \u2013 but we do, however, believe that the experience we gain from single-arm studies of combinations like -568 can help inform us about future medical practice as part of the expansive data generation strategy that you've heard from Giovanni and myself. Thank you.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Colin, just one other point. You asked me about the Portola as a catalyst for Eliquis. Fortunately, Eliquis has one of the lowest bleeding rates in the NOAC class. However, we do feel that the advent of the antidote should increase the comfort level for some physicians who continue to prescribe Warfarin, albeit a modest one.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Colin. Tiffany, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A few questions. So just going \u2013 just sticking on CheckMate -568. You have [CheckMate] -227 running. That's an OS trial. It's a larger trial. Suddenly you start -568, which is a Phase II study, looking at the same doses in front-line lung. I still kind of am struggling to figure out why you started that trial. My guess was maybe it's a way to get early registration ahead of having -227 results, which may not come out until 2018. So really what's the purpose of -568?","And then on [CheckMate] -026 can you confirm that you have really the same exact efficacy endpoints and statistical analysis plan for that trial as you did maybe six months ago? I know the timeline has moved around a little bit. And now you're saying in third quarter.","And then last question on the fractional lung trial, 685 patients. Is that going to be amortized across the three current arms? Or does that anticipate other combo arms coming in? And some of that 685 patients going to arms that have yet to be revealed?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tim, let me start by [CheckMate] -568. And as we've said before, we have a very broad strategy in first-line lung. And obviously because of the strength of the profile of Opdivo and the importance of first-line lung, every study gets, rightfully, a lot of visibility. There are registrational trials, practice informing trials. And -568 is really a practice informing trial as we've designed it.","The Phase III study [CheckMate] -227 is really the critical registrational strategy there. That's really the way to look at it. Obviously as we've demonstrated before, we are executing our strategies very rapidly, with speed. There are degrees of flexibility and optionality built into every one of our trials. But that's really the reason why we did -568 is to inform medical practice. Francis will address your question on FRACTION and [CheckMate] -026.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Tim. So let me say again, and I want to reiterate, we have not changed our analysis at all. The PFS analysis will be on the hazard ratio of the PFS curves in the strongly expressing population, as we've said before. And of course this takes into account the totality of the Kaplan-Meier curve. If the primary endpoint of PFS is strongly \u2013 is met in the strongly expressing patients, we'll also look at all the randomized populations, which includes all those that express at the greater than 1% level. That hasn't changed either.","And overall survival is a secondary endpoint and will also be analyzed, as this is obviously clinically important. But I think it's worth reminding everyone that OS could be confounded by the crossover, which is allowed within this particular trial.","So let me just say nothing has changed in terms of the analysis. What we're able to do as we've watched the drug \u2013 I'm sorry. As we've watched the study mature in terms of the duration of therapy and the event rate is that we're able to advance it forward without any increased risk to the study.","Now just a quick note on FRACTION. FRACTION is a study that gives us enormous flexibility. So you've picked up on an interesting point. There are a lot of patients in this. But it allows us, depending on the data, to move to additional arms or to ramp up in the arms there.","So it's not the same as you would expect for a registrational study, where you come up with the number at the beginning. It's about efficiency. It's about speed. It's about being able to identify signals and move quickly, should we see them. So thank you very much.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Tim. Can we go to the next question, please, Tiffany?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Francis, maybe for you, just you've touched on this, but just to hit it directly on the head. Would you mind comparing and contrasting your front-line lung cancer trial with the trial that Merck is running? And the reason I'm asking is, it's possible we may see the Merck data first. Don't know. But if Merck were to fail for some reason on the PFS endpoint, how should we think about that in terms of reassessing odds that your trial would hit on PFS or not? As I know there are some design differences that are important, I'd love to hear you articulate those for us.","And then also I don't \u2013 only one other question. I know it may be too early. And I know companies don't often like to provide this data. But can you give us any sense of where you're seeing duration of therapy in second-line lung right now? Thank you very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, let me just add a couple comments there. First of all, on Study -026 it's obviously not appropriate to speculate on other trials. Let me just reiterate. We are very comfortable about the design of our trial. We are very comfortable about the depth of understanding that went into the statistical plans. And we are increasingly comfortable about the choices we've made in terms of the dosing and schedule of Opdivo, as it relates to the efficacy we are seeing, both in the marketplace and in clinical trials. And I think it will be important to really look at the results of our study to understand the performance of Opdivo in the first-line setting in lung cancer.","With respect to length of therapy in lung, as we have seen get post approval, Murdo will give you some perspective there.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Sure, Mark, as you hinted it is early days. And we would prefer to have a 2-year in-market experience, so that we can do a full 1-year look back and provide more quantitative estimates of the duration of therapy that we're seeing in the second-line lung market. I would say we're very encouraged by the long-term follow-up data that were presented at AACR. So we expect to see duration of therapy in line with clinical trials and hopefully even a bit longer.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Mark, for the questions. Tiffany, could we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys, thanks for the question. So a lack of testing has been obviously a very differentiated factor for Opdivo thus far. Is there any updated thoughts on how that's going to evolve commercially, when you look to first-line lung?","And the second part of it does this harmonization of any technologies for testing matter to you guys? Help, hurt, or sort of indifferent? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Okay. So, Geoff, I'll start. It's Murdo here. We're seeing some evolution in testing. And it's primarily in the first-line setting, when tissue is available. So we're seeing 1% or 2% increases month over month. We're currently running at about 30% of patients being tested. And over 60% of that is in the front-line patient setting. So very few second-line patients continue to be tested.","So clearly, we have decided to commercialize our companion \u2013 sorry \u2013 our complementary biomarker PD-L1 test. We have a full commercial effort behind that. And we are setting the stage for what could happen in the front-line setting, which would be a testing market, as that's how we've defined our clinical trials.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Geoff. So I think what you're referring to is the blueprint study at the AACR. And just to remind everyone, these were the Phase I result, so a two-phase effort to compare four of the PD-L1 diagnostic assays across 39 non-small cell lung cancer tumors.","This was cross industry collaboration between four pharmaceutical companies, including us, and two diagnostic companies. And the idea was to provide greater clarity on the analytical performance of each assay.","Now the results indicated that two of the assays appear to be highly correlated. And three of the four assays were analytically similar. And in this first phase of the study, while some differences were due to scoring approaches and selective cutoffs, the assays were deemed not identical and interchangeable at this point in time. And I think one would say these preliminary results are not intended to alter the current guidelines for each diagnostic. But also I want to say is, very importantly, these findings confirm the quality and the utility of our assay.","So anyway we're moving forward into the second phase. We'll have to see how that goes. But obviously we're working hard with others to try and get to a point where there is some interchangeability. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Geoff, for the questions. Tiffany, could we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. So I have a couple questions. First of all, with respect to ASCO I believe that you're going to be providing some updated data from CheckMate -012 that helped inform your dosing for the Opdivo plus Yervoy combo in [CheckMate] -227. Could you just provide some more color on that?","Second, with respect to LAG-3 I noticed that you delayed and also downsized your key LAG-3 trial, so that was downsized from 540 to 360 patients and pushed out from September of 2016 to May of 2018. Could you discuss that?","And then finally, is there any other commentary you can offer on your other novel I-O agents? Thank you.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, David. So let me just talk about ASCO. And I just want to reiterate, we're really looking forward to ASCO. And there will be a number of areas of interest for us, as well as the updating longer term data on previous studies.","But you did specifically ask about that. Obviously I'm under embargo, the ASCO embargo, so I can't really give you any more color. But what we have done in the past, and you should expect, is that in these studies, particularly ones that are particularly interesting, we are presenting updated data, where the patient follow-up is extended. And in the context of immuno-oncology, the durability responses is a particularly interesting aspect of this. So one would expect a complete update of the whole data set.","As far as LAG-3 I think as I've already said, I was \u2013 and I appreciate how closely people look at the ClinTrials.gov data. But particularly in the FRACTION context, particularly these adaptable and flexible trials. Some of the changes, even quite large changes in numbers of people and duration, don't necessarily correlate with how the drug is and isn't going. And particularly in this trial, I think we removed one site or a country. And as a result you saw a big change in the numbers. So it's not representative of the progress.","As far as novel I-O combinations I did want just to say that first of all, we're very excited about the progress we're making with what has now become a fairly conventional, but still effective, I-O combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. As you appreciate it's \u2013 as Charlie mentioned, it's approved in the United States now. And should be approved soon in Europe.","And we have a number of trials ongoing and planned. Some registration in lung and renal as you mentioned, others exploratory. And you'll be seeing data from some of those at ASCO also.","We're also continuing to bring novel I-O agents into the clinic. We now if I'm correct have six other possible combinations. And OX40 should come into the clinic in June. And the CD73 we hope later in year.","So we're very excited about the opportunity this offers us to really expand the opportunity for patients to get those durable responses across the broadest number of patients possible. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Dave, for the questions. Tiffany, can we go to the next?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First on Opdivo, I would like your view if PD-1s work well and move strongly into front-line lung, to what extent do you think the second-line lung opportunity moderates in size?","And, Murdo, on Opdivo pricing in the U.S., are there any signs that payers are looking to negotiate price in any way? Or do you pretty much get a label, get added to the compendia, and your price is your price?","And lastly, just a quick one for Charlie. On U.S. Eliquis in the quarter, was there any creep up in trade inventories or improvement in gross to net? I think revenues were up quite a bit more than the impressive Rx growth in Q1 versus Q1. Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me just start maybe, Gregg, with a perspective on second-line lung and what happens going forward, should there be a rapid penetration of Opdivo in first line. My perspective is that that really puts into context our strategy with novel agents, where we've consistently said that we're looking at really understanding the basis for patients that don't respond or progress following the response. I think FRACTION, as Francis mentioned, is a great trial for us to test hypothesis and advance our early pipeline very strategically.","It also underlines the importance of the breadth of our early pipeline with up to eight agents in early clinical development this year. And obviously we're also investigating what happens in terms of retreatment potential and other evolution in how the sequence of care in lung cancer happens. That really positions us very strongly, because of the totality of what we have going. Murdo?","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yeah, thanks, Gregg. Your question regarding pricing in the U.S. on Opdivo. So far we've actually seen very good access to Opdivo and a good appreciation of its value across all of its current indications. And are close to 100% reimbursement without restrictions to those indications. We're also seeing continued strong reimbursement of Yervoy and very good reimbursement of Yervoy plus Opdivo in regimen and in combination in metastatic melanoma.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And, Gregg, on your question on the U.S. Eliquis, as I mentioned in my comments we did have a one-time positive adjustment due to the Medicare coverage gap. That was about $25 million. And there was a slight increase in (51:03) inventories, we think up to about $40 million.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Gregg, for the questions. Tiffany, go to the next one, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I believe it was stated on the Q4 call, which was three months ago today, that there are or were no interim looks at CheckMate -026. And that Bristol did not expect early stoppage relative to the November 1 completion. So a summer stoppage is a very positive development. Has anything changed but the event rate? It would seem to me that the company would be able to predict with great precision the standard of care event rate. So should we consider a scenario where the increased number of events are likely in the Opdivo arm? I know you don't know. But is that a reasonable conjecture? Or alternatively, what else could be driving this higher event rate? Thank you.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Steve, I think it's \u2013 I would be very careful about speculating at all. Let me just say \u2013 and I want to repeat what I've said already. We make a decision based on the event rate and the duration of therapy. And in this particular study, for all the reasons we've already discussed, it's really important to get that right. We believe based on our experience and our record of success, we have \u2013 or we will be getting it right. But I can't speculate about the result.","I do think all I would say is, if this was \u2013 if I knew the results and I knew how to predict exactly the events, we wouldn't need to do the trials. So the thing is there is always a degree of uncertainty in this. But I don't think where we are towards the end of a trial, there is any uncertainty left in terms of months and months. So we are looking at the third quarter with a good deal of confidence. And I just want to repeat again, it's without any reduction in \u2013 oh, I should say no increase in the risk in terms of the study design.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Steve, this is Giovanni. Just to maybe address another of the elements you highlighted. So first of all, our timing in Q3 is not driven by an interim analysis. It's driven by our understanding of the completion of the study. And the time change is not driven by an increase in event threads.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Steve. Tiffany, could we go to the next questions, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Three questions, please. First, could I press Francis on how Bristol's thinking on the role of chemo to potentiate I-O agents, namely nivolumab, has evolved? There's been some recent publications on reduced clonality with chemo. Some publications on impact of chemo dependent on Immunoscore. Obviously you have your own clinical experience with the drug. But I just wondered whether you are more sympathetic or less sympathetic to advancing chemo in combination with PD-1 blockade?","Second, one of your competitors, AbbVie, just made a material acquisition of a company with a DLL4 conjugated monoclonal for small-cell lung cancer. Obviously Opdivo is being developed in that setting. I'm interested in your views of that particular target versus a PD-L \u2013 PD-1 modality.","And then finally, there are a proliferation of PD-1 monoclonals not yet approved but in development from a variety of biotech and pharma companies. Could you just remind us of Bristol's stance regarding prosecuting your intellectual property? And what you think the ultimate outcomes are going to be here for the late entrants? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Andrew, let me just \u2013 this is Giovanni. Let me just start with a couple comments. And Francis will follow up on some of your questions as well.","So first of all, with respect to intellectual property. Obviously as the leader and the innovator in this field, we have a broad estate of patents and intellectual property, which we are defending vigorously. There are a number of legal proceedings ongoing, some of them initiated by us, some of them initiated by Merck in the U.S. and Europe and Australia.","I would say that in the cases in which we have received an opinion from courts, we are very pleased with the initial developments there. And many of those cases will take a long time to conclude. But we feel very strongly about where we are from an IP perspective. And we are optimistic about the first court decisions.","With respect to the business development activity you mentioned at the beginning, obviously we know the field in lung very well. As you also know, we have a clear priority in business development. We look at many opportunities all the time. And we look at the value of platforms in the context of what our programs are. And as Francis will tell you we have strong confidence in the breadth and depth of our pipeline, specifically as it relates to small cell and non-small cell lung cancer.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Andrew. So first of all, let me just reiterate. We believe that the I-O combination is the best way to improve upon the expectation, the long-term expectations of patients.","But we have got some trials based on a very robust set of data with various chemo\/Opdivo regimens with considerable follow-up as well. So just to remind you we have, as part of our [CheckMate] -227 study in the non-expressor population, a chemo combination. And we also have actually a CheckMate -370, which is a treatment informing a study in the community, looking at different approaches, different regimens, different sequencing of chemo.","So while we're focused on I-O\/I-O combinations, we're certainly open to the idea of chemo in certain patient segments.","I think as far as the small-cell lung cancer, which you intimated from your question about DLL4, chemotherapy there has an important role to play. And DLL4 is \u2013 the target is one way of addressing that with an ADC. We think Opdivo and Opdivo\/Yervoy combinations \u2013 and we'll be presenting data on this at ASCO coming up \u2013 have an important role to play in small-cell lung cancer, both on their own or potentially in combination with other regimens. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew. Tiffany, I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So two more again on sort of the earlier stage I-O assets. One, if you could just comment on CD137. I don't think I've heard you guys mention much about that one recently, unless I missed it. And Pfizer does seem pretty optimistic with what they're seeing, that mechanism, so just curious on your thoughts.","And then you did touch on the CD73 and said that's moving into the clinic this year. I think just there seems to be a lot of excitement around this adenosine pathway approach from a lot of companies. I'm curious if you can just kind of give your views on that approach as a monotherapy versus combination therapy? And then touch on sort of CD73 versus maybe directly going after the adenosine receptor with like the A2A receptor blockade sort of approach? And which one \u2013 what might be the advantage or disadvantage of the two? Thanks.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning. So let me first of all talk about 137. We will be \u2013 we've said for a while we will be presenting data later this year. And we will be doing that. And we have studies in monotherapy in a number of tumors and in combination with NIVO and actually other agents too.","I think what's important to say here is that we believe the bar has been raised and will be continued to be raised quite high by the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. So I think that's the benchmark to which we are looking to, as we look at the data and consider whether to bring further combinations forward.","As far as CD73, I'd draw your attention to the fact we presented data on this at the AACR. It's one of a number of non-effector mechanisms we're looking at in combination. We believe we're certainly at the front of this. And we're certainly looking forward to bringing it in and moving it into our FRACTION approach to efficiently and quickly see if there's some activity there.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Vamil. And, Tiffany, could we go to our last question, please?","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Your line is open.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on the results. First question for Murdo. In first-line lung cancer when you segment the market, and if you look at a label where you're restricted to just greater than or equal to 50% of PD-L1 patients, what percent of the market in first-line does that represent? Versus having a label that would have one, five, 10, or any positivity in PD-L1?","Second question for Murdo and Francis on the regulatory timing around Hodgkin's lymphoma and head and neck cancer. Can you give some clarity on filing in U.S., Europe, Japan?","And then on the commercial side what additional incremental investment do you have to make on those two indications? You obviously have the Sprycel salesforce in place, but don't actively sell in head and neck. Just a little bit of clarity on investment.","And then lastly for Charlie on leverage with the revenue going higher, and potentially going higher in the out years, as you optimize all of these indications, how are you thinking 2017 and beyond about operating leverage? Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Okay, John, I'll try and handle the first and part of the second question. And then Francis and Charlie can jump in as required.","So first-line lung segment. If you take a 50% cut off you're talking about 25% of the market, approximately. And if you take a greater than, let's say 1% cutoff, you're looking at about 70% of the market in terms of relative size.","When it comes to second line \u2013 sorry \u2013 your second question. When you look at the other indications in the U.S. we believe we've invested appropriately for commercializing those indications. However, we've stated we want to be leaders in I-O. Right now we have dominate share of voice in all our core tumors. We think we can continue that with the hematological team that we have currently selling Empliciti and Sprycel. I think Hodgkin's lymphoma fits in really nice there, and there's a good customer overlap. And then other solid tumors, we think we're appropriately resourced as well for.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","So let me very quickly say, the FDA has accepted our sBLA. We've got priority review. The EMA has validated our type 2 variation. The Japanese Ministry of Health has validated our application, and where we're presenting the data at ASCO in June. Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And obviously that's on Hodgkin lymphoma. Head and neck we are working on the dataset in anticipation of a submission.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, John, just on your question on leverage. Even our revised guidance in 2016 provides roughly (1:04:09). And as we stated many times (1:04:15) going forward throughout the decade, throughout the rest of this decade, but also beginning more acutely next year.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, everyone. So we are at the end of the call. I would just like to thank all of you again for your questions. I reiterate that we're off to a really strong start in 2016.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you.","Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy morning with several companies reporting, so appreciate your time. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; Giovanni Caforio, Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer; and Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer. Lamberto, Giovanni, and Charlie will have prepared remarks, and then we'll go to your questions.","Before I turn it over to Lamberto, let me take care of the Safe Harbor language. During this call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website.","Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Well, this is my last earnings call as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, and I'm pleased that my last full quarter was one of our best.","Over the past few years, we have evolved and strengthened our company, we have delivered on our strategy, and we have set a solid foundation for our future, building a robust product portfolio innovative pipeline that positions us well for the future. As a result, Bristol-Myers Squibb is now in a very strong position. And during the last quarter, we had solid performance across much of our portfolio, as well as important clinical and regulatory developments. I just want to note how excited we are that Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor approved for lung cancer in the U.S., and that a positive opinion was adopted last week in Europe for melanoma. These were not just important milestones for our company. These are important developments that have potential to improve the lives of thousands of lung cancer patients in the U.S. and melanoma patients in Europe.","Giovanni and Charlie will walk you through the highlights of the quarter in just a moment. But before they do it, I just want to say again that I feel very good about what we have done to transform Bristol-Myers Squibb into a diversified specialty biopharma company. And I also feel very good that Giovanni will be my successor as CEO. He's a trained physician, a global business leader with broad industry experience, and a senior BMS executive who has been instrumental in driving the execution of our strategy over the past several years. There is no question that Giovanni is the right person at the right time and will bring to the position the right mix of experience, passion, vision, and energy.","And lastly, I'm looking forward to my new role as Chairman of the Board. Again, it's a bittersweet transition in that I will miss working alongside Jim Cornelius, who has played a transformative role at BMS for the past several years, but I'm glad that I will be able to continue to work with the board and Giovanni and his leadership team.","And with that, I will turn the floor over to Giovanni and Charlie. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support and for his years of leadership. I, too, am glad that we will continue working together.","So as Lamberto noted, we just finished a very good quarter. Performance across the organization was strong, and we had some very important clinical and regulatory advances in our immuno-oncology portfolio. During the first quarter, we delivered 6% sales growth. Excluding the impact from our diabetes divestiture, we delivered a 10% increase over the first quarter last year. This was due to solid double-digit growth across our new and in-line brands. Here are some highlights.","First, regarding Eliquis, we continued to see strong performance. We had $355 million in global sales in the first three months of the year, with good growth in both cardiology and primary care. This is more than double the first quarter of last year. Along with our alliance partner Pfizer, we continue to focus on our goal of establishing Eliquis as the leading oral anticoagulant within its approved indications. In the U.S., Eliquis is now the number one anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions among cardiologists and the number one anticoagulant across all physicians for atrial fibrillation. In addition to progress in atrial fibrillation, the label expansion into VD (6:00) has helped our performance overall.","Internationally, our business was very strong. In Europe, Eliquis trends across most markets remained very positive. And we are also doing well in Japan, where Eliquis is the number one anticoagulant in new-to-brand prescriptions across all prescribers.","Regarding hepatitis C, global sales were strong at $264 million, primarily driven by the performance of our Daklinza-Sunvepra combination regimen in Japan. In Europe, we have launched in several markets, and commercial execution has been good despite increased competition. In the U.S., we completed our resubmission of Daklinza to the FDA in February for genotype 3 patients, and we have a PDUFA date in Q3. We also have presented interesting data on the combination of Daklinza with Sovaldi in HIV co-infected patients, as well as more recently in cirrhotic and post-transplant patients.","Moving to immuno-oncology, we had a very good quarter, commercially as well as in R&D.","Let me first talk about Yervoy. Yervoy continues to do well, with global net sales for the quarter of $325 million, a 20% increase over the same period last year. We had strong performance across all geographies. In the U.S., we saw growth in the community setting, while internationally, growth was driven by first line. As we continue to advance our immuno-oncology portfolio, Yervoy certainly remains an important treatment option for patients. However, as we have mentioned before, the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents, such as Opdivo in melanoma, will likely create some variability in Yervoy sales. We're also looking at Yervoy in earlier stages of melanoma. We recently announced the filing of study 029, in which Yervoy showed a benefit in adjuvant treatment for patients with stage 3 melanoma who are at high risk of recurrence. And we just presented data from study 069 at the AACR conference, which showed encouraging data of the combination of the Yervoy plus Opdivo. We believe that this regimen has the potential to further transform the treatment of melanoma, and we are anticipating a submission to the FDA by midyear.","Regarding Opdivo, as Lamberto mentioned, the last few months have been very exciting for all of us at BMS, but most importantly for patients across multiple tumors. In addition to the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year and the early approval in second-line squamous lung cancer in early March, we recently announced the early stoppage of study 057, the Phase III study of Opdivo in second-line non-squamous lung cancer. Opdivo has once again demonstrated a survival advantage over the standard of care in advanced lung cancer, and we will be providing this data to health authorities as quickly as possible.","With the early approval in lung cancer, we are the first PD-1 to market in this area of high unmet need. Our commercial organization was ready, and we were able to start treating patients within 48 hours. It has been very encouraging to see that we have nearly 100% access for Opdivo in the approved indications, and we are seeing an acceleration of usage in both the academic and community setting.","In addition to the U.S. approvals, just last week the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending that Opdivo be granted approval for use in patients with metastatic melanoma. This is the first positive opinion from the CHMP for a PD-1 therapy and will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which typically renders a decision within 60 days. And we are hopeful that we could be approved in lung cancer in the EU by the end of the year.","There is more to come with our immuno-oncology portfolio. ASCO will be an important meeting for us. We will be presenting two Phase III overall survival studies in lung cancer: study 017, and, we are excited to say, we were able to secure a spot for study 057, too. In addition to new data on lung cancer, we are looking forward to presenting new data in melanoma, more mature data from ongoing renal studies, and data in new tumor types such as hepatocellular carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma. We will also be presenting the results for the elotuzumab Phase III study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, and we expect to continue to have important data readouts over the next 12 to 18 months in several tumor types.","So, taken together, we are very pleased with our first quarter results: strong commercial performance; important clinical, regulatory, and business development advances. This balanced approach, driving results today while laying the foundation for tomorrow, continues to serve us well.","And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie, who can provide more specifics around our Q1 results.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. As Lamberto and Giovanni mentioned, we had a very good quarter, which was driven by strong sales growth of 6%, or 13% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a slightly negative impact on EPS of about $0.01. Despite headwind from FX, we had a strong sales performance from our key growth drivers, including Eliquis, Yervoy, and hep C. In addition, Sprycel and Orencia both had a good quarter, each up 10% compared to Q1 last year.","Sales of Opdivo were $40 million for the quarter, which included some inventory stocking. Overall, while early, we're seeing encouraging trends. With Abilify, our U.S. sales in Q1 were higher than prior quarters due to the way revenues are shared in our agreement with Otsuka. The formula is based on a tiered structure, and as our rights to Abilify in the U.S. expired in April, all of the U.S. revenues we record this year are at the 50% tier as compared with the blended annual rate of 33% for all of last year.","You may have seen that we recently agreed to transfer our North American Erbitux rights to Lilly. We will continue to commercialize Erbitux and book sales until the transition to Lilly, which we expect will be completed in the fourth quarter. After the transition, Lilly will pay us royalties on net sales, which will be accounted for as other income. The transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on our non-GAAP earnings.","Gross margin was 80% during the quarter, up 410 basis points compared to the same period last year. The favorability was mostly due to the FX impact on international inventories sold. If rates remain constant, we expect this favorability in gross margin to normalize. Gross margin was also impacted by a one-time benefit from a restructured royalty agreement.","A&P and MS&A were both down versus prior year, due in part to FX and lower spending on diabetes and Abilify. This was partially offset by increased investments in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo, and our hep C franchise. R&D expenses were down about 5%, primarily due to timing of R&D spend and FX. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% during the quarter, which does not include the R&D tax credit, as it's not been extended yet in 2015.","This was an active quarter for business development, as we continually look for opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. Within I-O, we recently added two new programs that expand our portfolio with the acquisition of the IDO and TDO program from Flexus, and the in-license of the TGF beta program from Rigel. With these programs, we add compounds that address the tumor microenvironment, which we think can act synergistically with our I-O assets in multiple tumor types.","We are also expanding our specialty portfolio through business development. Our recent agreement with uniQure brings us exclusive access to uniQure's gene therapy technology platform for multiple targets in cardiovascular diseases, including a program for congestive heart failure. The agreement also allows us to collaborate in other therapeutic areas.","Moving to guidance, we are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $1.60 to $1.70. This range assumes current foreign exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. When setting guidance in January, we expected a negative impact of $0.12 to $0.14 on full-year EPS due to FX rates at that time. Our updated guidance range incorporates an additional $0.02 negative impact based on current FX rates. While we are not changing line item guidance, in thinking about operating expenses for the remainder of the year, we are very enthusiastic about our position in I-O and are committed to maximizing our opportunity. And, as you might expect, we are continuously evaluating new investment opportunities, and we have identified several, both commercially and within R&D, that are in the process of being reviewed.","Now we'd be happy to address your questions.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Okay. Eric, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A. And, just as a reminder, in addition to Lamberto, Giovanni, and Charlie, Francis is here to handle any questions you might have.","So, Eric, with that, if we can go to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.

First off, as we look forward to the launch of Opdivo potentially more broadly in lung cancer, can you just talk a little bit about when you would anticipate potentially filing in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer? You certainly had your data available to the agency very quickly from CheckMate-017. Second question, can you talk a little bit about the \u2013 what you feel the importance of a biomarker is, and maybe just compare and contrast the PD-L1 biomarker and its relevance to response rate versus overall survival? And then the last question. Charlie, you had a very interesting comment there about BD and potential additional commercial opportunities. Is this the timeframe within which you think it's time to execute on potentially a more meaningful transaction to really broaden out the product portfolio? Thanks so much.","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Well, good morning, Seamus. I must say it's been an incredibly exciting last few months for Opdivo, as you've heard, for our company, for R&D, and importantly for patients. I must say I'm particularly gratified that the many strategic choices we made two, three years ago, that shaped our development program, are now coming to fruition.","For our initial tumors, we focused on lung as well as the traditional immunological tumors melanoma and renal cell, and we initiated broad programs in these tumors and characterized the benefit in terms of overall survival in Phase III studies, going head to head with chemotherapy when it's standard of care. We built optionality into our trials. To accelerate the results, we moved quickly to explore the combination therapy. Now the recent positive data from these studies in lung and melanoma, including combination therapy, together with the early U.S. approval in melanoma late last year, the rapid approval in lung cancer and advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer in early March, and last week the positive opinion in the EU for Opdivo with a broad label in melanoma, really I believe puts us in a very strong competitive position.","So moving your question on 057, we're very excited about the data, which you've heard will be presented at ASCO. I can't comment specifically on the submission. There are a number of steps we need to take to complete the analysis for the submission, and we're working as quickly as possible to share these data, of course, with the regulators around the world. But, as we've shown recently, we are confident that we'll work together and as quickly as possible with the FDA and other health authorities to broaden our label and to bring Opdivo to non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients as soon as is practical.","Now, moving to your PD-L1 biomarker question, I want to remind you that from the beginning, our strategy has been to characterize the PD-L1 expression in a broad population as possible so that as many patients as possible can benefit from I-O therapy. Now, our scientific goals have been two-fold: to learn about the relationship between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes, importantly, as you said \u2013 or as you asked \u2013 overall survival as well as objective response, and also to understand the science underlying PD-L1 expression in tumors and how it's affected by various factors, including Yervoy and Opdivo.","I think you'll have to wait until ASCO to hear more specific information about the relationship between objective response and overall survival, but I will say we're very excited about the fact that we're the only company that really has been able to show that relationship. Because, as well as the total population, we have done sub-analyses looking at PD-L1 positive and negative in both squamous \u2013 in both studies in second line, squamous and non-squamous.","So I just wanted to \u2013 let me finish by saying we continue to design studies to include all patients regardless of PD-L1 status, and we will follow the science and the clinical data that we generate regarding the use of this biomarker. I think it's important, to my final point, to say we have developed a high-quality, validated diagnostic test with data which will be quickly available, should we need it either for approval or labeling. Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti - Chief Executive Officer","So \u2013 Charlie, you will obviously elaborate on BD. But it is clear that our strategy on business development has not changed over the last years. We continue to look at opportunities. We continue to look at opportunities of different size, as long as they make financial sense and they give us the possibility of expanding our pipeline and our portfolio. Size is not the main element of judgment or the main element of selection. It's more the fit with our portfolio and our pipeline. So the moment is always mature for good business development opportunities.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, Seamus. As Lamberto said, nothing's really changed regarding our BD strategy. We've been fairly consistent with that, in that BD remains a top priority for the company as we recognize that innovation must be sourced not just internally but externally as well. And as Lamberto said, we're agnostic around size, and we're also very good at looking at different structures that suits the \u2013 our partners. And also, and very importantly, we're very disciplined around what we think makes strategic sense for us, as well as good science. And of course the financial metrics have to all tie it all together.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Great. Eric, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Firstly on Opdivo, I was curious if you're seeing use of Opdivo for squams and non-squams at this point? And as part of that, or as a follow-on to that, is there any evidence that payers will differentiate between I-O agents that have OS data versus those that do not? Obviously, that should matter to physicians and patients, but wondering if there's a payer angle there. And second line of questioning is around Eliquis. Given that some time has passed and the drug is ramping nicely and there's a change in leadership coming here, I just thought I'd re-ask about whether your efforts in Eliquis are leveragable in the future on products beyond Eliquis, and perhaps whether it's profitable at this point or not. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Sure. Thank you, Gregg. Good morning. This is Giovanni. Let me just answer the Opdivo question first, and then I'll go to Eliquis.","With respect to Opdivo, as we mentioned earlier, we were approved in lung cancer, squamous second-line lung cancer, at the beginning of March. We had obviously ensured that despite the very rapid regulatory review, that our teams were fully resourced and ready to launch. We were ready to launch right away. We actually started treating patients within 48 hours. I think what has happened since launch is very encouraging and reinforces our belief in the potential of Opdivo in lung cancer. We've seen, at this point, virtually 100% access with no barriers within approved indications by any payers. We've seen a lot of interest in our data, and we are seeing a rapid increase in penetration in both the academic institutions and the community. One of the things that we look at is, as a leading indicator of performance, is really how our trialists grow. And we are seeing week over week a really good trend in terms of trialists.","With respect to our performance, I would also say we are really looking at what we call the dynamic segment in terms of new patients coming on therapy. And we're very pleased that we are actually at this point at approximately a 50% share in value of the PD-1 market right now.","To your question regarding usage beyond the label, all I can say obviously is we are promoting within our two labeled and approved indications, and we are seeing that approximately 75% of claims are really in label with respect to the totality of our business at this point. So what we are seeing really reinforces our belief that the data is very strong. There is a lot of interest in it. Obviously we think survival data and the ability to promote a Phase III randomized trial with survival data, which is clearly a hard endpoint, resonates extremely well with providers and payers.","And to Eliquis, let me just echo your comments: The performance is very strong. We had a really good quarter. We had a good quarter in the U.S., where we continue to see growth in both our TRx share and our new-to-brand prescription share. We were able to grow both TRx and NBRx by approximately 20% in the quarter compared to other brands, which declined during the same period. And we also saw really good performance internationally with Japan, Germany, and all key markets in Europe. Eliquis is a very important asset for us. It is growing to be a really important product. And obviously, as you know, cardiovascular is one of our priority areas. We have a number of early programs in cardiovascular disease. We actually, as Charlie mentioned, signed an agreement with uniQure, which has a potential target in heart failure. So Eliquis is one product, but we are committed to the area.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Thanks for the questions, Gregg. Can we go to the next one, please, Eric?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple here. Just following the data we saw for Yervoy and Opdivo at AACR and what seems to be a really nice bump versus kind of just monotherapy PD-1, can you just elaborate a little bit more where you see the combo fitting into the treatment paradigm? And, just as we think about price for the combo, do you think that's going be any type of rate-limiting factor in terms of adoption ultimately when we think about that market? My second question was on your IDO. Just \u2013 can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of what differentiation you see with the product that you require here versus others in development and just the timelines we should watch in terms of when the product could move forward? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Chris, good morning. Let me just start with the combo. Obviously the data we presented at AACR was very positive in terms of the high response rate, and I believe what was really exciting is not only the response rate in the range of 60%, but also that over 20% of patients have a complete response. So we continue to believe that the use of the combination of Yervoy and Opdivo can really transform melanoma, because obviously the difference we are seeing in terms of the response rate translates into the potential for survival for a significant number of patients in a disease that progresses very rapidly.","The other point that I would like to make is that we are reassured by the fact that physicians are able to manage the side effect profile of Yervoy in over 80% of cases with the treatment algorithms that we've used since the launch of Yervoy, and that a significant percentage of even those patients that may stop therapy early, almost 70% actually see responses. So we think there is a lot of value in the regimen. And obviously as we get ready to present some data from the Phase III study 067 at ASCO, we are very focused on that.","From the perspective of price, I think that our experience is that payers and providers are very interested in data that demonstrates significant incremental value for patients. That clearly was our experience with Yervoy from the very beginning, and obviously we believe it continues to be what makes a difference there. It's important to remember that obviously the induction phase with Yervoy is something that physicians are very familiar with, and obviously the maintenance phase with Opdivo beyond the first 12 weeks is really something that is only happening for patients that have responders. And, as you know, there is a very high value in terms of potential survival in the long term toward response that payers traditionally have been very receptive to.","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Chris, good morning. Let me say, based on our experience with Opdivo and Yervoy in combination, the science from our internal program and our external collaborations, we believe that in addition to checkpoint inhibition, of course, which we have a great interest and expertise in, understanding and modulating the tumor micro-environment, which is where IDO plays, is going play an important role in how we continue to expand the benefits of I-O to additional patients.","Specifically around the Flexus asset, we have now had a chance to look at the data following the successful completion of the HSR process, we're very happy with what we've seen. I'm not going go into the specifics at the moment about what differentiates it. But it's a very \u2013 it's an exciting lead compound, but also represents a program in IDO and behind it programs in IDO TDO (31:40). All of which, together with some other areas in the tumor micro-environment, we think is going be very important.","As far as timing, we're moving well towards filling the data we need for an IND, and we're hoping to be in the clinic at the end of the year or at the beginning of next year.","Let me just finish by talking generally about the combination to reinforce what Giovanni said. We feel that the compelling results we saw at the AACR really reinforce our belief in the combinations and an opportunity to really expand the benefits beyond the patients who are treated presently with \u2013 treated with monotherapy. And we are planning to be in a position to have had a submission for the combination to the FDA by the middle of the year. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Thanks for the questions, Chris. Can we go to the next question please, Eric?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Giovanni, I don't know if you answered a question that was asked of you earlier, but maybe you can just talk about what you see as the commercial significance of Opdivo, having comparative overall survival in all comers in second-line squamous\/non-squamous lung. And the reason I ask is obviously competition is right at your doorstep with Merck and Roche. Merck's made some comments earlier today on their call suggesting a broader label, albeit no overall survival. So in the commercial environment, what do you see as the significance or relevance of having that broader label? And then a question for you, Francis. Roche has started four chemo combination trials of PD-L1 antibody in Phase III for lung cancer, and Bristol has been less committed to a chemo combination trial. I think that you've decided not to go ahead in Phase III. Clearly they're making a very large investment in this combination. What do you think they see that you don't? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Jami, let me start with the commercial perspective. We believe that, first of all, it is very important to have Phase III data. And it is very important to have overall survival data. Oncologists have traditionally really valued the opportunity to look at Kaplan-Meier curves and understand the survival impact of a new treatment for patients. And what we are very excited about is not only the fact that we have two Phase III trials \u2013 obviously you'll see those at ASCO \u2013 and that those are in all comers, but also our ability to characterize the response in PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients. So our data set is very strong, and clearly survival is important for both physicians and payers.","From a commercial perspective, just to conclude, we are obviously aware that this is a very competitive space. We are making all of the right investments to be competitive. We have invested in our commercial infrastructure in the U.S. early in order to be able and ready to launch. We have leading share of voice in both the melanoma market and the lung market at this point. And we will continue to make the investments that are needed in order to drive very competitive performance for our portfolio.","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Good morning, Jami. I'm not going to speculate on Merck's or Roche's strategy or indeed what the FDA may or may not do in terms of the data we've heard about. But what I can say from our experience with regulatory authorities is that we've got the label based on the data we've put in. And, based on that, I'm confident we are going have a very competitive label in second-line non-small cell lung. I'm very gratified about the progress of our comprehensive program in lung cancer. And, just to remind you, this has generated strong data in overall survival in second-line lung, both in a broad population, and it also has sub-analyses for both PD-L1 positive and negative patients. And you'll be seeing that data at ASCO.","I think as far as the combination with chemotherapy, we set out to go head to head with chemotherapy. And as I've said, we've shown very impressive data, which you'll have a chance to see. I would remind you as well as our approval in the U.S. approval, we also have an ongoing registration review in Europe for squamous lung cell cancer, and we have a number of collaborations in chemotherapy where at least we will be able to get some indication in addition to the I-O combination, which we'll be starting very soon in chemotherapy.","So overall I'm very confident in our broad program. You'll have a chance to see the second-line studies at ASCO. We certainly have first-line therapy, again going head to head with chemotherapy, and the first-line combination study will be starting very soon. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Thanks for the questions, Jami. Can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hello. That would be Schoenebaum, but that's okay. Hey. Thank you very much for taking the question, and congratulations on the success of the lung trials over the last several months. Maybe I can just ask one question. There's been I think some questions kind of around this, so I just wanted to hit it on the head. I don't know if this is a question for Giovanni or who, but \u2013 and I know that you're not going to give long-term guidance. But I think everybody that watches Bristol-Myers understands that your operating margin right now is sort of artificially suppressed, if you will, by some of the \u2013 the nature of your partner products, and that the earnings power in theory of your I-O franchise over the next several years is substantial. And in theory, the incremental contribution margin of your I-O franchise should be dramatically in excess of the overall company EBIT margin or operating margin today. And I think that is likely a statement of fact at the product level.","But the question is, how is management thinking about structuring running margins over the long term? How much of the I-O sales will you allow to drop down to the bottom line? I realize, we all realize, you're not going to give specific guidance. Maybe you can just talk philosophically about how, in the realm of exploding revenue perhaps over the next three to five years, how you will manage expenses. And then just a clarification on ex-U.S. lung cancer timelines, if I may. I heard you mention that approval will be by the end of the year I think, Francis, you expected. Could you just clarify, though, in which histologies and which line? And if it's not second line, when would you expect the second-line data versus docetaxel in both squamous and non-squamous, to make it onto the European label? Thanks.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Mark, thank you. This is Charlie. As you suggested, we're not going to give long-term guidance, but let me give you the frame I think that we've talked about before, as you think about our business. So just in the very near term, as we've talked about on the call, we lose Eliquis. Or, excuse me, Abilify.","Lamberto Andreotti - Chief Executive Officer","Oof.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I almost gave Lamberto a heart attack. We lose Abilify \u2013 actually we lost it as of April 20, and that is a significantly profitable product for us. In our agreement with Otsuka, we book revenue on Abilify and virtually have no cost of goods, and we virtually have eliminated all operating expenses against that product. In addition, Eliquis, as you mentioned, has \u2013 we share with Pfizer on that, and that has an impact on our overall profitability, because that goes through cost of goods sold. And then we do have a compelling opportunity, as you suggest in I-O, and \u2013 but we're also \u2013 have to make sure that we're making the right investments to make sure that we secure our leading position, not just now but going out into the future. Having said all that, over time you would expect to see some leverage in our P&L.","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Good morning, Mark. So we \u2013 as you say, we have a validated submission under review in the EU based on squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And, as you mentioned, we're looking to have approval before year's end. I'm not going to comment any further on potential submissions or other approvals, but just obviously to point out that the positive data from 057, we'll be working very aggressively to have that ready for submission to regulatory authorities around the world, including the EMA.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Thanks for the questions, Mark. Can we go to the next one, please, Eric?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A few questions. Can you just update us on your perspective of the combo of ipi and nivo in non-small cell lung? Relative to let's say a year ago, are you more confident or less confident in the utility of that combination in lung? And then can you talk about PD-L1 biomarker and how you think this could play out in Europe in lung cancer? Do you think that relative to the U.S., European regulators and payers may take a more pronounced view on the utility of the biomarker as a gating tool for treatment decisions. And then on elotuzumab, can you repeat what you said when we'd see the data and your level of enthusiasm for that product?","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Good morning, Tim. So let me first of all talk about the 227 study \u2013 that's the Phase III study in first line. It's a comprehensive, broad study in non-small cell lung cancer patients. It includes both PD-L1 positive and negative patients. It will have a different dosing schedule to other trials in combination. And I just want to reiterate that we have ensured that the trial design has benefited from the insights we've gleaned from our recently stopped Phase III lung studies. It's an important study. It's an important part of our broad program and will address a comprehensive lung population. It's ready to recruit, and you'll see it in clintrials.gov soon.","Talking about the PD-L1 biomarker let me be clear: We've always said that the role of the biomarker may vary based on tumor type, histology, line of therapy, and whether it's monotherapy or combination. And I think I'll add to that, of course the data that you have, that you generate, and the response of the regulators to some extent. But really it all comes down to the data. And we're very comfortable that we have generated a very comprehensive data set in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, based on the 017 and 057 studies.","Finally, about elotuzumab, we have the data from ELOQUENT-2 \u2013 that's a Phase III second line study. We look forward to presenting that at ASCO. But of course it's premature for me to discuss our regulatory plans until after the data is presented. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Thanks, Tim. Can we go to the next question, please, Eric?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions, and congratulations on 057. Charlie, your full-year guidance seems very conservative given the performance in 1Q and gross margin outlook. Is it a reflection of your Opdivo launch trajectory, or are you expecting other major headwinds somewhere, other than of course Abilify that you just talked about. And then, Francis, similar to the earlier question on IDO, could you comment on the TGF beta data assets from Rigel and when we can expect data from those? Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Alex. This is Charlie. I did mention to some degree how we think about guidance in my comments, but let me just comment a little bit further. So Abilify was very favorable to us in the first quarter, but that essentially goes all away back half of the \u2013 or the last three quarters. I did mention we do have a one-time benefit in our cost of goods sold related to a royalty restructuring. And then OpEx is normally lighter for us in the first quarter than it is in any other quarter. And when you take that timing difference, as well as my comments earlier about considering additional I-O investments, that's really how we get to the guidance range that I talked about earlier.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","And let me just \u2013 this is Giovanni. Let me just reiterate that we are really excited with the initial feedback from the launch of Opdivo in both melanoma and lung. As I mentioned earlier, all of the early indicators are very strong, from access to physician interests to the growth in number of trialists across community and academic settings. And, finally, as I said in terms of our total share, the PD-1 opportunity and how rapidly that is growing.","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Good morning, Alex. You're right. We're excited about the Rigel collaboration on TGF beta. Just to be clear, that's a discovery program. And therefore I'm not going to comment on when we might have a clinical candidate. But I think it's important to remind you that we do have, in the clinic, a collaboration with Eli Lilly on their TGF beta inhibitor with Opdivo, and I think we would expect to see data from that before we could get the Rigel compound into the clinic, which of course will be very helpful for us in deciding where we will go. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Thank you. Can we go to the next question, please, Eric?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have three questions, please. The first is, for your updated 2015 guidance, does that reflect an expected U.S. approval and launch in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in 2015? Second, with respect to breaking down study 017 and 057 based upon PD-L1 status, could you just help us understand how you plan to potentially cut the data to demonstrate greater effectiveness in high expressers? And then how you will try to frame the debate at ASCO, since different companies use different cutoffs and biomarkers? And then, third, with respect to ex-U.S. Opdivo and lung, any suggestion for when we should be modeling lung launches ex-U.S. in 2016? Should we think about major markets launching in the second half of 2016 after price negotiations? Is that sort of the right timing to think about in major markets ex-U.S. for lung? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","David, this is Giovanni. Let me just answer a couple of your comments. With respect to launch of study 050 of the non-squamous indication, we are not going to comment on that at that point. As Francis said, we are conducting all of analyses on the data. We look forward to sharing that with regulatory authorities, and it's really premature to make any other comments there.","With respect to ex-U.S. Opdivo lung sales, I think that when we are approved, you should be thinking about the same sequence of launches that is typical of ex-U.S. and particularly European markets, with more rapid access for patients in those markets, like Germany and Northern Europe in general, where there is the opportunity to launch right after approval. And obviously in some other markets we will need to go through negotiations related to reimbursement. So, there, the only thing I would say is our experience with Yervoy is going be very helpful to us, and with Yervoy we were able to obtain reimbursement broadly in line with label in every one of the key markets, not only in Europe but around the world.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Okay, great. Can we go to the next question, please, Eric?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks for so much taking the questions. So one just direct one on Eliquis first, and then a couple on the immuno-oncology side. For Eliquis, are you seeing or are you anticipating any greater pricing pressure in that market given the recent approval from another competitor in that space from Daiichi? And then in I-O, you mentioned the progress you're making with Yervoy in the community. Can you quantify just what percentage of the use of Yervoy is now in the community versus in academic centers? And then do you think Opdivo's going to have a very different breakdown when we think out a year or two from now, just given the different profiles? And also, for the combination, anything about that being used in the community setting? And is there anything you do to try and mitigate the heavy dropout rates that we saw with the combination? Anything you've learned maybe from what you've done with the combo in lung or in other tumors that could help there? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","Thank you. Let me take the first part of the questions. With respect to access for Eliquis, first of all, there is really strong momentum for Eliquis in the market. We are seeing very significant growth in TRxes and NBRxes. And obviously we've established a leadership position in new-to-brand shares across all indications in cardiology and in atrial fibrillation across the total market. That's important in negotiating with payers.","The second point that I would say is we are in a very strong position from an access perspective. We have over 90% access in both the commercial and Medicare space. On the commercial space, our preferred status is approaching 70%, and in Medicare it's above 80%. So while the category will continue to be managed, and obviously we are very focused on it, the fact that we are emerging as the leading agent in terms of the overall momentum positions us strongly with payers.","With respect to the use of Opdivo and how the uptake is going in the community versus the academic institutions, obviously that's very different in melanoma versus lung, because, as you know, about 50% of melanoma is treated in the hospital and academic setting, and only 50% in the community. When you look at lung, that's very different, with over 80% of patients treated in the community. So while at the beginning it is logical that the uptake is fast in the academic and hospital setting, we are actually seeing with Opdivo already a very significant increase of uptake in community, which is clearly very important, and it makes us feel optimistic about the overall opportunity for Opdivo in the community setting.","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Vamil, let me just \u2013 good morning. Let me just say, of course we are collecting safety across many tumors. It's a lot easier for us, of course, because we have the same dose in all the tumors, so it's much easier for us to compare. I think broadly one would say that the safety is very good across most, if not all, tumors.","And let me just add a little color, actually to David's question about PD-L1 status also in 017 and 057, building on what Giovanni said. Obviously I'm not going to talk about the data, but I just want to reiterate that there are comprehensive analyses both for the broad population and PD-L1 and -positive and negative patients that will be presented at ASCO. And we have to publish it also comprehensively. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Great. Eric, I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. I was hoping you could tell us the one-time impact in the gross margin in the quarter. How much did that impact? And what was your commentary around will it stay for the rest of the year? What is the new gross margin guidance including this? And this goes away this year, and so there'll be no impact next year. Just so we're clear on that. And then, secondly, on HCV in Japan, can you give us a sense of how many patients you have, like, what market share you have over there? And Baraclude OUS, just wondering if the weakness was just FX or if there was anything else going on. Thanks.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Hey, Marc. It's Charlie. So the 400 basis point improvement we had in gross margin, I would characterize two-thirds of that was FX and one-third was the one-time royalty restructuring. We expect, assuming current FX rates, that most of the favorability we had in the first quarter due to FX in our margin will dissipate. So we don't see any further benefit going forward.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Operating Officer and CEO-designate","From the perspective of HCV Japan, let me say the performance has been really strong. Our dual regimen of Sunvepra\/Daklinza we launched in the middle of last year. When we describe the opportunity there, remember there's about 1.2 million patients with hepatitis C in Japan. Of that, 70% are genotype 1b. And we decided to focus initially on the approximately 150,000 patients that are in the healthcare system actively seeking treatment. We've seen really strong commercial execution in Japan. We've seen rapid uptake. And, as you've mentioned, we had approximately $200 million in sales in Japan in the first quarter. When we look at our penetration in terms of our share of the more recent oral regimens, we have the vast majority of the patients there. The largest share we have is in the subset of 150 patients I described before. But we've seen some uptake with new patients coming into the treatment in Japan as well.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Marc, just concluding on your Baraclude question ex-U.S. The sales were down 5% versus prior year if you exclude the FX impact.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Great. Eric, can we go to the last question, please?","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Three questions, please. Firstly, just looking at your 069 trial at AACR, there's obviously some quite considerable toxicity with the combination. Just thinking about your ongoing lung program with the combination, what are the learnings in terms of dose modification, scheduling, patient selection, or monitoring and treatment that can put into place to make a more \u2013 a better-tolerated regimen within the Phase III lung indication? Second, I'd wonder whether you'd comment on anticipated patent term extension for Eliquis, how long it will take you, and, two, and when you will have confirmation of that? And then finally for Francis, if there is no difference in response rates between the PD-L1 positive and negative subgroups in 017, what would that tell you about your diagnostic?","Francis M. Cuss - Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer","Good morning, Andrew. So, first of all, let me just say we believe the combinations do have an added effect. We think that's been shown very nicely in melanoma. And I think they have the potential to meaningfully increase the survival expectations for more patients than monotherapy alone. So I think, obviously, one can't always extrapolate between tumors, either in terms of efficacy or safety \u2013 we've seen differences there \u2013 but we do think underlying this is an opportunity with combination of Opdivo and Yervoy to treat more patients. Clearly, looking at the lung cancer population, we understand that it's a different population, and we think in non-small cell lung cancer, there may be a slightly different tolerability.","That being said, we've learned a lot from the ongoing combination studies together with the second-line studies. And so we really think the first-line combination study that's about to start really does have a good chance of understanding the potential of combination in lung cancer.","As far as the 017 study and the assay, let me just say that I think our assay is a good assay. It's validated. It's ready to go in terms of the need for approval or labeling. And you'll have the opportunity to see the data, which is very strong, I think, across 017 and 057 in terms of documenting the different patient populations.","Lamberto Andreotti - Chief Executive Officer","But we're not going to provide any comment on patent term extensions for Eliquis.","And I will close this call by thanking everybody for participating. We had a strong performance in the first quarter across much of our portfolio, and we had important clinical and regulatory development. Bristol-Myers Squibb is stronger than ever. Thank you. And have a good day.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations","Okay, everybody. Thank you. As always, Ranya and Bill and I are available for any follow-ups you might have. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

We have a lot to discuss today, so let me share an overview of the call. As you have seen, we have made an exciting announcement this morning, on our Lung Cancer Program. We consider today\u2019s results as a break-through in cancer research, and we are excited for what this means for patients and for the treatment of lung cancer. These results is a through example of the innovation that its core to our strategy. Based on our understanding of this disease, we made bold and innovative changes to our program as the science of all. Today\u2019s results validate our approach. I am really proud, of what our R&D organization has accomplished, to advance the understanding of biomarkers, in the treatment of lung cancer. And Tom will walk you through the details in a few minutes. ","We also announced, a very good quarter there and strong performance overall in 2017, which Charlie will share in more detail.","From my perspective, we are starting 2018 with good momentum in our business and we see number opportunities in oncology and outside of oncology that we will be focusing on this year. And as I started to discuss in San Francisco last month, looking beyond 2018, there are multiple growth drivers, that position us well for the longer term. I\u2019ll talk more about this, a little later in the call. And with that I\u2019ll handed it over to Tom, to discuss today\u2019s announcement. Tom?","Thomas Lynch","Thank you, Giovanni. If I could ask everyone to turn to slide six. Today we are excited, to announce the Study 227, met the co-primary endpoint, of improved progression free survival for the Opdivo Yervoy combination versus chemotherapy, for patients with high tumor mutational burden, or TMB, regardless of PD-L1 expression. And remember, that we're looking at both pathologies in CheckMate-227. And as we also announced, the DMC has recommended that the trial continue to completion for overall survival in a PD-L1 selected population in Part 1A. While we planned to present the results in upcoming medical meeting, what I can tell you now is that this PFS data is highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful. I strong believe that this will make a difference for patients with advanced lung cancer. ","Let's just put this into context. When I first began seeing one cancer patient 30 years ago, the only options were chemotherapy and radiation, both marginally effective and significantly toxic. Since then, lung cancer has become a group of related diseases defined by distinct biomarkers that brought biology and treatment. EFGR, ALK, ROS1, RET and PD-L1 just to name a few. Today we add TMB to this list to define a subtype of patients who clearly drive benefit from combination immunotherapy treatment regardless of their PD-L1 status. As I've consistently said, Bristol-Myers Squibb is a science driven company. These results demonstrate the strength and importance of our translational capabilities and validate the innovative changes we made to the trial design in light of how quickly the science was evolving. ","Perhaps most importantly, the results today further validate the role of the CTLA-4 mechanism. Lung cancer is now the third tumor where we've showed benefit with the Opdivo-Yervoy combination in a randomized trial. And we look forward to the overall survival analysis from 227 as the data matures in the TMB population. ","Now if I could ask you to turn to slide 7. What I'd like to do is tell you or answer the question, why do we choose to include TMB in our analysis plan. First from a machinist perspective, TMB measures the number of somatic mutations that are present in the DNA of a tumor compared to the DNA of normal tissue. We believe some of these mutations can drive expressions of neoantigens. And then these new neoantigens could be more visible to immune system and thereby driven an immune response. ","Second as you know for Bristol-Myers others have generated data showing improved outcomes for patients with high TMB. We've shown this across multiple endpoints, and those includes response rate PFS and overall survival across multiple tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer and small cell. And we've shown this for both Opdivo monotherapy and the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. This support our hypothesis around TMB being an important potential biomarker. ","Now if I could ask you to turn to slide 8. Now let me take a step back and explain how we adapted 227? On this slide, you see the overall study design. As you know 227 was originally designed as two companion studies. Part 1A looking at PD-L1 expressers, and part 1B looking at PD-L1 non-expressers. ","As more data emerge we made three important changes to 227 to reflect the evolving science all of these were key. First, we increased the size of Part 1A, this gave us more statistical optionality and lowered the potential for imbalances in the PDL-1 positive patients. Second, we added the second part, part 2 to 227. This is a study of about 750 patients who are enrolled regardless of histology and across the PDL-1 spectrum comparing Opdivo plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. And the third change we made was to our analysis planned for part-1 which allowed us to include TMB. I will disclose in details of that today. ","Now if could ask you turn to slide 9. As I mentioned, part-1A and part-1B are technically two companion trials running at the same time. However, in discussions with the FDA we executed and integrated analysis planned but brought together the Opdivo, Yervoy arms and the chemo arms across all of part 1 in a predefined population of TMB patients.","Turn to slide 10 please. Within that integrated analysis planned, we defined two co-primary endpoints across part-1 and that is what we\u2019re reporting today. The first is comparing the combination of Opdivo Yervoy versus chemotherapy for PFS in a PMB selected population. And the second is comparing the combination versus chemotherapy for overall survival is a PDL-1 selective population. ","If I could as you know to turn to slide 11. Through the PFS endpoint, we were able to access the TMB status of the majority of patients across Part-1 which I\u2019ll remind you is more than 1,200 patients, actually its more than 1,700 patients. And here you can see that of all those assessed roughly 45% or above a cut-off upgraded in 10 mutations per mega base which is what we defined as high TMB. In our study, TMB was evaluated using foundation medicine analytically validated assays foundation one. Now I ask if you could turn to slide 12. ","We\u2019re very encouraged by today\u2019s results which establish TMB as an important new independent biomarker for selecting patients that respond to immunotherapy. Clearly, we\u2019ll be sharing these data with health authorities and we look forward to presenting the complete results at the future Congress. ","We believe TMB could be important more broadly. We started to incorporate it across our IO trials not just for Opdivo and Yervoy but also far for our next generation oncology assets. In fact, we\u2019re studying TMB in over 100 studies in multiple tumor types and programs. If we could now turn to slide 13.","As a reminder, what we\u2019re reporting today is just the first of many significant data opportunities from our broad long program. For CM-227, the analysis for patients from Part-1 B is now finally complete. Part-1A continues for overall survival, in PDL-1 patients remember that the overall survival is event driven. In know that the interim occurred later than we expected and we anticipate that the final results will be later this year or early next year. And part-2 of the trial is ongoing which we don\u2019t expect in 2019. ","I also remind you that the 9LA trial, looking at Opdivo plus Yervoy concurrent with two cycles of chemotherapy is also ongoing, with results expected in the second half, of 2019. And of course, we have the initiation of our IDO, Opdivo combination trials, with both insights IDO and our own compound which we are eagerly are waiting to see. ","I could now ask you to turn to slide 14. Beyond lung cancer, we have significant data milestones, with Opdivo in the combination over the next 24 months, with trials reading out in hepatoma, gastric cancer, small-cell lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. ","As I had said, we are a science driven biopharma company. I am particularly excited about our opportunities across the areas of neuro science, fibrosis and cardiovascular disease, and we continue to accelerate the development of our most promising assets in those areas, as well as immuno-oncology. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Giovanni. ","Giovanni Caforio ","Thank you, Tom. I want to reiterate that I am really proud, of what our organization has accomplished. This is an important result for lung cancer patients and we are very excited by the opportunity ahead of us. ","Turning to slide 16 please. 2017 was a very strong year, thanks to strong superior commercial execution and good progress in our clinical programs. We are now entering 2018, with good trends and momentum in our business. ","Moving to slide 17. We are starting the year, in a very strong position, with good top and bottom line growth, in our business. There are a number of pillars in our business, that can grow in 2018 and beyond and I am really excited about the prospects. First, Eliquis is a very important and growing franchise for us. As we exit 2017, Eliquis is the leading NOAC and its approved indications, and has tremendous opportunity to continue to grow. ","With Opdivo, the existing business going into 2018 has a strong momentum. We see continued strength across the current indications for Opdivo and beyond our excitement about the First-Line Lung, results announced today. We have a number of opportunities this year, that we are focused on, including adjuvant melanoma and the upcoming PDUFA for First-Line renal, with study 214. ","With today\u2019s results, I even more confident, that we will play a meaningful role in first-line lung cancer, and I am looking forward to continue data readouts later this year and into next year, that will build on today\u2019s announcements. And thinking beyond the 2018, we see a sustained - of growth, driven by important opportunities for Eliquis and Opdivo. So, let me remind you, of what those are.","I previously mentioned Reno, as part of our growth in 2018, and it also plays a role beyond this year, in what we see as a significant opportunity for Opdivo. It's an area where we started to make a difference in second-line and see significant growth potential in first-line now, based on study 214. With the first-line indication, Opdivo will have a presence across the continuum of care in renal cancer. ","Two other areas, with a billion dollar plus potential, where we are focused, our gastric cancer and HCC. Diseases with high unmet need and poor outcomes. Based on what we have seen from Phase 1 and 2 data on opdivo on these tumors, and anticipating data readouts from our Phase 3 program this year and next year, we believe these are important areas driving growth in the near and in the medium term. In addition to this, we have important opportunities in small-cell lung cancer later this year and head and neck in 2019. ","Finally, our emerging pipeline across all therapeutic areas is one of the most promising in our history with several opportunities contributing to sustained growth. We are excited with several programs moving forward, such as IDO and LAG-3 in oncology and from our non-oncology pipeline, where we'll see FGF21 and TYK-2 moving to the next stage of development this year. All of what I just described gives me confidence in our future, and in our ability to continue to deliver on our strategy. The significant opportunities are ahead of us requires to ensure the right level of investment behind R&D and certain commercial capabilities, and we are doing just that. ","And turning to slide 18 please. A year ago, I spoke about the work we were doing to evolve our operating model. And today, I'm pleased to say we are delivering across the company, with a disciplined approach to resource allocation. We are creating a better company, which moves fast and is more competitive. We are strengthening our capabilities, particularly in translational medicine, and we are investing in our pipeline and commercial capabilities to support future growth. These will continue to be a critical focus going forward. ","With that, I'll hand it over to Charlie Bancroft, who will discuss some specifics on the quarter and how we are thinking about our financials. ","Charlie Bancroft","Thank you, Giovanni and Tom, for your very exciting comments, all tapped off from my Philadelphia Eagles winning the Superball. ","Let me start by saying, we delivered a very good 2017 with robust revenue and earnings growth, driven by strong execution across the company. ","Moving to slide 20. While total revenues grew 7% for the year, and our prioritized brands were up 27% as Giovanni just highlighted. The exceptional product performance on key brands drove the EPS growth. ","With that, I'll provide some color on the strong trends we are seeing Opdivo. It was another solid quarter for our Opdivo franchise. We delivered $1.4 billion of worldwide revenue and almost $5 billion in sales on a full year basis. Similar to previous quarters, we were successful in maintaining our leading share in second line lung and saw strong performance in other tumors such as renal cell. While the trends are early, Opdivo has rapidly penetrated the second line HCC market and we are seeing good uptake of Opdivo in the adjuvant melanoma setting. ","Outside the U.S., Opdivo continues to lead in key markets such as Germany, France and Japan. Excluding the sales deferral impacting Q4 of 2016 international sales of Opdivo were up over 64% in the quarter. With these strong Opdivo trends in today's announcement, we see meaningful opportunities for growth in both the near and medium term. ","Turning to Yervoy. We are seeing pressure on U.S. sales due to the adoption of Opdivo in the adjuvant melanoma setting. Going forward, we expect these trends to stabilize and our outlook remains positive with the potential launches in the first line renal cell and first line lung. From the franchise perspective, we expect the growth of Opdivo in adjuvant melanoma were more than offset the erosion of Yervoy. Our strong commercial execution across the portfolio also resulted in substantial growth for -- in the quarter. In the U.S., Eliquis extended its leadership position with almost 50% TRx share of the NOAC market. Internationally, we are seeing similar trends and strong brand momentum in leading new-to-brand share in top European markets. With this performance in mind, we believe Eliquis is well positioned for period of sustained growth going forward. ","Now turning to slide 21 and our non-GAAP P&L. I\u2019ll start with our gross margin which continues to be strongly influenced by product mix. The strong growth of Eliquis and declining of virology franchise erode most of pressure on our margin in the quarter. ","Moving to OpEx and building on Giovanni\u2019s comments about resource allocation, the increased investment in R&D during 2017 while prioritizing spend in MS&A. This was enabled by our ongoing operating model evolution that we will continue to execute going forward. ","With respect to our tax rate, the favorability in the quarter was primarily driven by earnings mix. And thinking longer term and taking into account tax reform we expect our tax rate to be in high teens within the coming years. With tax reform in mind, turning to slide 22 we see no change to our balanced approach to capital allocation. ","Business development remains a top priority for us and 2017 was a very active in which we executed over 50 transactions. We expanded our translational capabilities, we licensed new assets and technologies and we entered several late stage clinical collaborations. The ISM acquisition are partnership with Foundation Medicine and our new relationship with Halazyme were few important examples of transactions we executed last year. ","We also remain committed to our dividend, 2018 marks a ninth consecutive annual increase. With respect to repurchase, we bought back 250 million in the quarter and nearly 2.5 billion for the year. Taking together we returned over 5 billion to shareholders in 2017. ","Turning to slide 23 for additional color around 2018 guidance. Our full year and non-GAAP EPS guidance represent strong growth over 2017 in spite of the roughly $200 million impact from the change in accounting rules effecting how certain royalties are recorded. On gross margin, we expect additional pressure to be driven by the continued growth of Eliquis and erosion of virology to be somewhat offset by the growth of Opdivo.","Our approach on OpEx reflects the continued prioritization in R&D while we drive efficiencies in MS&A. In conjunction with today\u2019s announcement, our guidance includes investments supporting the educational efforts to commercialize TMB. ","A quick note on OI&E. We have restructured a portion of our future AV royalty rights and therefore will receive higher royalties in 2018 and 2019. Our tax rate of 20 to 21% takes into account tax reform and as I mentioned the potential for further favorability over the next few years. ","In conclusion, we have a very solid 2017 with strong execution across the board. We are well positioned to grow in 2018 and today\u2019s announcement increases our conviction in the growth outlook for the company. I\u2019ll now turn it back to John for Q&A.","John Elicker","Thanks Charles and I think we\u2019re ready to go to the Q&A session. So as a reminder we have Giovanni as well as Murdo here for any of your questions. Go ahead please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from the queue, Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","John Elicker","Seamus, we can\u2019t hear you. ","Operator","Sorry, Alex Arfaei from Bank of Montreal Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is now open. ","Alex Arfaei","Good morning, thank you very much for taking the questions and congratulations on the results. I am just curious, why is overall survival is not being evaluated, based on TMB as well. And we know from CheckMate-26 that Opdivo monotherapy showed very encouraging results in this setting. How come opdivo monotherapy is also not being included in the TMB analysis? Thank you very much. ","Thomas Lynch","Alex, thank you. I\u2019ll take both of these questions, and I think let me just take the second one, I can do the second one probably quicker, than we will talk a little bit about the end points in the first one. So, just to remind everybody, what we were reporting today are the two co-primary endpoints, so we are reporting the PFS in the combination a therapy, which is a co-primary endpoint in TMB high group and there we\u2019re reporting the fact that the second co-primary endpoint which is the test for overall survival in the PL-1 group is continuing for maturity. ","We have not seen any overall survival data, I think that\u2019s very important to mention. So, we have not seen any overall survival data. The second thing to say, is we are not going to be reporting any secondary endpoints on the call. The data is very fresh to us, we look forward to reporting those in important medical meeting and we also look forward to publishing that as soon as we possibly can. ","Let me just say a few things about endpoints and trials. So, a couple of things. I think as a physician we think that, that I think that PFS and overall survival are both important endpoint, doctors use both endpoints, PFS and OS, be able to make decisions. I\u2019ll also say, when you have PFS particularly in a very large well powered trial, you are able to, to get a very good sense of potential benefit and that does predict for good benefits with patients, whom are very encouraged by the PFS spend its today, that we see in the TMB population. ","I really want to stress something else about this result. This is highly statically significant and its clinically significant as well. I think that\u2019s an important point to drive home with the PFS, we look forward to seeing the OS data, when it matures, in the TMB group, just like I am sure you are excited about seeing it and we think that that\u2019ll be something that will also be important for doctors in terms of making decisions. ","I also want to stress one another point Alex, is this was across all PD-L1 expressing groups, and I think, one of the other things, we think is important, is that you know right now, PD-L1 is important decision-making factor for doctors, when deciding, how to treat people with lung cancer, and there are some people who are not getting, immunotherapy because their PD-L1 negative. ","I think what TMB gives us, is the opportunity to identify patients, who clearly benefit from low dose - added to opdivo in that setting, we could not be more excited to tell you about that today. ","Operator","Thank you, and now we take our next question from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink. Please go ahead, your line is now open. ","Seamus Fernandez","Okay great. Some problem with my phone system here. Well, first of on the eco the sentiment on the eagles from so what of you said, in Boston, it was a unique event. So, thanks for that comment there, Charlie. ","Second, in terms of the difference in the study design. Congratulations on the creative change to incorporate TMB. Just hoping that you could just give us a little bit of color on whether or not do you guys have a relatively complete understanding of the benefits of the combination over Opdivo monotherapy? I know that you did comment a little bit on that on the margin, but the clinical significance, is the clinical significance applied more to TMB and the analysis therein or the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy? ","And then secondarily, as we think about the longer-term opportunities Giovanni. Just hopping that you guys could give us a little bit color on how you're feeling about the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination as a continuous treatment given some of the safety concerns or at least the safety information that we're seeing out there? Again, the significance I think is clear, but we're just trying to get a better sense of directionally how confidence you are that the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen particularly as a continuous combination therapy after 6-week treatment dynamic is something that you think is going to really work its way into the lung cancer regimen overtime? Thanks. ","Charlie Bancroft","I've got to say as a Patriots fan, die hard Patriots in the sea of Eagles fans here, it's been a rough morning. If we didn't have 227 reports, I don't think I get through it. So, let me just address a couple of your points here that I think are well crafted and are important. The first thing I'll say is that I feel very confident that this is both a TMB story and an Opdivo-Yervoy story. And I think both are important. Because first, understanding the biology, selecting the patients are going to benefit most. TMB looks like a very powerful biomarker. And as I mentioned, we're looking at across our spectrum of IL agents including our next-gen agents. ","The second point comes down to the contribution of components and how important Yervoy is? And for me, I have felt for some time that Yervoy is performing extremely well in a number of different settings. Remember, benefit in melanoma, benefit in renal cell cancer and now benefit in this case, in non-small cell lung cancer it can be high. And what I can tell you is that our analysis of the data thus far makes us very confident that Yervoy is a big part of what we're seeing today. And it's not just Opdivo, but the Yervoy is part of this as well. And I want to mention as you said, its low dose Yervoy that's given every 6 weeks and has that advantage in terms of being well tolerated by patients as we move forward. So, I think that it's not just TMB or the combo it really is a story about both and I'll turn it over to Giovanni for his thoughts. ","Giovanni Caforio","So, I just had a couple of comments. So first of all, I want to strength again, reinforce what Tom was saying about the importance of the combination about Opdivo and Yervoy. This is the third tumor type, in which we have seen data that makes us really excited about the potential of this combination, melanoma, renal now, non-small cell lung cancer. ","The second thing that I want to say is that I'm quite proud actually of the work that we've done in optimizing the regimen and I think that's really important, the dose and schedule of the Yervoy as part of the combination are really important. Based on the totality of the data that we have seen so far you know our confidence and our broadline cancer program has only increased. And I think that\u2019s important because in parallel it also strengthens overall the growth outlook for the company. So obviously it starts with patients but I think this is a really important time for the company overall as well. ","Operator","Thank you. And now we\u2019ll take our next question Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is now open. ","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Just a couple of questions, maybe please first if you can address the commercial implications of TMB, just curious what payers KOL doctors are saying about TMB. I know this is new and exciting but how typical is this in their practice. And if you could talk about the size of frontline loan market effected by patients with high TMB, your press release said that 45% of patients expect high TMB but is that 45% of the total market, or is that 45% of a share of the market and I ask because we go back and look at CheckMate-26, I think you evaluated 60 of the population. So, if you could put that into perspective. ","And then just lastly, maybe for you Tom, how confident are you now in hitting overall survival and for part 1A of the study and did I hear you right? I think earlier you did say that in the earlier question that you would also look at OS and TMB although I wasn\u2019t clear and then just lastly is this highly registrational trial? Thanks very much and congratulations.","Giovanni Caforio ","Thanks Jennie. First of all, I\u2019m also excited that we were able to announce what we\u2019ve been able to do today, clearly following the science and looking at tumor mutational burden as a biomarker has been the right scientific approach in first line lung cancer and congratulations to Tom and his team for being to deliver on that. ","We are also commercially and medically are very excited about TMB. It appears to be a highly predictive biomarker, as you know it's the foundation 1 test recently was recently FDA approved. And in parallel to that FDA approval, they are pursuing a national coverage determination for CMS Medicare coverage and reimbursement of that test upon indication as companion diagnostics. ","So, we\u2019re very, very excited about that and in terms of size of the front-line lung cancer population, clearly you know the design of 227, we designed this trial to exclude ALK- and EGFR positive patients. So, the 45% number applies to the TMB patients that were tested in the trial. ","And I think you alluded to the ascertainment rate while it was 60% in the trial, we have a lot of confidence that that will rise with improvements to methodologies, pathology techniques as well as surgical techniques. So, we\u2019re hopeful that, that will improve overtime and I would say that we\u2019re very ready for this, the team at Bristol-Myers Squibb has been focused on the translational side but also on helping educate physicians. I would say in the academic centers, there is a high degree of awareness of TMB and there is already quite substantial testing today. I would say it gets much lower than that when you go out into community oncology and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focusing a lot of our educational and continuing research efforts. We have an ongoing safety clinical trial in first line lung cancer looking at patients with Opdivo and low dose Yervoy being treated after having their TMB accessed. And that\u2019s being conducted through our I-O icon network, we have a great partnership with a large network in community oncology, so it will help to be able to generate data and describe the safety profile of the drug, on a must larger community base population. And then of course as we pursue regulatory approval, the commercial organization will be ready to focus on a number of different important audiences inclusive of the ones you mentioned. ","Lastly, I would say from a payer perspective, this is very positive event. I think both clinicians and payers have been looking for a better way, to segment the first-line lung cancer market and I think with the advent and exciting information that we have, that we hope will be presented as Tom said, at an upcoming Scientific Congress and publish thereafter. We hope that we will be able to go to payers in the U.S and around the world and say, this is a patient population that discretely benefits from Yervoy, low dose Yervoy plus Opdivo. So, we are very excited about that in commercial ramp. Thanks ","Thomas Lynch","So, - I mean just eco something which Giovanni said, I think when you have a data set like this, which is highly statically significant and most importantly, probably more importantly, clinically meaningful, I think that does increase our confidence in a number of different elements of our entire lung cancer program, not just study 227, remember f we have got study 9LA, which is coming after this via part 2, which will only chemo combo and then we have our IDO studies. So, I think that\u2019s an important finding today. ","I think the second thing you asked is about whether we were looking at OS and TMB and as I mentioned earlier, we will be looking at overall survival and TMB as you know, that\u2019s event driven and, when the data matures, we look forward to sharing them broadly at that point. ","I think the second question you asked is about our confidence in hitting overall survival in part 1, as you know, we have not seen any overall survival data. The hurdle for stopping the study early is usually extremely high and again its event driven and we look forward to seeing that data when the required number events occur at that point. ","And your final question came down of a - do we look at this data as registrational. I think as we said earlier, we are eager to share this information with regulators in the United States and in the EU, because I think Murdo put it very nicely. We think this is going to make a big difference for doctors and for patients, and as someone who's treated lung cancer for 30 years, to me this kind of data is the kind of data the doctors are asking for, they want to be able to know which patients are going to benefit and I think it's going to have the opportunity to really change the way we think about non-small cell lung cancer. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum, from Citi, please go ahead, your line is now open. ","Andrew Baum","Thank you and congratulations. Three questions please. Obviously, we are operating in the dark so, we haven\u2019t seen the 189 or 227 or the mono data from GT-7 but with that in mind, three questions. ","Number one, is it going to be the enemy of the great care? And what I mean by that is the low friction associated with Keytruda chemo problematic in persuading clinicians to adopt the more expensive and arguably more toxic therapy which requires educational support. ","And then along the same lines of that, in terms of friction, you mentioned the need for continued education but also there is a 12-day turnaround for TMB, to what extent can that be addressed and how quickly can we migrate to quickly can we migrate to the liquid TMB assets here. ","And then the last question is in terms of cut off, which picked up on one of Tom's points about the relevance of TMB to identify patient populations and other indications. Do you have a firm sense that this cutoff is transferred across indications exactly which is much apparent decision and as anything driven by science in terms of identifiable number? There is that consistency here or is it going to be around the indication-by-indication basis. Many thanks and congratulations again. ","Giovanni Caforio ","Why don't you start with commercial and Tom can go?","Charlie Bancroft","Yeah, thanks Andrew. I think the way I would approach my view of the first line lung cancer market is, we've known for a while that PD-L1 expression has been a perfect biomarker in being able to stratify and select patients. Now with this very large dataset, we've been able to establish the value of a high predictive biomarker in TMB. And we have a compelling profile of Opdivo plus low dose Yervoy as a result. And I think that that really is an opportunity for us to redefine the way in which clinicians, payers and patients think about first line lung cancer. So, we're excited about that. ","I think there will still be a role for PD-L1 expression to play to understand where other options and other treatment modalities should be used. But I think the compelling nature of these data and the predictive nature of TMB will allow us to establish a very good presence in the market. I would also say that the partnership with Foundation Medicine has been a good one for us. We're working very closely with them to understand the logistics of how TMB testing and patterns of testing are currently occurring. I would say that academic centers are doing very well in turnaround time and tissue ascertainment. ","And I think that that will propagate into the community. It will take some time and obviously when physicians see a very compelling clinical profile, I think that that is likely to lead to an acceleration and testing and an improvement in turnaround times. Although, our hope is that we would establish testing for TMB as a panel type of test as a test that occurs early in the diagnosis of a patient so that it is available to the primary treating physician early in that treatment decision making process. And that's our goal really going forward. So, the turnaround time today will hopefully not be an impediment as we go forward. For the liquid biopsy question, I'll turn it back to Tom. ","Thomas Lynch","I think one of the things that I would start off by saying is that, I'm incredibly proud of our translational capability as Giovanni mentioned in his remarks and how we approach this. Let me give you a little sense of how we got to a cutoff of 10 for TMB. What we gave as we looked at number of studies that we have done in lung cancer. We look to study 12, study 568, we look to study 26. And then we've looked at different cut points of the tumor mutational burden that were able to best segregate outcomes and best to get for who is what have better response and better benefit than others. And we are why at a cutpoint of 10. Now I have to say, let's stress something else. This is very early in the understanding of this biomarker, this is the first important report of it applied to a randomized trial. As I remember, this is a prospective analysis that we did using our archival tissue, but it was the analysis itself was a perspective and I think that's important to keep in mind. ","I think you have to think about other biomarkers. Look at how we understand how to use receptant in patients with breast cancer. You know is it two plus or was it three plus and it became understanding that amplification was the key issue and so it really is early in the process and while I think data, I\u2019ve seen that 10 is going to be the number, I hope 10 is going to be the number forever, can I promise you that someday we\u2019re not going to file up the numbers really 8 or 12 and as other companies and other investigators look at this in their data sets might we learn more, absolutely and I remain open to collaborating across investigators in that respect. ","I think the second thing about the test that\u2019s important, is this is the highly validated test while the number might be something with time that might get adjusted for indication by indication. The test itself is highly validated and on November 30 at 2017 it was actually approved by the FDA. ","So, while we need to work with foundation on the companion diagnostic indications, we\u2019ll obviously work with them in the FDA at that point. The test itself is solid and we feel very good about that. And that brings us to the last question we ask which is when do we think blood-based assays will come in and I think there was great promise for blood base assays and I think that will make this process much easier for patients. On the other hand, we don\u2019t quite haven\u2019t yet, we\u2019re closed. And again, we look forward to working with the number of diagnostic companies that have insight into how we can create better ways of looking at TMB. ","What I can tell you today is I think that our findings in study 227 may increase the imperative and the urgency of coming up with better ways and assessing TMB and I think blood base biomarkers will be one of them. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is now open. ","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much for the questions and congrats on the data. Just the question on this TMB data set and the competitive landscape in front line. When you consider the other data sets from these all all-comer chemo combos data sets out there, what sort of hurdle that you consider as you think about the commercial kind of opportunity here. Basically, do we need to see improved hazard ratios in this TMB population relative to some of those overall competitor data sets for chemo combo data sets that you talked about here to see physicians adopt or do you think it's really a debate here of some physicians preferring, kind of IO-IO versus IO-chemo. So just trying to get a little bit of sense, how you\u2019re thinking about that. My second quarter we\u2019re just clarifying earlier comments on filing. I guess do you think there is a potential pathway to file this data earlier than lead 2018 2019 read-out from the OS arm of the 18 study. I\u2019m sure you understand a little bit on the filing dynamics there. Thanks so much. ","Giovanni Caforio ","Let me start and then I\u2019ll ask Murdo and Tom to jump in. So first of all, the progression free survival was the core primary end point of this study and so given the strength of the data as Tom mentioned we will discuss that with regulatory authorities but that was the core primary endpoint of the trial and in the TMB part of the study is the data is, that data is mature and ready. ","With respect to your question about competitiveness, I think what\u2019s important here obviously Tom has said many times and we believe that lung cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, is a very broad set of disease. In fact, you know 30% of it is treated by physicians in the academic and hospital setting, up to 70% is there in the community. ","So, it's obvious that depending on competitive data set and our data that we\u2019ll always be physician preferences in patient profiles that are more indicate different treatment options. But I think what\u2019s important here, is the ability to identify a patient population that is, that has potential to respond to treatment strategy with the regiment of Opdivo plus Yervoy, what\u2019s also important here, is the ability to identify patients that are not likely respond and both are really critical, so I think the biomarker here is very important, it identifies the population of patients that should be treated in our mind, based on the data, with Opdivo plus Yervoy, and it also helps to define which patient actually made that, which patients may benefit from a different treatment their strategy. Because it is clear that for patients with low TMB going for a combination of immuno-oncology agents may not be the right strategy. So, I think there is clearly room in this market for most evolve treatment strategies, but the data is very compelling. ","Murdo Gordon","Yeah, thanks Giovanni, I would also eco the way the market is right now. There is lot a lot of questions on the mind of treating physicians on what to do in lower PD-L1 expressing patients, in terms of treatment options available. We know what the - 21 G-set dataset, we haven\u2019t as you mentioned seen the 189 datasets, but there is still a lot of patients in the market who have low PD-L1 expressions, who are not receiving an immunotherapy options. With the TMB in biomarker, we are able to look across all PD1 expression and in rich for a population with TMB and we have been able to in this clinical trial demonstrate a benefit in PFS with Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy and I think that\u2019s a very compelling treatment option for clinicians going forward. ","The combination of PD-L1 and TMB makers to also be as Giovanni said, a very useful way to select patients out of immune checkpoint inhibition, but given the very broad program that we have with 227 and other clinical trials that Thomas described, we will be able to answer many more of those questions going forward and I am excited about that, I think that over the next year and a half, two years, we will be able to help physicians out there understand exactly when and where to use, what treatment option and I am also pleased that we are developing all of those treatments options within our own portfolio.","Thomas Lynch","Now I just think I eco those two, one of those two comments and again I think that I look at this as being data that we eagerly look forward to sharing with the regulatory agencies, and I think that\u2019s answers your question, about how we are going to proceed. ","Operator","Thank you, the next question comes from Tim Anderson, from Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is now open. ","Tim Anderson","Thank you. I just want to stay on those, is your filability of this data. So, you know Bristol, sort of commonly said that PFS is an imperfect predictor of OS. And I think we have seen that in certain datasets overtime by different companies, including Bristol. ","And if I think about TMB in O26 at least, what was published as a later analysis on OS, there wasn\u2019t -- there is a big PFS benefit looking at TMB fabrication but there wasn\u2019t much of an OS benefit. And if I -- Tom, you kind of said, we\u2019re early in our understanding of TMB as a biomarker. So, without having OS data, I am still struggling to see how this is data that FDA were accept for approval essentially. ","And if you could maybe just clarify your comments earlier on the biomarker saying, we're very early in our understanding, but at the same time you're saying it's very validated. So maybe that's just the technical point about validation. And the last question is have you seen in the Opdivo monotherapy data out of 227 such that you can put Opdivo plus Yervoy in the context?","Thomas Lynch","So, Tim, thank you. Let me just I can answer the second question really quickly. And that, as I mentioned today, we're commenting on the two coprimary endpoints. And there are number of secondary endpoints in the study and we look forward to sharing those at in upcoming medical meeting and publishing those and going over those in detail. ","So, to your first question which again, thank you for the chance to clarify my answer to Andrew's question earlier. What I'm saying we're early in the understanding of TMB. I'm not saying that we're early in understanding how to measure it in the validity of measuring it. So, the foundation one test has been highly validated and it's been FDA approved as a test, meaning, when you test somebody's tumor for TMB, that answer you're going to get is reproducible and is meaningful in terms of being a validated test. This is not a test that's does not have their vigor of other areas. When I was responding to Andrew's question on the question of the cutoff. Could the cutoff be different in a different cancer type of different tumor type sure could. We don't have another data yet, as I mentioned you were looking at TMB in more than 100 different studies that we're doing. And is it possible that we'll possible the TMB for colorectal cancer might be different of pancreas cancer might be different or gastric cancer might be different, it might be. And that's what it ends up by saying we're early into the, not that we're early in this scenario of 227. So, I think that's important. ","The second question comes down to PFS versus OS. Now as you know, many many drugs have been approved based on PFS, in fact our own 067 experience. And Melanoma was approved first based on PFS before we have the OS data. And as you also know Tim, frequently almost always, PFS data comes before OS data comes, not always but often it comes before that in the setting. ","And we look forward to seeing the OS data on this trial, we have not as I mentioned to you, we have not seen any overall survival data from 227 yet. And we have as much curiosity as you about this. What I will say is that one of the things doctors do as when I look at a study with the size and robustness of this trial, this was a total number of patients on study 227 is nearly 2400-2500 patients. ","And so, it's a large trial with the result which is highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful. And in that setting, I believe particularly what's meeting an unmet medical need. When there are patients out there who are not getting IL therapy that we have excellent data for now that shows can benefit from IL therapy I think that's a very compelling case for why this matters. ","Operator","Next question comes from Jeffrey Holford from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. ","Jeffrey Holford","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So just three quick here. I don't know if you going to be observe anything now about PD-L1 spaces. I assume that's going to be subgroup analysis to this, within this I remember that when we look to CheckMate-2060 high TMB PD-L1 greater than 50%. It was a stunning result there and maybe perhaps what we\u2019re going to be looking at here is something like breast cancer where I think physicians are more than 2 points on a matrix like node status and hormone receptor status. Perhaps it could be tumor patient burden and PD-L1 status that really drives these as a combo. So maybe some comments on that.","Second do you think the rationale for tumor mutation burden also works in chemo combo and triple combo with Opdivo- Yervoy chemo, there is no reason why that rationale shouldn\u2019t work just as well.","And then last, few questions about the file-ability of this data here. Do you not think that the Keynote-21 G approval acts as a strong president for file-ability here? Thank you. ","Thomas Lynch","So, let\u2019s take this a little bit by in order. So first I think Jeff your comment about PL-1 status in TMB the interactions between the two I think is a very interesting one, we just got this data, so we look forward to looking at that and looking at many of the other potential understanding and relationships we can have once we have some time with the data to take a look at that but I do think there is a possibility that, that might help to find a population that might benefit. ","I think one thing Murdo said earlier and Giovanni echoed as well what I think is really important which is you could imagine a scenario where a combination of biomarkers be the PDL-1 and TMB, good to find patients who do not benefit from IO agents at all. And might say these are patients we should treat with another type of experimental therapy or chemotherapy in that setting. So, I share your enthusiasm for looking at that interaction between the two biomarkers as well will look at the interaction among all the biomarkers that we look at in lung cancer. ","Second point you rate Jeff is a question of rationalizing -- whether TMB will hold with chemo. Again, as I mentioned we\u2019re looking at this in more than 100 different scenarios and again we just haven\u2019t seen data yet in that setting and we look forward to seeing that because I think that will add more color to the patients and how the patients benefit in that setting. ","And then the final question of file-ability, as you know we don\u2019t comment on our relationships or actual discussions with the FDA and we certainly don\u2019t comment on the strategy the other companies might have used in getting their trials approved. ","What I will say is that we do look forward to sitting down with the FDA and the EMA and sharing with them this data set because we think it is the potential to be a highly significant for patients. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is coming Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead your line is now open.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. John, I figured everyone else is asking multiple, so I\u2019ll ask multiple today as well. First, I guess the first and the main question I have is I just wanted to understand how you guys went about changing the stat plan, like what informed that decision and specifically what informed these specific sets of changes that lets pool the part-1A, part-1B let\u2019s put only PFS but not OS and TMB positives. Just curious about that, one. ","Secondly, I know the slides say the CTLA force rolled is 'validated', I was just curious if you could explain how and presumably you\u2019ve seen the PFS curves on combo versus mono and TMB high as well. ","And then finally I noticed foundation medicine defines high TMB as 20 mutations per megabit. I mean granted all that is still in flux, and I know you guys are using 10 mutations per megabit. So, I guess my question is how does your data look for combo versus chemo in 10 to 19 mutations per megabit versus 20 plus mutations per megabit and I only ask because EMA has been doing some of this in prior regulatory reviews. For [indiscernible]. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio ","So Umer, thank you for your questions. So, I\u2019ll start off with the first one, which is how did we change the stat plan, and why do we change the step plan. And so just to give you a sense, the data in lung cancer has been developing an emerging incredibly quickly. And this -- the way -- our understanding of the biology of lung cancer has improved. So, we look the study 26 and I don\u2019t know if you guys noticed, but 26 didn\u2019t exactly hit what we were hoping for in that setting. So, we looked at in great detail about why, didn\u2019t it work and what were the differences and let\u2019s do a whole excellent sequencing of our patients on study 26 to be able to look in great detail, to understand what about our patient population might have been different. ","And it was -- while we were doing that, that we began to understand based on some data with Yervoy and tumor mutational burden in the past and other emerging data that was being generated by a translational medicine group that TMB might turn out to be an important marker, okay. ","And that\u2019s how we came upon TMB and then we look at it, 568, which is a practice informing study of about 300 patients of lung cancer, and that gave us more depth of data to look at TMB and lung cancer and the same thing with study 12 and so those three things said - that it is looks like this might be an important biomarker. So, we change the stat plan to enable us to give us, to give us the size, remember we nearly double the size of study of part 1A of the trial. That was really important to be able to do, which gives us the statistical optionality to be able to look at a marker like TMB, while still preserving the ability to look at that - to look at OS in a PL1 defined patient group. ","So that\u2019s really, I think the background for how we got there. I think what I can say about CTLA 4 being validated in this setting, is from our look at the data we have seen so far, we believe that Yervoy is a very important part of this story, and we think that Yervoy is clearly critical to the benefit in this TMB high patient population as well, I say at this point. ","And your last question is really interesting, regarding TA foundation might say, 20 is high, what happens between 10 and 19, what happens between 6 and 10, those are all excellent questions, we just haven't yet gotten to the point, where we have been able to look at all the variation across. ","What I can tell you is, when we look at the three datasets, I told you about 26, 12 and 568, we found 10, was an endpoint that the distinguished in lung cancer, using the foundation 1 assay outcome. And then when we prospectively analyze that in a patient sample, using our cart tissue, we were able to show this result. I can\u2019t tell you the patients who have got 25 don\u2019t do even better, they might. Where the patients who have 7 might also do well. And again, those are all things I think we are going to learn with more time. ","Operator","Thank you. So, next person is Geoff Meacham, from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is now open. ","Geoffrey Meacham","Hey guys, good morning and thanks for the question. I just had a couple. On TMB, what work have you guys done in other tumor types beyond lung, and I guess at this point, what do you think is the next step in tumor types that you already have your formal approval are you think, we are doing that, or do you think the more logical path our indications, or you haven\u2019t seen more IL activity. And then on 227, Tom as the data for Part A and Part 1A and B mature. How important do you think overall PFS and OFR on an ITT basis not the TMB segment. Thank you. ","Charlie Bancroft","Jeff. Just the first comment on your first question. As Tom mentioned, we are measuring TMB in over 100 trials. You will remember that one of the first trials in which we started stratifying for TMB status was [indiscernible] that's included in the study design. We're looking at TMB across multiple types of tumors lines of therapy. And obviously as our clinical development program evolves, we will learn much more about the role of TMB in selecting patient populations outside of lung cancer. ","Thomas Lynch","And Jeff for the question on 227. I think the couple of things I want to emphasize on what we have now that what we haven't looked at yet. So, in a group of patients with high TMB regardless of PD-L1 expression. And remember these are also across histology. So, including both squamous and non-squamous. The addition of low dose Yervoy two Opdivo improve PFS in that setting. What we haven't reported the overall survival from a PD-L1 selected group. And you'll seeing that data down the road. And there is really not much more we can say about the survival data. I'd love to have the answer now as well, and I'm sure you would as well. We just don't have that data yet. And we look forward to having that dataset. Again, I keep coming back to the fact that there is, that was still early in our understanding and there is a lot of data that's going to emerge not just from our studies in lung cancer, but from other investigators working with other agents in this disease and we're going to keep learning and we're keep following that biology as we did in this circumstance to improve outcome. ","Operator","Next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. ","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just two more on 227. So just following up I think on prior comments. So, one, solid very positive comments and data on TMB and PFS. I'm still wondering why you've decided to stick with PD-L1 and as the driver for the OS analysis for Part 1. When you're making the changes, why you do not change that also be TMB. I know you can't talk about that end points now but, maybe you can clarify why the decision was made the way it was.","And then the second part you mentioned Part 1B is now finished. And as I'm curious as to why is that not continuing to CT OS data, why are we stopping that one. Why are you stopping that one now, was there something that you in the interim analysis or was that always the plan as you just did your stats plan to not look for OS benefit in that population. Thanks. ","Giovanni Caforio ","So, Vamil thank you for your questions. I'd say couple of things to answer them. The first question is, Part 1B is finished because we used patients from Part 1B that were PD-L1 negative, but high TMB there in the TMB analysis. And the second thing is as we then design part 2 which is acting the Opdivo chemo question across a broad group of patients regardless of their PD-L1 status. And that's the way we design in this fiscal analysis. ","I think your question on, the first part of your question on overall survival for TMB versus overall survival in the PD-L1 reflected patient population. Because this study is so large, that's one of the things again one of the thing people asked earlier and how do we change it and why do we change it? We wanted to have optionality to look at a couple of the important questions and value reported PFS on this we just haven\u2019t seen the OS data for TMB and so it's entirely that we will see OS data from TMB and we look forward to seeing that data but we just have not seen that data at this point. We\u2019re waiting for that data set to mature. At the same time, we have this preserved ability to look at overall survival in a PDL-1 population. So, I think that those are really important points to get across. And part 1-B was the smallest of all the three parts of study-227 and part-2 has almost 750 patients. So, if you\u2019re wondering about the chemo question with Opdivo that will be answered in part-2 of our study. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Marc Goodman from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Marc Goodman","Yes, couple. So first of all, I just want to try and understand remind us about O26 and when you describe that you hit on PFS but not on OS. Why in this case you feel confident that -- what are the key differences so that we can have more confidence that you\u2019ll hit on OS financial year. ","And then second each quarter you guys are pretty good about giving us Opdivo sales and the breakdown of where it comes from. So, if you could do that for the quarter, that will be helpful. ","And then third you mentioned FGF I know we\u2019ve been waiting, did you actually talk to the FDA, have you signed off on Phase 3, when will you begin and what you should be looking for as endpoints there? Thanks. ","Giovanni Caforio ","So, Mark let me start with the FGS-21 maybe. As you know we had discussed that we were in conversation with the FDA to start to the next phase of development for FGS-21 one of the veins we discussed with the FDA was the fact that we had in our original set is we have not included a post treatment biopsy of different doses, so we\u2019ve decided to go ahead with the study that we\u2019ll be looking at post treatment biopsies before we move into a large phase-3 study and that study is starting right now. ","Thomas Lynch","So just to quickly address the question on the O26 I assume you\u2019re talking about the O26 retrospective look that we did, that we presented at ACR last year that showed a PFS, but I think you separate amount by PFS based on TMB in that setting. There is a lot of cross over remember in O26 and it was again used to generate hypotheses generating data. It was not a predefined pre-specified prospective analysis like 227 was. ","Murdo Gordon","Yeah, thanks for the question Mark. For Opdivo sales by major tumor type and I\u2019ll give you US numbers and I can give you a worldwide after that. But we currently enjoy roughly 44 to 50% of our business from lung, that\u2019s all lungs because we continue to get a bit of off label first line lung cancer usage particularly in squamous.","In renal, about 18 to 22% head in neck around 5 to 10% melanoma, 14 to 20% and then there is a kind of all others then you should think of this as probably early update in leading indications because of the approvals now in HCC and adjuvant melanoma. We\u2019ve got about 9 to 15% there and the reason I give ranges is its very hard obviously to get specific point estimates by tumor types. ","I\u2019ll just give you the lung number, when you go worldwide, that claims to between 50 and 60% and that\u2019s because of the strength we have in ex-US markets in lung cancer, because of the leading physician we have been able to establish through earlier access approval, particularly strength in markets like Japan and France, so, very strong performance in lung outside the U.S.","Operator","Certainly, last question is Jason Gerberry from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Jason Gerberry","So just one quick regulatory question on 227. So is the thought that, you would need in TMB high favorable OS as a secondary endpoint for to gain full approval and European approval, or that the co-primary endpoints in different sub-population would be registration enabled. I just wanted to get clarification of that, in light of Merck\u2019s comment earlier in their 3Q about needing OS to drive approval in the target population they are going after. ","And then just one other question, just can you provide the proportion of -- how prevalent TMB high is in PD-L1 negative patients? Thanks. ","Giovanni Caforio ","Jason let me just, maybe answer that question. We are not going to comment more on our regulatory interactions, but I just want to stress the TMB part of the study met its primary end point and the primary end point is progression free survival in that study and we look forward to discussing that with the regulatory authorities around the world. I think that, Thomas said earlier that we have just received the topline data, there are a significant number of secondary analysis that we will be conducting and we look forward to presenting that data together with other analysis at a future meeting, obviously as we have mentioned the study looked at TMB regardless of PD-L1 expression and so it included patients across the full spectrum of PD-L1. ","So, let me just close and thank everybody for participating in the call. And in closing I like to reaffirm my enthusiasm for the results we have shared with you today and during my carrier, I have many, many years in oncology, I can\u2019t remember a time in which cancer research was advancing at the speed, that we are experiencing today and I am very proud that we at the MSR at the forefront of incredible scientific advances. We had a great year in 2017 and I am very confident in the multiple opportunities that we are pursuing to be build a strong future for the company in 2018 and beyond. Thank you. ","Thanks everybody.

At this time, I would like turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Public affairs. Please go ahead, sir.","John Elicker","","Thanks, Catherine, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter results. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, and both Lamberto and Charlie will have prepared remarks. Also joining for the Q&A portion are Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer, who formally took over on July 01. B\u00e9atrice Cazala, who is Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations and joining us from Rome is Giovanni Caforio, Giovanni has been kind enough to join us from our Rome Offices as he dealing with from family health issues over there. So before we get started, let me cover off the legal requirements.","During this call, we'll make statements about the Company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliation\u2019s of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website bms.com.","Lamberto.","Lamberto Andreotti","Well, thank you, John. Good morning everyone. We have just completed another very important quarter for our company. We made good progress in R&D including the presentation of key data and advances on the regulatory front. We demonstrated real strength in the performance of comp of our key products, namely YERVOY, SPRYCEL, ORENCIA and with our other franchise.","And with respect to ELIQUIS\u00ae and our diabetes franchise in [Americas] we did well but in some we did not get the results we wanted and we need improvement. All necessary actions are in places to help us realize the sales and market share that our product can achieve.","Let me elaborate on this point. Clinically the big news first quarter will the ASCO meeting at which we presented very exciting data the demonstrated at our immuno-oncology portfolio has a very real potential which significantly changed the treatment paradigms for patients with a range of concepts. Granted we still have a lot of work to do but the promise of our immuno-oncology work is evident and presents us with important opportunities that we are committed to invest behind.","YERVOY is performing well in all markets and we continue to develop it in new indications. We have seven potential registrational trials underway on Nivolumab in three separate cancer types, renal, lungs, and melanoma. And we are considering additional tumors, and we have other products at an earlier stage of development.","Significance is the fact that we are developing our immuno-oncology assets in both monotherapy and combination and ASCO we presented the results of our Phase III trials combining Nivolumab and YERVOY in patient with advanced melanoma the first such clinical trials to combine to immuno-oncology agent. Simply stated the results of this Phase I trial were striking.","We will continue as I said to devote significant resources to our exciting immuno-oncology program. Regarding ELIQUIS we made progress with respect to life cycle management in the U.S. we filed for VTE prevention an indication already approved the and launched in Europe and other international markets. We presented the results of the amplified study of ELIQUIS at the IFDH Congress results that forward speak to the strong safety and efficacy profile of ELIQUIS in this case for patients in VTE treatment and we plan to file later this year.","Commercially the global launch is well underway and there are being some positive indicators especially concerning our work with cardiologists, but the results appear far from the levels that I believe ELIQUIS can reach thanks to each profile that is strong and well differentiated. Together with Pfizer we\u2019ve identified various opportunities for improvement and not intensifying our access efforts and our field medical and promotional activities. Additionally, we\u2019ll be initiating our DTC campaign in the U.S. in the first quarter.","Regarding diabetes, as you know we announced the topline results from our SAVOR study ONGLYZA and why we will have to wait until September for a fuller analysis we were pleased that the drug met its primary face the objective. With respect to FORXIGA, we have great (inaudible) application with the FDA in just this morning perfect timing. The FDA notified us that it would consider factory submission completed and gave out the new PDUFA date of January 14, 2014. We look forward to working closely with FDA in the coming months to review the filings and we are preparing for a likely (inaudible)","Diabetes is an important therapeutic area for us. We have a strong portfolio in an increasingly more competitive and more crowded space. And we and AstraZeneca had made the determination to increase our commercial investment behind the portfolio.","Turning to the rest of our products, this was the last quarter affected by the loss of Plavix last year and excluding Plavix and Avapro\/Avalide we deliver us solid double-digit growth last quarter.","Again I would especially pleased with the performance of our key products namely YERVOY, SPRYCEL, and ORENCIA products that are important for the future of Bristol-Myers Squibb. And taking as a whole, I\u2019m increasingly happy about the trends and diversity of our portfolio. A number of things can and will be improved, but we are moving in the right direction with the right products.","As you have seen we have updated our financial guidance, we are including our outlook for revenue. The reduction is related largely to two factors, foreign exchange and the recall of Fervex a local OTC product in France and other international markets. Charlie will discuss these two factors that affect our top-line. What I want to make clear is that, while we continue to look for opportunities to be more efficient across the entire organization, we are also protecting key R&D and promotional expenses.","As we know they are important investments for our future success. Again, taken as a whole, this was an important quarter for Bristol-Myers Squibb. Our focus on balanced execution remains the right approach, focusing on driving short-term results, while lay the foundation for long-term growth.","With that let me turn the phone over to Charlie for a closer look to some of our results. Thank you.","Charles Bancroft","Thank you, Lamberto and good morning everyone. As you have seen, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 and reported double-digit sales gains in our key brands. Excluding Plavix and Avapro, global sales grew 10%, led by YERVOY, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. Let me provide some highlights. YERVOY\u2019s sales were $233 million, an increase of 44%. YERVOY continues to post strong sales growth as physicians embrace YERVOY\u2019s durable long-term survival benefit and efficacy in a broad range of patient.","In the U.S., we continue to do well in the hospital setting and we are seeing strong growth with community-based oncologists. YERVOY also completed a best quarter in Europe and had strong quarter in South America and Australia as well. You may recall that during Q1, there was a 25 million returns reversal in our reported YERVOY sales.","ORENCIA Sales increased 21% to $352 million. We continue to see strong growth in the ORENCIA\u2019s share of biologic-na\u00efve patients as we expand access, imbursement and the promotion for ORENCIA subcu. While sales of the IV in subcu formulations are both growing, subcu continue to set the pace and now represent nearly 30% of all ORENCIA sale.","By early fall, we plan to launch ORENCIA subcu in seven additional market in Europe were new guidelines announced last month at (inaudible) recommend ORENCIA as a first-line biologic for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","SPRYCEL grew 28% to $312 million. The first-line trial and usage of SPRYCEL continues to grow in all market, especially among physicians who traditionally select a first generation PKI for patient with CML. We also continue to educate prescriber about the revise NCCN guideline, which incurred switching earlier at three months of treatment milestones have not been met.","Sales of ELIQUIS were $12 million during the quarter, while the initial launch has been a bit slower than we anticipated, we and Pfizer are aligned and continued belief that ELIQUIS will be the leading new agent in this market overtime.","As Lamberto mentioned, there are areas in which we had a good start, particularly in cardiology. But we clearly have identified areas for improvement to ensure the differentiated profiles of ELIQUIS is recognized by provision and patient.","In order to help ELIQUIS game momentum in the U.S. we will be increasing our medical educational activities with physicians in key territories. We also will launching a DTC campaign during the third quarter. Outside the U.S. we\u2019ve plan to launch ELIQUIS in nine additional countries by year-end.","Our diabetes portfolio had sales of $215 million in the quarter. Clearly, the diabetes market has becoming increasingly competitive and we along with our partner AstraZeneca recognized the need to adequately resource this business and execute better to drive growth, and therefore, planned to increase our commercial investment in the second half of the year.","Sales for the ONGLYZA franchise were up 40%, this includes a favorable impact from a $26 million return reversal in the U.S. As you will recall there was a significant change in formulary status at Caremark late last year. We believe we are seeing signs of stabilization in franchise performance at our TRX here move slightly excluding the Caremark in time.","For BYDUREON and BYETTA Q2 was the first quarter in which we had full commercial control of the [genotype] franchise on a worldwide basis, having taking over the international market on April, 01. BYDUREON had a good quarter at sales in the U.S. were up 10% sequentially. With AstraZeneca, we will be increasing our resources behind by BYDUREON.","For BYETTA, we will focus our promotional efforts in combination with long acting insulin. We\u2019re in the process of launching for CV in Europe and as Lamberto mentioned the FDA just accepted our regulatory resubmission in the U.S.","We also posted solid gains in our global HIV and Hepatitis B with sales totaling $1.2 billion in the quarter. REYATAZ global sales were $431 million, a gain of more than 6%, driven in part by the timing of tenders in Brazil. Sales of ATRIPLA and SUSTIVA also rose 6% to $411 million. ATRIPLA remains the number one single tablet regimen.","I also want to address and recall we undertook during the second quarter for three of our matured brands outside the U.S. which together had 2012 full year sales of approximately $100 million. The largest of these brands is Fervex an OTC product for cold and flu symptoms. This was a voluntary recall based on quality concerns from the third-party supplier and there has been no product complaints or reported adverse health events.","In Q2 the estimated pretax impact of this recall was about $54 million or $0.02 per share. This includes an inventory write-off, sales returns and estimated loss sales. We are pursuing several options to get the product back on the market which we don\u2019t expect to occur until sometime in 2014 with that assumption we estimate an additional $30 million pretax impact during the second half of 2013.","Now let me highlight two line items from the rest of our P&L. I will quote with our remarks on our non-GAAP results. As John mentioned reconcilations to our GAAP results are available on our press release and on our website. First I want to comment on other income and expense, a line item we do not usually discuss. Prior to the restructuring of our agreement with Sanofi at beginning of this year, we had reported royalties from certain international markets in this line. Following the restructuring any royalties from these markets are reported as revenue.","The impacts of other income and expense this quarter is roughly $40 million. Secondly, our non-GAAP tax rate was 13.8% during the quarter primarily driven by favorable earnings mix and an adjustment to our reserve associated with the legal entity restructuring we did late last year.","Finally regarding guidance, we are revising our full-year 2013, non-GAAP EPS guidance range to a $1.70 to $1.78. We are also making the following line item revision. 2013 sales are expected to be between $16 billion and $16.5 billion. In addition to the recall that I discussed earlier foreign exchange is having a significant impact on our sale, particularly a Japanese Yen. At current rates, we estimate that sales will be negatively impacted by approximately $180 million as compared to our original expectations.","Gross margin is now expected to be approximately 73% primarily driven by product mix. A&T is now expected to increase in the mid single-digit range. While we are increasing resources behind certain growth spend, we have been more efficient with some of our mature product spend. And finally our full-year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 15%.","At this time, we would be happy to answer to your question.","Francis Cuss","","So Catherine I think we are ready to go the Q&A portion and I would just remind people that in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, we have Beatrice, Francis and Giovanni here to take any questions that you might have. Catherine?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes sir. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first caller Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes hi good morning. I was curious when we will see any new data on the","Wal-Mart in any tumor type and also some commentary on ELIQUIS and maybe some specifics around which you are doing there to get the product going other than access related issues. Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Why don\u2019t you \u2013 why don\u2019t I start. Thank you this gives me the opportunity of saying couple of things about, a couple of additional things about, Lamberto and then Francis will continue, with more specific answer to your question. I want to confirm that we are aggressively invest in this immuno-oncology portfolio that we have and it will not be clearly an important component of this portfolio that we started to build with YERVOY.","We believe that based on the data we presented at ASCO, we believe that transformational potential of immuno-oncology and we feel good about our leadership position in this area. Others are working also in this area, we\u2019ve company that working also in this area, but we are committed to remain at the forefront through a program that is science driven that are device entity and actually go. Let's go back to, to PD-1 and the question on the disclosure out data.","Giovanni Caforio","","Thank you, Gregg, we are very encouraged by the progress at both our Phase III and early trials. We expect to get data from our ongoing Phase II study and third line squamous non-small cell lung early in 2014 depending on the results of that and our discussions with regulators that may lead to a submission and obviously an opportunity to present that at ASCO.","In addition we have combination data from Nivolumab and YERVOY ongoing renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung this is 1b study and we will be seeing in-house that data before the end of the year that will help us to determine how to go forward with further studies in that combination. Again this will be presented at ASCO next year. Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Yeah, Giovanni I think this is not unexpected question of the ELIQUIS options just to answer, but let me just say before you do that your line may (inaudible). I personally my higher management team our colleagues at Pfizer are convinced that the clinical profile of ELIQUIS is unique and differentiated. We are the only agent with superiority clients versus (inaudible) in the freaky outcomes of stroke and systemic embolism, major bleeding and mortality. And the other two new agents cannot make the same attributable to the [R&D] claim.","So we have things to do, we are convinced that new supportive actions we identified with Pfizer will either results and we continue to believe, I personally continue to believe and everybody here continues to believe that ELIQUIS will be the leading new agent overtime.","Giovanni, why don\u2019t you go into the specifics of actions?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes thanks you. Good morning. I would say following up to what Lamberto just said there are really four areas in which we are focusing on, I\u2019ll touch on those very briefly. We had really good access early in launch with a large percentage of lights covered in both commercial and Medicare, the focus now for the second part of the year is actually increasing, preferred status coverage in both areas and currently as you know in Medicare that is very important.","The second point is, with hospital formulary listing and stocking we had somewhat of a slow start there, we are now back on track, but clearly in the second part of the year we\u2019ll be working very actively to fully close that gap. The third one is penetration in cardiology, as Lamberto mentioned; we actually have had a good initial uptake in cardiology when you look at new two brands share in MBRX share we are at roughly 15% at this point in cardiology, which is in line with PRADAXA and when you look at our switch share in cardiology this above 20% or significant for PRADAXA.","We have clearly seen that physicians that are exposed to the full dataset find that profile to be very compelling and so in the second part of the year we are planning a significant increase in the number of promotional medical education events and peer-to-peer interactions with physicians through the medical organization. And finally as was mentioned before we would be fasting a DTC campaign in Q3 and those are really the four areas we are focusing on.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thanks Greg for the questions. Catherine can we go to the next one?","Operator","","Yes sir. Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you just a couple of follow-ups. The $12 million in sales that we recorded this quarter for ELIQUIS, just was wondering they don\u2019t seem to match with prescription trends that we have seen during the second quarter and not that we think the trends have been so spectacular, but there does seem to be a disconnect where they are scripts that were nut shelled returns just trying to understand that. And then Francis if you could elaborate a bit more on PD-1, just curious to note post ASCO did you see a bump at all in enrollment and just curious to know how enrollment is going with your trial and then also interested in what trials have you started with other immuno checkpoints in combination with PD-1 outside of three tumors you have already studied. Thanks.","Francis Cuss","Giovanni, do you want to answer the question on prescriptions and sales of ELIQUIS?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes in the U.S. only demand sales in the quarter was $16 million and so the $12 million really relates to a work down in the initial inventory, which was built in Q1 when we started distribution of the products. But the demand in the quarter for the U.S. market was $16 million. And in terms of abandonment and rejection rates. We\u2019re doing quite well. It\u2019s in line with our forecast because our reimbursement support programs are working quite effectively.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Jamie, thank you. So we\u2019ve had no difficult at all recruiting. What has bumped up after ASCOs obviously with combination studies we have ongoing. And actually requests for many different other tumors in compassionate use. There is a lot of interest.","In terms of other tumors and other combinations, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re looking already at \u2013 have it just on carcinoma and hematologic relating piece with Nivolumab and we plan to start very soon a clinical program exploring both monotherapy and the Nivolumab YERVOY combination in the number of additional tumor types, strictly those with higher met needs such as head and neck glioblastoma, colon cancer with high microsatellite instability pancreatic gastric, small cell lung triple makes the breadth. A whole combination of studies, which I think will inform us about where we will see both from monotherapy and combination, where we go next. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks, Jamie. Catherine, next question please.","Operator","Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Baum \u2013 Citi","Hi, three questions if I could. You have on your bottom line data you presented ASCO was remarkable with much return and safety and efficacy. And should we expect within the non-small cell combination cohort in the safety, you\u2019re going to present at slightly less picture in term of safety given, some of these patients presumably have latest therapy just thinking of the combination impact on [efavirenz].","Second there is a lot of excitement about LAG3 as a target you will identify that with a new portfolio one of high interest, you have meant today. Is there any problem here with anti-therapeutic, antibody to explain delay? And then finally if you could comment on the fourth coming ruling from election in relation to the ONGLYZA\/KOMBIGLYZE what are your expectations there with regards pricing for both things? Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","So Andrew, let me start with the non-small cell lung combination. As I just mentioned, we are ongoing with 1b study. We\u2019re obviously looking carefully at safety and efficacy and we will have structure in-house towards the end of the year beginning next year.","Obviously, we\u2019re also looking at monotherapy and so we got a couple of options here, because those are in Phase III. As far as LAG3 is concerned, as you say we are very excited about LAG3. There is no particular delay with due to go in to the clinic before the end of the year. And of course the exciting about this is an area of interest around exhausted T-cells, which of course is NUEVO, YERVOY, and of course LAG3 is doing very well. So with no delay, we\u2019re very excited to get in.","Andrew Baum \u2013 Citi","Okay, I got we are more from excitement of science still the reality of Germany?","B\u00e9atrice Cazala","Okay. So from everybody just to remind you quickly what the process is in Germany now. We have a process for (inaudible) which is three step process (inaudible) your product. They come up with rolling. This rolling is not binding and advised to the GBU which is signaled because of looking at this product. They come up with rolling there and then they start to a negotiation with them. So it is a lengthy process going over a period of time, which usually last about a year so, at this stage you will such company going slow and assessment before actually it was KOMBIGLYZE and KOMBIGLYZE what I have said to equate and soon our assessment which will be it.","Those two first step has been completed for KOMBIGLYZE and actually there was a different in the ruling between the equate which give us more stability and GBA which come from the things that was additional benefit. So now we will answering the negotiation from KOMBIGLYZE and we cannot comment further on this past.","I think now to the over world class of (inaudible) for the evaluation so we quick first and then residue so that GBA asset going to start, what we have in our hand is a ruling a few weeks ago ruling of equates ongoing and it include ONGLYZA-1 not the KOMBIGLYZE. So we are now expecting to see the GBA ruling and then we will go into the formulation.","So it will be pre-mature now to discuss obviously we will come out of that, what we know however is that there is a chance to be able our views of benefit of those assets and the importance of those DPT-IV in the treatment of diabetes with very good efficacy and safety. So we see up anything and we are looking forward to continue the discussion with the GBA in this front.","Francis Cuss","Thanks Andrew, Catharine can you go to the next question please?","Operator","Yes sir, Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","Thank you couple of questions, YERVOY can you talk about your level of enthusiasm for the upcoming Phase III prostate cancer data that starts around the corner. And can you talk about the commercial opportunities for that litigation in terms of how the trial was designed in often terms of the current competitive landscape? And then on PD-1, I know you guys are pushing into likely pushing the additional combination trials with PD-1 in YERVOY, but how much do you outside of Pfizer and folks internally think that the initial combo data in melanoma portals that you will have success in other tumor types with base on what you know about things like tumor biology?","B\u00e9atrice Cazala","So just let me start Tim with the YERVOY, as you know lifecycle management program with YERVOY, there are two prostate cancer studies ongoing, one which as you say we will be presenting later in the year is more advanced cancer, I think we are modestly enthusiastic about that in the sense which is a very heavily treated group. We have another ongoing study which will be in earlier lines which we believe when we have those results we will take the two together and have an idea of the value there.","Just talking about PD-1 for a moment, I think there are two ways to look at the combination trial, obviously in advanced melanoma the results are pretty extraordinary clearly that does provide some evidence to the opportunity for increased response rate, but the other way to look at this might be that in certain tumors where traditionally immunotherapy hasn\u2019t had any effect, the combination might actually have some effects, particularly in those where there is lots of unmet needs.","We\u2019re being encouraged to look very broadly to signal detection work and they go on from there. So we\u2019re hopeful, but we have yet to get lot of the data, but we will do over the next 12 months.","Lamberto Andreotti","","And Tim, I think we have discussed the commercial aspects of YERVOY close that once we have at both trials and we have analyzed that.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein","","Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Thank you, Tim. Catherine, can we go to next question please?","Operator","Yes, sir. Seamus Fernandez from Leerink has our next question. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann, LLC","","Oh great. Thanks very much. Just a few questions on dapagliflozin and then also first off on dapagliflozin. Can you talk a little bit about the reasons for an advisory committee specifically, you mentioned that likely was going to be discussed and can you give us a little bit of a flavor of what has been changed or improved meaningfully with the new filing versus some of the questions that had been raised by FDA historically?","And then secondly, as we think about the investments that you\u2019re talking about both behind the primary care franchises and also the investment behind the immuno-oncology portfolio, obviously this is going to be likely pretty costly, you hopefully will also have a launch of dapagliflozin next year. How should we be thinking about your ability to kind of manage the cost structure relative to the longer-term opportunity? Thanks a lot.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Hi, Seamus, thank you. The DAP data, we are submitting significantly enhances the information we provided in our first submission. And in addition to many of the questions raised by the FDA is part of the, I should say all the questions raised by the FDA is part of that complete response letter. Part of the reason for the outcome is that the original outcome as you recall that was a vote not to approve. So the FDA felt it was important to come back and present our broader portfolio of information now and for the advisory committee to apply as part as recent initiatives say we will have a couple of studies on CV risk which are now two years in, those are in patients with a history of CV disease who are diabetic and two new studies which weren\u2019t in original (Inaudible) specifically studying blood pressure and glycemic control in diabetic patients.","As you heard earlier we now have PDUFA date of early January, we\u2019re preparing for the advisory committee with a hope of getting approval then.","Lamberto Andreotti","","So about investments Charlie will give you today first of all it is a great problem to have because when you have multiple assets behind which you can invest that means that you have a good portfolio and I feel very good about it having said that yes we have a lot of investment that are needed to support that pipeline and that portfolio. Excuse me if you think about 2015 when we were looking at we are preparing for the revision of the guidance we obviously look at expenses and when we are facing the service recall and the foreign exchange we can see that whoever we had to cut expenses significantly and we decided not to go beyond looking politicians is because we believe we need to support the portfolio, the launches and the pipeline we have, Charlie.","Charles Bancroft","","Yeah, thanks Lamberto. I would just say as a general premise given our legacy and heritage of productivity we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout our P&L as part of our everyday business. But having said that we need to balance the short-term and long-term as we build a solid foundation for sustained long-term growth and as Lamberto mentioned, we have a lot of very unique opportunities in front of us.","Let me frame it by saying, if I look at the portfolio, we are taking out almost all ABILIFY expenses as I think about 2013, as we transferred most commercial responsibilities to Otsuka. And we\u2019ve also optimized our matured brands and in-line brands, although we continue to look for efficiencies there. So moving forward, when we think about ELIQUIS in the continued rollout of launches, the annualization of DTC spend in the U.S., obviously there\u2019ll be more spend going forward.","And same thing with diabetes as we brought up another sales force and potentially launching Forxiga in the U.S. and we\u2019re also rolling out Forxiga launches globally, you would see incremental expenses there, as well. And there\u2019s been some questions already on IO, that\u2019s a unique and compelling opportunity for Bristol-Myers Squibb, so moving forward from 2013 that will be an area of focus.","And then lastly in Hepatitis C, we do have a unique and significant opportunity in Japan. And sort of one-offs in different countries as the portfolio evolved that we will see incremental expenses as we think about our Hepatitis C program as well.","Francis Cuss","Great, thanks a lot. Can we go to the next question please Catherine?","Operator","Yes sir. David Risinger with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. I have three questions please. The first is, could you just provide a little bit more clarity on whether there\u2019s going to be any public disclosures of any incremental PD-1 data in any cancer later this year or whether we need to wait until early 2014, second with respect to YERVOY and prostate cancer given the scientific communities interest in immuno-oncology I'm surprised that you are not going to be disclosing the YERVOY data the Phase III trial results I think that they are completing on clinicaltrials.gov its indicated for completion in September.","So could you provide some more color on that, I know that the first line monotherapy study has a completion data in January of 2016. So just wondering if you know we need to wait a couple years for the prostate data disclosure. And then finally I was hoping that you could review the Hep C opportunity in Japan and the timing for launch. Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Well, Francis you start.","Francis Cuss","David thank you. So let me be very clear, there won\u2019t be any public disclosures during this year, obviously the third line lung data if it\u2019s good after discussion with the regulators we would certainly disclose that should we be making a filing. As far as YERVOY prostate cancer is concerned we will be providing that data at ESMO later this year and my point really earlier on was that when we look at prostate we will be looking at the whole prostate area together with the early line study that you commented about which will be viable on 2016.Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","Sorry, if you want to Ann will.","Ann Powell Judge","Yeah, as I mentioned earlier regarding Hep C, we believe that we have a unique and significant opportunity to have the first fall for our regiment in market in Japan with our GT, genotype 1b strategy, and we think that we have 18 months to a two year lead on both Abbott and Gilead had in Japan. So our registration on Phase III study of our NS5A declared as we are in NS3 for now and in intolerant GT or genotype 1b patient is expected to be presented at AASLD November, and we expect the file before the end of this year with approval on sometime in the second half of next year. Just as reminder, we had about 1.2 million to 1.5 million people in Japan infected with Hepatitis C and about 70% of them are genotype 1b.","Francis Cuss","","All right. Thanks, Dave. Can we go to the next question please, Catherine?","Operator","","Yes, sir. Marc Goodman with UBS; please go ahead.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS","Yes, couple of questions. First, Lamberto, in the past you\u2019ve actually said that you bought that R&D spend would be relatively flat for the next couple of years. So I was curious if that has changed and as part of the previous couple of questions about spending if there will be increased spending in R&D, and we should expect that relative to what you are spending this year, because of the immunotherapy?","Second question is that guidance changed on sales, I was curious whether the ELIQUIS ramp slower than expected, if that also baked into your lower guidance sales or is that basically doing what you thought it was going to be doing? And then in diabetes, can you update us just on the reimbursement that the payer issue pricing, what\u2019s happening? Are you on formularies, is it that the issue or is it a marketing issue, and just curious, your thoughts on that? Thanks.","Lamberto Andreotti","I would start to it comments on the R&D. The R&D expense it is a very important subject and we have still discussing this subject within our Company it is clear that the opportunity associated for us and for the patients associated with immuno-oncology are increasing and therefore Francis and Charlie and I together with our teams are looking at level of investments that which we require as Charlie mentioned we also have other investments that involve R&D, and then our commercial organizations we are looking at in defining the budget for next year.","I think I can could clarify on ELIQUIS, the sales for this quarter were below what we were expecting. But today then and is there something that\u2019s you were still at the launch stage and so these guidance is are related to the performance of ELIQUIS we seen.","Charles Bancroft","","I would just add to that Mark is that when we look at guidance and as we projected it we take our product trend into account. The bigger issues as I mentioned were FERVEX and the total year impact as we see it for FERVEX is going to be over $80 million FERVEX and the other two products and then FX as I mentioned had a $180 million impact. So they were the larger ones that we take into account all product, all product trends.","","Lamberto Andreotti","","Giovanni, would you want to answer the question on diabetes?","Giovanni Cafori","","Yes, it\u2019s Giovanni. So to answer your question the comments made before was specifically related to coverage with Caremark we lost the coverage at the end of last year and that had a meaningful impact on our ONGLYZA sales coming into this year, we've seen that impact primarily in Q1 at the beginning of Q2 we believe that impact that has now stabilized, beyond that plan, we continue to have good access with ONGLYZA and KOMBIGLYZE across the majority of the market. And on the other side of exenatide our preferred access in both commercial and Medicare for BYDUREON has actually been proving following the launch and steadily improving this year as well.","So although diabetes clearly from a pricing and rebates perspective, it\u2019s an increasingly competitive area, over all the access to our portfolio is quiet good. The Caremark issue was a very significant issue, it was one issue that impacted as in 2013 for (inaudible).","Francis Cuss","Great thanks Mark. Can we have the next question please Catherine?","Operator","Yes sir. Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group please go ahead.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hi guys thanks a lot for taking the question, I appreciate it. My first one is on ELIQUIS. Is it that the message, the data message on the superiority isn\u2019t being disseminated properly or is that you\u2019re seeing resistance to acceptance of that message? And then on NEVO if I may, you\u2019ve been pretty clear about the filing \u2013 the potentially filing timeline in (inaudible), at least in my mind I\u2019m really confused about the potential filing timeline in melanoma. I was wondering if you could \u2013 as a monotherapy. I was wondering if you could, are you willing to clarify that at all. And then just finally, obviously, there\u2019s been a lot press reports around M&A activity in the space not including Bristol, but I just think it might be a good time to get your updated thoughts on use of capital and the size of the deal that you might consider theoretically. Thank you very much.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Let me talk to the use of capital and then I will ask Giovanni and Francis to answer your questions, and I think we\u2019ve sent PD-1 respectively. Our use of capital priorities have not changed and they include business development, they include a mark investment in business development. So we continue to look at opportunities outside that assessment assess that financial volume of those opportunities as well as it fit with our portfolio and pipeline. So we continue to be constantly looking about way that is financially clever and disciplined. Giovanni do you want to talk about ELIQUIS?","Giovanni Caforio","","Yes. So the message is actually resonating quite well and when you look at the messages that are recalled by physicians, the first three messages that are recalled in very high percentages are stock reduction, the bleeding data and the mortality data.","Obviously, the dataset is one of the most comprehensive datasets that exist and we\u2019ve seen that physicians that are exposed to a medical education program and have the opportunity to learn about the profile typically become believers and styles and that\u2019s the reason why we are strengthening the investment in medical education programs and appear to be events in the second part of the year, because when physicians are exposed to the full dataset, it actually resonates quite well.","Francis Cuss","Great, thanks Mark. Next question please. Go ahead sorry.","Lamberto Andreotti","Yeah, Mark, just to say, I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on the timing, but what I will say is we are encouraged about the progress of the three trials we had ongoing in melanoma, two of them with \u2013 monotherapy and one with the combination. Interim analysis are embedded in all these trials we have overall responses, one with primary endpoints. And certainly there is the \u2013 we\u2019re looking at other ways to accelerate as well. So we\u2019re enthusiastic about the Phase III program give there is a lot of option. Thank you.","Charles Bancroft","","Sorry, Francis and thank you Mark for those questions. Can we go the next question please Catherine?","Operator","Yes sir, Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen and Company","","Thank you, I have two questions. You have already given a very through assessment of ELIQUIS, but on the Q1 call the company said that ELIQUIS was on track and the access was ahead of plan. So I'm wondering what is change then the last three months for instant have competitors reacted in unexpected ways for instant. Second maybe assume that if there were any pancreatic findings and saver that would have been told that already. Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Sure, Giovanni I can comment, first of all Steve that was a good question on ELIQUIS and Giovanni can give you a good answer. And then you will talk about bigger.","Giovanni Caforio","Yeah Steve this is Giovanni. I guess going back to what we said at the beginning we had very good success with access from early on and continue to have over 80% of life\u2019s covered under commercial space and over 75% of life\u2019s covered in America space. My comment was there covered life\u2019s had the beginning as always primarily non-preferred status, we are currently working and completing contract negotiations to increase the percentage of life\u2019s that are in the preferred status and that\u2019s normal. With respect to performance our update in cardiology has been quite good it has been quite good at the beginning, the last few weeks have been more I would say flat than the first part of the uptick curve, part of that was leading to a number of weeks where they were short weeks because of vacation in the U.S. but the uptake in cardiology continues to be good and what we want to see in the second part of the year is that uptake to accelerate and to broaden in some segments of primary care and we haven't seen that yet.","Charles Bancroft","","Just not going to comment anymore about save the results but of course as you know they will be presented on Labor Day at the ESC. I think many of us were very encouraged by the recent meeting at the NIH where for two days this item was discussed and I think not many people (inaudible) that we have that there really wasn't any indication that either GLP-1 based therapy more \u2013 were associated with the risk of pancreatic carcinoma, thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Thanks Steve, Catherine I think we only have time for two more questions.","Operator","","Thank you. Chris Schott with JPMorgan, please go ahead.","Christopher Schott \u2013 JPMorgan","","Great, thanks very much. Just a couple here, one just a quick one following up on ELIQUIS I guess you mentioned the potential for a broader uptick in PCP as we go later this year. In that setting how much of a hurdle do you think the breadth of your current label in light of [DPP] is in terms of a uptick relative to Xarelto in that setting. Second question following upon business development it's not a bias more towards in-market products versus pipeline at this stage (inaudible) very significant assets to invest in with the immunotherapy platform.","Does that lend itself towards looking more at in-market products that could maybe provide more near-term operating profits through invest back into that internal pipeline and then finally DPP-4 is just more broadly category growth has slowed a bit here just what's your expectation going forward is that something you think this is a kind of a norms, can we reaccelerate growth in the category, just give any comments you might have on the broader category? Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Giovanni, you will take ELIQUIS and DBP force on business development group. Now I think that if I would tell our idea has now changed. So we continue to look at a full range of opportunities that goes from in market products to early stage on the assets.","And it is clear that even though we have an interesting portfolio of our all interesting pipeline ourselves. We must be very careful on not loosing opportunities outside there to integrate our pipeline without assets that come from the outside. So yes, there is continuing activity to identify early, also early assets that can make our presence in our DBP areas stronger. Giovanni.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, so to answer this on early question primary care. The biggest hurdle in primary care has really been so far the intention of warfarin. If you compare primary care, in cardiology about two-thirds of new patients today at over discussed on a new agent in primary care, two-thirds patients are still started of warfarin and there clearly a differentiated profile like the profile of ELIQUIS has the potential to accelerate over time that transition. We don\u2019t see the breathe of indications as a major factor there, but of course as you know we are working to broaden our indication set as well.","And then on DBP force, a lot of the acceleration that we saw last year for DBP forces in U.S. was really related to the very rapid erosion of the [PZDs] the slowdown this year has really been related primarily to that process endings. But we continue to see opportunity for growth of DBP-4s clearly the very accelerated growth of last year was linked to a number of factors including the erosion of TCDs.","Lamberto Andreotti","Okay. Thank you, Chris. And Catherine, can we go to our last question please?","Operator","","Yes, sir. And our final question comes from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you very much for taking the question. Lamberto, I believe you made reference to increasing resources around the entire diabetes franchise with Astra and I wanted to understand that a little more fully. Is Astra fully engaged with the amount of resources that the joint venture wish to just spend in that category and importantly have they already been engaged with BYDUREON because I think your comment was toward BYDUREON specifically? Thanks a lot.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Tony, in fact Astra has been very engaged and we have discussions with AstraZeneca at all levels including discussion between Pascal Soriot and myself about how to improve our presence in diabetes. It is not necessary through that we have only invested or decided to invest more behind BYDUREON, the U.S. we are adding an additional sales force, but it\u2019s mostly focused on. So its entire portfolio that we are supporting and again Astra is engaged and we are engaged equally and we continue to work together to optimize the individual asset and the entire portfolio.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Thank you, Lamberto.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, Tony. And with this thank you. We as I said, we just complete and have a very important quarter for Bristol-Myers Squibb, a quarter that is characterized by the balanced execution between commercial sales and clinical R&D advances. A quarter there is progress on driving near-term results and making long-term investments. Thank you very much everybody.","Francis Cuss","Catherine. That concludes the call, I appreciate everybody taking the time to join us and have a great rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you. And again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all again for your participation."],"4340":["Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Hannah, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our call to discuss our second quarter earnings. With me this morning are, Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Executive Officer, Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Both Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks. Also joining are Murdo Gordon, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Tom Lynch, our Chief Scientific Officer, who, obviously, will be here for Q&A.","And before I turn it over to Giovanni, I'll read the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.","These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change. We'll focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website.","Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased that we just finished another strong quarter. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.74, which is a 7% increase over last year. And we grew our revenue by 6% with double-digit growth across our key growth drivers. Now, before I go into more detail, we all know that a competitor announced data this morning that is clearly important to the market. So let me make a few comments.","First, our CheckMate 227 is a first-line, non-small cell lung cancer program, not just one trial, investigating several important scientific questions. In study 227 we have at least three discrete opportunities for success. We will be able to evaluate the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy, we will evaluate Opdivo plus chemo in PDL-1 negative patients and we will be available to evaluate Opdivo plus chemo in all comers. Additionally, as you know, we are testing two cycles of chemo with the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy.","It's also important to recognize that MYSTIC trial and CheckMate 227 are very different trials. First, the dose and schedules are different. In 227, we believe we have optimized the dose and the schedule. Second, the trial sizes are very different. 227 enrolled over 2,200 patients, with 1,200 patients in the PDL-1 positive portion alone. In contrast, MYSTIC enrolled roughly 1,100 patients in all comers, and its primary endpoint was evaluated in a subset of that population. While the MYSTIC results are important data and we look forward to seeing more, it's very difficult to read across trials.","So let me now get back to our results this quarter. Globally, Opdivo sales were very strong. In the U.S. Opdivo delivered strong performance in an increasingly competitive market. Shares in the second-line lung cancer market remained stable, and we saw continued strong performance in other tumor types, with oncology trends in head and neck cancer. Internationally, we delivered very strong growth, as we leveraged broad reimbursement and strong commercial execution to drive continued adoption in our key markets. We also saw important progress from a regulatory and from a clinical perspective.","Earlier this month, we announced results from CheckMate 238, which was stopped early as Opdivo demonstrated superior recurrence-free survival in the adjuvant setting of melanoma versus Yervoy, the current standard of care in this setting. This is another successful registrational trial with Opdivo, and it's an important validation of our strategic approach to moving treatment earlier in the adjuvant setting, which we are exploring across tumors.","In Europe, Opdivo achieved two important approvals, one in head and neck cancer and one in advanced bladder cancer. In the U.S., the FDA accepted for Priority Review our application for second-line hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer, and we have a PDUFA date of September 24. You saw that we just filed the sBLA for four-week dosing for Opdivo monotherapy and we look forward to making that dosing available to patients and physicians.","ASCO is always an important Meeting for us. From my perspective, there were two key themes at this year's Meeting. First, we saw the emergence of the next wave of immune-oncology agents that have the potential to complement validated mechanisms, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. Assets like LAG-3 and IDO underscore the potential of our R&D pipeline and our expertise in this area.","Second, it was clear that translational research in biomarkers are likely to play a critical role in identifying which patients will benefit most from different therapies or regimen. This work is important because we know that the unmet need in cancer remains high and that there are many patients we are not reaching. And we believe our pipeline of I-O assets positions us well to bring forward the right medicine or regimen for the right patient at the right time.","Looking forward over the next 12 months or so, we have important data readouts expected from our portfolio, including in renal cancer, HCC, small cell lung cancer and, of course, non-small cell lung cancer. Outside of oncology, execution also continues to be strong. Eliquis delivered 51% growth, continuing to expand its lead in the expanding NOAC class. Our hepatitis C regimen was approved and recently launched in China, making it the first regimen of its kind in this important market. Orencia product sales remains strong, having again delivered double-digit growth.","We also saw continued progress in our diversified portfolio from a regulatory and from a clinical perspective. We've made good progress on FGF21, where we are in discussion with health authorities about our registrational program which we intend to start by the end of this year. Orencia received approval for psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. and in Europe, and we expect 2018 to be an important year for our immuno-science pipeline, with potential data readouts for the T2 and the BTK programs.","Finally, following our IP settlement with Merck earlier this year, together with our partner owner, we've just taken additional legal action against a number of companies with commercialized PD-L1 products. As we've said before, we have established a strong IP position with respect to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 that we will vigorously defend. Similar to the Merck action, we are seeking financial remedy, and not to reduce patient access to these medicines. As the innovators in this field, we have made significant investments in developing the science of IO, and we are proud of the transformative benefits it is bringing to cancer.","As I look back at the first half of the year, I'm very pleased with the execution across the company. We've reported strong sales performance and we have seen good progress from a regulatory perspective and from a clinical perspective. Looking ahead, I see tremendous opportunity for us to continue our growth and I am confident that we are very well-positioned for the long term.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning, everyone. As Giovanni described, we delivered strong results during the quarter driven by solid execution across the company. Let me first provide some color on the performance of our key products, starting with Opdivo. During the quarter, we saw continued growth for Opdivo in the U.S., with a year-over-year increase of 19%. We're very pleased with this performance, particularly given the increased competition in the market across the range of approved indications.","Specifically, in second-line lung cancer, we maintained roughly 40% share as we exited Q2. Outside of lung cancer in the U.S., the trends in renal cell remain strong with approximately 50% share, and we are seeing early signs of acceleration in head and neck. Given the current trends and strength of our business in the first half of the year, we believe that Opdivo will grow in the U.S. compared to 2016, despite pressure in the second half of this year due to the competitive dynamics in both first and second-line lung cancer.","Internationally, sales of Opdivo were up 17% sequentially as we continue to see adoption across second-line, non-small cell lung cancer and renal. Outside of these tumors, we are in the process of launching Opdivo in head and neck and bladder in several markets where we already have secured reimbursement, including Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.","With respect to the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in melanoma, in the U.S., share for the combination remains stable, with use in roughly one-third of first-line patients. Internationally, access and reimbursement approvals for the combination facilitated greater adoption, resulting in 24% year-over-year growth in Yervoy sales.","As Giovanni mentioned, Eliquis delivered strong growth and is leading new-to-brand share in both the NOAC and OAC class. Given the strength of our data, including the real-world outcomes data presented over the last two years, we believe we have significant opportunity for continued growth. Internationally, Eliquis delivered strong growth of 42% compared to the same time last year and continued to outpace the growth of the NOAC class in key markets around the world. Eliquis is the number-one NOAC in new-to-brand share in countries such as Germany, France and the U.K.","Orencia and SPRYCEL delivered worldwide double-digit growth year-on-year as we continue to drive demand growth for Orencia in the early, rapidly-progressing patient segment of RA. With respect to SPRYCEL, our first-line new patient share remains strong.","Now I'd like to highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. As I've described in the past, our gross margin is sensitive to product mix. During the quarter, we saw continued growth in Eliquis and declining performance from our virology portfolio, together pressuring our margin.","With respect to operating expenses in the quarter, SG&A was down 6% while R&D was up 5%. This dynamic reflects our commitment to strategically manage our expenses to ensure we can invest in the most important opportunities for our company, with R&D as a key priority.","Just a couple comments on capital allocation. Business development remains a top priority and the second quarter was very active. We executed multiple transactions, including collaborations to expand our biomarker science in I-O with QIAGEN and to study potentially registrational clinical collaborations in combination with Opdivo. In addition, we completed the $2 billion ASR during the quarter and, as I previously outlined, we plan to conduct additional share purchases during the second half of the year at roughly $250 million per quarter.","Turning to guidance. Given the strength of our business in the first half of 2017, we are raising the floor on our non-GAAP EPS and are now guiding to $2.90 to $3.","In closing, we believe our marketed portfolio and pipeline have significant potential. We've delivered very solid results in the first half of the year based on strong execution across the company, and we will continue to focus on investing in the highest priority opportunities across the portfolio.","I'll now turn it back to John for Q&A.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Charlie; and thanks, Giovanni, for the comments. Hannah, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Tom, I have a question for you. And, Giovanni, I appreciate your spelling out the differences between the MYSTIC trial and CheckMate -227. But, Tom, just curious to know your level of confidence in just the general CTLA-4 thesis in light of the MYSTIC results.","I note that there are a couple of other really important front-line studies with Yervoy and Opdivo that could report later this year renal and next year head and neck. If you could comment generally about the role of CTLA-4 and your confidence in this asset. It's very hard to walk away from MYSTIC feeling warm and fuzzy about 227. So I'm just wondering if you could talk big picture about that particular strategy. Thanks very much.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Well, Jami, thanks so much for your question. And what I'd like to do is start off by making a couple comments about lung cancer in general and then address specifically the thoughts about CTLA-4 because I do think it's an important data to emphasize how we look at CTLA-4.","So as I've said many times, Jami, lung cancer is an unbelievably difficult disease to treat. I've been at it for 30 years and I continually am struck by how challenging it is to make progress in this disease. I think as Giovanni outlined in his comments, one of the key things about Bristol-Myers is we have a comprehensive program in lung cancer.","We're not wedded to any one approach. We have optionality with monotherapy in first-line. We have combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in first-line lung cancer. We also have Opdivo-Yervoy combined with chemotherapy, as well Opdivo combined with chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer. So study 227, along with its new cousin, study LA-9 (sic) [9LA], are really a family of studies that we hope are going to demonstrate what the best opportunity in lung cancer is in the first-line.","So let me just comment on CTLA-4 as a mechanism. As an oncologist, what really matters to me are drugs that impact overall survival. And CTLA-4 is one of the two drugs in immuno-oncology that has been shown to impact overall survival. And let's just think about it. In Phase III we had data this year that shows in melanoma that Opdivo and Yervoy has a survival advantage in patients with melanoma.","The NCCN has endorsed the combination therapy in small cell lung cancer and in mesothelioma. We have Phase II studies that shows strong signals in renal cell cancer and MSI-high colorectal cancer. And, again, in the next 12 months, you're going to be seeing nearly five large Phase III trials where we're looking at CTLA-4 plus Opdivo in renal cell cancer, head and neck cancer and small cell cancer in addition to what we were talking about in non-small cell lung cancer.","So we believe that CTLA-4 is an important mechanism. In fact, Jami, not only do we think that Yervoy itself is important, but we've also invested in a non-fucosylated new formation of CTLA-4 and we're partnering with CytomX to look at a Probody for CTLA-4. So I think as an oncologist, as a clinical researcher, when you see an agent that's associated with a survival advantage, I think it's important to find out what is the optimal way to use this drug and how can we improve outcome for our patients.","And one of the things that we've become very aware of is dose and schedule are important when you combine I-O\/I-O drugs. And I think that we feel, certainly in 227, that we have a good dose and schedule for our patients.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks for the question, Jami. Hannah, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. And just a couple additional follow-ups given the MYSTIC update. So just a couple here. So first, when you reflect on the various differences between the studies specific to CTLA-4 and PD-1 combos, what are the really critical ones, in your view, that could lead to a different outcome from what we saw with MYSTIC today? Specifically, do you see this as issues of MYSTIC were about study powering and size? Or is there something specific with the agents and their dosing that led to this outcome? And if you're willing to comment on that.","My second question, anything from MYSTIC that would impact any of your thoughts around the 227 design, or more specifically, statistical powering (18:08) statistical plans?","And then finally, how are you thinking about PFS versus OS as a key endpoint as we think about the first-line lung market and I-O studies? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Chris, this is Giovanni. Let me just start and then I'll ask Tom to give you any other comments. I think many of the \u2013 of course, it's very difficult to speculate on any comparison of the two studies because we don't know really a lot about the data that was communicated today.","With respect to the design of the study, first of all, as you mentioned, size is really important. Second, we should remember that the studies include two different medicines, both in terms of the PD-1 and PDL-1 and in terms of the CTLA-4. Dose and schedule are extremely important. And also, as we've said already, you have to remember that 227 really is a program and gives us the ability and optionality to look at multiple combination strategies in different patient populations.","But let me ask Tom to give you more comments about that.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Giovanni. And, Chris, I think, again, it's important to reflect and think about these studies. There's much about MYSTIC that we don't know. All we've seen is the same press release that you saw this morning. But I think just to re-emphasize, first, the CTLA-4 drugs are different. They're different drugs. And dose and schedule may be important. We've spent a lot of time with Yervoy optimizing its dosing schedule across different tumor types. And we found that there are differences across that.","The second is the PD-1 target is different. We're a PD-1 drug, that's a PDL-1 drug. That could be when you combine with CTLA-4 potentially a difference between these trials. And you pointed out and Giovanni emphasized, the power and size are different between the two trials. So I think it's very difficult to read across the two studies.","You did ask a specific question about 227. And as you know, we have not disclosed our statistical plan for this study. And, again, I think that the data today certainly is one piece of the information, but I think that the ability to understand what the ultimate best way to treat patients will require more data from MYSTIC and certainly the results of both 227 and 9LA.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Chris. Hannah, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. We'll go next to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess just a couple here. You mentioned the dose and schedule a couple times there in terms of differences here between 227 and MYSTIC. But I was also intrigued by the filing you had with the fixed dose, every four-week dose and you're relatively quiet in terms of talking about that with the Street before you submitted it. So just can you share a little bit more about the data you have around that new formulation and what gets you comfortable that this fixed dose will be appropriate across all tumor types?","Then maybe one, just shifting gear more to the results for the quarter. You raised the bottom end of your guidance range on EPS. Your sales guidance looks like it's essentially unchanged. Can you just share some thoughts on your views on the top line? And obviously, the moving parts in the back end of the year with the Keynote-189 study. What is it that's keeping you not changing sales guidance, even though you had a good quarter here and you are raising the bottom end of the EPS guidance? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you. So this is Giovanni. Thank you. I'll try to cover some of your points at a high level, and then I'll ask Charlie to make some comments on guidance and the rest of the year, and Tom and Murdo to give you some perspective on dosing. So first of all, let me say, our performance in the second quarter and actually in the first half of the year is very strong. Commercial execution continues to be very, very strong and trends are good across products and across geographies. So we see good momentum.","Obviously there is a degree of uncertainty in lung cancer, but here the U.S., similarly we are at the beginning of our launch of hepatitis C in China. So those are trends that are a little more difficult for us to comment. But, overall, I would say we feel we are in a really good position from a commercial execution perspective.","With respect to dosing, I think that, as Tom was mentioning, we are working really as a priority to continue to optimize the schedule of our assets across indications, across lines of therapy, in combination. And what you've seen with 227 is really a lot of work that went into the finding of that dose. Similarly, we've been working on the four weekly dosing for Opdivo monotherapy.","And I'll have just Charlie first, and then Tom and Murdo, give you more comments about that.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, not much to add to what Giovanni said. We are pleased with the first half performance. There is uncertainty, as I mentioned in my comments, regarding Opdivo as we look at the second half of the year. And we're roughly two weeks into our hepatitis C opportunity in China.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So I think your question about our fixed-dose sBLA I think is a good one. And we think about how to use these drugs. We want to think about giving doctors and patients the most flexibility and optionality in the way they use these drugs for convenience and for potential efficacy when we combine them in different settings. So as you know, we have the 3mg per kg dose approved and the fixed dose at 240. So the ability to have a q4 week dose might be appealing for many patients and many doctors. And also to note, we also have in 227 the three-week fixed dose, so that can combine better with a Q3 week chemotherapy.","I think what patients and doctors want is the ability to use our drugs in a way that's most convenient for our patients and for physicians as we put together multiple combinations. I think as you're going to find, as combination therapy continues to play a greater role as we move forward, that this kind of flexibility in dosing will be very important as we move forward.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. Vamil, the only thing I would add is, this could be particularly helpful in parts of the market where infusion infrastructure is a little more constrained. For example, academic medical centers, large regional hospitals. We have seen definitely some preference there for longer duration or longer interval between dosing. Whereas in the community setting, the q2 week dosing schedule we've had until now has been fairly well-accepted. So that q4 will have an advantage, definitely in the academic setting, definitely in the regional hospital setting. And then we are interested, as Tom mentioned, in pursuing the most convenient dosing across indications. And that may vary depending on combinations, as Tom mentioned, as we evolve our portfolio.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Vamil, for the question. Hannah, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Yes. We'll go next to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. First I was hoping, Tom, you could comment on your perspective of the PD-1 or PD-L1 agent hitting on OS after missing on PFS. Secondly, can you share your thoughts around the company's appetite to play in the PARP space? Pretty interesting collaboration announced earlier that could be material in the industry.","And lastly, you've begun to talk more about NASH this year. At this point, have you met with the FDA yet to plan a pivotal study and when could that start? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Gregg. And let's break these down into three parts. And I think I might start with the NASH first and then we'll talk about PD-1 and PARP. As you know, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is an important clinical disease and it leads to cirrhosis. It leads to potential hepatocellular carcinoma down the road. We're very interested in our FGF21 agent. Because our FGF21 agent is able to approach all three elements that seem to be important in NASH and the pathophysiology of NASH. First, it approaches the metabolic derangement that we often see in NASH in terms of fat accumulation.","Second, it has the ability to reduce the inflammation that's important in the pathophysiology of NASH. And finally, it has anti-fibrotic impacts as well. And so we presented Phase II data on FGF21 at EASL this year that showed that we were able to reduce hepatic fat in a patient population of people with NASH, giving us a clear signal that this is something we wanted to take forward into Phase III.","And we have been discussing, to answer your question directly, we have been discussing our NASH data with regulatory authorities. And we hope to begin Phase III trials and a program by the end of this year, depending upon timing and how we're able to accomplish our timing. So this is an area that we definitely want to pursue. As we mentioned many times on these calls, we're not just a cancer company. Cardiology, fibrosis, immuno-science, are very important to Bristol-Myers Squibb.","The second question about PD-1 versus PDL-1. I think that's a terrific question. And if you go back two to three years, there were people who thought that PD-L1 drugs might turn out to be better than PD-1 drugs. And I think now, I think again, we have to really see where the data takes us and follow the science as we look at PD-1 drugs and PD-L1 drugs as we move forward.","And, again, around your question of overall survival versus progression-free survival in terms of endpoints, as an oncologist, we always like it when we see overall survival data. It certainly is something which can help doctors make decisions in terms of treating patients. But as we know, with the influence that second-line and third-line therapy has made, it's increasingly difficult to be able to demonstrate overall survival.","And so, for example, if you look at breast cancer. Many, many breast cancer drugs now have been approved on PFS. I do think that PFS and OS it will continue to be important endpoints and will be different in different studies as we move forward.","And finally, regarding PARP. I'll mention a couple comments from a scientific standpoint and turn it over to Charlie to offer more comments. I've always felt that PARP was an important target in oncology. DNA repair is clearly one of the hallmarks of tumor progression and it's something that mechanistically the ability to combine a PARP inhibitor with an I-O agent is something that, to me, is very appealing from a scientific standpoint.","And, Charlie, do you want to comment on...","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","No, I would just say we think it's an interesting class and particularly it's synergistic with PD-1s and it looks like it may have applicability in tumors like ovarian and prostate and triple-negative breast. And it's something we continue to look at.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Gregg. Can we go to the next question, please, Hannah?","Operator","Yes. We'll go next to Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of questions. On 227, it's not terribly clear to me why you can't give some elements of statistical design. It's not like there's a wealth of CTLA-4 competitors that are going to suddenly go out and change their trials. So with that as my comment, I'm hoping you can at least talk about whether the analysis is going be hierarchical in nature, and maybe you can reveal what the starting cut point would be for that analysis.","And then on this first readout potentially by year-end, are you expecting that you'll have both PFS data and mature OS data at the same time? Or could the OSPs come a lot later, like it will in MYSTIC? The reason I ask that is that MYSTIC today shows us that maybe PFS is not a great measurement. So if your OS data isn't mature, I'm wondering if there's risk to this initial readout. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tim, this is Giovanni. First of all, I would say we've said all along that we have optionality with our statistical plan. We don't really see a need to make any change there. And with respect to the time lines for the study, the primary completion, as you said, is the first quarter of next year. We do have an opportunity for an interim on OS by the end of this year.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And just to add, Tim, to your question. I think that we have not disclosed when the interim is. We've been saying all along that we expect to have some data in the first half of 2018. Whether that data will be PFS or OS, as Giovanni just mentioned, we have the optionality to look at both co-primary endpoints in the study, and we look forward to seeing the data.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Tim. Can we go to the next question, please, Hannah?","Operator","Yes. We'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on (32:17) CTLA-4 combo, but outside of lung for a minute. So perhaps starting off in CheckMate -214, the renal trial. I was curious about the (32:25) dose selection every three weeks \u2013 every six weeks deployed in 227, and if there have been interims in that trial? And then also on CheckMate -651 in head and neck, are (32:35). Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So thanks for your question. Let me address the renal cell question as we think about it. So think about kidney cancer. Kidney cancer is an interesting disease. I can remember when I was training, the only drug that worked in kidney cancer was vinblastine and it really barely worked at all. And yet since then, we've seen the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in kidney cancer and they've shown very good benefit, though not for all patients who get treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","And, clearly, there are patients with more severe adverse disease who don't necessarily seem to do as well with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but they've made a huge difference in how we approach the disease. And then we've seen the advent of I-O and immuno-oncology agents and the difference they make.","As you likely know and are alluding to, we were delighted to be able to publish our study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology our Phase II trial looking at NIVO and IPI in patients with renal cell cancer. And as you know, the combination of NIVO plus IPI had a response rate at 40% with a two-year survival that was between 60% and 65% overall, which we think is very a encouraging data and is the basis for why we've proceeded with the randomized trial 214. Our hope is that we're going have some data from 214 by the end of this year as we move forward.","The second part of your question was about head and neck cancer. And, again, I want to emphasize, this has been a busy week for I-O in terms of readouts at various different head and neck trials. All we know from the pembro study is it did not meet its primary endpoint and we don't know much more than that in terms of details.","But what we do know and want to remind you of is that the nivolumab study in patients with head and neck cancer compared to investigator's choice chemotherapy did show a survival benefit, with a one-year survival rate of 36% versus 16% for the investigator's choice and has led to the use of single-agent nivolumab as we move forward. And as you mentioned, we do have additional data that we plan to present in head and neck cancer next year.","So CheckMate -651, as you mentioned, is a trial looking at IPI-NIVO versus chemotherapy and cetuximab in patients with head and neck cancer. And we expect to have that data the first half of 2018. And we also have a trial that will be maturing in the first half of next year looking at the combination of IPI-NIVO versus NIVO in patients who aren't able to tolerate cisplatin and cetuximab.","As you know well, head and neck cancer patients are a uniquely comorbid group of patients with lots and lots of comorbidities that make aggressive treatments challenging. And so we are very happy that we have trials that cover the broad range of how patients present with head and neck cancer and what doctors see with head and neck cancer.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Umer. Hannah, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks for the question. So just two questions. First, Tom, can you remind us again your biomarker strategy and how you see this impacting lung? I'm particularly interested in the application of the tumor mutation burden test as a stratifying metric in the new lung study that you guys just announced for the combination.","And then the second question is just, can you give us just a general sense of how excited you are and perhaps when we might see data from either the LAG-3 or the Flexus IDO in tumors outside of melanoma? And if you are willing to expand a little bit, do you have plans for registrational trial starts in tumors outside of melanoma for either of those two assets? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. So let's get to the meat of the question. So first question, Seamus, that you asked us about, our biomarker strategy. And this is an area of great interest to me and it's an area of great importance to patients across the spectrum. And so if you think about lung cancer, and we've said many times it's a difficult disease to treat. But I think the thing that I've been very impressed with in lung cancer as a lung cancer clinician is how this disease has evolved and how it's fragmented over the past 10 years.","If you go back 10 years, 10 years ago we just thought of small cell and non-small cell and that's what you used to make your treatment decisions. Now when a doctor is looking at a patient with lung cancer, they're thinking about EGFR. They're thinking about ALT. They're thinking about ROS1. They're thinking about PD-L1 expression. And I think that they may soon be thinking about TMB as an important marker as well in cancer.","And so let's think, what is TMB? TMB is tumor mutation burden. It's a measure of the amount of mutations that are present in protein coding genes in patients' samples. And when you think about it, some people think it's important in and of itself. Others think that TMB is really a reflection of important tumor neoantigens and that one day we might be able to look at the TMB data and define which tumor neoantigens are actually driving the immune response.","So we've been happy that we've been able to look back and use TMB in a number of settings. As you know, the data we presented at AACR, we're able to look at TMB in patients in our 026 study and we were able to identify a group of patients who did very well with monotherapy. And we will continue to look at TMB in a number of different tumor settings when the data allows and when we're able to do it.","And I think one of the examples and an example of the commitment we have to TMB is in our study 9LA which is now available on ClinicalTrials.gov. We actually will be prospectively collecting TMB as part of the 9LA study, which is our trial of standard chemotherapy versus two cycles of chemotherapy with Opdivo and Yervoy. And, again, we have to follow the data. The data we have so far is early, but it certainly gives us reason to think that this could turn out to be something important in patients with cancer.","Your second question comes down to IDO and where we stand with IDO. And as you know, this is also something very important to Bristol-Myers Squibb. We thought enough of IDO as a target that we went ahead and purchased the IDO asset from Flexus, which is now the Bristol-Myers IDO. And we have announced that we will be moving forward with trials with the Bristol-Myers IDO as we go forward.","We think that there are some things about our IDO which could actually be differentiating and might prove to be important. We think we see excellent receptor occupancy. We think we see very good suppression of kynurenine levels, suggesting that we're inhibiting the enzyme. And this may allow Opdivo to be a more effective immuno-stimulatory agent. So we're excited about where the Bristol IDO can go in its combination with nivolumab.","But in addition to this, we also have a relationship with Incyte and you saw in ASCO this year the first data with the Incyte IDO along with Opdivo and we saw very strong response rates in melanoma and in head and neck cancer. And so, again, eagerly awaiting to see how we get these trials going. As we have announced, we plan to start our trials with Incyte by the end of this year and we hope to also have our Bristol-Myers trials up and running as well during that timeframe.","And finally with LAG-3. LAG-3 is something I was extremely excited about at ASCO. And why was that important? I think you learn a lot by studying resistance. And if you look at the most importance thing about LAG-3 so far is that we looked at patients who had prior treatment with immuno-oncology agents with melanoma and we were able to find a percentage of patients that responded to LAG-3 plus Opdivo in that setting.","And more importantly, we were able to use the biomarker of LAG-3 positivity to select a group of patients that had almost a 3 times higher response rate in that setting. So we think LAG-3 is an important target and we're going to continue to develop the biomarker, the LAG-3 biomarker, and we're going to continue to look at LAG-3 in IO-na\u00efve patients with melanoma as well as expanding our experience in previously treated patients.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Seamus, maybe if I can add a couple of comments there. I think these developments that Tom articulated for you are really important for us because we've discussed this before. And when you think about our strategic priority, advancing that early pipeline, in oncology and outside of oncology is clearly a very important priority for us. So I'm personally very pleased that we are working between now and the end of the year to start a number of registrational programs.","We mentioned FGF21 outside of oncology. Tom mentioned LAG-3, the two IDO programs and nivolumab is another important program. I'm very pleased we are seeing the beginning of a number of registrational programs that are going be really important for us as a company. And even more broadly, I think what we've discussed today is how we are advancing a very broad program in lung cancer which continues to expand and advance.","The second pillar is how we are moving forward with a broad number of short-term opportunities for Opdivo and Yervoy within oncology beyond lung cancer. And the third pillar is really the new pipeline. And I think you are seeing that we're making very, very good progress across every one of those three areas.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Seamus. Hannah, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Baum of Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Three questions, please. The first one relates to MYSTIC. So your competitors seemed to highlight that a number of trials with I-O have missed PFS and gone on to hit overall survival, and head and neck is obviously one of them for you. You obviously have more experience with I-O than anyone else in this space.","Our concerns is the examples of missed PFS that hit OS with I-O all seem to be in trials with short PFS, where patients have been through multiple lines of therapy, which looks to us very different from the situation with first-line non-small cell lung. With that in mind, if you were facing a similar situation with 227, which I hope you won't, where you've missed PFS with the Opdivo Yervoy combination, how confident would you be feeling about making the OS? That's the first question.","Second, just going back to the differences between the individual molecules. To what extent is your development plan for non-fucosylated CTLA-4 reflect the fact that you believe effector function is a critical element of the efficacy of the molecule different from your competitor?","And then finally, just on patient selection, aside from baseline tumor load, to what extent do you think their learnings in optimizing the patient population using baseline tumor load, performance data, liver mets, which may significantly skew any data you may get from a large clinical trial, and to what extent can that be leveraged in your recruitment criteria? Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Andrew, thank you for your questions. And the first question is really a hypothetical. And it really is impossible for me to be able to opine on a potential hypothetical of missing PFS or hitting PFS or missing OS or hitting OS. And I really think we have to wait until we get more data from the MYSTIC study to really understand that. As we've said earlier, we have PFS and OS as co-primary endpoints in 227 and we have not disclosed our final statistical plan in that setting.","Your second question regards the new formulation of the non-fucosylated CTLA-4. I think one of the reasons we've looked at these two new CTLA-4 targets, first, we believe in the target. We think the target's important. The target's been shown to have a survival advantage, and as I illustrated in my answer to Jami's question. So we think the target's important. And if we think the target's important. And if we think the target's important, the question then becomes, how do we optimize the therapeutic index? How do we make CTLA-4 a better molecule, an even better molecule than it is? And there's two main approaches.","With the CytomX approach, the thought is, the Probody technology will allow a differential exposure of tumors to CTLA-4, allowing us to enhance the immune response within the tumor itself and possibly not see the same degree of side effect profile that you could see with immune side effects in other areas. So that's the thought behind the new formula, behind the CytomX approach.","With the new formulation, there's a possibility that there could increased potency of the drug that could actually allow us to have more effectiveness in that setting. And, again, very early. We just started, as we announced at the last earnings call, we just started trials with the non- fucosylated CTLA-4. And so we're going have to see how that evolves.","And your third question, Andrew, is around the concept of patient selection. And I think you've hit a very important point is that, as we look at these cancer types, and as I mentioned this about lung cancer earlier, we are seeing increased fragmentation in the patient populations. And we're seeing the biomarker selection is becoming increasingly important as we look at patient populations.","Lung cancer, for example, is not just one disease. It's many diseases defined by EGFR and ALK and ROS and possibly Tumor Mutational Burden and PD-L1 positivity. So I think as we go forward, attention to patient selection and attention to thinking are we treating the right patients is something that we take very seriously in our tumor design and our trial design. It's one of the reasons, as Charlie mentioned earlier, we're continuing to up-invest in R&D and up-invest in translational medicine because we think it's important for us to prospectively be selecting the correct patients.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Andrew. Hannah, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a couple questions. On CheckMate 227, is the interim in 2017 on PFS or OS? I think Giovanni said OS. I had thought it was also PFS or only PFS, so please clarify. And related to that, why would it make sense to do the interim look in Q4 as opposed to Q3 since the conclusion is in January? Would you agree Q4 doesn't provide much benefit in terms of the timing? So that's the first question.","The second question is regarding CheckMate 568. I think Bristol is saying there is a possible update in 2017. What does whether there is an update or not depend on? Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Hey, Steve. It's John. Real quick on their interim analysis. We have said all along that, like in all of our trials, we've built in optionality, which we have in 227. In terms of timing, everything is event-driven. So we've never committed to January, even though that may be what's on ClinicalTrials.gov. And we've said sometime in the first part of 2018 is when the primary endpoint should read out. So both the interim and the primary analysis are event-driven, and so, obviously, time flexible.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Steve, regarding your question on 568, I'll just give you a little bit of color behind 568 and how it got to the place where it is. 568 was designed as practice-enabling study of Opdivo and Yervoy. We initially designed 568 to be about 160, 170-patient study initially. And with more experience, we decided to increase that size to 300 patients. And then last year we decided to actually add a randomized portion to 568 looking at this question of two cycles of chemotherapy followed by Opdivo and Yervoy, and that will be an all-comers trial.","Now, after discussions with the Agency, we've actually decided to make that a separate Phase III trial. So that's the trial that's now called 9LA. And so that trial will get going. We hope the first patients will enter that trial. We have a safety lead-in right now, which, to the best of our ability, seems to be going well with the two cycles followed by Opdivo Yervoy. And so we hope to begin accrual for that trial in September of this year if all goes according to plan.","As of now, we have not yet decided upon our presentation strategy for 568, but we look forward to sharing that with you when we have.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Steve. Hannah, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much. I have three questions. The first is, with respect to U.S. Opdivo in the second quarter, could you just provide the percentage of sales in different cancer types in the second quarter?","Second, with respect to your expectation for Yervoy combo Phase III kidney cancer results by the end of the year, could you just help reconcile that with ClinicalTrials.gov? ClinicalTrials.gov indicates a primary completion for that trial on September 30 of 2019. So it makes me wonder why look at any Bristol-Myers dates on ClinicalTrials.gov.","And then finally, with respect to your Flexus IDO, when do you expect to present Phase I data on that later this year? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. David, let me ask Murdo to start and give you some data on Q2 U.S.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","David, for Q2 U.S. about 50% to 55% of our sales are in non-small cell lung cancer for Opdivo. And renal cell carcinoma is between 15% and 20%. And then the other big one for us is melanoma, at 10% to 15%. There are obviously other tumors, with bladder, head and neck and others, but those are the three big ones and that's the split.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","For the 214, by the end of this year that is an interim analysis. You may be referring to the final analysis. And let me ask Tom to give you an answer to your question, to your third question.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And your third question regarding the Flexus IDO, we hope to have data, in fact, we're pretty sure we will have data, for the CITIM Meeting this fall.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Dave. Can we go to the next one, please, Hannah?","Operator","Yes. We'll go next to Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Geoff, are you there?","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, I am. Can you hear me?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Now we can, yes.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So thanks for the questions. So, Tom, another one on CTLA-4. Obviously data-dependent. But if 227 looks underwhelming, would a strategy be to explore triple combos in lung? I'm just thinking with all the assets and novel mechanisms you guys have in-house, whether you view CTLA-4 as more foundational.","And then for Murdo on the quarter, can you give us some perspective on second-line lung share new start trends? Just trying to think whether KEYTRUDA is slowing starts. And then looking forward, would you expect any formal reimbursement limitations on sequential I-O therapies in lung? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Geoff, why don't we start with Murdo to give you some perspective on your more commercial questions. And then Tom will address your CTLA-4 question.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. Thanks, Geoff. In second-line lung cancer our shares have actually been very stable. So we run around 40% share of second-line lung cancer. And that market volume has held up quite well so far because the impact of pembro usage in first-line has not yet been felt in a reduction of eligible second-line patients.","That will change as we get closer to the end of the year where the shares in second-line lung should hold, but the addressable eligible population of second-line I-O na\u00efve patients will start to shrink. And obviously next year, there will be a smaller pool as well.","I will say, our teams have done extremely well in establishing this holding of share despite two competitors in the second-line setting. And ex-U.S., we've done very well given the lead that we've got in second-line in many markets due to fast reimbursement. So the emergence of our lung cancer business ex-U.S. is also driving some nice growth.","And then outside of lung cancer, our shares are very good in regimen in melanoma, in head and neck we've seen some recent acceleration. In renal cell, we've held up well. Bladder, we're emerging. Actually the broad usage in other areas where NCCN is updated, like Tom mentioned in mesothelioma, is also helping to drive growth outside of lung. So we feel good about that.","In terms of reimbursement limitations, really in the U.S., we have seen very good prior authorization approvals in the mid to high-90% range even in combination settings. And, of course, in melanoma it's really the market where we see the most in combination used today. Now, we are obviously tracking the U.S. environment very closely. And we are, I think, in a very good competitive position should there be further restriction or barriers to combination reimbursement as you see sequential lines of therapy evolve, given that we have multiple targets and multiple combinations to use in those settings.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tom?","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So Geoff, thank you for your question. And this is an area of great interest to me. So the first thing is, I can't really think about hypothetical of 227 and MYSTIC. So I think it's really not helpful to think about hypotheticals.","But I do think it's important to think about triples. And something I've been interested in for quite some time is this idea that I really think that to begin to think about how we're going to be driving prolonged survivals in cancers, we've really only begun to scratch the surface in terms of thinking how to use these drugs.","And I do think that triple therapy, quadruple therapy, down the road makes sense. Just think about lymphoma. And you think about the fact that we can cure lymphoma now with five drugs. We've made a huge difference for patients with lymphoma in that setting. And it's entirely possible that ultimately the way we approach lung cancer, other cold tumors and even melanoma will be with multiple drugs.","So for example, we have announced that we have begun some dose-finding studies in early trials with IDO inhibitor plus Opdivo and Yervoy, looking at that together to try to learn, could there be a signal with that triplet in melanoma. And we also have plans to look at a LAG-3 with IDO and Opdivo as well.","And so we are committed to multiple drug combinations. Of course, the difficult thing is as you begin to put together multiple drug combinations, trying to determine the relative impact of the different components becomes very challenging and requires a tremendous amount of creativity and innovation in clinical trial design.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Geoff. Hannah, I think we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thanks. We'll go next to Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. So first, Murdo, for Opdivo, can you give us a sense of where the OUS sales are coming from, just like you did with the U.S.?","Second, on Eliquis, where is the market share now for the cardiologist specialist? Just give us a sense there?","And then third, for Daklinza, can you confirm there were no sales in the second quarter for China, and can you give us a sense of what kind of ramp should we be expecting in China? Obviously, hep C we've seen pretty amazing ramps when these products launched. So give us a sense of how we should expect sales for China. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Sure. Thanks, Marc. Ex-U.S. we've seen very nice launch progression in Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain. We are very early in our launch trajectories in Canada. We're hopeful that we'll be launching soon in Australia. In the U.K., we've launched in our regimen setting in melanoma, and it's going extremely well. So our business is really broad, and we've got over 20 markets ex-U.S. now reimbursed either fully in lung, renal and melanoma, or at least lung and melanoma. And we're working now on our head and neck and bladder indications to be able to secure reimbursement there.","So I think our position in Europe, in particular, is very, very strong because of the timing advantage we've secured with indications there and with the rapid uptake that we've been able to achieve. So OUS I feel very good about, and the teams have done extremely well across medical and commercial to launch.","With respect to Eliquis, we are sitting with very strong shares now. We are at roughly 53% Eliquis TRx share. And we're leading \u2013 and we've got large shares in NBRx leading that just a few more points. So we're growing very well in Eliquis. And, of course, there's still a lot of warfarin used in total prescriptions in the U.S., with about 47% of the market still in warfarin. And in NBRx, that's down now to roughly 30%. 29%, if I remember. So we still see a lot of headroom for growth on Eliquis, but very, very good share trends there. And leading in our categories in BTE and atrial fibrillation.","And with respect to Daklinza in China, we did not book any sales in the second quarter. We have started to book sales this quarter. The uptake curve in China with the dual of Daklinza and Sunvepra is a very difficult thing to predict. We are in the process of securing some reimbursement now in three main provinces in China. We are currently selling primarily in the private pay sector. So more to report on that next quarter. But obviously we're very excited about the opportunity being first in the market and being able to help a very large unmet need and a very large patient population in China.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Marc. And, Hannah, can we go to our last question, please?","Operator","We'll go to Tony Butler with Guggenheim.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, thanks very much. Two questions, Tom, for you. One, if I may go back to FGF21 and NASH and Phase III. And the question is, could you share the designed, if there is a clinical endpoint, for the Phase III program? Or is it simply looking at tissue histology following sort of end of trial biopsy? That's one.","And then second, back to MYSTIC and 227. Is there \u2013 I understand dose and schedule and a lot of the comments that you've made. But are there perhaps other characteristics of these antibodies that may be substantially different which could actually allow for some clinical differentiation?","For example, one being IgG1 versus IgG2. Don't know if that really matters, but it could.","Clearly, you've made some comments that glycosylation could affect binding characteristics for ipilimumab. I'm just looking for something more than simply dose and scheduling, if you think that might be useful. Appreciate the time.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tony, thank you for your question. The first on FGF21 is the data on the design of those trials will be available on ClinicalTrials.gov. It's something we're discussing with the regulatory agencies now.","The second question is a good one. And many people have suggested that IgG1 versus IgG2 could explain potential differences. They are different drugs, so there does exist a possibility that there could be differences. But, again, our job is trying to define the best way to use CTLA-4 based Yervoy and our agents. And really I don't have a real thought as to how important these other factors could be. I mean, there's certainly some science that suggests that there could be some differences. But, again, it's again very early in the process of understanding how they work.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Tom. Thanks, Tony. Again, we just completed another strong quarter. I am very pleased with execution across the company. As you've seen, we've delivered strong sales performance and we are continuing to make good progress from a clinical perspective and from a regulatory perspective.","Looking ahead, as I said at beginning, I see tremendous opportunity for us to continue to grow and I am very confident that we're well-positioned for the long term. So thanks, everyone, and have a good day.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Candace; I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Bristol-Myers 2014 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. John Elicker, you may begin your conference. ","John Elicker","Thanks, Candace. And good morning, everybody. My apologies for any of who you had difficulty dialing into the call. There was some confusion around start date but this -- I think we are ready to go at this point. We are here to discuss our Q4 earnings and as well we had issued our 2015 guidance. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our CEO; Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Operating Officer; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer; and Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer. Lamberto, Giovanni and Charlie will have some brief prepared remarks and then we will go to your questions. ","First, I'll take care of the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we will make statements about company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.","We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Well, thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. First, as you all know, we announced last week that effective May 5th, I would be retiring as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb. While remaining on our Board of Directors and becoming its Chairman replacing Jim Cornelius. Jim's role in our company has been transformational and outstanding. And I feel honored to have worked with him for many years. And now to take over from him as Chairman. I am very pleased that Giovanni Caforio will be successor as CEO. Giovanni is a global business leader with broad industry and management experience including a solid background in oncology. He is also a trained physician who brings to his work an important perspective and certain insights. Importantly, Giovanni is not only been a key player in developing our strategy these past several years, he is also been one of the driving forces executing against it. So he is very good about leading our company in his very capable hands. ","I am going to ask Giovanni and Charlie to walk you through our fourth quarter results, but before I do that, I will speak for a few minutes about some of the highlights of the past year because 2014 was without question an important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I am very pleased, I am very proud about it. In 2014, we accelerated our evolution to being a diversified specialty biopharma company, beginning with a completion of divesture of our diabetes business. Under Giovanni's leadership, we are refocused our commercial organization to optimize global brand and market. These allowed us to drive strong sales across our portfolio and across the world. In fact, our commercial organization had a good year delivering 6% sales growth excluding the diabetes franchise. These changes positioned us well for continued success with our portfolio of marketed and pipeline products. Under Francis's leadership our R&D organization also had a good year. Most notably with respect to our immunoncology portfolio. Getting approval of Opdivo in the US for melanoma and with the early stoppage of two Opdivo study in melanoma lung due to very positive results. These developments underscore the strength of our I-O strategy and our I-O programs. And importance of continuing to apply the same strategy. Beyond I-O, we made good progress across the rest of our diversified portfolio. Just to mention a few examples. We've obtained an important label expansion for Eliquis. We continue to develop interesting early asset in immunoscience and HIV. We executed several business development transactions to make our I-O portfolio even stronger and to build the rest of our specialty portfolio in areas like fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. ","And we committed significant resources to increase our biologic capacity announcing strategic investments to expand our Devens, Massachusetts facility and build a new plant, totally new plant in Ireland. Biologics now comprise about 50% of our R&D portfolio and that number will continue to grow. So taken an altogether 2014 was a good important year for us. And strength of a strong foundation for our future, financially, commercially, clinically, by every indication Bristol-Myers Squibb is well positioned. We will of course continue to face challenges such as the economic losses of exclusivity in a very competitive market place. But we have the right product, the right plan and the right people to find our way through it all. In that, I have no doubt. And because we are in such a good position, I feel that my decision to retire as CEO into effective proposal from our Board to become Chairman come at the right time. And again I am very confident in Giovanni's ability to lead Bristol-Myers Squibb to build on our success over the past several years and to take our company forward. With the support of the outstanding management team that have the pleasure of putting together and lead. ","So with that I'd turn the floor over to Giovanni to provide our Q4 results. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio ","Thank you, Lamberto. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support. And more generally for his exceptional leadership over the last several years. He has led our company at a pivotal time. Navigating us through a challenging but exciting biopharma transformation. And leading us to our current position of strength. I am looking forward to continuing our work together as we transitioning to our new roles. ","So as Lamberto discussed, 2014 was a very good year that ended on a very good note. During the fourth quarter, we delivered 9% sales growth across our diversified portfolio and across our key markets, excluding our diabetes franchise and impact of foreign exchange. Let me touch on some of the highlights. First, Yervoy had a very good quarter with the 41% increase. In the US, this strong performance was driven by continued penetration into community sector. Outside the US, it was driven largely by its first line indication an improved access. Even with our success in 2014, we've recognized that the melanoma market dynamics will continue to evolve following the launch of Opdivo. While these may impact Yervoy's short term trends, we are very well positioned. In monotherapy, both our products have demonstrated overall survival. And in combination that have the potential to offer long-term survival to the largest number of patients. Eliquis has its best quarter ever with $281 million in sales. In the US, the expansion of the label was a key reason why sales grew 20% over the previous quarter. And we continued to make good progress in new two brand prescription by cardiologists. Outside the US, we also made good progress particularly in Germany and Japan. Looking forward, we have every reason to believe that Eliquis' strong performance trends will continue. ","Regarding Hepatitis C we had a really good quarter. Generally speaking, our strategy is to focus on difficult to treat patients and the unique medical need of each market. We made important progress. In Japan, with our dual regimen and in Europe where Daklinza is approved in combinations including sofosbuvir. ","In the US, we are working with the FDA and expect to be able to resubmit the Daklinza based on data from completed and ongoing studies. And lastly, we are very excited about the US approval of Opdivo. Our commercial organization was more than ready to go at the time of approval. Shipments were ready by year's end and our people have hit the ground running. We are leveraging Yervoy's established commercial presence, building on our strong relationships with physicians and payers. In fact, our commercial organization is actively promoting Opdivo. And within the first two weeks, we reached nearly 100% of the top accounts and already have 70% share of voice within the melanoma market. And while it is early, we are making good progress with access. Although we are primarily focused on Opdivo for melanoma in the US and hopefully soon in Europe following our O-63 and O-70 announcements, we are also preparing for potential approvals in lung later this year.","Charlie will talk about our 2014 financials and our outlook for 2015. But let me close with a few words about the coming year. Clearly, 2015 like every year will have its challenges and its opportunities. That's a given. But I am confident that we will successfully find our way through it all by continuing to execute against our strategy and by maintaining our balanced approach of driving results today while setting the stage for tomorrow. That means growth of our marketed products, strong product launches and continued investments in our portfolio of the future. And that means continuing to focus on leadership in immuno-oncology as a priority. But also remembering that we are a diversified specialty biopharma company. One with multiple products across multiple therapeutic areas.","And with that I'd turn the floor over to Charlie. ","Charlie Bancroft ","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will discuss the few items from our fourth quarter non GAAP P&L and our outlook for 2015. As Giovanni covered some of the highlights on sale, I will make just a few additional comments regarding revenues during the quarter. ","First, Eliquis sales were reduced by approximately $15 million in gross to net adjustments for the Medicare coverage gap. Sustiva benefited from a $30 million annual equity share true-up related to Atripla and finally our net revenues for Plavix and abraproabolib which are captured under matured product benefited from $36 million reduction in our returns reserve. With the dollar strengthening, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on both the top and bottom line. Compares to the same quarter last year the negative impact was 3% of sales and approximately $0.03 on EPS. ","Gross margin were 78% during the quarter, up 440 basis points compared to the same period last year, mostly due to product mix, following the divesture our global diabetes business. Marketing and selling and admin expenses increased about 9% in the quarter due in part to increased investments in key brands including Eliquis, Yervoy, Opdivo and our HTV franchise. ","R&D expenses increased primarily due to timing of spending across our R&D portfolio. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 10% during the quarter compared to almost 18% during the same period last year. Our Q4 rate reflects the full year of the R&D tax credit which was just extended in December. ","Now, I'd like to spend a few moments discussing capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach to using our capital. We feel good about the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility these resources give us to make important investment decision. We continue to see business development as a top priority and also remain committed to the dividend, which was recently increased for the sixth year in a row. In regard to business development, we believe that innovation must be sourced both internally and externally. We continue to look for BD opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core area of interest. We are committed to fully advancing by leading immuno-oncology portfolio. Our clinical collaboration strategy reflects our belief that combination therapy will be a key component of I-O in the future. And that we are open to exploring external I-O opportunity. ","Since the end of Q3, we\u2019ve announced four additional clinical collaborations including Opdivo. Overall, we have non clinical collaboration to study Opdivo in more than a dozen tumor types. In addition to these I-O collaborations, we also find several deals that will strengthen our specialty portfolio. We will continue to develop and diversify our R&D and commercial portfolios focusing on high quality opportunities that are closely aligned with our diversified, specialty biopharma strategy. ","I will now move to 2015 guidance. We are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $1.55 to $1.70. This range assumes current exchange rate and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. As a reminder, there are several factors to keep in mind which will have an impact our 2015 revenues. Our rights to Abilify in US and most remaining international markets expire in April. Abilify is a high margin product as we record our share of revenues without any meaningful associated cost. We will see a full year's impact on Baraclude sales in the US due to the loss of exclusivity last year. As we previously mentioned, we expect the negative impact on EPS of roughly $0.10 in 2015. As I commented during our October earnings call, revenues from matured products and other non core assets will decline significantly this year due to a one time step down of about $400 million related to expiring agreement. In addition, I remind you that this is a declining business. ","As you all know, the US dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2014 average rates and quite a bit just in January. Based on current FX rates, this will negatively impact our 2015 revenues by approximately $800 million and $0.12 to $0.14 on earnings per share. On the other hand, we expect continued growth in 2015 from the rest of our portfolio, where we are seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue. We are also very encouraged by the accelerated approval of Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma in US and hope to receive approvals in other countries in other tumors in 2015. ","We expect our full year gross margin to be approximately 74% in 2015. Our gross margin continues to be largely driven by product mix, loss of exclusivity and the structure of our co-promotion agreement for Eliquis. We expect these downward pressures to be partially offset by the growth of new products including Opdivo and our HCV portfolio. You will see our line item guidance for AMP, MS&A and R&D in our press release. ","Our operating expense projections reflect our new operating model, following the divesture of our global diabetes alliance early last year. We remain committed to invest in key opportunities including our late stage pipeline and the launch of Opdivo in the US in advanced melanoma and potential subsequent launches in other regions and indication. We also continue to drive growth of our priority plan including Yervoy, Eliquis, Orencia and Sprycel. We will however continue to be prudent with our resources on our older brand and leverage our specialty model. Our operating expenses outside the US will also be affected by prevailing exchange rate. ","On the R&D side, we expect to spend less in 2015 primarily due to decrease spending on diabetes clinical trial. ","Now we'll be happy to address your questions. ","John Elicker","Yes. I think we are ready to go to Q&A. And everybody, I just remind you that in addition to Lamberto, Giovanni, Charles, Francis is here to take any questions you might have. Candace?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And your first question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Tim Anderson ","Hi, thank you. Few questions if I could. Can you just outline for us when we might see human data on the next round of various checkpoint modulators that you have. Second question is just an update on Nivolumab and Yervoy trial on lung and when that case study would be starting? Do you have the data from the earlier stage studies in hand to pick the dose? So anything on that topic would be helpful. Then last question just an update on the timing of the elotuzumab second line trial in multiple myeloma. ","Giovanni Caforio","Good morning, Tim. Happy New Year. First of all, let me start I think you are talking about elotuzumab, let me talk to the back and -- however quick two study which is in relapsing is a second line relapsing but not from myeloma is on track for us to see data in the first half of this year. So obviously premature to discuss regulatory strategy but obviously if the data is positive we will be seeking to submit this around the world. As far as an update on the Opdivo, Yervoy phase 3 study first line in lung, I will say we completed the design phases there; we are on track to initiate. We are not providing any further detail on the --details although I will say to you it is a comprehensive study, it is in a broad lung population both in terms of histology and biomarker and we will be using different doses from the tumors we so far initiated combination studies and we really -- this combination does have the potential to provide incremental benefit across the broad lung cancer population. And as far as the earlier studies in other four compounds we had in development, what I would say they are progressing, those exploratory studies, we will be seeing dates at this year. We have not decided yet whether we will actually share that data publicly because of the intense competitive situation, but obviously like we have during last year, we see interesting data. We would be moving fast to potentially registration study and of course you will be able to see that in clinical trials.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","Mark Schoenebaum","Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. I like to offer my congratulation to Lamberto on a fantastic job. And best wishes to Giovanni on his next steps. If I may also ask on the I-O franchise. If you could just remind us timelines for the O-57 trial on the non squamous population? When we -- when your best estimate is, from when we could -- when you will have data from the interim analysis. And then I was wondering if you are willing to provide any color about your filings strategy for nivolumab in the second line lung cancer study now that you have one positive trail obviously in the squamous population and then just a broader question, the PBM have been and payers have been very focused on Hepatitis C and now that they seemed to be setting their sights on oncology. And I was just wondering if being -- the company launching probably the highest profile oncology drugs or if you had any reactions to that. Thank you so much. ","Lamberto Andreotti ","Well, Mark, first of all thank you for your nice words. I hope I will make one of your videos with same comments. And before Francis reply to your first two questions and Charlie and Giovanni to your third question, let me take the opportunity I will say few things quickly about immuno therapy because in the last few weeks -- the last few weeks have been really very excited for us at BMS and obviously for all the patients. And what I am really glad to see the potential in immunotherapy coming to fruition, first with Yervoy and now with Opdivo. Some of the strategic target that we made when we set our development and program is putting us now in what we believe is a very strong competitive position. We had always felt that it was important to address the broader set of patients is possible. We've also -- always believe in the importance of demonstrating a little survival and this is what counts patient, physicians and payers. And at the same time we have build our R&D people that build optionality into our clinical trial. So while the trial were designed to show survival, overall survival we have flexibility in evaluating our end points when we can accelerate program and finally we've also always believed in the important role for both monotherapy and combination regimen. I said all these because I believe that the recent results of our studies are validating our strategy. And now Francis you want to answer question on 56 or 57 and nivocyclomab [ph]","Francis Cuss ","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. Honestly, I was very pleased when the O-17 study second line squamous study was stopped early. We are reviewing the data in house and with our experts in lung cancer outside the company. We will be sharing the data with numerous regulatory authorities and we believe it is a very important event for both patients and for BMS. We've not made yet a decision when and where we will be presenting that data. As far as O-57 is concerned, as you are aware that is an event driven study, which means that the patients -- the interim study will be triggered once we reach the right number of events. It is also a different population to the squamous population in the sense that there are more therapeutic options to these patients. And they tend to be better with chemotherapy. So that's running behind -- that's why that's running behind the O-17 study. We obviously remain very confident about our trial design and the potential for Opdivo in lung cancer but obviously like every other study; I am looking forward to actually seeing the data before we can comment on what we will do next.","Giovanni Caforio","Mark and this is Giovanni. Thank you for your comments. With respect to PBMs and pricing and access in general, first of all, let me say that we've been operating in an environment with headwinds from a pricing and reimbursement perspective for quite some time. We understand that will continue including the US. A good example for us is Yervoy where over the last few years, we were able to work with payers around the world very proactively and effectively and Yervoy today is really reimbursed in every market around the world accordingly to label and access for patients has not been an issue. So when we think about this issue going forward obviously the first starting point is to have truly differentiating data and product profiles. And that's one of the reasons why for example as Lamberto mentioned we are focused on overall survival as a main point for our trial. The second one really is working collaboratively with payers around the world. We have very strong history of having done that in the past. And we continue to look at that as a priority for us. The third one is we price our products based on the value they offer to patients and the healthcare system. And as importantly we have in the US and other parts of the world, one of the most comprehensive and most effective reimbursement and patient support program in oncology and in the industry. So we are very focused on pricing an access, we are investing in this area and we are going to be proactively addressing every one of the area mentioned. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. And I offer my congratulation to Giovanni and Lamberto. Fantastic job, it has been a pleasure and I am sure we will continue to see each other, but question for you Francis, I am wondering if you could share your observations about Merck's lung strategy? How your lung data and indications might compare to there? They seemed to have breakthrough designation in population that accounts for 70% to 80% of lung compared to what we are seeing with you guys so far. So I am wondering if you could just comment on that. And secondly can you help us to think about and maybe Giovanni this is for you. Help us to think about the launch trajectory of this drug Opdivo, why -- how do we think about -- clearly what's going to drive sales will be label expansion and how do we think about the timing for label expansion and are you going to the FDA with O-17 now, are you planning to wait for the O-57 report out? Thanks very much. ","Francis Cuss ","Thank you, Jami. Happy new year to you. I am not going to comment really on Merck's strategy, but I would like to take the opportunity to comment on ours. And we have a very broad development structure in lung cancer as you know. We have 10 ongoing studies, we have 11 just about to start, and that's the first line combination study. And it is basically all population, all histology, all lines of therapy and both PD-L1 positive and negative. So it is a very comprehensive study and I think it is important to note that we have actually made significant progress over the last year. I think I told you all a year ago, it's going to be big year for data, for Opdivo and we would know lot more about Opdivo at the end of the year, and I think we've shown that particularly last few weeks which have been very exciting. So we completed our own submission for the third line of study in the United States and just to remind you we did make a submission having validated in Europe around the middle of the year. As you heard on the call, we couple of weeks ago we announced that the squamous study had been stopped because of Opdivo was superior in terms of overall survival. An overall survival we believe is the gold standard in cancer and very important attribute we believe I-O agent such Opdivo. And of course this marks the first time that any PD-1 has shown over sign in cancer, it is not the first time we've shown superiority, we of course showed it earlier last year in melanoma as well. As I just noted before, we are moving forward with the events proceeding in the non-squamous population. And we should, if our projections are right, get to that by the middle of the year. We also have a first line study underway, that started about a year ago. It is in PD-L1 positive patient and it is our intend to go beat chemotherapy double is in first line as we have already done in melanoma and in second line squamous. And just to rounded out I did mention then we will be starting a comprehensive study first line with our combination in this half of the year. So a very broad program. I am confident by the end of this next 12 months, we are going to have approval in lung and that we will have increasing submission around the world. Thank you very much.","Giovanni Caforio","And Jami this is Giovanni. Thank you. So with respect to launches and expectations for uptick, let me maybe start by saying we are really excited about the approval we have received at the end of December in advanced melanoma for Opdivo. And we started working on the launch and executing the launch immediately after the approval by yearend. We already have shipments in the market and our teams were actively promoting and while it clearly early we are very pleased that we have already reached about 100% over our work most important target and we have a very high 70% market share of voice in melanoma. That reflects the fact that we have been successful commercializing Yervoy over the last few years. And we gained a lot of experience in immuno-oncology and in the US marketing particular. So as we think about the future, obviously, we are ready for potential future launches later this year in lung in the US but we are also ready for launches in melanoma in lung in Europe and other key market. And we've made a lot of the investments needed in order to make sure that teams were properly staffed and ready to go. And obviously we will follow a very similar strategy of educating physicians on Opdivo immunotherapy and the strength of our data. I think it is important to remember that there is a significant percentage of the lung prescribing community which is different from the melanoma prescribing community. And as a result of that those physicians are probably at the beginning of their learning curve with respect to immuno-oncology, and I think it would be important for us to do the same education we did four years ago when we launched in melanoma. When you put all of those things together, we are very optimistic about the future but we obviously realized that there is a significant variability in 2015 because of timing of potential launches, the evolution of the label and speed of uptick in different tumor types. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann LLC. Your line is now open. ","Seamus Fernandez","Oh, thanks very much, thanks for the questions. And congratulation Lamberto and Giovanni. And congratulations to the whole team on the success of O-17. As we think about the opportunity for potentially accelerating uptick of Opdivo, the current indication is quite small; the third line indication in lung also is quite small at this point. But as we speak with payers, their feedback is that the incorporation of any of these products into the NCCN guideline or perhaps into a compendia listing would be -- could be critical to gaining access and allowing physicians to prescribe more broadly. Can you talk a little bit about how that typically lines up without an FDA label? And if there is an opportunity in your view and perhaps Giovanni can answer this one to see that move forward. And then separately on a bigger picture perspective perhaps Lamberto and Francis could comment on this a bit. But the focus on immuno-oncology has been extremely successful. If you -- as you seek to build out in other areas, one of the areas of focus we've seen GDD that the genetic disorders as a focus or drive disease is a focus and also fibrosis, is that really the direction we should see the company focused towards and what types of business development would you anticipate going forward? Thanks a lot.","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks, Seamus. This is Giovanni. Just to answer your first question on NCCN guideline and compendia listing. Obviously, we are focused on delivering data from a number of Phase 3 well controlled clinical trial with overall survival as the primary end point. And we believe that over time as the data evolved, it is very likely that the NCCN and other groups may include that data in their guidelines and recommendations. From our perspective, obviously in terms of our promotional efforts, we will focus on the label indication, but as we've seen in oncology, the strength of the data that emerges is often reflected in guidelines and pathways. ","Lamberto Andreotti ","And it is also dispensation our specialty portfolio, Seamus. I would let Francis discuss the different alternative but it is clear that our first goal has been that of making I-O presence, our I-O presence strong and deep and wide. And we will continue to go in that direction. But at the same time, we believe that what we are doing in GDD, in fibrosis and immunology or in virology to a certain extent, are all possible new areas in which we can follow the same strategy. So strong internal R&D, acquisitions of technologies products and inclusion of research groups into our own pipeline and team. And collaboration with other companies. And we are not at this point choosing one of the areas because it is premature to do so. So we are working on in different directions with the same approach but seem to have worked out well for immuno-oncology. Francis? ","Francis Cuss ","Good morning, Seamus. So let me say we are over excited about what's going on outside of I-O and so for instance, at the end of last year, we moved an HIV types inhibitor novel compound in Phase 3, and of course this year we are going to be exploring further the imminent stimulation in virology that's our platform allows us to do in immuno science. In addition, our exploratory portfolio in immuno science is progressing well, that's both biologic and small molecule. As you've seen with expanded portfolio in fibrosis with a couple of year end business development deals when we -- and we collect and during 2014, we moved a number of very novel compounds into the clinic. And I think it is epitomize really our approach this, what we did in GDD where we brought forward an anti-challenging body acquired from our iPierian high period [ph] but also from our internal programs, myostatin and active [ph] Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. So we are making progress across the number of these areas and the pipeline really made some good progression during 2014. Thanks. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Scala of Cowen and Company, LLC. Your line is now open. ","Steve Scala","Thank you so much. I joined the call a bit late so my apologies if these questions have already been asked. But first, in the last 25 years or so R&D at Bristol has only been down in two years. Now Bristol has perhaps its best pipeline ever and you are guiding for R&D to be down in 2015. I find that it a bit surprising. So can you tell us why that is the case? And if there is a trend that we should look forward to continue? And then secondly in melanoma Opdivo and Kutura [ph] have similar indication, so what do you are finding hospital formularies are doing? Are they stocking both products and they stocking one over the other? And what is the mental process that going through to make the decision? Thank you. ","Lamberto Andreotti ","Francis, do you want to comment, he expected I can make a comment that it is clear to me and it is clear to my management team and to my Board that we will continue to finance adequately more than adequately everything that make sense. So our resource is devoted I-O and our resource is devoted to our differentiation out there and we will spend in a productive way. But, Francis, anything?","Francis Cuss ","So just to build on that. We certainly have a very full set of such projects going forward into 2015 and we continue to do a number of productivity initiatives to make sure that our investments actually are very, very efficient.","Charlie Bancroft ","Yes, I would just add one other point, Steve. As I mentioned in my comments that we also have a step down in our diabetes clinical trials vis-\u00e0-vis the alliance that we have. So that's also impacting the year-over-year spent. ","Giovanni Caforio","And this is Giovanni. From the perspective of formula released to access for Opdivo, these are clearly very early days but we are starting from a position where we have established relationship with hospital and payers in the US., the early signals that we are seeing a quite positive, we have some initial good progress in access. So we are working and it is a priority but so far the signals are positive. ","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citigroup Inc. Your line is now open. ","Andrew Baum","Yes, two questions if I could. Firstly, could you just remind me when we'll see the one plus one data for the arm of Yervoy, Opdivo and number two, if my memory serves me correctly the recent Nature papers included representation from diagnostics of all your competitors, if I remember I think Bristol's contribution was lacking and obviously your diagnostics for PD-L1 has not shown the same predictive benefit as others. To what extent you -- its rating that diagnostic and I am assuming there is a new diagnostic, when will it be ready for prime time? And then my last question is on bio-specific. Could you tell me when your first bio-specific I-O agent will be entering the clinic many thanks?","Francis Cuss ","Thank you, Andrew. So let me go through these quickly. So the one data from the O-12 study continues to mature, it is very informative. We have not made the decision when we might present it and for competitive reasons we may not present it this year. I take issue with you over the fact that our diagnostic is not working. I think if you look at the data in our label and look at most labels it is very similar. So I think -- and then the platforms the same, so I think we are showing exactly what everyone else is showing. The differences is we've done a comprehensive program and we are looking much more comprehensive both the negative and the positive patients with the opportunity to get a label in both of those. And finally, as far as bio-specific, I know we have a very broad preclinical program based in California from-- heads up by Nils Lonberg, who is an acknowledged leader in this field. I am very comfortable with the breadth of that. We will certainly compliment that with additional business developments. But as far as bio-specifics, I think we will take every opportunity on its merit but we certainly got plenty of monotherapy moving up into the preclinical and for clinic. Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Your line is now pen. ","Vamil Divan","Thanks so much. And thanks for taking my questions. So couple if I could. One just on HEP C, I think what you said is that the filing in the US is going to be based on data you already have and also some ongoing studies. If it is correct, can you just bit a clear by maybe when those stages will be done and when exactly do you think you will be able to re-file in the US? And then my second question following up on the earlier one on the expense side. I'm just wondering if you can maybe help breakup some of these moving parts here, you mentioned the diabetes impact this year, also in terms of currency, you are having an impact this year. And then some of those might be more broader structural changes that might be more ongoing impact we are seeing in the expense line. So is there anyway just sort of quantify that the expense numbers are quite a bit below over your expecting, so how much of it is more of these one time type things for this year and how much might be more of an impact going forward? ","Charlie Bancroft ","Hey, Vamil, it is Charles. Maybe I'll start on the expense side. So if you look at just the exchange impact on expenses where we guided for example A&P decreasing in the mid to high teen range, if you excluded exchange that would be a decrease in the mid to low teens range. Similarly with MS&A, that would be a decrease in the mid to low single digit range if you exclude FX. And then in R&D, it also had an impact related to almost 1% on how we think about R&D. As I mentioned in comments, we are doing everything to invest in our opportunities, in our new launches as well as the critical brands within our key portfolio. We've also with the recent -- following the exit of the diabetes business, we also took the opportunity to reorganize and take expenses out particularly in our matured brand. So the combination of all those things and plus did the last add that I mentioned earlier around the diabetes expenses having a step down in R&D year-over-year. ","Francis Cuss ","Vamil, good morning. Just to remind you that our approach, our strategy with the fact is being to focus on difficult to treat patients around the world and that are the same in United States. We have a complete response letter, we are talking to the FDA about the answers to that and I am not going to details except to say that no new data will be required to make this submission. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. ","Chris Schott","Great, thanks very much. And I first just want to add my congratulations to both Lamberto and Giovanni with the new roles there. A couple of quick ones here. Maybe first can you elaborate on the dynamics between the O-I and the PD-1 in melanoma as we think about 2015, just little bit more about how you think that dynamic plays out. Second thing on melanoma, any updates on the O-69 study and the ability for Bristol to file off that data? And the final one just broadening out a little bit on the diagnostics. Do you expect the FDA to recommend testing for PD-L1 status for non-small cell lung cancer patients and with the number of different assays and even definitions of what PD-L1 positive means, how do you see that dynamic playing out in the market place so we think out over the next few years and seeing multiple agents enter the market? Thanks very much. ","Giovanni Caforio","So, Chris, good morning. And thank you. This is Giovanni. Let me just start towards the melanoma space. And first of all we are coming out of a very strong year, a very strong quarter for year, right. In the fourth quarter, we grew 41%, over 30% in the US versus prior year. And that's the reason why the fact that we've established a really strong presence in melanoma with 60% of our sales coming from the community setting and about 70% from our sales coming from first line. So we have a really strong base there. And I would say that we expect the melanoma market to be evolving rapidly over the last next 12 to 24 months. And obviously as a result of that like I mentioned earlier we see some uncertainty and volatility in the short term. But we actually see a very good, very well about our prospects in melanoma because we have two agents which in monotherapy both have demonstrated survival. And we have a combination strategy which really has the potential to provide long-term survival very significant percentage of patients. And so some short-term volatility but from a very strong starting point and with very positive prospects in the medium and long term. ","Francis Cuss ","Chris, good morning. So let me just comments on the O-69 study. I am very encouraged by the data I have seen, we have not yet decided where we will present that data. But it will be this year. I am not going to talk about the details of our ratings strategy but let me just zoom out a little bit and just mention our overall melanoma strategy. I mean I just remind you we have accelerated review [ph] for monotherapy in Europe. We are in the process of filing both second line and or first line around the world. And the combo is the part of that broader structure we are talking to authorities about the potential submission there. So I am looking forward to the rest of 2015 because I think you can see further submissions, further approvals around the world. And potentially broadening of our label. So it is very exciting for us to know that we are doing 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","John Boris","Thanks for taking the questions and would also like to extend my congratulations to both Lamberto and Giovanni. First has to do with your I-O franchise, certainly with you having a clinical development lead one advantage you potentially have is survival data not only in melanoma but potentially in lung, possibly renal in the future. Can you help me understand how long you might have that benefit because you did run well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials and having survival versus competitor that doesn't have survival data, how does that play with oncologist in the marketplace? Second question has to do with Eliquis, just on new to brand share with cardiologist, can you articulate a percentage there? You mention that broadening of the label was important in terms of expanding that and if that's surpassing Xaretto now? And last question just has to do with M&A very quickly. Can you maybe give some additional color especially since you're potentially being viewed as not as diversified as you historically have been? When you're looking at deals, are you looking at smaller or larger scale transactions to either diversify the business or to further position the business in oncology going forward? Thanks. ","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, John, this is Giovanni. On I-O, we believe that having overall survival is very meaningful. And in our experience it is obviously very meaningful to payers. It is important for prescribing physicians and it is obviously essential for patients. So we are very focused on that as Lamberto and Francis mentioned as very, very important part of our strategy. The second comment on Eliquis, we are very pleased with our performance in the US and other parts of the world specifically in the US, we've seen that the expansion of the label to include the treatment has accelerated. The growth of our prescribers base and also accelerated our trends in primary care. Our focus remains primarily in cardiology and our new two brand share in cardiology including VT and atrophic relation in the quarter in the US has grown from 41% to 47% which is a leading position. ","Lamberto Andreotti ","And as far as VT is concerned, I can say that nothing has changed than from my discussion in July and Charlie has been involved in all these over time, we will not change -- size is not the most important aspect, most important aspect is fit with our portfolio, fit our goals and good science and we continue to look at small and big things. And they are not medical also, good financial to say.","Operator","And your last question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning. And I'll add my congratulation as well for the transformation we are seeing with the company. Question on your gross margin guidance at 74% in 2015. It seems low compared to where you are at 78% right now. Is it mostly Abilify and is this a one time this in 2015 because we expect your overall product mix to basically offset the impact of Eliquis. And a follow up on the earlier questions. Could you give us a little bit more color on your revenue expectations for Opdivo and HEP-C in 2015? Your guidance suggests you have a conservative outlook there. Thank you.","Charlie Bancroft ","Okay. I'll start on gross margin and maybe Giovanni can touch on the revenue. Abilify, as I mentioned in my comments is a high margin product for us and we loose almost the entirely of that in April of this year. Eliquis was also which also which is a growing product for us also at very low margin because of our relationship with Pfizer. So we have lower 50% margin. And as we've said all along, our gross margin percentage is solely a function of product mix. So over time depending upon which products and their margin grow faster vis-\u00e0-vis the others that will have an impact on our margin. So it is hard to say at this point, at this juncture as we are launching Opdivo which has its very decent margin. And how our margin will play out over the longer term.","Giovanni Caforio","And from the perspective revenues. As I said before, first of all, we are really very excited about the potential for growth of the franchise. And we are getting ready for potential multiple launches in the US and Europe. But obviously there is a degree of variability in our forecast because of the timing of launches over the course of the next 12 months.","Lamberto Andreotti ","Okay. So we understand that Pfizer is waiting for you. So we let you go and we -- I want just to conclude by saying that we had a good fourth quarter and a good overall year. Across the organization, we believe we are stronger now and that enables us with the ground running in 2015. I am very happy. I am very proud of what we achieved. I am very confident in what we will achieve. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Elicker","Thanks, Orlando, and good morning everybody. We're here to discuss our second quarter earnings as well as the news that was press released last night. With me this morning, Giovanni and Charlie will prepared remarks. Chris Boerner, our Chief Commercial Officer will be here for Q&A, as well as Fouad Namouni, our Head of Oncology Development is here for Q&A as well.","I\u2019ll take care of the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we'll make statements about Company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the Company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change.","We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.","I'm pleased to speak with you today about our strong performance in the second quarter and the progress we've made on our planned acquisition of Celgene. But, first, let me start by discussing the results we announced last night and frame what it means for Opdivo and how I think about our outlook going forward.","With respect to 227 results, as you know, we announced important results last night. We had a successful outcome, but also a part of the trial that didn\u2019t meet its endpoint. Starting with the results of Part 1a, this is the third major tumor in which Opdivo+Yervoy shows an overall survival benefit in the first-line setting. And we believe these results represent a potentially differentiated opportunity in first-line lung cancer. If approved, the combination would provide an additional and chemo-sparing treatment option for patients. And I have full confidence in my commercial team's ability to execute in this competitive marketplace.","As we noted in the press release, we also saw in an exploratory analysis, an overall survival benefiting in PD-L1 negative patients. We\u2019ll be sharing all the data at an upcoming medical meeting. So, I won't go into the specifics today.","Now, turning to the results of Part 2. They were not what we had hoped for. There are, however, important aspects of the study results to keep in mind. First, we're looking at one-year landmark analysis. Opdivo plus chemo performed consistency with the experimental arms of other successful trials. The chemo control arm somewhat overperformed compared to what we regularly see. The performance of Opdivo was consistent with our expectations, but the trial was not positive.","The totality of the data we received from both Part 1 and Part 2 confirms our belief in the profile of Opdivo as an important medicine and further strengthens the value of the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. We know lung is a highly competitive market, and we are excited about the potential opportunity to offer a differentiated option for patients. We plan to discuss these results with health authorities, as soon as possible.","We continue to expect growth for Opdivo in the U.S. and ex-U.S. this year compared to last year. Looking forward, we see the growth trajectory for Opdivo being driven by data, supporting future approvals, and Charlie will discuss the near-term dynamics for Opdivo.","Now, let me turn to the second quarter results. Our results were driven by excellent commercial execution across the entire portfolio. Eliquis continues to drive significant growth through strong execution and the best-in-class profile with a compelling growth outlook ahead.","I've already talked a lot about Opdivo. And as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve had a really good quarter. Additionally, our results this quarter reflect strong financial discipline from an OpEx perspective. Charlie will provide more color on performance in the quarter and the potential opportunities that we see ahead.","Reflecting on a strong performance in the first half of the year and the clinical trial results, we announced last night, I want to move to discuss how I am thinking about the future company overall.","When we announced the Celgene acquisition in January, we said it was attractive from a strategic and from a financial perspective. As I speak with you today, I am even more convinced of the rationale of the deal and the exciting new company we are creating with the acquisition.","When we first announced the deal, we said we view the Celgene as providing us with a unique value-creation opportunity through five potential near-term launches and an attractive pipeline. As the year has progressed, we\u2019ve seen very positive developments with Celgene\u2019s business. Both IPRs for Revlimid were rejected and an additional settlement was announced. We\u2019ve seen the late stage pipeline opportunities move closer to launch with three of the big five, filed with the FDA and other health authorities.","As a combined company, we\u2019ll have a bolder and more diversified portfolio with significant growth prospects. In the medium term, we will have potential for four hematology launches, and ozanimod approval in multiple sclerosis and later in IBD, at TYK2 to approval in psoriasis among other indications, as well as lifecycle management opportunities for our I-O portfolio, including adjuvant therapies. ","Longer term, as we face losses of exclusivity in our portfolio in the second half of the next decade, we will be in a much stronger position as a combined company. We\u2019ll have an earlier lifecycle portfolio, including the potential six near-term launchers, the 50 Phase 1 and 2 programs will be maturing, and we expect our balance sheet to be reset, allowing us to continue to source external innovation through business development.","As you know, we announced the decision to divest OTEZLA, based on our ongoing discussions with the FTC, and we're currently engaged in a strategic sale process. Charlie will say more in a few moments.","I feel good about our preparedness for the integration and our ability to execute as a combined company. In June, I announced my future leadership team. The team includes key talent from across both companies and was selected to ensure key value drivers are protected. Specifically, it was critical to ring fence hematology and solid tumor commercial capabilities, while bringing best-in-class enabling functions to bear across the entire portfolio.","With R&D execution, a key priority for the combined company, we\u2019ve named two talented leaders, Rupert Vessey and Samit Hirawat to run the research and late stage development organizations, respectively.","I'm pleased to note that Samit has been with BMS for few weeks. As he transitions into the Company, he\u2019s not permitted to work on oncology development until the end of October. However, as John mentioned, Fouad is here today to answer your questions regarding oncology.","To conclude my remarks, I'd like to reiterate, I am pleased with our strong performance this quarter. I am encouraged by the results we announced in our first-line lung program and the potential opportunity to provide new treatment options to patients with unmet needs. I'm very excited to create a leading biopharma company and build significant value for our patients and shareholders.","And will that, I'll hand it over to Charlie.","Charlie Bancroft","Thanks, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone.","Building on Giovanni's comments about Checkmate-227, I'll start by providing some additional color regarding dynamics in our I-O business during the quarter and how we think about it moving forward.","In U.S., we continue to see strong share across indications including both metastatic and adjuvant melanoma, first-line renal cell and second-line lung. As expected, we also continue to see the size of the eligible pool of second-line lung patients decline, which has impacted demand sequentially.","Yervoy sales were also down sequentially in the U.S., primarily due to unfavorable inventory compared to Q1, and slightly lower demand from non-promoted use of Opdivo+Yervoy, especially in small cell lung cancer. Though there were some impact of increased competition within the first-line renal cell market, we maintained strong share at 35% to 40%, almost all being intermediate to poor risk patients.","Internationally, we continue to see the second-line lung opportunity being more durable than in the U.S. as the size of the patient pool declines much more slowly. Our teams have driven very good adoption of Opdivo+Yervoy in first-line renal cell for reimbursed markets such as Germany, Japan and the UK. In these markets, we are rapidly seeing first-line renal cell share that is similar to or in some cases higher than in the U.S.","Consistent with our experience in the U.S., we've also seen an expansion of the treated population for adjuvant melanoma in markets where it's reimbursed. This market is however more competitive than in the U.S., given Keytruda was launched around the same time.","Looking forward, we continue to expect year-over-year growth for Opdivo this year. With respect to 2020, we expect some pressure on Opdivo compared to 2019, given the competitive dynamics in the business and likely timing for approval of Checkmate-227. However, looking beyond 2020, we believe the potential launch opportunity in first-line lung cancer next year, along with additional potential future indications across metastatic and adjuvant settings will position Opdivo for growth in 2021.","Turning now to Eliquis, which delivered another remarkable quarter. Eliquis continues to cement its position as the number one option for anticoagulation treatment VTE and AF patients in many key markets around the world while enjoying substantial room for continued growth moving forward.","In the U.S. Eliquis demand grew over 30% compared to the second quarter last year. This was driven by continued expansion of the NOAC class with Eliquis commanding a leading share within the category. As I\u2019ve described in the past, the donut hole for Eliquis will be an important factor to bear in mind for the second half of the year. Recall that we accrue this as patients enter the donut hole, which means that the liability is relatively low in Q1 and Q2 but is substantially higher in Q3 and Q4. Additionally, the magnitude of the liability, which was roughly $550 million in 2018, will be much larger this year. The liability has increased from 50% to 70% this year, we've increased Eliquis volumes significantly, and we have a higher component of Medicare patients in our sales mix.","Looking forward to the longer term for Eliquis, we continue to see significant headroom for growth. Within the overall U.S. market, the Eliquis TRx share is currently just under 43% and will converge over time to our new-to-brand share, which stands at almost 55% today. We also expect to see the NOAC class continue to expand with continued declines in warfarin use. And with the best-in-class profile, we have seen Eliquis steadily increasing its share within the category. Finally, we believe there is potential to see the market expand over time as uncontrolled and undiagnosed patients enter treatment.","Now, turning to our future with Celgene. As Giovanni discussed, we are making good progress at preparing to integrate the companies, and we expect to close late this year or early next year.","Let me discuss some of the details starting with OTEZLA. We announced the planned divestiture late last month and are now preparing the sale process. We believe OTEZLA is an attractive asset and we have had significant interest from potential buyers. As you know, we will need to formalize and agree on the terms of the sale with the FTC, once we have a draft definitive sale agreement. At that point, we expect to enter into a consent decree with the FTC, which will allow the Celgene acquisition to close and subsequently for OTEZLA to be divested.","With respect to the EU process, the review period ends on July 29th, and we are targeting a Phase 1 clearance. We will provide an update when we receive the European Commission's decision.","In the quarter, we locked in our permanent financing for the deal by issuing $19 billion of bond financing at attractive rate. We continue to actively transfer the integration with very good collaboration between BMS and Celgene. And with the later close date, we now have more time to be even better prepared for day one. We are still expecting to achieve $2.5 billion of run rate synergies by the end of year three.","Regarding the phasing of synergies, there are couple of things to bear in mind. The close date has moved back, which is just a calendar impact, and synergies from OTEZLA, though modest, would have come later, and as we\u2019ve said, we believe we can absorb this impact.","A few comments on the overall financial outlook for the Company. As Giovanni described, we've seen the value rationale for the Celgene acquisition strengthen since we announced the deal with the pipeline opportunity continuing to progress. Since the financials for the S-4 were prepared at the end of last year, we've seen several important developments in addition to the OTEZLA divestment. Checkmate-227 is read out, the UPSA sale just closed, and three of Celgene\u2019s late stage pipeline assets have been filed with the FDA. Taking all these factors into account, we continue to see the opportunity to grow through 2025.","Until we close, the two companies will continue to evolve and the projections in the S-4 will become more stale. So, we don't plan to continue to reference or update them. However, we will provide a perspective on the Company's outlook soon after the deal closes.","Switching to capital allocation where we plan to continue our balanced approach. We remain committed to the dividends as evidenced by our 10-year track record of continual dividend increases. And as we\u2019ve previously mentioned, we've modeled annual increases in our pro forma financials.","In regard to our capital structure. We recognize the importance of deleveraging over the next few years. With this in mind, the OTEZLA proceeds, which we view as an acceleration of future cash flows, are planned to be used to reduce debt upfront and avoid excess initial leverage. We continue to expect to see our gross debt to EBITDA ratio at less than 1.5 times in 2023.","Business development continues to be important. We expect to remain active in early stage in smaller deals over the next few years, while working to reduce debt. Complementing the dividend, we have a solid history of distributing cash to shareholders with almost $8 billion of share repurchases over the past 10 years. And looking forward, we have already announced plans to execute a $5 billion ASR at the close. Similar to our past practice, we will review our plans for share repurchases continually, taking into account our cash and debt positions and alternatives for allocation of capital.","To close, we delivered another very strong quarter. We believe that the opportunity we have with the Opdivo+Yervoy in first-line lung along with the lifecycle management opportunities in I-O, our growing Eliquis franchise and the breadth of potential launches from Celgene, TYK2 and the earlier pipeline will position us well for the future.","Now, I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.","John Elicker","Thanks, Charlie. Orlando, I think, we're ready to go ahead to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Hi. Thank you. First question is, results of 227, how do they influence, how you now look at the odds of success on Checkmate-9LA? Does that trial have CTLA component? I\u2019m guessing you'd say the odds of success with that one have to be higher. Also, can I confirm that that trial stratifies by PD-L1 and not by TMB, which seem to make sense in light of the Part 1 findings.","And the second question is on Part 1 itself. Just directionally, hoping you can see whether the magnitude of clinical benefit was the same in PD-L1 positive versus negative patients. It seems that across few different tumor types now, CTLA-4 combination may offer its greatest value in the PD-L1 negative segment where we know that PD-1s at least by themselves don\u2019t really seem to work. Is that potentially where the best and easiest positioning of the combo would be?","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Tim. This is Giovanni. I'll ask Fouad to answer your two questions. I just want to start and reiterate how excited we are to have an opportunity to play in first-line lung cancer, which was what we now know with the results of Part 1a of 227 and particularly with Opdivo+Yervoy, which as you know we\u2019ve been successful in establishing in two other tumor types, melanoma and renal. So, I think that's important news for us. And I'll ask Fouad to give you his perspective on 9LA and PD-1 expression.","Fouad Namouni","Thank you, Giovanni, and thank you, Tim, for the question. We are confident in 9LA. Let me remind us what 9LA is. 9LA is the combination of two active Checkpoint inhibitors, Yervoy and Opdivo in first-line lung cancer added to two cycles of chemotherapy where the goal is to really manage the early progressions but also create a load of new antigens that will continue to stimulate the immune system. So, we continue to be confident in 9LA in the way it is designed. For your other questions around Part 1, and in fact, this is third time we see Yervoy and Opdivo perform in terms of overall survival versus standard of care in first-line -- in a cancer and this time in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. I think, we have seen clinically a significant and meaningful overall survival of the combination in first-line lung cancer PD-1 positive. We have seen improvement in overall survival in the exploratory analysis of PD-L1 negative. Overall, I would say, Tim, we are seeing the same pattern for Yervoy and Opdivo that we have seen in other tumors, like melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much for the questions. Just a little surprised by the new process with the beep. So, just a couple of quick questions. First off, I was just hoping the team could comment on whatever is possible to comment on relative to the Senate bill at this point and kind of the relative exposure that Bristol has to U.S. spending alone and then prospectively in combination with Celgene, and just hoping to get a little bit of your thoughts on the Senate bill itself. And then, separately, just hoping to get a little bit of color on 227. More than anything, the question really is, when we see the data presented, both from the Part 2 and the Part 1a study, are we going to not only fully understand, but also will come away with Bristol proving that the benefits of adding Opdivo on top of chemo therapy having clear benefit also in non-squamous patient perhaps on PFS. And then in terms of Opdivo+Yervoy, are we likely to walk away with a clear view that not only is Opdivo a monotherapy showing improvements, but that Yervoy on top of that is additive?","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Seamus. This is Giovanni. Let me start with your question on what's happening from a pricing and policy perspective. Obviously, as you\u2019ve seen the environment is very fluid in Washington. I think, these are early days. And it\u2019s difficult to point to specific outcomes of the dialogue that is happening in Congress. As you know, we\u2019ve discussed for quite some time the perspective that I have that we're at the beginning of the period of change from a policy perspective. And from my point of view, I actually support discussion about change because I think it's important to address the affordability issues that patients have.","Now, remember, those affordability issues are clearly primarily driven by benefit design and the very high out-of-pocket expense patients have because of the way insurance plans are designed, and some of the misaligned incentives in the system.","And one of the things that I would like to say is that we are concerned with many of the proposals that we are seeing, including some of the proposals that are included in the Senate bill, because while they are very punitive in many ways for the industry and particularly for companies that are focused on innovation, they don\u2019t really benefit many patients, they only benefit about 2% of patients in Medicare as currently grafted, and they don\u2019t address some of the misaligned incentives in the system. So, I think, we\u2019re all for change and we have proactively proposed policy solutions that address issues that are making it difficult for patients today. And I think what we've seen so far, doesn't address some of the big issues that we see in the marketplace.","Now, as I said before, I think, it's important to remember, from the very beginning, I felt that it was important for us during the period of policy transitions and changes, to have a broader and more diversified portfolio that goes across multiple types of reimbursement with more growth opportunities into different diseases and more launch opportunities to accelerate really the lifecycle of the portfolio. And I think that's what the Celgene acquisition does for us. I think, it becomes even more important, given the uncertainty of these days and times to have a broader portfolio, to have a more diversified portfolio. And I think it's critical for us. And that's what we do through Celgene.","Now, with respect to your question, going to the next level of detail, when we look at the impact of some of the measures that are being proposed, we can see, for example, that yes, there could be a potential impact for Revlimid. But, I would also remind you that some of those measures only would come into effect in 2022, when we would be really, I would say, at the end of the lifecycle of that asset. And also, there are other parts of our portfolio where there would be offsets going in the opposite direction.","So, I think it's early to give you a definitive answer on what the impact would be. But, I think that given the broad portfolio we have, I think you would see ups and downs. And many of them, obviously, would be impacted by where every one of the products would be in their lifecycle. And again, Opdivo -- sorry, Revlimid would be towards the end of that cycle.","Chris, do you have anything to add?","Chris Boerner","Yes. I mean, Seamus, let me just pick up where Giovanni left off. I think, you have a number of different proposals embedded within the Senate bill, there are a number of different additional steps that are going to be required before anything is enacted. And obviously, as you know, specifics matter here. What I would say is that, as Giovanni mentioned, having a more diversified portfolio is better. When you look at it on a product by product basis, obviously, the allocation of the business by payment mechanism is going to be important in determining the impact. What I will say is, from a BMS exposure, what we've said previously, I'll just remind you, is that looking across our business, we have about 24% of our business in Part B, about 26% in Part D, and relatively little Medicaid exposure.","With respect to Celgene, remember, we\u2019re two separate companies, so as for specifics, you would need to ask them. But multiple myeloma, for example, is primarily a disease of the elderly. So, we would skew a bit more towards the Medicare population.","Fouad Namouni","And Seamus, this is Fouad, for your second question around what we will see, what we will understand when we show the data from both Part 1 and more data from Part 2, will be the following. Let me start with Part 1. When we will show the data from Part 1, clearly, we will understand the performance of nivo and added benefit of Yervoy on top of nivo, very clearly. And we will understand also the overall pattern that we are seeing with immunotherapy combinations, like depth of response, rate of complete responder, the durability of response and the long-term survival. And I think these elements would be very clear when the data will be presented.","For Part 2, in addition to what was reported in the press release today, what we will understand is one, the performance nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus other combination of PD-1 and PD-L1 agent in chemotherapy. Basically, I think, we will see that the performance of nivolumab in chemotherapy is very consistent with what we have seen with other PD-1s and PD-L1 agent combined with chemotherapy. I think, we would see that the chemotherapy comparator arm in Checkmate, which we said on Part 2, has outperformed what we would expect in the standard of care. Let me remind us that, what we know from the activity in standard of care in terms of median overall survival, the chemotherapy is between 13 to 14 months, and this is supported by real-world evidence. I think, the chemotherapy arm outperformed in 227, maybe underperformed in other studies. And I think, this is broadly what people will take when we go in depth into the data from Part 2.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Thanks very much. Just two questions on 227. I guess, first on the Part 1 study. I know, you can't go into specific numbers yet. But, do you feel you need to see an overall survival hazard ratio close to that seen with chemo Keynote-189 for this offering to be competitive, or should -- or are you more focused on those factors, like CR rates and depth of responses you think about what you need to be to find kind of role and a niche for that combo?","My second question was on Part 2 and that stronger kind of control arm survival rate. Can you give us any color in terms of crossover rates in second-line -- to second-line I-O in Part 2, and was that meaningfully different than what we\u2019ve seen with prior competitor studies? Thanks very much.","Chris Boerner","This is Chris. Maybe let me start and then I'll turn it over to Fouad. As we said previously, as you think about how physicians have conversations with patients, very rarely do they have a discussion around hazard ratios. And so, we believe, what is important and what we hear from customers is, how are patients performing over time, so that would imply landmarks are very important. And one of the key drivers for treatment choice in first-line lung cancer continues to be our product showing durable efficacy. And so, when you step back and you think about first-line lung cancer, despite all of the progress that we've made in that area over the last few years, we need to keep in mind that the majority of patients progress within one year. And in doing so, many of the spaces actually burn through two options, I-O and chemo. So, there is a need for more options that potentially spare patients from chemotherapy and have proven OS and durability benefit, and that's what we hear consistently with respect to how physicians are going to make choice in first-line lung cancer.","Fouad Namouni","And that with regards to the Part 2 crossover, to I-O therapy in the chemotherapy reference arm, we have seen a level of crossover, about a third of patients, which is consistent with many other trials. And we do not believe that the crossover is the reason explaining the output performance of our chemotherapy arm.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Navin Jacob with UBS.","Navin Jacob","I just wanted to understand the rationale behind the non-squamous as the primary endpoint for Part 2. The squamous data looked quite good in comparison to 407. And if you could, as it correlates to that, could to clarify if 9LA has a similar design as Part 1a where the primary endpoint is also specific to non-squamous\u2026","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Navin, for your questions. So, first, the non-squamous and the primary endpoint, this is the largest population, this study. The squamous population is pretty really a small percentage of the first-line. Data available to us at the time showed, there is benefit, and most of the benefit we see in the non-squamous population. Therefore, the study was really designed to ask the non-squamous question. For 9LA, the study is designed to go to all commerce in terms of histology and biomarkers. And looking at the first-line population of patients is different where you combine both checkpoint inhibitor and diminishing the number of cycles of chemotherapy.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Maybe as you think about the outperformance of the chemo arm in Part 2 of Checkmate-227, can you help us think about your adjuvant program and maybe again any puts and takes there as you think about design or performance of those control arms and just confidence level in those trials, given that chemo outperformance that you saw in 227 Part 2? Thank you.","Fouad Namouni","So, in the adjuvant space, I think -- so first, we're very pleased to see our data in the first-line setting with Part 1a. And we believe the performance of immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting really will be good and makes us really confident in the adjuvant setting. In terms of standard of care, there were so many evolution and changes in the management patients in terms of supportive care and how we do it in the metastatic setting of lung cancer. There was not a lot of progress in the adjuvant setting in terms of standard of care and comparators. And we believe that our adjuvant and early program is pretty strong, and actually we have, as you probably have seen, started steady in this stage 3 setting of lung cancer of nivolumab and nivolumab plus Yervoy versus durvalumab and looking at overall survival in this population of patients.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala","The Company seems to be suggesting that the tail of the Opdivo+Yervoy curve will impress in Part 1a when its presented, it has been mentioned two or three times on this call already. In Keynote-189, Keytruda plus chemo saw 69% of patients alive at 12 months. So, I\u2019m interpreting Bristol's positive tone as Opdivo+Yervoy will show more than 69% of patients alive when Part 1a is presented. And I\u2019m just wondering, would you suggest, I consider other interpretations of the Company's positive tone? So, that\u2019s the first question.","Giovanni Caforio","Go ahead, Steve.","Steve Scala","Yes. The second question, is the Company dealing with crossover differently in 9LA than Checkmate-227? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. Steve, let me just start before Fouad answers your two questions, by saying, I think, we\u2019ve really pointed to the types of benefits that I-O and plus I-O. And we\u2019ve seen consistently in tumors where Opdivo+Yervoy has provided a benefit. The physicians really have valued deep responses, complete responses, the durability of responses, and as the follow-up of those studies has continued is when we really started to see the value of the trend. So, I think that's an important consideration. But, Fouad?","Fouad Namouni","I think, Giovanni summarized very well our observations on the lung cancer. I would just add, this is a pattern that we have seen in other -- two other major cancers, in melanoma and in renal cell. For the question on 9LA crossover, the crossover is not systematic in 9LA, it was not systematic in 227. So, patients, when they progress in the study on the chemotherapy arm, they will receive standard of care therapy by their physicians.","Chris Boerner","And this is Chris. Let me just jump in here and make a couple of comments. So, first, as I mentioned, there's still considerable unmet need in first-line lung cancer. And we think there's an important role that Opdivo+Yervoy has to play. And I think that as you begin to think through what that opportunity could look like, remember the experience that we've had without Opdivo and Yervoy in melanoma and renal cell which are the two diseases in which we've seen significant benefit there. And what we see with the regimen is significant responses, including impressive CR rates, you see durable responses, you do see a compelling overall survival benefit that has that characteristic plateau in the Kaplan-Meier curve, which appears to be somewhat differentiated from other mechanisms. And you see a side effect profile that has advantages relative to chemotherapy. So, we think there's an important role to play for dual I-O therapy without Opdivo+Yervoy in that setting.","The other thing I would say is that when you look at Opdivo+Yervoy and the clinical trials also, we see in the market when we hear back from customers is, it's very consistent with their real world experience with the regimen. Why is that important? Well, first, that\u2019s frequency, not the case with other modalities. And second, we have a strong base of Opdivo+Yervoy users across tumors. In fact, and when you look in lung cancer, of the highest prescribers in lung cancer, just over half of those physicians have used Opdivo+Yervoy in another tumor, notably melanoma and renal. And if you look at all of the targets in lung cancer, just over 30% have used Opdivo+Yervoy in other tumors. And those physicians account for about 45% of the total opportunity in lung cancer. And those are the very physicians who have made Opdivo+Yervoy a standard of care in those other tumors.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll hear from Matt Phipps from William Blair.","Matt Phipps","Thanks for taking my question. I guess, on the Part 1a or Part 1, you\u2019ve now had Opdivo+Yervoy show improved survival, at least numerically in both the biomarker positive and biomarker negative population. So, how do you think about the totality of data when you're talking to these physicians and regulators as far as patient populations? And then, secondly, can you talk just generally about the potential for approval neoadjuvant lung cancer, based on pathological complete response rate?","Fouad Namouni","Matt, thank you for the question for Part 1a and Part 1. Overall, as we said, we have seen clear benefit, clinically meaningful and statistically significant of Yervoy+Opdivo in the primary end of the study, which is in PD-1 positive. We have also seen good survival benefits in the PD-L1 negative. I think, the totality of the data will be seen. We\u2019re not going to comment on our interaction with health authorities. They will be happening in the next days and weeks. But, I think, we have seen benefit across the board in terms of biomarkers, in terms of the totality of the data.","In terms of neoadjuvant, I think, major pathological responses in lung cancer has not been actually used historically as an approval and endpoint by the USFDA by our health authorities. On the other hand, it\u2019s going to depend on how meaningful is the data. And when we see our data from study 186, we will be able to interact with authorities and see what will be the outcome of that.","Chris Boerner","And the only thing I would add to that is that, while obviously we\u2019ll have to see how the discussions with regulators proceed, what I would say is, just consistent with what I've mentioned previously, we think A, there is opportunity in first-line lung cancer from an unmet need standpoint and we think that Opdivo+Yervoy has the opportunity to provide an important treatment option in PD-L1 patients across the full spectrum of PD-L1 patients, positive patients.","Operator","And next, we will hear from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to come back to comments about Opdivo in 2020 and just make sure I understand the moving parts, correctly. So, it sounds like, it\u2019s flat or down year, driven by the drag on sales for lung cancer in 2020, presumably with like maybe flattish sales in renal with growth coming from melanoma and some of the other tumors. So, I just wanted to make sure, I sort of had a rough sense of how the moving parts will evolve before you get the lung expansion opportunity in 2021.","And then, my second question, can you just elaborate a little bit more on FTC trends as it pertains to defining markets? And really what I'm getting at here is, whether or not your sales process could include companies that have meaningful share in the injectable space of moderate to severe psoriasis? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks, Jason. Let me ask Chris to give you some perspective on different dynamics impacting the Opdivo business today and into next year. And then, Charlie can comment on the FTC and where we stand, and what's the process there.","Chris Boerner","Yes. So, let me just start with, as we think about 2020, obviously performance in \u201819 becomes very relevant. So, where we are today, we continue to see strength in our core business. We continue to lead in virtually every tumor in which we are promoting. And as you think about our core tumors, the large tumors, first-line metastatic melanoma, second-line renal cell, second-line HCC, we continue to see I-O shares at or greater than 50%. And then, we've talked a lot about the two big growth drivers that we have for this year, which are notably first-line renal cell and adjuvant melanoma. And again, there, very happy with the continued performance of the teams. In first-line renal cell in the U.S., we are holding share at around 35%. Obviously, we have seen some impact of I-O plus TKI, mainly in the favorable patients less so in intermediate and poor, which is where we are indicated. And then, outside of the U.S., we\u2019ve seen good uptake in key markets, notably Germany and Japan, where we have access and we expect additional access approvals later in the year.","Similar story on the adjuvant melanoma side, U.S. shares still holding around 70%, in spite of competitive entries there, and outside of U.S. is still very early in terms of access.","As we think about 2020, while we're very pleased with the results that we presented yesterday for Part 1a, given the competitive dynamics, the timing of data readouts, we do think there will be some pressure on Opdivo in 2020. But the growth picture becomes much clearer as you get into 2021. And exactly what that profile looks like is going to be informed obviously by the opportunities we see with 227. You will continue to see a stabilizing of the dynamics in second-line lung cancer, which is important. Just to remind you, we expect second-line lung in the U.S. to stabilize in terms of I-O eligible patients at the end of this year, little bit later as you get into ex-U.S. market. And then, clearly, we will be looking for some key study readouts that will inform that near-term growth picture, notably 9LA in lung cancer. We\u2019ve got first line GBM, 9ER in first-line renal cell and then first-line studies in head and neck and esophageal. As you get later out, clearly, the adjuvant programs become important.","Charlie Bancroft","Yes. Just, Jason, in regard to your question on the FTC. We believe that the divestiture of OTEZLA will satisfy the FTC\u2019s concerns and allow us to close the transaction on a timely basis. We won't have full clarity on who is an acceptable bidder until we present a draft sales agreement to the SEC. But had to had some preliminary perspective from the FTC. So, we feel directionally we have a good understanding. As I mentioned in my comments, based upon what we see today, we believe we will be able to run a robust process that will generate significant bidding interest.","Operator","[Operator instructions] Next, we\u2019ll hear from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat","First, I want to touch upon a trial I feel like we haven't had much discussion on, which is your LAG-3 Phase 3 melanoma, which is due perhaps in the next 12 months or so as per ClinicalTrials at least. And my question is, we know it\u2019s fully enrolled. And where is your expectation and how are you thinking about the trial? I also noticed it has a PFS primary endpoint, not an OS. So, I was curious to get your perspective on that. And then, secondly, it was helpful commentary on the market shares in various Opdivo indications. I was curious if you could give a bridge on a dollar basis on progression of sales from 1Q to 2Q, for Opdivo U.S. Thank you very much.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you. Why don\u2019t we start with Fouad on the LAG-3 program. ","Fouad Namouni","Thank you, Umer for the question and the melanoma development -- LAG-3 is a Phase 2\/3 study. Looking at the addition of LAG-3 to Opdivo -- comparing to Opdivo. I think as you mentioned, we will have in the next month the first readout from the Phase 2 part and we will see if we hit the threshold to move to the Phase 3 part, as we said earlier.","Chris Boerner","And then, let me just comment on Q2 dynamics. So, Q2 dynamics, Opdivo was down slightly about 1% in the U.S. And that\u2019s really a function of a few things. First, we continue to see pressure in second-line lung cancer, due to the decline in the overall opportunity. That's what I referenced previously around the percent of I-O eligible patients. What I will say though is within the pool of I-O eligible patients, we continue to hold a market share for Opdivo of around 40%. We've also seen some competitive impact in tumors outside of any discussion around lung cancer, notably in first line renal cell, and I referenced those previously. Again, they\u2019re in that market. I\u2019m very proud that the team\u2019s holding share of roughly 30% to 35%. And the impact really of I-O TKI has been confined to favorable patients. And where they have gotten additional uptake outside of those favorable patients, has mainly come at the expense of monotherapy TKI.","And then, beyond that, I think we\u2019ve spoken to what the near-term opportunity looks like for Opdivo. ","Operator","And next, we'll here from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Thanks very much. I just wanted to pivot to ask about the TYK2 development program. Could you just provide an update on key trial progress, and when you expect enrollment to complete, and when you expect to be able to share key results? Thank you. ","Giovanni Caforio","Sure, David. Good morning. This is Giovanni. So, as you will remember, we have two studies in our Phase 3 program for TYK2, and both studies are progressing rapidly through the enrollment period. And the design of those studies requires a one year treatment period. And so, we do expect to see data, one year after the completion of enrollment, which I expect to be sometime towards the end of next year, in that timeframe.","Chris Boerner","The only thing I would just add to that is we continue to be very excited about the profile of TYK2 and how it can play an important role in psoriasis. As you may recall, psoriasis is a debilitating disease, has very serious comorbidities, there's a considerable psychosocial cost associated with the disease. And based on what we've seen with TYK2, at least in the early days, we're seeing very good activity approaching biological efficacy with an easier mode of administration. So, we think it has an important role to potentially play in psoriasis. And from a commercial perspective, we're still very excited about the opportunity here.","John Elicker","Orlando, do we have any more questions?","Operator","And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Elicker for additional or closing remarks.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you. Thanks, everyone. In closing, this is an important time for us at Bristol-Myers Squibb. We've had another strong quarter demonstrating our ability to execute on many priorities. We delivered good financial results, driven by strong commercial execution. And going forward, we will continue to advance our pipeline and progress the integration planning with Celgene, including the divestiture of OTEZLA. The data that we announced in first-line lung cancer has really the potential to help us bring a new and an important option to more cancer patients who continue to have important unmet needs.","Thanks everyone for participating in the call.","John Elicker","Thanks, everybody.

Mr. John Elicker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Public Affairs, you may begin your conference.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Jonathan, and good morning, everybody. I know it's been a busy day, so we do appreciate you joining us for today's call to review our third quarter results. With me this morning is Giovanni Caforio, our CEO; Charlie Bancroft, our CFO. They will both have prepared remarks. And then joining for Q&A as well will be Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer, and Murdo Gordon, our Head of Worldwide Markets.","Before I turn it over to Giovanni, let me take care of the Safe Harbor language: During the call we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.

We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change.","During the call we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.","Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter I spoke to you about the promise of our exciting new chapter and the potential for sustained growth, the tremendous opportunity we have to lead in I-O and transform the way cancer is treated, and our strategy to strengthen and expand our diversified portfolio of specialty medicines. During the third quarter, we made important progress across the board. It was a very good quarter. Business performance was strong. We had significant clinical and regulatory successes, and we recently announced two business development deals.","Regarding performance, we had $4.1 billion in sales, a 4% year-over-year increase. Opdivo and Eliquis, our key growth drivers, showed strong demand in the market. Opdivo sales were just over $300 million, reflecting a strong uptake in squamous lung cancer and melanoma, particularly in the U.S., but also in Germany. Following the recent approval of non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer based on the 057 study, we now expect to be in an even more competitive position in the U.S. Eliquis prescription trends continue to be very positive, and we remain encouraged by what we are seeing in our key markets. And it was also a very good quarter for our other marketed products, namely our hepatitis C franchise, despite the increasingly competitive hep C landscape, as well as Orencia and Sprycel.","Regarding clinical and regulatory milestones, we also had a very strong quarter, most notably with respect to I-O. Specifically, we continue to improve on our competitive position in lung cancer. Opdivo just received another early FDA approval, expanding the label to now include non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We have a very strong label with a demonstrated overall survival benefit in a broad population, regardless of PD-L1 expression and no requirement for PD-L1 biomarker testing.","In first line, we presented promising data on the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination regimen at World Lung. Based on our data, we feel confident in our first-line strategy, with ongoing trials for PD-L1 expressors while we are finalizing our plans for PD-L1 nonexpressors.","In melanoma, we are very pleased to have received U.S. approval for our Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen, making it the first I-O combination therapy to be approved for any type of cancer. And with renal cell carcinoma, as you will recall, we announced in July that the 025 study was stopped early, the fourth such announcement we've been able to make with Opdivo, something for which I am very proud.","A few weeks ago at ESMO, we presented important data from that Phase 3 study, which demonstrated superior overall survival for Opdivo versus standard of care in advanced or metastatic RCC. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to Opdivo for this potential indication, and we are working are regulators and anticipate filing in the U.S. and the EU by the end of the year.","And lastly, our application for elotuzumab for multiple myeloma was accepted by the FDA for priority review with a PDUFA date of February 29. This followed a similar action by the European Medicines Agency, which granted elotuzumab accelerated assessment.","Given all the progress we made immuno-oncology during the quarter \u2013 clinical, regulatory, and commercial \u2013 it is clear to me that we are rapidly changing the standard of care across multiple cancers. We are strengthening our leadership position, and we are successfully growing our business.","With respect to business development, we continue to invest in building a diversified pipeline, within I-O and beyond. Recently we signed agreements to license or acquire exciting programs in I-O and fibrosis. Going forward, I expect we will continue to expand our portfolio to strengthen our leadership position in I-O and also to enhance our non-oncology businesses. Charlie will elaborate further on our business performance and business development in his prepared remarks.","Again, I am very pleased with our third quarter results and continue to feel good about where we are and where we are headed. We have an established, proven strategy. Our performance across the company, from commercial through R&D, is strong. And we are making the investments necessary to deliver on the promise of our exciting portfolio. We are entering our exciting next chapter from a position of strength and with a great deal of optimism.","And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. As Giovanni just mentioned, we had a very good quarter, driven by strong sales growth of 4% or 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Overall, FX had a negative impact on EPS of approximately $0.05.","Let me provide a few highlights. Opdivo sales were $305 million for the quarter. In second-line lung cancer, Opdivo has quickly become the standard of care. Roughly 75% of new squamous patients are being treated with Opdivo, and physicians are also prescribing Opdivo in the non-squamous setting, given the updated NCCN guidelines in June. With the recent FDA approval in non-squamous and no biomarker testing requirement, we believe Opdivo is in a very strong competitive position in all second-line lung patients.","In melanoma, we are beginning to see usage in combination and expect our competitive position to be strengthened with the expected upcoming approvals for studies 066 and 067. Importantly, access continues to be very strong, as we have nearly 100% coverage for Opdivo in the U.S.","Internationally, Opdivo has now been approved in over 38 countries. In Europe, we have approval for both first- and second-line melanoma and squamous lung cancer. Our trends in Germany are strong, and we are working through the reimbursement process for most other EU countries.","Yervoy sales were $240 million in the third quarter. As we've discussed, we continue to see an impact of the PD-1 in melanoma in both the U.S. and EU. We do believe Yervoy will play an important role in combination with Opdivo going forward, not only in melanoma but potentially in many tumors, including lung and renal. Over time we expect the regimen, once launched around the world, will allow the Yervoy business to stabilize.","Eliquis sales were $466 million, up 7% sequentially from the second quarter. Prescription trends remain strong, both in the U.S. and internationally. U.S. TRx growth was up over 18% versus prior quarter, although sales were flat. This was primarily due to the impact of the Medicare coverage gap, or donut hole, which kicks in around this time of the year. We continue to be encouraged by very strong new-to-brand prescription trends with both cardiologists and primary care physicians.","Hep C sales were very strong for the quarter at just over $400 million. During the quarter, we launched Daklinza in the U.S. for combination use in genotype 3 patients and recorded $111 million in sales. While the trends are early, our sales in the quarter reflect strong demand, VA purchases, and some inventory stocking. We have also filed additional indications for HIV co-infected, cirrhotic, and post-transplant patients. Our business in Japan continued to do reasonably well in the quarter, but we do see an increasingly competitive landscape there, which will impact our business going forward.","Now, let me highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was unfavorable 180 basis points compared to prior year, primarily due to manufacturing variances, the contractual expiration of Abilify in the U.S. earlier this year, and higher sales of Eliquis. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher sales of Opdivo and hep C. Compared with our second quarter, gross margin is down 290 basis points. Recall that last quarter we recognized previously deferred hep C sales in France and had roughly one month of Abilify sales.","Overall, operating expenses were higher than last year, as we are seeing the impact from the incremental investments we mentioned last quarter. These initiatives in commercial, medical, and R&D, primarily behind Opdivo and Eliquis, are continuing into Q4 and 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter is in line with last year, and on a quarterly basis will fluctuate based on earnings mix. Our Q3 rate does not include the R&D tax credit, which has yet to be passed by Congress.","Moving to business development, we have recently executed against two early-stage opportunities which served to strengthen our pipeline. In fibrosis, we acquired an exclusive option to the worldwide rights of Promedior's lead asset, which is being studied in two orphan fibrotic diseases, myelofibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with the potential to prevent and possibly reverse fibrosis. In oncology, we licensed worldwide rights to a CSF1R antibody from Five Prime. This agreement expands our existing collaboration and further supports our early-stage I-O development strategy of targeting the tumor microenvironment.","Now, let me provide some comments on our revised guidance. We have increased our guidance range for both revenues and EPS due to strong sales trends, primarily from Opdivo, Eliquis, and hep C that have exceeded our expectations. For tax, we expect an effective rate of 20% due to earnings mix. As Giovanni mentioned, we remain very confident in the growth opportunity of the company. Over the next several years, we see meaningful growth from our portfolio, which will disproportionately come from Opdivo and Eliquis. And as previously discussed, we are making strategic investments to support these important growth products.","To conclude, we are very encouraged by our continued good clinical results, regulatory approvals, and strong underlying sales trends and metrics from our key brands that are important to our future growth outlook. We would now be happy to address your questions.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jonathan, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A. And just as a reminder for everybody, in addition to Giovanni and Charlie, Francis and Murdo are here to answer any questions you might have. Jonathan?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore","Guys, thanks a lot for taking the question, and congrats on nice Opdivo sales. Yervoy's obviously declining. I was just wondering if you could, at least qualitatively, describe just kind of where you think that will bottom. Obviously, it should begin to pick up once the combination \u2013 if and when the combination of Yervoy and NIVO become standard of care in melanoma. Maybe you could help us understand how long you think that will take to happen. Is that going to require a lot of physician education, or is that adoption going to be quite rapid, and thus stabilize or grow Yervoy from here?","And then, on hep C \u2013 maybe you said this on the call, but I'm sorry, John, if I missed this \u2013 but did you guys actually break out specifically, sales in the EU and Japan? Japan I'm the most \u2013 I'm interested in, if possible.","And then, when will you have the next data update on the Yervoy plus NIVO combo in lung? Thank you.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yes, hi, Mark. It's Murdo here. Thanks for the question. Yeah, you're right in your observation. Yervoy is obviously seeing some pressure from the rapid uptake of the PD-1 entrants into the melanoma marketplace. And Yervoy monotherapy in front line has decreased. We're obviously very happy about the recent approval of the regimen by the FDA, and we are fully promoting that regimen now. So in the U.S., I think we'll see some stabilization of Yervoy between now and the end of the year. It's obviously a very early launch, so we don't have historical trends. We have seen some early uptake of the regimen already in the market, and in fact, about 10% to 15% of new patients are actually receiving the regimen. So that's a good signal that there's already good demand in the market. And we're hearing positive things from community oncologists about their interest in using the regimen as well. I think, when we go outside of the U.S., it's going to obviously take a little longer, because it'll take time to secure reimbursement. So I would expect Yervoy to continue to be under some pressure ex-U.S.","On hepatitis C, the Japan sales, I'll turn it over to Charlie. He can break that out for you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so in Japan, the sales were $175 million. And that's down from about $235 million, if I recall, in the second quarter. For Europe, the sales were roughly $75 million.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Mark. So, let me say that the 227 study is recruiting. We've added now a chemotherapy arm to the nonexpressors, and there'll be different chemo combinations, depending on histology and the geography, either Opdivo plus pemetrexed in the platinum doublet, or Opdivo plus gemcitabine in the platinum doublet. And in the study, Opdivo and chemo will be dosed concurrently. You'll see this amendment posted to ClinTrials.gov shortly, but of course we'll be updating you next year on the progress of the 012 combination studies as they become available.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Okay, Jonathan, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Oh, thanks for the question. So just a couple of quick things. Can you guys update us, maybe a little bit, when we might see, first off, the updates in terms of other combinations that you're developing in I-O? I think previously, you had said that you would have data in-house from some of these other \u2013 the early combinations, early next year.","The second question is just on specifically, when might we see data coming from other parts of your pipeline and the non-I-O parts of your pipeline? Or when would you hope to reveal some of that?","And then the final question:. Just in terms of the recent NCCN guideline update, can you just lay out for us the importance of the NCCN guideline updates relative to the label, as well as reimbursements, and maybe just give us \u2013 can you give us a sense of how that might improve reimbursement rejections, if there are any, or if you see upside from that update? Thanks.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good morning, Seamus. So let me confirm, we will be getting data from some of the exploratory programs in-house by the end of this year and early next year. And we'll be presenting that data, at least on some of those assets, in 2016. As far as the rest of the non-I-O portfolio, we are looking to see some preliminary data in the second half of next year potentially. Does depend a little bit on the different programs, but we're hopeful to see some there. (19:29)","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Seamus, this is Giovanni. Just on the I-O portfolio and specifically with respect to the early portfolio, to add on what Francis was saying, it's clearly \u2013 it is clear to us that we are in a leadership position in immuno-oncology. It is also clear that we have a very strong belief in the potential of the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, and we are doing the studies you're aware of in melanoma, lung cancer, renal cell, but it is also a very important priority for us to continue to advance the rest of our portfolio, look at new mechanisms of action, potentially new combinations. It's a priority for us, and you will continue to see that as the new data emerges, because while we've made a lot of progress, we're clearly focused on continuing to innovate in this space.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yeah, thanks, Seamus, for the question on NCCN guidelines. This was a fairly significant update because it now affirms, with overall survival data for Opdivo, we've been able to establish a category 1 recommend in front-line metastatic melanoma and in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, both in squamous and now in non-squamous, regardless of PD-L1 status. So for prescribers out there, it's a really clear update that they can use Opdivo without any requirement to having a test result for reimbursement. So we're feeling very good about that. I think that that will help build confidence for prescribers and for patients alike, that reimbursement will indeed be appropriate for Opdivo in an all-comer patient population in lung. We also \u2013 just as a reminder, we continue to have Yervoy plus Opdivo as a category 2A recommendation in first and second line as the regimen in melanoma.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jonathan, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the question. Just I guess building off the second-line lung dynamics (21:46) out here, your competitor has talked about an expanded use of diagnostics (21:55) over time. I guess what role do you see for diagnostics? My second was on (21:59). Where are we right now with share there, and do you believe you'll be able to get that type penetration (22:04) as quickly as you did in the squam market? And then a final quick one is on the expense (22:13) going forward. Should we think about significant further step up in expenses going forward, or do these 3Q levels reflect the incremental investment that you're putting behind your growth franchises? Thanks very much.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Okay, Chris, you were breaking up a little, so I apologize if I don't catch all of your questions, but I think you had three things in there. You were asking us about what do we think the diagnostic dynamic's is going to be in the market, what is happening with non-squamous uptake, and lastly what should we be thinking about expenses going forward, which I'll turn over to Charlie. I'll take a stab at the first two.","You know, it's really interesting, in second-line lung, the good news is physicians can use Opdivo in an all-comer patient population, according to our label across non-squamous and squamous. So really the testing for Opdivo is to better inform a physician-patient dialogue on what expectations should be around response to Opdivo. But the good news is you don't have to wait for that test result before treating a patient, and you don't have to inform a patient that they might not be eligible for treatment. And, as I mentioned before to the previous question, the prescriber can feel confident that they'll be reimbursed for the product across a broad range of patients. So we think that in second line having a broad all-comer label is definitely an advantage.","Now, I do think testing will evolve over time, but I think the ideal time to test for PD-L1 expression is going to be when tissue is taken at time of diagnosis when other things like EGFR and ALK are ascertained. So in second line oftentimes there's no tissue available, and it's very difficult to get test results. In front line, more likely, so I think that's where it'll evolve, and it'll take time to see how that changes in the market.","With respect to our performance in non-squamous, obviously it's a very recent event, so we have been promoting for just a few days now. But previous to our approval, there was some uptake in non-squamous, and at this point in time, we're probably \u2013 and this is an estimate \u2013 we're probably in the range of about 30% to 35% of new patients receiving Opdivo in non-squamous second-line non-small cell lung cancer.","I'll turn it over to Charlie.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, Chris. Yeah, we've been talking about, given our growth potential, particularly in Opdivo and Eliquis, that we need to make strategic investments to really leverage our position of strength. And with that you started to see some of the increase in expenses in the third quarter. And you'll see additional increase in absolute terms as we get into the fourth quarter. There is some level of seasonality and timing of expenses, as we think about the fourth quarter, so I wouldn't view that as the run rate as we think about 2016. And, of course, we look across the entire business as we think about where can we up-invest, but also where can we reallocate expenses. And, as you can appreciate, it's too early to be thinking about giving some sort of guidance for 2016.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Chris, this is Giovanni. From my perspective, when you look at the results of Q3, there's really strong trends in terms of revenues and top line growth for the key growth drivers. I think that speaks to the strength of commercial execution. And it really validates the strategy to strategically invest in the business in order to accelerate the right trends going into 2016, as we start what we've called our new chapter of growth.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Jonathan. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Timothy M. Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just staying on the topic of I-O, can you talk about what your research shows in terms of physicians that today want to actually do PL-1 testing in the second-line setting? So I know that it's much easier to use your product, and I would imagine that's a major competitive advantage, but I know from talking to physicians in the past, there are some proportion that actually want to do PD-L1 testing, and they put some value on that. I'm wondering what your research shows is the proportion of physicians that feel that way today in second-line lung? Is it one in 10 or one in five, or what exactly?","And then a second question: Can you give us your updated perspective on how PD-L1 testing will be employed in Europe right out of the gates here in second-line lung? Is that something that's going to be used as a access-limiting tool?","And then last question: Just off-label use of Keytruda at the moment, not that you're promoting it that way, but we've seen data from one treatment center that said that almost 30% of use was actually in renal, which I'm sure can't be reflective of the national average. But what percent is currently being used outside of those two indications?","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","So we'll let Murdo comment on anything related to Opdivo. But we'll leave Keytruda to the other company, Tim. Murdo?","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yeah, Tim, so I think it's hard to fix a number in terms of physicians who prefer testing over those who are agnostic to testing. I think what we're seeing is, in an academic institutional setting, where reference labs have had our antibody for some time now, there are definitely more tests \u2013 there's more testing in the institutional setting so that the physician can ascertain what the likelihood of a response will be. I think in the community, it's much less frequent and that will obviously change, as I said, earlier but it's the minority of physicians who are aware and understand how to do the testing. Given that we've been out promoting in the squamous histology for some time with no required testing, clearly they're a bit confused now as to why all the sudden there's a requirement to test from other PD-L1 inhibitors. And of course we're reinforcing that there's no requirement to test with Opdivo across non-squamous and squamous.","When it comes to off-label use, in terms of renal indication, we're not really tracking that right now in a large extent. We look at it, obviously; we look at all of our use. But most of our use to date can be explained by the melanoma indications and our lung indications. We did \u2013 as I mentioned, we did see off-label non-squamous lung use prior to the approval recently.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And with respect to \u2013 this is Giovanni \u2013 with respect to your question regarding Europe, at this point, obviously, we are approved for melanoma and the squamous setting, and we have not seen indication of a restriction based on testing for PD-L1 expression levels. But obviously there is no data that would support that restriction, given our currently approved indications in Europe.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jonathan, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Question for you first, Charlie, on operating margin leverage. On the last earnings call, you obviously signaled increased levels of spending and sort of threw cold water on the operating margin leverage story. Now we're seeing those increased levels of spend, but also greater-than-expected revenues coming through. So can you give us a little bit more color on when we can expect to see a greater magnitude of operating margin leverage? Are we going to start to see that in 2016, say, second half? Or do we have to wait until 2017 and beyond? If you can just give a little bit more color around that.","And, Francis, for you, what are the key pivotal trials that you expect to see next year in terms of either reaching information at your interim analysis or when the trials conclude? But what are the additional tumor types that you expect to see reading out next year? Thanks very much.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jami, this is Charlie. I'll answer your cold-water question first. Operating leverage for us as we think about 2016 and beyond will start happening in probably the 2017 period. We haven't finalized our budgets and our plans. But we expect \u2013 and we did say this on the last call \u2013 meaningful expansion as we get back towards the back half of this decade. So we'll continue to update you as we give guidance for 2016, and then we can think about it further. But we do expect significant expansion towards the latter part of this decade.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think what's important, as I said before, is that \u2013 and as you mentioned, Jami \u2013 is that revenue growth is very strong, which really speaks to the strategy to invest in the business. And it's an important priority for us. But I just want to reinforce what Charlie said: Coming out of 2016 and going into 2017, we do expect leverage to begin to appear and become very meaningful.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good afternoon, Jami. It's Francis. So, as you recall, we presented encouraging data in new tumors at ASCO, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma, and all of these could be firsts for BMS going forward. So, in addition to the nine to 10 positive registration studies we've had in the last 12 months, as you know, we've got 25 ongoing planned registration trials. And before the end of 2016, we could potentially see registrational data for head and neck, for Hodgkin's lymphoma, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or for bladder. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jonathan, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks very much. I have two questions. First, with respect to renal cell carcinoma, obviously the data was very impressive and you've filed it for approval. But just wondering if you can provide a framework for NCCN guideline update potential and timing? And then, second, with respect to the EU, could you just walk us through key events to watch for Opdivo and lung cancer over the next year? What we should think about in terms of timing for an approval in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, and the rollout in the EU of that indication?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","David, this is Giovanni. Let me just take your first question on renal and just confirm, as we said in our remarks, we are working with regulators to complete those findings in Europe and the U.S. by the end of the year. We don't have an update on NCCN. And the only thing I can say is that, on both the regulatory front and NCCN guidelines, we've seen in the past that those updates are made rapidly when they're as compelling as you just mentioned. And I'll ask Francis to comment on lung in the European Union.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Good afternoon, David. Just \u2013 I'm not going to go into detail about our regulatory interactions in Europe, but they have always been very good with the regulators there. And we would expect to see some action next year on non-small cell lung cancer approval. Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jonathan, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Baum with Citi, your line is open.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Okay, Jonathan, maybe we can go to the next one.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi, good morning. A couple. First on Eliquis, Charlie, any inventory changes or rebating changes that affected Eliquis sales in the quarter versus the second quarter level on net revenue? Secondly, on Opdivo, do you expect share to go up in monotherapy in melanoma, given that docs may want to add Yervoy later and want to start with the mono agent that has the combo data? And lastly, for Giovanni, you talked, when you took over the CEO seat, that you wanted to win in I-O, and certainly help diversify the company. You made some comments about diversification earlier via the pipeline. I was curious if you're focused at all, maybe for Charlie too, on any efforts to diversify with commercial stage assets, or is it really a pipeline-driven phenomenon? Thanks.","Charles A. Bancroft - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, Gregg. This is Charlie. I'll handle your question on Eliquis. And I did mention this in my remarks, that in the U.S., TRx growth was up actually 18% sequentially versus Q2. What we saw, though, is relatively flat sales, and that's because of the impact of the Medicare coverage gap, or what's infamously known as the donut hole. So that suppressed overall sales, but still strong prescription growth, and strong sequential growth.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yeah, we had a little bit of inventory workdown on Eliquis in the quarter. It's about two-thirds of the change is about what Charlie mentioned, the coverage gap effect, and then one-third would have been inventory workdown.","When you think about Opdivo monotherapy, it's actually a really good question, Gregg, because what we are hearing from our customers is, the fact that we have two immune checkpoint inhibitors in our portfolio has obviously very real potential benefits for them, but even for patients, once a patient enrolls in our patient assistance program for either drug, they are no longer required to re-enroll for assistance with the mixed drug. So, as you highlighted, a physician may decide to use Opdivo versus other PD-1 options in front line, because they know if they do progress, they don't have to fill out any additional paperwork or reapply for patient assistance when they get a patient on Yervoy. And it's a real convenience factor for physicians and patients. And obviously, if they are going to use the two in combination, then they only need to familiarize themselves with one PD-1 inhibitor in that setting as well. So, thanks for that question.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Gregg, with respect to your question on the two imperatives, I'm optimistic, and I feel that we are continuing to make great progress on both fronts in terms of winning in immuno-oncology. Our leadership position in this field has strengthened coming out of the third quarter.","And in terms of diversifying, that continues to be a priority for us. And in terms of diversification, it's both within immuno-oncology, and that's really the discussion we had earlier about investing in new mechanisms of action and advancing the early immuno-oncology pipeline, and then obviously, outside of immuno-oncology. You've heard about at least one of our business development deals in the quarter, and how the rest of the pipeline is moving forward. Our business development strategy is really agnostic with respect to pipeline versus marketed assets. Obviously, there are fewer late-stage or marketed assets available, particularly given our focus on truly differentiated medicines. But we are looking at both, and obviously it is likely that we will continue to do more pipeline deals, just because of the nature of our business.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jonathan, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. So just two. First one around the topic of price, where obviously there's been a lot of discussion in the media, just \u2013 my question really is you guys, obviously, as you mentioned, had the first approved combination now, and we know how you priced that one. Just the feedback that you're receiving or of any pushback, just given how you've priced that relative to the monotherapies would be interesting to hear now that it's been a few weeks. And second one, one product that I think doesn't get discussed as much is elotuzumab, and you talked about the therapy (39:47) that's ongoing there. Can you maybe just sort of frame the market opportunity there? I think people realize it's a big market, but also pretty crowded, and it hasn't shown much impact in terms of \u2013 as a monotherapy agent. So how do you see the commercial potential for that product? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vamil, thanks for the question. Let me start on pricing, and then Murdo will comment on elotuzumab market opportunity. So first, clearly there is a lot of discussion about pricing and pricing of specialty medicines specifically. The way we think about it at BMS is that we are developing truly innovative medicines that offer significant value to patients. And we are also strengthening and continuing to strengthen globally the reach and the characteristics of our reimbursement support and access assistance programs.","With respect to the combo, specifically, the value that the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy offers for patients with melanoma is very significant. And payers are responding positively to the 60% response rate, to 17% complete response, to the durability of the response, and we have really not seen significant objections to date. Remember that during the phase in which the two products are used together, the cost of therapy during that induction phase is only 6% higher than Opdivo monotherapy. And only the patients that continue on a monotherapy regimen with Opdivo after the combo period clearly continue to incur incremental costs. But those patients are typically patients that would respond, and given the durability of response with Opdivo, the value is highest at that point. So I think that message is resonating really well.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","(41:50) Thanks, Vamil. On elotuzumab, we really have an interesting opportunity with elotuzumab. Obviously, with our first indication in relapsed\/refractory, when we receive it from the FDA, we have an opportunity in a smaller percentage of the market, but still a very significant opportunity. It's a large market. We have also prepared commercially for launch in the near future, so we have, as you'll recall, transitioned our commercial activities on Erbitux back to Lilly, and now we have a dedicated hematology field organization to be able to focus on customers that prescribe implicitly, (42:35) which is a really nice fit for us with our Sprycel business. So we're excited about it. I also like that we've got a very nice lifecycle plan with that product, and we're hopeful that we're successful in front-line data, which will come out later next year with our ongoing ELOQUENT-1 trial.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, Jonathan, could we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been answered. I have one on Sprycel, actually. It doesn't get as much attention. Obviously, a significant product for you. Our understanding is that it will face generic competition from Gleevec next year. So if you could comment on how we should think about the impact there. Thank you.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yeah, thanks, Alex. Glad you mentioned Sprysel. We're having very good success Sprycel worldwide, growing rapidly in front-line share. We've done a really nice job, I think, in the U.S. and ex-U.S., in becoming a much more front-line, first-choice product. With the advent of generic Gleevec, we're definitely going to see some pressure in the U.S. and some markets ex-U.S. We're already seeing that in some locations like Canada, but I think given the strength of the share evolution in front line, we're going to be able to weather that quite well. Obviously, we're also focused on the ability for the oncologist or hematologist to test patients for depth of molecular response within the first three months, which should allow us to be able to use very rapid second line penetration in that market. And I think that will be important to continue to have good Sprycel growth long term.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Jonathan, could we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the quarter. For Giovanni and Francis, you do mention that you want to dominate to a great degree through the new mechanisms of action in the I-O space. Can you maybe help us understand when we might begin to see some additional data on the anti-LAG-3, anti-KIR, anti-CD137? And I think there was also commentary out in Denver about other mechanisms potentially going into the clinics, so just some commentary on the strategy there. Secondly on Eliquis, new-to-brand share or percent of sales coming from cardiologists versus primary care? And then on ASH, anything you want to focus us on, relative to what we should be looking at, at ASH in your portfolio?","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. John, let me just start on leadership in immuno-oncology and Francis will elaborate further; then Murdo will talk about Eliquis.","So, from my perspective, we clearly are the leaders in this field. The field of immuno-oncology is moving probably faster than all of us had expected, in terms of the strength of the activity we are seeing in tumors and the number of tumors in which immuno-oncology is active. And we are working in order to maintain and strengthen our leadership position by growing and expanding our development programs into new tumors, but also continuing to lead in terms of understanding the potential role of combinations in increasing response rates and improving the impact on survival.","And our goal, as we've stated before, has been to replace chemotherapy. We believe that combo I-O therapies are best positioned to do that. We have the most advanced data set with Yervoy\/Opdivo combinations and, obviously, we are not sort of resting on our current position, but we are continuing to advance new mechanisms of action into the clinic, because we want to continue to innovate. And that's what we mean when we define maintaining and strengthening our leadership position in immuno-oncology.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, John, good afternoon. So let me give you a little more color here. So as well as our major focus on checkpoint inhibitors such as Opdivo, Yervoy, anti-LAG-3, and urelumab, we're also interested in other potentially complementary approaches to reverse tumor-induced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, but also directly stimulate the immune system.","So \u2013 but just to say \u2013 so generating optimal T cell responses may also require T cell receptor activation plus co-stimulation, as you know, which then can be provided through ligation of the TNF receptor family members, including anti-GITR, which has just gone into the clinic for us, OX40, which we expect to bring into the clinic next year. And of course, urelumab, which is already under way.","As far as the tumor microenvironment, we're actually very excited about the progress of IDO, that program we acquired from Flexus, and we're on track to have that lead molecule enter the clinic next year. Additionally, as you recall, we have the TGF-beta program from Rigel, which is still preclinical, and then internally discovered anti-CD73 molecule, which we hope to be in the clinic before the end of next year, too. And of course, with the recent announcement of the Five Prime licensing deal, we also have a CSF1R in phase run, (48:32) which is in combination with Opdivo, and we're very pleased with how that trial is progressing also.","So, let me just sum up. We have a number of exploratory clinical studies in addition to checkpoint inhibitors, as well as other complementary nonredundant approaches to PD-1 inhibition. We will be getting data at the end of this year and through next year, and depending on the data and the timing, we will be presenting some of that next year. Thanks.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","And John, to your question on Eliquis, we've enjoyed a historically very strong performance in cardiology. We currently have around a 50% share of new-to-brand patients in atrial fibrillation and VTE treatment patient populations. And then in primary care, we have about a 40% market share in those same two indications, so we are already the most prescribed, in new patients, novel oral anticoagulant in cardiology, and we intend to become the number one novel oral anticoagulant in primary care.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Yeah John, I think with ASH, you could expect to see some updated data on elotuzumab from the ELOQUENT-2 data. And I believe we're going to have some updates to the data presented last year at ASH for Opdivo in Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","Can we go to the next question, please, Jonathan?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, I have three questions. First, CheckMate 017 and 057 both stopped early, whereas KEYNOTE-010 went to its completion. Do you think this is likely attributed to a KEYNOTE-010 trial design that benefited from learnings from other studies? Or should we think more broadly than that? I'm sure you have thought about it, so I'd be interested in anything that crossed your mind on that topic.","Secondly, Merck claims to have 70% share of melanoma with PD-1. To what do you attribute this dominant share? Is it the first-mover advantage, is it the Q3 week versus the Q2 week dosing, or is it something else?","And then lastly, I could be wrong, but I think the last cut of CheckMate 012 data presented was from about a year ago. Maybe based on data that you have internally, I'd be curious if the NIVO-chemo combo arm continues to demonstrate an undifferentiated tail response? Thank you.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good afternoon, Steve. So, let me say, we obviously know very little about the overall survival data for Keytruda, and we'll obviously look forward to seeing the full results when they're published. But let me tell you what we do know. We do know that Opdivo has a clear overall survival benefit, and a benefit in a broad population. As a result, it's got the broadest label and, as you know, it's indicated for previously treated patients, both squamous and non-squamous, regardless of PD-L1 expression. And as Murdo said, there's no need therefore to test.","Now, in both CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057, Opdivo demonstrated PFS benefit versus docetaxel. And, in CheckMate 017, the benefit was seen in both PD-L1 positive and negative patients. And in CheckMate 057, the benefit was statistically significant at all levels of PD-L1 expression, including greater than 1%, not just 50%. So I'm very clear in my own mind about the strength of the Opdivo data. And obviously we'll be able to comment \u2013 you'll be able to see when you see the Keytruda data.","I don't have an update on the chemotherapy data from 012 in combination with Opdivo. But what I would say is we are going forward with a number of approaches in addition to the I-O combination of Opdivo\/Yervoy regimen. So we've got the large, well-controlled study 227. We are looking at novel dosing with chemo in terms of priming and shorter-term disease control. We have collaborations with Novartis and Celgene looking at chemotherapy and targeted therapy. And we've also initiated a multiarm study, which is CheckMate 370, which is looking at Opdivo primarily in the community setting, (53:28) chemotherapy with (53:30) first line treatment, either alone or in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. So, based on all of this, we're confident in our approach to exploring a broad lung approach, but also exploring the role of chemotherapy combinations in first-line lung.","Murdo Gordon - Senior Vice President & Head-Worldwide Markets","Yeah, and I think, Steve, you had a question regarding the 70% number that was put out during the Merck call this morning. I believe that was a 70% share of PD-1 monotherapy in melanoma. And I think if you look at overall share of melanoma, Opdivo to Keytruda, whether it's used in monotherapy or a regimen, we're roughly a 50\/50 share. I think we're 49%; they might be a little higher. So Opdivo has caught up quickly. I think with the regimen indication, that dynamic is still very much in play, and I think we'll see some increased usage of regimen in the market, which will further drive Opdivo share. I think the only other thing is to \u2013 whether or not this is a function of dose. I think it's more a function of the early-mover advantage, as you described. We're seeing that, in the market, our promotion is going well. We have the largest share voice in melanoma, and with the advent of the regimen approval, we'll be promoting that fully and expect to continue to evolve in total I-O share of melanoma.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks. Jonathan, I think we have time for just one more question.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. So just a quick one to build on the business development comments. You've been doing a great job at continuing to build your I-O pipeline via BD. Could you comment on your level of interest in cellular therapeutics, given this is one area you're currently not in? And then, just on your initial comments on diversifying, should we expect a shift from I-O focused deals to other therapeutic areas? And, if so, what would those therapeutic areas be? And then, just lastly on your HIV pipeline, could you just provide some color on your attachment and your maturation inhibitors and the potential you see there, given this is a disease you clearly have great experience in? Thanks.","Francis M. Cuss - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Good afternoon, Colin. So let me start with BD. Clearly, we've always seen BD as very important to complement our internally discovered efforts, and as you've seen in the last quarter, we've expanded our portfolio both in I-O and in \u2013 outside of I-O. And I would just comment, again, on the \u2013 I've talked about the CSF1R collaboration \u2013 sorry, the licensing \u2013 with Five Prime, but the fibrosis side is very important, too.","And, just to give you a bit more color, we gained the worldwide rights to PRM-151, which is a recombinant form of a human pentraxin-2 protein. Now, this is in Phase 2 development, as you heard, for the treatments of IPF and myelofibrosis. Now, what particularly struck us about the early data, which is continuing to develop in myelofibrosis, that it suggests that pentraxin-2 may be able to reverse the fibrotic process and improve the downstream events, not just stop the progression. So pentraxin-2 clearly complements our growing early-stage fibrosis portfolio. And it becomes very exciting if the early data is confirmed and have the potential to be transformational in multiple fibrotic diseases.","As far as HIV, we're continuing to bring forward two novel, potentially first-in-class compounds. The attachment inhibitor has moved into Phase 3. As you saw recently, we've had some good Phase 2 data with the maturation inhibitor, the first in salvage therapy and, of course, the second a possibility for fixed-dose combinations. So we think there's considerable value in both those assets, even in a very mature area like HIV.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just \u2013 Colin, let me just \u2013 before I close, make a couple of comments on business development. So first of all, both areas, immuno-oncology and other therapeutic areas, will continue to be important internally and in terms of business development. And, as we've done when we have moved from our focus on checkpoint inhibitors into the tumor microenvironment, we will continue to look at how the science evolves in other areas within immuno-oncology. And when we see technologies or programs that are interesting and relevant to our program, we will continue to focus on business development in immuno-oncology.","With respect to the other therapeutic areas, they remain the ones we've discussed before with immuno-science, cardiovascular medicines, fibrosis, and genetically defined diseases as areas where our science can be complemented by business development activities. And I don't expect that to change going forward.","Giovanni Caforio - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me just close. Thank you all for participating in the call. And reiterate that, again, we had a very strong quarter. Our performance was strong from a commercial perspective. Our clinical and regulatory developments were very significant. And we are optimistic as we're moving forward into our exciting new chapter of sustained growth in a position of strength. Thanks, everyone. Have a good day.","John E. Elicker - Senior Vice President, Public Affairs & Investor Relations","Thanks, everybody.

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Mr. Elicker, please go ahead.","John Elicker","Thanks, Debbie, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter results. With me this morning for prepared remarks are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Charlie Bancroft, our CFO. And then joining for Q&A are Elliott Sigal, our Chief Scientific Officer; Giovanni Caforio, President of the U.S. Pharmaceuticals Business; and Beatrice Cazala, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations.","Before I turn it over to Lamberto, let me cover the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website.","Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, John, and first of all, congratulations for your promotion and expanded responsibilities. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we lost the exclusivity of PLAVIX in the U.S., after having lost the exclusivity of AVAPRO and AVALIDE towards the end of the first quarter.","These 2 events did not come unexpected. And in fact, we have worked for years to get ready for them and to transform our company. I feel good about our progress in the full transition to our portfolio of the future.","When I look at sales, exclusive of PLAVIX and AVAPRO\/AVALIDE, I'm pleased to see 8% year-over-year growth for the rest of our portfolio. And this is despite the significant weakening of many currencies versus the dollar.","Importantly, the sales growth came from a portfolio of products that is innovative, is diversified, covers a range of therapeutic areas and spans across multiple geographies. All these factors provide the foundation for the future success of our company.","With respect to our long-term growth, as we've been saying for some time, business development is a top priority and a key part of our company's balanced approach to capital allocation. Having completed the acquisition of Inhibitex in the previous quarter, I'm very excited about our recently announced planned acquisition of Amylin and the resulting expansion of our partnership with AstraZeneca.","The strategic rationale for this acquisition is clear. There is significant unmet medical need in diabetes, and there is a real demand for different, but complementary treatment options.","We see particular value from Amylin to market its GLP-1 products, BYETTA and BYDUREON. They are already approved in the U.S. and in Europe. They complement our current portfolio and will enable us to offer a more comprehensive disease management solution to patients, health care providers and payors.","In addition, for reasons we have explained before, we believe this transaction is a logical expansion of our successful alliance with AstraZeneca, with which we have collaborated since 2007. We expect that by leveraging the existing Bristol-Myers Squibb-AstraZeneca sales force, our capabilities in access and our marketing experience will significantly broaden the prescriber base and drive increased adoption of Amylin's GLP-1 franchise.","We also recognize the great value of Amylin's U.S. endocrinology capability as having the potential to enhance the promotion of our existing ONGLYZA franchise. Finally, we look forward to integrating Amylin's state-of-the-art plant in Chester, Ohio into our global manufacturing network.","Again, I'm very excited about these opportunities. We will be ready to move forward as quickly as possible after the transaction closes.","Also related to diabetes, and as you know, we are waiting for the European Commission's decision on the marketing authorization of FORXIGA in the second half of the year.","","Switching from diabetes to oncology, at ASCO in June, we built on our leadership position in immuno-oncology with a presentation of compelling data on our investigational anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, which was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The data showed potentially meaningful responses in 3 advanced cancer types: lung cancer, kidney cancer and melanoma. Based on these encouraging results, we plan to begin our Phase III program in lung cancer and renal cancer in the coming months, with Phase III in melanoma expected to start later this year or early next year.","Finally, as you know, we received a complete response letter on the new drug application for ELIQUIS for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. We have met with the FDA and have a clear path forward.","On balance, our second quarter performance sets a good foundation for the future of our company. We are confident with our new and key products and continue to position Bristol-Myers Squibb for success and that our portfolio of the future can get us where we need to be for sustained long-term growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Charlie, who will give you some additional information and walk you through some of our numbers. Thank you. Charlie?","Charles A. Bancroft","Thank you, Lamberto. This was an important quarter for the company as we officially move past PLAVIX and AVAPRO and take another step towards our transition to the portfolio of our future.","In the second quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.48. We reported second quarter net sales of $4.4 billion, down 18% compared to last year due to the loss of exclusivity of PLAVIX and AVAPRO. Volume was down 19%, price was favorable by 3% and foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on sales.","As Lamberto mentioned, global sales grew 8%, excluding PLAVIX and AVAPRO. Overall, we are pleased by the trends of our key brands that are important to our future growth.","Let me provide a few highlights. We continue to make progress with YERVOY and are focused on delivering longer term growth. During the quarter, we reported YERVOY sales of $162 million, with U.S. sales of $121 million. Demand in the U.S. was up approximately 7% sequentially compared to the first quarter. As we look forward, we are focused on ensuring that physicians and all stakeholders understand the potential for long-term survival.","We also continue to focus on extending our prescribing base in the community setting. As you know, the process for getting access and reimbursement in Europe takes time, as negotiations take place in each country, and we believe we are making good progress.  In markets where we have access such as the U.K. and Germany, we are outperforming most recent oncology product launches.","Our virology franchise had a very strong quarter, with BARACLUDE delivering sales growth of 22%. Sales of SUSTIVA and REYATAZ were up 5% and 3%, respectively. International sales of REYATAZ were positively impacted by timing of orders from both Russia and Brazil.","ONGLYZA franchise sales were $172 million, up 54% compared to last year. Going forward, we are focused on driving adoption earlier in treatment as the first add-on to metformin, leveraging our head-to-head data versus SU as used in our label update for the use of ONGLYZA in combination with insulin.","SPRYCEL was up 26% in the quarter. We continue to make share gains in both first line and the continued expansion of the second line opportunity. The ORENCIA franchise was up 27%. Our IV volume continues to outperform the market, up 4% in the quarter.","ORENCIA subQ, which was launched in the U.S. at the end of last year, had sales of $44 million in Q2, up 42% sequentially compared to Q1. Given the CHMP positive opinion, we are preparing for a potential launch of subQ in Europe later this year.","Now let me give you just a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. As John mentioned, reconciliations to our GAAP results are available on our press release and on our website.","Gross margin was 75.3%, up 220 basis points compared to second quarter last year. This favorability was primarily driven by foreign exchange.","Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 3%. Increased investment behind new brands was offset by spending related to PLAVIX and AVAPRO. Looking forward, you may recall that in Q4 2011, we increased investment spend and recorded certain onetime expenses, which we do not expect to recur this year.","Advertising and promotion expenses were down 11%, reflecting decreased spend behind PLAVIX and AVAPRO, partially offset by investment in new brands. R&D increased 5%, driven by overall portfolio spend. The effective overall tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter, the decrease compared to second quarter 2011 is primarily due to earnings mix.","Now turning to guidance. You have seen that we have confirmed our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.90 to $2, which includes the estimated $0.03 dilution related to the planned acquisition of Amylin. Given the P&L impact from the acquisition after we close, we are not updating our line item guidance at this time.","I will point out that our year-to-date sales and expenses are generally in line with our expectations. We plan to provide an update to our line item guidance on our third quarter call. We still expect full year PLAVIX sales to be approximately $2.7 billion.","I will now turn it over to your questions.","John Elicker","Thanks, Charlie. Debbie, I think we're ready to go to questions. Just as a reminder, in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, we have Elliott, Giovanni and Beatrice here for any questions you might have. Debbie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Lamberto, you mentioned that you recently met with the FDA on ELIQUIS and now have a path forward. Can you please share that with us, specifically what the FDA is requiring, and if you could please give us a sense of the time line? And secondly, maybe Elliott is on the phone, if you could talk to the recent anti-PD-1 trial that was just posted on clinicaltrials.gov. I understand this is a lung cancer study. If you could talk about the time line, the trial design and if there are any interim analysis built in so that we can just think about the potential for the timing of commerciality?","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes. Thank you for your questions. I will let Elliott go into more detail. What I want to say is that we are confident in the path forward, as I said. And very important, we are also confident in the differentiated profile we have for ELIQUIS in atrial fibrillation, which is an area of high unmet medical need. So we have double confidence here. And Elliott, maybe you want to elaborate a little bit more on what we see in front of us from a regulatory point of view and then take the PD-1 questions of Jami?","Elliott Sigal","Yes, Jami, I'll reiterate Lamberto's statement that our confidence in the results from the ARISTOTLE trial and the AVERROES trial has not changed. I think it is significant that we've already met with the FDA, that the FDA set a meeting date to discuss how to move forward after the Complete Response Letter on the day that we were issued the Complete Response Letter, and that meeting has already taken place. I went into the meeting cautiously optimistic that we could move this application forward. And that confidence has increased. We understand what the FDA is asking for and already working on providing that information. The FDA, along with both sponsors, are committed to working expeditiously to address the outstanding questions and move the application forward. As we stated in our press release last month, the Complete Response Letter details the request for additional information on data management and verification from the ARISTOTLE study. And this was a complex, large trial over multiple years, involving 18,000 patients. The operational complexity of conducting a program of this size with a significant number of patient records is an important consideration in the FDA's review. I believe everybody understands the significance of the results and the significance of the differentiated profile, and so their due diligence on every detail and their meticulous aspect of the review, I think, is understandable. I will emphasize the questions raised do not relate to the primary or key secondary endpoints and do not contest the validity of our database. Importantly, the Complete Response Letter does not request that we conduct any additional studies. I can't be too predictive about time lines other than to say that the FDA regulations are that they have the option to take up to 6 months to review our response once it's submitted. We're working ferociously to submit this application and know exactly what to do. We're already working with the agency in a collaborative manner, and I think that it's possible our submission can be completed within a shorter time frame than the allowable 6 months after submission. I will say we are proud to have been able to get ELIQUIS filed in all 3 major markets, the U.S., Europe and Japan, within several months of each other. We're working on all 3 continents with health authorities to bring this differentiated profile to patients as soon as possible. Jami also asked a question about PD-1 and you must have picked up something that just came across the wire from clinicaltrials.gov. And this is our first Phase III trial for anti-PD-1, this time in lung cancer. I will step back and mention that the mechanism involved here is to unleash the immune system to attack the cancer cells that are invading the body. This is a natural mechanism, and cancer has a way of putting this mechanism into check. Anti-PD-1 removes that break and allows the immune system to attack cancer cells. This is true with YERVOY, and this is true with anti-PD-1 by a different mechanism. The data we presented from our Phase I\/II study at ASCO are very important, and we have acted in a data-driven manner to accelerate and expand the anti-PD-1 program. Interim results showed that this therapy is clinically active in non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, importantly with durable responses in many patients and an acceptable and manageable safety profile. And we've seen activity at multiple dose levels. So we have designed multiple Phase III programs and are working with health authorities around the world. Today, it's become public that our first Phase III study in lung cancer will address the significant unmet medical need in the histology of squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer and in second line. Importantly, this is a monotherapy trial involving over 250 patients, is compared in a controlled manner with an active control, docetaxel. The primary outcomes are both response rates and overall survival. This Phase III program will also include earlier lines of therapy and different histologies and other tumor types, including renal cell and melanoma. And these Phase III programs will begin this year in all 3 tumor types.","Operator","We'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And thanks for that pipeline detail, Elliott. I have another pipeline question. If you could just provide updated commentary on dapagliflozin? And then with respect to YERVOY, when should we expect to see the prostate Phase III results? And then, finally, a commercial question. Regarding YERVOY in the U.S., how should we think about the second half U.S. outlook versus the first half of '12? Should we expect growth in the second half of this year versus the first half U.S. YERVOY sales?","Elliott Sigal","Yes, David. Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","If you're ready with the pipeline answers, why don't you go ahead, Elliott. I want to say a couple of things about YERVOY.","Elliott Sigal","Well, Lamberto, I was going to update people on dapagliflozin and then YERVOY prostate results. Dapagliflozin, we're pleased to have received a positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe in April. And we've always believed in the benefit\/risk of the drug, and we're glad to see this is recognized in Europe. The next step is EU approval decision, which we expect to occur in the second half of this year, 2012. I would add that it's very exciting with our potential acquisition of Amylin to be a company that looks to the future with all 3 modern mechanisms, SGLT2, DPP-4 and GLP-1, in a franchise to offer patients and physicians options across a spectrum of the disease. And these 3 offerings may well occur first in Europe. In the U.S., we are disappointed to have received a Complete Response Letter. In the CRL, the FDA is requesting more clinical data to allow better assessment of the overall benefit\/risk profile. In contrast to ELIQUIS, the path forward is not as clear as I would like. However, we are collaborating with the FDA to define our options for a path forward in this important mechanism. YERVOY's life cycle management program continues beyond melanoma. And our prostate trial that began several years ago, we think we will have results at least internally in the second half of next year.","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes, eventually, we'll move to YERVOY. Before moving to YERVOY, just one additional comment on FORXIGA. We are -- we, as a company, all of us at the company, we are very convinced of the good benefit\/risk profile of FORXIGA so we are all behind moving this product forward in the U.S. and elsewhere. Speaking about YERVOY, I would like Giovanni to elaborate on what we have done and what we are going to do in the U.S. But before I ask you to do that, Giovanni, the one thing I want to remind everybody is that we had a particularly strong launch last year. I mean, we established YERVOY with a very strong launch last year, and YERVOY continues to perform. So when you look at the $162 million of reported sales this quarter, we are encouraged by those sales on top of a strong launch last year. YERVOY is growing in the U.S., growing in Europe, especially -- it's growing in Europe, in the countries where access is established. And elsewhere, we are working elsewhere in Europe. And elsewhere in the world, we are working at establishing access and reimbursement. So YERVOY is doing well. And though the BRAF-positive segment is highly competitive, we see continuous growth in the future, both in the U.S. and international. So Giovanni, why don't you elaborate on the U.S.?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. As Lamberto mentioned, we are building on a very successful launch in the first 12 months. And in Q2, in the U.S. specifically, we've made progress and grew sequentially our sales 4% and our demand 7% versus the previous quarter, versus Q1. Yes, we believe that YERVOY can grow further in the U.S., and we are very focused on continuing to educate physicians about the long-term survival benefit. And there are different ways you can look at the melanoma market. So from the perspective of the institutional and the hospital setting, we've been very successful in that segment, and we have good penetration with YERVOY. Physicians and patients in the U.S. are increasingly understanding within that setting the value of the long-term survival benefit of YERVOY. And we do see continued opportunities for growth in that segment, building on a very strong base. The process of educating physicians in the community setting is also progressing. But that is a slower and a longer process because many physicians see only very few patients a year. So the community setting is also an area of focus for us and where we can make significant inroads, but over time. There are also, obviously, very significant dynamics, different dynamics in the market depending on the BRAF status. The BRAF-positive segment, as Lamberto mentioned, remains very competitive. And we believe that physicians, as they continue to gain experience with the 2 novel agents and they continue to focus on long-term outcomes, will actually -- YERVOY will play an increased role in this segment over time. In the BRAF-negative population, YERVOY has a good penetration, but older agents are still getting usage. And so there is still room to grow and in that population as well and this is the immediate priority for us. So in summary, as we think about the second half, we are building on a very strong base. The market will continue to evolve over time. We will continue to focus on the long-term survival profile of YERVOY through our customer model, and we see the room for continued adoption of the product in the U.S.","Operator","We'll go to Tony Butler with Barclays.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Lamberto, I have 2 questions. Lamberto, the first one is really around how should we think about both REYATAZ and SUSTIVA later -- for the remaining part of this year and maybe even into 2013, given the assumption of a quad launch sometime in the next couple of months? And more importantly, what are you doing commercially to actually increase that share of voice in those -- for those 2 products? And then, the second question, I suspect, is for Elliot. Elliott, could you comment on what data sets you may be willing to share with us that would be presented at AALSD (sic) [AASLD] later this year?","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes, Tony, when we think about HIV, one thing that we must remind people of is that we have been leaders in this space for many years. And we have 2 of the leading products in HIV. REYATAZ is the #1 PI in the U.S. and ATRIPLA is the #1 HIV regimen in the U.S. So we have continued to establish these products despite a competitive market. I mean, there have been increasing competition over the years, and these products still hold and hold very well. So you're right, there will be increased competition in the future. But we believe that these 2 products, well supported as they are, will -- are -- and established amongst physicians and patients are going to hold and hold very well. Giovanni, you want to add something here?","Giovanni Caforio","I just like to reiterate and confirm, yes, the market is extremely competitive, and we also understand the level of competitive pressure will increase because of the inroads that recently launched products will -- are making and also the potential entry of new products in the next 12 to 24 months. I would say given that physicians and patients are very experienced and satisfied in existing agents and the existing regimens, that new products will need to meet a high threshold for differentiation in order to be accepted broadly. Having said that, we do believe that new entrants will have a place and especially in the treatment of naive patients and will have an impact in the market. From our perspective, as Lamberto mentioned, we have a very strong franchise with 2 leading agents. ATRIPLA continues to be the first most prescribed regimen in the U.S., and REYATAZ is the most prescribed protease inhibitor in the market. And they are clearly supported by very strong clinical data. Physicians are used to prescribing those 2 agents, and patients are very comfortable with them. Now given how important the franchise is to us, we are absolutely not underestimating the pressure that will come from new competitors. A couple of things I would say is we are well resourced commercially, and we are fully committed to support the 2 products appropriately. We also are very well prepared to respond and so we will continue to focus on this.","Elliott Sigal","Tony, you asked a question about what we might present at the liver meetings on our hepatitis C program. We will be presenting because we now have safety data from the Phase II study called 003, that was started by Inhibitex with the Inhibitex nucleotide 189 on top of standard of care in genotype 2 and 3 patients. And we expanded this study in May to include arms that combine our 5A inhibitor, daclatasvir\/ribavirin N-189, as well as an exploratory cohort of daclatasvir plus 189, all in genotype 1. So we expect to present initial data from the study 003, and that will be, I think, significant in terms of our assessment of safety. We also expect to present additional data from the daclatasvir plus the nucleotide from Gilead, in combination -- in the combination trial. Specifically, we expect to present the SVR12 data from 24 weeks of treatment. We may well have SVR4 data from the 12-week arm from the study, and it'll be unclear at this time whether it'll be available for the presentation, but we will try to make it available if we have it and if we meet the time lines. I will say that you may have noted that we also recently posted our internal Phase IIb trial on 189 plus daclatasvir that will begin recruiting soon.","Operator","We'll go to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","If I can go back to ELIQUIS, can you frame out the earliest best case time line for answering the Complete Response Letter? I'm wondering if you could be as quick as something like 2 to 3 months, I would imagine there are certain physical limitations on how long it would take to validate data and trial sites, but I just don't know what that would be. And then, going back to dapagliflozin in Europe, given the positive opinion in April, it seems like you should have already received final approval and I'm wondering if additional questions have come up in Europe kind of like they have in the U.S. And can you confirm that the major regulatory issue at this point in the U.S. is the cancer signal?","Elliott Sigal","Tim, this is Elliot. With regard to dapagliflozin, FORXIGA, in Europe, we're waiting for the EU decision that follows the CHMP-positive opinion. That decision takes a variable amount of time. We are expecting it now in the second half of '12. The issue in the U.S. is the judgment of benefit versus risk. And as I mentioned before, we're working with the FDA on paths forward for that. With regard to the time lines on ELIQUIS, again, I think it's difficult to predict. I'll have to restate the fact that once we submit, and we're working very hard over the next 6 weeks to answer as many, if not all, the questions as we can, there could be a -- up to a 6-month review period. But the way the engagement is occurring, it is possible that the FDA will not require that full 6 months.","Operator","We'll go to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So just to follow up on, Elliott, on those last comments on ELIQUIS. You mentioned it's -- there was -- I believe you mentioned a 6-week time frame and then possible -- and that they're working diligently with the FDA. In terms of that diligence with FDA, does FDA physically have to participate in any of that work process or workup, i.e. is there a necessity for any site inspections really is the question at the end of the day? And then, separately, on anti-PD-1, just to follow up on Jami's question. Can you -- I think she asked about the possibility of an interim analysis and whether that would be incorporated into the study or not. But I guess, my question is could response rate -- are those co-primary endpoints? And could response rate possibly be the driving force behind an earlier-than-expected approval?","Elliott Sigal","Seamus, this is Elliott. I'll take the questions in reverse order. We don't have any more to announce today other than the Phase III trial that is starting to recruit in August. I did say that, in a data-driven way, we are looking at accelerating the program and broadening the program since that is required both by the unmet medical need and the data, and we have a good working relationship with health authorities. With regard to ELIQUIS, I think you specifically asked site inspections, as far as I know at this time, are well behind us. And I believe it's a matter of working together on what we will submit, hopefully, sometime in early September.","Operator","We'll go to Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, for the 2013 $1.95 kind of guidance that you've given us, can you talk about push pulls that have occurred since then that we should be thinking about and how we should think about that number? Second, can you just give us an update on ELIQUIS, what's happening OUS and where we are there and how we should be thinking about reimbursement? And then third, just on YERVOY, can you give us some numbers behind just what's happening there with share? I mean, what percent are actually getting BRAF tested these days, and what is your share kind of in the positive and negative patients?","Lamberto Andreotti","We can't answer on the guidance for 2013. As we stated at our last earnings call, we are less than a year away from 2013, and we will plan to provide guidance for 2013 in January of next year.","Charles A. Bancroft","Yes. Mark, I mean, there are some -- obviously, some pluses and minuses, BD, if we think of Inhibitex and Amylin acquisitions. FX is a headwind to U.S.-based multinationals. We've had pipeline pluses and minuses as well and then also the good progression, I would say, of our in-line product sales. So those are some of the key dynamics as we look at 2013.","Elliott Sigal","With regard to ELIQUIS regulatory activity, as I mentioned, we're working hard on all 3 continents. So we're interacting with health authorities in Japan and Europe, as well as in the U.S.","Beatrice Cazala","Regarding international, you are to remember that we have introduced ELIQUIS in PDP in Europe. So we're commercializing the product today in 14 countries including the top 5 EU. We are expecting to launch in the majority of them by the late '12. Reimbursement is going through. We are getting those reimbursements on a country-by-country basis. It's an interesting challenges as we are negotiating at the same time as our competitors are negotiating their A-fib indication. And obviously, we will be filing, hopefully, and we'll be getting our filing for A-fib soon. But at the moment, things are going well for PDP. It's creating an important milestone for the team because it not only validates the benefit\/risk profile of the product in the hospital setting, but it also -- it gives the partnership between us and Pfizer a valuable experience as we are preparing our relationship to launch the A-fib with key customers.","Giovanni Caforio","And with respect to the segments of the melanoma market in our share, BRAF testing at this point is -- the penetration is very high. We estimate that to be between 70% and 80% in the market. With respect to our business with YERVOY, 70% approximately of our business is coming from first line, 30% of the business is coming from the second line setting. We see approximately the same percentage of the business, 50-50 coming from community and hospital. And it's very difficult to give a precise answer on shares in any of those segments because the numbers are very small. So we work through ranges. In the BRAF-positive segment, we clearly have a lower share, which we estimate to be in the 10% to 20%. And we have a significantly higher share, of course, above 50% in a BRAF-negative patient population. But again, these are ranges based on a very small number of patients.","Operator","We'll go to Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 quick ones. First on anti-PD-1 and melanoma. Elliott, will you share whether this will be first or second line? And then I have a question about the GLP-1 market, not about market growth, which is obviously good, but on share. The BYETTA-BYDUREON franchise share has been slipping in the last few months. So can you put some color around, at least at a high level, how you plan to reverse that trend and whether reversing that trend was assumed in the deal model assumptions?","Elliott Sigal","Just quickly, Gregg, on anti-PD-1, we have plans for both first- and second-line melanoma.","Giovanni Caforio","And on GLP-1s, we are clearly very excited with the opportunity to be able to promote the Amylin portfolio after the closing, and the fact that BYETTA and BYDUREON added to ONGLYZA and KOMBIGLYZE position us with a very broad portfolio of agents in diabetes potentially across all of the important classes. So with respect to our plans, upon closing of the acquisition, we will be immediately focusing on building on a successful initial launch by Amylin and revamping the sales trajectory of BYDUREON by further advancing the access position and increasing the focus on educating primary care physicians on the value of BYDUREON. We think that today, the GLP-1s have been used and prescribed primarily by endocrinologists in the U.S. but there are many patients that are not treated by endocrinologists that could benefit from GLP-1s and BYDUREON. And with respect to our plans with AstraZeneca and the Amylin teams, we are actually very well positioned to accomplish this objective. We will be able to leverage, as Lamberto mentioned earlier, our commercial experience. We have significant capabilities to improve access and affordability programs. We have existing diabetes sales forces, which can be deployed rapidly. And we expect that we will be able to significantly broaden the prescriber base and increase the adoption of the products. So this is in line with our plans from the beginning. Finally, we also believe that the successful launch of BYDUREON does not necessarily need to come at the expense of BYETTA, and we see the potential for the 2 formulations of exenatide to be quite complementary. Because of the fact that a twice-daily formulation has better effects on post-meal spikes and the indications of BYETTA over time, we would expect to see BYETTA usage as an adjunct to patients taking daily insulin to treat their disease and that's clearly later stages of the disease. And with the weekly convenience and the better nausea profile of BYDUREON, we think they will be valued by patients at an early stage of the disease. So we will be thinking about both agents within the franchise, and we'll be focusing on supporting the performance of both.","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes. And outside of the U.S., the responsibility of these products is in the hands of Lilly. We had some good initial contacts with Lilly. I spoke myself to their CEO. And soon after the closing, we will go into the details of how to transition the products from Lilly to Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca. There is a transition plan already agreed upon between Amylin and Lilly, and we will do our best to accelerate the transition. And so far, Lilly has been very cooperative, and I don't expect them to change in the interest of everybody and especially of the patients that need this GLP-1 product for the 3 companies, Lilly, AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb, to move that.","Operator","Catherine Arnold with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wondered if -- I want to go back to anti-PD-1. What's the earliest that we might see the sequential work you're doing with YERVOY in melanoma? And then secondly, what is the -- what's your current thinking on inclusion\/exclusion criteria regarding tumor expression of PD-1 in any of the solid tumor trials that are beginning, ongoing in any way, and then even, for instance, in the future, non-squamous lung trial for instance? There's obviously a lot of competition in the space. I'm sure everybody's thinking about that.","John Elicker","Elliott?","Elliott Sigal","Catherine, if I understood the questions right, the sequential data on the anti-PD-1 -- I don't have a specific date when you'll see that information. But we will start our Phase III trials in melanoma. We first thought by the end of the year or early next year, I think it's going to happen this year, and we'll be finalizing those trials with the appropriate health authorities and publishing them as soon as they're finalized on clinicaltrials.gov. I believe your second question had to do with biomarkers, and we are -- we have a very robust approach to biomarkers in the PD-1 space, and including PD-L1 as a marker, so patients are getting biopsied. We're looking at whether there's a subgroup of patients that will help personalize this approach as precision medicine. And then the PD-1 in other solid tumors will -- is being evaluated. I think this is a very exciting opportunity in multiple solid tumors.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I had one question on -- obviously, business development has been very -- has been instrumental in all the success you guys have had over the last many years. I know Jeremy Levin departed the company several months back. So I just wonder if you could give us an update on what's happening with leadership within that part of the organization. And then, number two, I was wondering if you could give us your view on, if you have one, your view on the outcomes trial for BYDUREON, whether you think that's likely to work and also update on timing and how important that may be to adoption? And then, finally, maybe just to press a little bit more on ELIQUIS. You've obviously had lots of back and forth with the FDA now. Elliott, what will be your advice to investors in terms of assuming -- in terms of thinking about whether or not they'll actually give you a superiority claim on efficacy and bleeding? I recognize that you may not go very far in answering that but I want to ask.","Lamberto Andreotti","Maybe, I should ask -- I should take Elliott out of the embarrassment of saying that we'll not answer this question but up to you to decide, Elliott. Your question about business development, we have a very good team in charge of business development here. Elliott Sigal is the interim head of that team. As you can imagine, we are all very focused on business development here at Bristol-Myers Squibb. I mean, this quarter, we have announced one of the biggest acquisitions of our recent -- our biggest acquisition over recent past. So our BD machine is working very effectively, and senior management of this company, including myself, we are all very involved in business development.","Elliott Sigal","Mark, you had 2 questions that I might be able to help with. The outcomes trial with BYDUREON is certainly a focus of ours once the transition -- once the acquisition closes. We will talk with the Duke investigators that we're quite familiar with and heavily involved in. They reached out to us. I think the way to look at this is all 3 of our mechanisms have an opportunity to modify CV risk. And all 3 of our mechanisms with AstraZeneca will have outcomes studies because it's not enough these days just to lower sugar. One must do so as safe as possible, with few hypoglycemic events and offer something in addition. Glucose plus is what we call it. The weight reduction, the blood pressure reduction and the biochemical activities of all 3  mechanisms give us hope that the outcome trials will document CV reduction. And so we will be working on that outcomes trial. It will be several years before that's available, and I think the advantage of the first weekly diabetes medicine of BYDUREON will carry it a long way, and we're committed to enhancing the delivery of that medicine. With regard to ELIQUIS, no, I won't talk about discussions that aren't finalized. But I do believe very strongly that the data should be reflected in the label, that this is a highly differentiated product with 2 wonderful studies that document a low bleeding rate and a tremendous efficacy. And that's important to reflect to patients and physicians because of the significant unmet need of stroke reduction in atrial fibrillation.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 for Elliott. First, on ELIQUIS. Is the FDA concern relative to the 380 patients lost to follow-up? And if so, why is this an issue since these cases are equally balanced in the ARISTOTLE trial in the apixaban and control groups? And if this is the question, are you simply providing the detail on these patients and that is why the final results are not being questioned? So that's the first question. The second question is, if everything were to go extremely well for the PD-1 program, what -- in what year could the first indication be on the market? Could it be before 2015?","Elliott Sigal","Well, Steve, that's a good guess, but not something I can comment on nor something I have paid a lot of attention to on ELIQUIS. I would just go back to the statement that we are verifying the data management and validating aspects of the trial, that we think the endpoints are not being questioned, and we think this is a differentiated profile and I'll be able to explain more at an appropriate time. With regard to putting PD-1 into Phase III","starting this summer, I think that we're trying everything possible to accelerate. And I don't have a prediction on when the Phase III trial or the registration will occur at this point. But as we move further, I'll be able to update people on that.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 3 fairly quick ones. First, can you just update on your -- us on your plans for PD-L1 where I think we saw some data at ASCO? Second, on the PD-1 in melanoma, can you just talk from a commercial standpoint your comfort the market can support pricing for the use of 2 immunotherapies, whatever order they come in, as you think about kind of developing the product in that setting? And then finally, switching gears to the Amylin acquisition. What's the time line over which you expect to see either an inflection point or some acceleration for the GLP-1 portfolio given your increased investment, these capabilities you've talked about? Is a 6 to 12 month kind of process post-deal close like a reasonable time frame? Or is this something that's going to take a bit longer to really see this franchise kind of hit the trajectory that you're hoping?","Elliott Sigal","Just quickly on PD-L1 and then I'll turn over to our commercial colleagues, Beatrice and Giovanni, on the other 2 questions. We have multiple options that we're evaluating for PD-L1 given the effort we're putting behind PD-1. There are some interesting applications of immune modulation that this mechanism may apply to, and specifically, we're looking at some in virology right now.","Beatrice Cazala","Yes, regarding the pricing question about PD-1, it's clear that we will first have to understand the full benefit of the product in terms of survival in melanoma. So once we have that, and we'll be able to understand also the approach to the regimen and where the drug should be used. You had also potential biomarkers. So when we fully understand the place of PD-1 in the sequential treatment for melanoma, we'll be able to determine what would be the achievable and acceptable pricing for the marketplace. This is very early days. We are learning a lot through our current activities with pricing and reimbursement and access in the U.S., obviously, but also around the world. So we will be fully prepared once we see the result of the trials to address those questions.","Giovanni Caforio","And on the Amylin portfolio, clearly, immediately after the closing, we will be extremely focused on a very rapid integration. There is good work ongoing in Amylin. At the beginning, we will focus on strengthening, advancing access. We think that's absolutely essential. We have a base to build on the endocrinology market and that can grow further. And clearly, as I said before, we will focus on the primary care segment and that will be an immediate focus. But obviously, increased penetration in primary care will happen over time.","Lamberto Andreotti","So thank you very much, everybody. In conclusion, this was an important quarter for Bristol-Myers Squibb. We are confident that both our new and key products and our pipeline will continue to position our company for long-term growth. And coupled with our disciplined approach to business development and continuing good work on our clinical trials, we are confident that -- in our company's progress as we look at our -- to our future. So thank you, everybody, and have a good morning.","John Elicker","Thank you, Lamberto. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and Tim Power and I are here for your follow-ups.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call is being recorded. And now, your host for today's call, Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Public affairs. Mr. Elicker, please go ahead, sir.","John Elicker","Thanks, Rufus, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us to review our Q1 results. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. They'll both have prepared remarks. And joining us for Q&A are Elliott Sigal, our Head of R&D; Beatrice Cazala, Commercial Operations; and Giovanni Caforio who runs our U.S. business.","First, before we get started, let me take care of the legal requirements.

We have just completed another good quarter. The external environment is certainly not becoming easier, particularly in Europe. We had challenges across all dimensions, but Bristol-Myers Squibb is staying on course. We continue to execute our strategy in a consistent manner. Our focus remains balanced on both short-term results and long-term growth as we keep increasing our sales and earnings, while delivering clinical and regulatory results.","Taken together, we started the year from a good position. With respect to sales, we grew by 5%, and this growth was broad-based and included some of our more recent product launches. I was particularly pleased with the performance of our virology franchise and other key in-line brands, including ORENCIA, SPRYCEL and ONGLYZA. For YERVOY, we had strong stable demand in the U.S., and I am particularly encouraged by improving U.S. trends in recent weeks and increased adoption in the European markets.","With respect to regulatory developments, we are moving forward on multiple fronts, 2 of which are especially significant. Regarding FORXIGA, which for those of you who do not know it yet, is the brand name for dapagliflozin, we have received a positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe. We expect the decision on marketing authorization in a few months and together, with AstraZeneca, we are already planning for an eventual launch.","We are glad about this European recognition of FORXIGA's benefit\/risk profile for treating type 2 diabetes. And also, by the fact that the agency spoke specifically of the need for additional treatment options, while highlighting the significant unmet medical need in diabetes. We will work with the FDA to clarify a path forward in the U.S., and we continue the regulatory process in all other geographies.","Regarding ELIQUIS, we are looking forward to the FDA's upcoming decision on the atrial fibrillation indication, which will hopefully be followed by decisions in Europe and Japan where we have also filed. In partnership with Pfizer, our focus now is on implementing the most effective launch plan.","With respect to clinical developments, our pipeline remains robust and encouraging. As discussed at last week's EASL meeting, we are increasingly well-positioned to meet the unmet medical need of the 170 million people worldwide who are chronically affected by hepatitis C. The data presented highlighted the broad portfolio of HCV assets that we have today, including a first-in-class NS5A inhibitor and demonstrated our diversified hepatitis C strategy based on multiple mechanist and combinations.","Thanks to the acquisition of Inhibitex and its potent nuc, we have broadened our portfolio of investigational HCV compounds and increased the potential opportunities to provide the right regimen for diverse patient populations. This is a high priority for our company, and we are devoting significant resources to it.","We are also making good progress with our immuno-oncology late stage pipeline, from our YERVOY development program, exploring additional indications in prostate and lung cancer, to our work with anti-PD-1 and other potential important asset entering Phase III for renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma. We plan to present data on anti-PD-1 at ASCO.","So we are moving forward on many fronts and maintaining our focus on balancing both short-term results and long-term investments, remaining firmly committed to commercial execution, as well as scientific advancement. This balance is particularly important as we continue to transition to our portfolio of the future and build a foundation for sustained long-term growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Charlie who will give you some additional information and walk you through some of our numbers. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft","Thank you, Lamberto. We did have strong operating results to start the year. In the first quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, an increase of 10% over 2011. Sales growth across our key products was partially offset by an increase in investment spending. We reported first quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, up 5% compared to last year. Volume was down 1%, partially, driven by PLAVIX and AVAPRO, which I'll touch on later, price was favorable by 7% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on sales. As Lamberto mentioned, we are pleased by the trends of our key brands that are important to our future growth. Let me provide a few highlights.","We continue to be encouraged by the performance of YERVOY. As the U.S. melanoma market continues to evolve, share for YERVOY was stable in the quarter, and as Lamberto stated, we have seen encouraging weekly trends over the past month or so. During the quarter, we reported YERVOY sales of $154 million, with U.S. sales of $117 million. In all markets where YERVOY is commercially available, we are focused on ensuring that physicians understand the long term survival profile of YERVOY.","We continue to make progress on access and importantly, we received a permanent J code in the U.S. earlier this year, which has helped to reduce the reimbursement cycle times. As you know, the process for getting access and reimbursement in Europe takes time as negotiations take place in each country. We believe we are making good progress with positive decisions in Belgium and Netherlands this quarter.","Our virology franchise had a very strong quarter with BARACLUDE and SUSTIVA delivering sales growth of 18% and 13%, respectively. International sales of REYATAZ were impacted by the timing of a tender in Brazil that occurred during the first quarter last year that we expect to occur in Q2 this year. The ONGLYZA franchise delivered $161 million of sales. In the U.S., the franchise delivered 10% prescription growth sequentially versus Q4, with KOMBIGLYZE up 22%.","Going forward, we are focused on driving adoption earlier in treatment as the first add-on to metformin, leveraging our head-to-head data versus sulfonylurea, and our label update for the use of ONGLYZA in combination with insulin. SPRYCEL was up 34% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. We continue to make share gains in both first-line and the continued expansion of the second-line opportunity.","The ORENCIA franchise was up 28%. Our IV volume continues to outperform the market, up 4% compared to 1% for the overall market. ORENCIA subcu was launched during the fourth quarter last year in the U.S. and had sales of $31 million in Q1, which includes a modest impact from de-stocking. The prescribing physician base is broad, and we are encouraged by the business coming from new ORENCIA prescribers.","Global sales for ABILIFY were flat. Total prescriptions in the U.S. were up 4%, outperforming the overall market, but reported sales were down 4% due to de-stocking and another step down in our Otsuka contractual share to 51.5%.","Finally, you know that we are coming to the end of the market exclusivity period for PLAVIX and AVAPRO in the U.S. and have lost exclusivity in Canada. During the quarter, sales for PLAVIX and AVAPRO were down 4% and 29%, respectively, driven in part by U.S. prescription trends.","Now let me just give you a few comments from the rest of our P&L. As John mentioned, I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results, where reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release in our website. Gross margin was 75.2%, up 150 basis points compared to first quarter last year. This favorability was driven primarily by favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 8%. This was driven primarily by increased investment behind new brands. Also included was a $12 million bad debt expense in Europe.","In terms of the rest of the year, we still believe that MS&A will decrease compared to 2011 per our guidance. You may recall that in Q4 2011, we increased investments and recorded certain onetime expenses which we do not expect to recur in 2012.","Advertising and promotion expenses were down 9%, reflecting decreased spend behind PLAVIX and AVAPRO. R&D increased 2%, driven by overall portfolio spend. The effective overall tax rate was 26.7% in the quarter. The increase compared to first quarter 2011 is primarily due to 2 factors. Firstly, the R&D tax credit has not been extended yet. We assumed the extension on our full year guidance, but it will not be reflected until it is -- the rate is approved. Second, last year, we had certain discrete tax releases that did not recur in 2012.","Now turning to guidance. You have seen that we have confirmed our 2012 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.90 to $2, and there is no change in our line item guidance.","I would now like to turn it over to your questions.","John Elicker","Thanks, Charlie. And Rufus, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A. And just a reminder, that in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, we have Elliott, Beatrice and Giovanni here to answer any questions you might have. Rufus?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a few questions related to the company's hep C program. Obviously, the data that was presented at EASL, the combination of your NS5A with Gilead's 7977, was very positive. My questions to you are this though. Just given Gilead's public stance that it is likely to develop its own combination, just if you can fill us in on what Bristol's development path forward is, and specifically where we are in the de-risking process of your own nuc? Secondly, will you comment on the study dose of 50 milligrams of 189? My question is this, is this a new consideration to go forward for the Phase III or is this part of the study design that has been in place? And then just thirdly, on your NS5A, what is the timing to getting that product to the market just according to clinicaltrials.gov, it looks like you're starting a Phase III trial for the genotype 1b population and just wondering what the sort of overall strategy is?","Elliott Sigal","Sure Jami. This it Elliott. Let met try to take those questions. First of all, we too are extremely excited by the field's reaction to very strong data presented at the European Liver Conference. This showed, for the first time, the combination of 2 oral agents achieved in a Phase II study, 100% cure of genotype 1 patients. Based on the strength of this data, we feel it's in the best interest of patients that the 2 companies pursue vigorously a clinical collaboration. And should Gilead decide to do that, we are quite open to discussions. Having said that, I am more confident than ever of the potential of our broad portfolio. The success of this trial validates our acquisition of Inhibitex, the addition of a very potent nuc, 189, to our hepatitis C portfolio. And we are -- we have plans to combine that agent with several agents, including, of course, daclatasvir, our lead 5A compound. If we step back a bit, we've been talking for some time as what it would take to achieve an all-oral regimen, and we're happy to be one of the handful of companies in the forefront here. There's some success, but there's some unanswered questions. It's clear now that monotherapy will not be sufficient. It's possible that just 2 agents will be sufficient. It's possible that a nuc may not be the only important ingredient. Some of the data presented at the conference mentioned a non-nuc. So our portfolio is very strong with the nuc, a non-nuc, a 5A, a protease and multiple collaborations. Some of the unanswered questions have to do with exactly which combination mechanisms are going to be required and whether 12 weeks or 24 weeks of an all-oral agent will be sufficient. And again, we have multiple options. So let me address first the plan for our 5A, which is well underway and where we are with the earlier program in our nuc and its progress. We believe that not all 5As are the same. Ours is differentiated first, and at present best-in-class. And we've presented important data with a protease, as well as with the nuc now. We started our Phase III program for daclatasvir in 2011, and we will continue to roll out additional studies throughout this year. Our Phase III program for daclatasvir will include studies in combination with other oral agents, as well as on top of interferon-based regimens. We will also have an active control for an approved protease inhibitor. Importantly, we see a major commercial opportunity in Japan, and we have started a Phase III combination trial, which is going very well, combining our protease inhibitor with our NS5A. We expect that this trial to be registrational, and it should complete in 2013. We also plan to start a related trial with the 5A and our protease inhibitor in null and partial responders, patients that are intolerant to PEG riba and also treatment naive patients that have the genotype 1b, and this will be a global trial relevant to the U.S. and Europe and other countries. The registrational trial will complete around 2014. In addition, adding this dual regimen on top of PEG riba forms a quad that we feel will be very useful in many situations for salvage. And we've had very encouraging Phase II data. This is moving into Phase III in the U.S. and Europe in null patients, and it's registrational program could complete in 2013. We also have several other trials where we add daclatasvir on top of interferon for special populations that will complete in 2014. Now I am, as I said, even more excited about our nuc from Inhibitex than at the time of registration because of the new data. You referenced a 50-milligram dose that would only be one possible dose we would use. We feel that there are multiple doses that are safe for human testing from 50 to 200. We will be getting more experience with 200 throughout this year. We will have safety data on a range of doses of 50 to 100, which we will at least have internally and hopefully talk about towards the end of the year. We will initiate a Phase IIb study later this year with our nuc in combination with NS5A with the range of doses, and this will help inform the doses and regimens to take forward in a 2 component all-oral agent into Phase III some time in 2013.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Alison Yang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My name is Alison Yang. I'm calling in on behalf of Tony Butler. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on ipilimumab. Firstly, could you give us a sense on first line and second line penetration based on BRAF status? Secondly, could do you comment on -- at ASCO we'll see a series of results from Roche's ZELBORAF, including BRIM, Break 3 [ph] and Break MB [ph]. How do you expect that, that's series of data will impact the volatility in that melanoma market?","Lamberto Andreotti","So let me start, this is Lamberto. Let me start with a couple of general comments about YERVOY and then I will ask Giovanni to continue. And Elliott, if you have to add something, please do it. First of all, let me say that, as you are all aware, this product YERVOY, is a very important product for metastatic melanoma patients, their physicians and of course, for our company. We are continuing to focus on ensuring that the truly differentiated long-term survival profile of YERVOY is well understood by oncologists in all the countries where it is commercially available. There is a lot of work behind this. As both Charlie and I said, in the U.S., we saw strong sales in Q1 and in addition, in recent weeks, we have been seeing some even more encouraging trend in demand. Though reimbursement and access environment outside of the U.S. continues to be somehow challenging, we continue to pursue -- ensure that as many patients as possible have access to YERVOY. And for those countries where the product is commercially available like Germany, we are glad to see that it is doing well and in the other countries we keep working diligently the pricing and reimbursement processes. Now Giovanni why don't you give some more color on -- about what we are doing of the U.S.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, good morning. This is Giovanni. As Lamberto said, we had a strong quarter in the U.S., with sales of $117 million, which is stable both in terms of sales and shares versus the previous quarter at a time in which the market continues to evolve. Going to your question, our share of new treatment initiations in the first quarter was again similar to Q4. We saw very high shares in BRAF negative patients across first and second line, and we continue to see using BRAF positive patients, including the first-line setting. At this point, approximately 70% of our business is coming from the first-line use and 30% of our business is coming from second line. Now as Lamberto also mentioned, in the last few weeks, we've seen encouraging trends in terms of demand and sales in the U.S. More importantly, as more physicians have become experienced with using YERVOY, we've seen that the perception of the product has continued to advance. Physicians are valuing increasingly the long term survival benefit for YERVOY and are becoming comfortable with its use. And we've seen continuing increase in the number of accounts ordering and using YERVOY. In terms of our thoughts regarding the transition in the market and further evolution of metastatic melanoma, I would say, the last 12 months have seen very, very significant changes in the market. We've gone from the use of old agents and the primary focus on palliation, to the adoption of new agents and the primary focus becoming the improvement of patient outcomes. And while that adoption of new agents has been quite rapid, that has been primarily the result of what is happening in the institutional setting, in the hospital setting and within the community, only in those physicians that are more experienced in melanoma and see more patients. But going forward, we see that the percentage of physicians in the community that are continuing to use older agents will shift over time to focus on survival. And when that happens, we will be very well positioned as YERVOY. So we're encouraged with the recent trends and the evolution of the market in the U.S. As a reminder, YERVOY has very strong long term survival data, and that is independent from BRAF status, and it applies broadly to all of the segments of the patient population in metastatic melanoma.","Operator","And we go next to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of questions. On ELIQUIS, assuming you receive full approval at the June PDUFA, how quickly would you be ready to launch? And second question is on the commercial potential of hep C therapies, the patient pool is large, but for most patients, the disease is asymptomatic and even though the cure rates are high, with a largely silent disease like this, I'm wondering if the ramp up may not be quite as high and as fast as some are expecting. And if that's the case, then that kind of race to be first to the market may not be quite as important, and you could end up with a crowded category with a bunch of players where everyone takes a part of the market?","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes, Tim, it's Lamberto. If you can imagine, we are very excited about the opportunity to launch ELIQUIS in atrial fibrillation. We have a differentiated profile for a disease that there's still a very high unmet medical need like atrial fibrillation is. What I would like to add on the line is that, in addition to the great profile of the product, we have 2 strong companies, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, with a strong legacy of success in CV commercialization getting ready for the launch and will behind both companies will behind the launch very effectively. We are preparing for the launch. We have been working with Pfizer to be ready sooner as we can to launch the product. And Giovanni, why don't you give some more color about what we are doing there?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, thank you, Lamberto. This is Giovanni. So building on what Lamberto said. Clearly, we are very focused on the profile of ELIQUIS and the differentiated profile of ELIQUIS not only versus warfarin, but also versus the other new agents, because of the benefit in efficacy, bleeding and mortality versus warfarin. Lamberto mentioned our and Pfizer's legacy in CV. In the U.S., we are also are very excited with the fact that we truly have complementary capabilities. We at BMS, for example, develop strong expertise in the hospital setting, Pfizer is very experienced with integrated healthcare systems in the U.S., and they clearly have with us a broad reach in primary care. So we are focusing very actively on preparing for launch, and working together to leverage our complementary capability and experience in this disease area. Regarding launch and uptake, we have learned that establishing early access and reimbursement is very critical to a successful launch. And that will be our focus in the first 4 to 6 weeks after we receive approval. During that period, which will likely be during the summer months, we will also be focusing on training our sales force and medical organizations to begin promoting and supporting the product. Once we begin to promote, we expect that the primary opportunity for ELIQUIS at launch will be to compete for new patient starts and patients who are no longer well-controlled on warfarin. And based on our profile, we plan on working to establish ELIQUIS as the leading new agent for these patients. Over time, as physicians become more comfortable with the profile of ELIQUIS and its overall value, we believe that other patient segments such as those on aspirin or switches from patients that are controlled on warfarin could become significant opportunities. In the long term, the size of the opportunity of ELIQUIS will ultimately be dependent on a number of factors: The incidence of A-fib and how it grows annually; the evolution of the percentage of patients that get treated; the share that new agents capture, and within that, our share with ELIQUIS; and finally duration of therapy. So in summary, we're excited with the profile of the product, with Pfizer as 2 companies which have significant experience in CV, but also complementary capabilities in the U.S. market. We're working very hard to prepare to launch, and we will be ready to execute the commercial launch when we're approved by the FDA.","John Elicker","And Beatrice, did you want to comment on the HCV opportunity?","Beatrice Cazala","So you're asking our views on the commercial opportunities and the way the market could shape up. You heard Lamberto talking about 170 million people worldwide. What's important to realize, it's only 20% of patients that are infected that are currently diagnosed. And only 10%, even less than 10% in some geography are treated. So the magnitude of the opportunity is significant. We know that physician, payers and patients are looking for safer and more tolerable regimen, with better cure rates and with shorter duration of therapy. Once this is available, we believe that there will be a rate of patient coming into the health care system that will need to be treated. So delivering on these advances could drive a strong expansion of the number of treated patient and result in significant commercial potential over time. When we looked at the various criteria for critical success factor, we are well aware, and we are analyzing those and monitoring them regularly. The change that this would create would impact significantly. At the moment, we have very conservative assumption. The potential increase in treatment rate with safer, easier to use, and more effective therapy will be also key. And we don't know yet which products will be there available and in which regimen. The share of patient treated with each regimen, because each regimen will be about efficacy, but it will also be about safety and individual patient tolerability and acceptance of those regimen. The payor response might be very different in different geographies to the development of novel treatment options, the price expectation [ph] and finally, the sequence as you mentioned of competitive launch is something very important. So working on those adds, you heard from Elliott the strength of our portfolio. We believe we will be ready for all scenarios because we have a very complete scope of products, and we mentioned the dias [ph], but we also as you know, have alonda [ph] interferon in development. So we feel that we are very well positioned to succeed adding and monitoring all the criteria for critical success factor in this market.","Operator","And we go next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just very quickly, can you guys update us on what happens, and if there were any changes quarter-to-quarter with regard to stocking as it relates to ABILIFY and also if there were any trend changes on REYATAZ that you can just update us on quickly? Separately, with regard to the ELIQUIS launch, it sounds like you guys are talking about this as an incident-type patient population. Can you just remind us the size of the global patient population? And how we should be thinking about the sequence of the launch opportunity? It seems like incident patient population opportunities and new patient opportunities rather than switch opportunities have been relatively slow launches. And then the last question is with regard to ELIQUIS, some of the feedback that we continue to get from physicians on a regular basis has been with regard to inertia and part of that is related to the patient and the price of therapy and the cost of therapy associated with that. Obviously, access is a big part of that, but access is also baked to price globally. So maybe you can just talk to us about whether or not you think apixaban warrants a price premium or if you think a price premium is flawed? We've seen a different approach from Regeneron, where they came in at a lower price and have actually generated an absolutely phenomenal launch, at least in the short term.","Lamberto Andreotti","Let me say the following. Giovanni can you take ABILIFY and REYATAZ, and Beatrice to speak about the global opportunity and some of the access considerations on ELIQUIS. Obviously, we are not going to discuss the price that we are going to charge for ELIQUIS in the future. It's too early, and it is clearly -- we're not going to discuss it today. So Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. Very quickly on the performance of ABILIFY and REYATAZ starting with ABILIFY. From a DRx perspective in the U.S., we continued to see strong performance for the brand. We grew 4% versus prior year in DRxes, which is significantly higher than the total market. We had some inventory work-down during the quarter, and the change in our agreement with Otsuka, which impacted net sales versus previous. But from a demand perspective, it's a really good picture with 4% DRx growth. REYATAZ, we also did grow 3% in demand versus the same quarter of last year. We continue to be the #1 prescribed PI. There are a lot of new competitors in the market, but we continue to have a very strong position in the marketplace.","Charles A. Bancroft","Yes. I would just add to that. Recall in my remarks, Seamus, around the tender business, which is quite large in Brazil to the government there. We didn't really have much of a tender in the first quarter this year. As I said, we expect it in Q2. And then last year, we did have the tender. So there was a timing issue there on a global basis for REYATAZ.","Lamberto Andreotti","Beatrice, on ELIQUIS?","Beatrice Cazala","Yes, regarding the global opportunity, you were asking the size. I mean, we have to recognize that there is about 10 million people which have today worldwide the A-fib conditions. So representing about 15% to 20% for stroke. So when you look at that, it's clear that there is a significant potential. So you are talking about where are the opportunities mentioning that, obviously, the new patient are easier because you don't have to switch them to get and again [indiscernible] as was already mentioned to you, of what we are going to do in the first stage of the launches. Overall, when we look at the global market, including switch for warfarin, an important part of what we want to achieve. You know that a lot of patient are not well controlled in terms of the INRs with warfarin. So understanding fully what control means over time. It's not going to be easy to convince everybody, but we believe we have a strong data, which will allow us to be able to access both segment of the market, both the naive patient, as well as the warfarin currently only-treated patients. So when you look at the sequences of launches and what could happen on a worldwide basis, it depends on the ability to get first the registration, and we are finding in most of the geography. But also the ability to get access, and I will mention in particular Europe, you mentioned some of the launches there. It's clear that based on what we are hearing as you know, ELIQUIS has been launched in some of the European market today, and we are gaining reimbursement. Relatively, I would say, positively across Europe. I don't know how much. In all the discussion we are having with the authorities on pricing, we feel very encouraged by the dialogues we have talking about our product, its profile, and they're asking us when are we going to come with A-fib. So we see a positive acceptance of our current profile with very important data we have on both ARISTOTLE and AVERROES. You also know that in some geographies, not just warfarin patient, those are important, but there's also aspirin-treated patients. There are many geography where it's aspirin that has been used because they don't and cannot use warfarin. So in those market with our data, we feel again, we have a unique opportunity versus some of our competitors regarding a broad scope of studies, allowing to face the different patient types. With that, you mentioning the speed of penetration, one has to realize that a lot of the patient are coming to the hospital first. And it's half of the population going to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment before going to the cardiologist and the PCP. And because of that, nature of the -- you need a certain time to establish formularies, to follow the patients through the continuum of care, to be able to follow the chain of treatment, all the way to the PCPs. So we have been working, Giovanni mentioning to you, but it in every geography we are looking at that very carefully to optimize our launch penetration.","Lamberto Andreotti","So let me add one comment on ELIQUIS. I have very many reasons to be proud of my R&D team. And Elliott and his team have done a great job also on ELIQUIS, and I'm very proud of the fact that this is a global filing. We have filed in the U.S., we have filed in the EU, and we have filed in Japan. So this is really a global successful approach to the development of our product.","Operator","And we go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups on those, and I  appreciate those comments on ELIQUIS. One view that seems to be out there as part of the reason we saw PRADAXA quickly ramp then slow as the product captured a lot of the kind of low-hanging fruit in the market here of \"really difficult to treat\" warfarin patients. How are you kind of factoring that in as you kind of think of it being, while very differentiated product, the third kind of new oral coagulant -- anticoagulant kind of entering here and as you're thinking about the launch trajectory? The second question, you've mentioned again going after aspirin, going after existing warfarin patients, can you just give us a sense of just how long of a timeframe you are thinking here till those become a reality? Is that 1 year or 2? Is that 3 to 5 years? Just trying to kind of frame up how you're thinking about how long that opportunity takes to play out? And then just a final question and shifting back to hep C, markets obviously rapidly evolving, you've got a lot of assets, do you expect once the dust settles though, we're going to see 1 or 2 regimens really dominating globally? Or will this end up being a pretty fragmented market with a lot of different combinations used in different geographies, in different patient genotypes, et cetera? Just any comments there will be appreciated.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, this is Giovanni. Let me start in clarifying some of those comments I made earlier on ELIQUIS. You're right. As we think about the source of patients for ELIQUIS at the beginning, we do think that accumulation of early switch patients were probably already picked up by PRADAXA. And so as we think about the opportunity for ELIQUIS, the primary opportunity at the beginning will be to compete for new patient starts, and that's where our strong profile will be helpful there, and we will be focusing on that as a primary area of focus at the beginning. We did describe a sequence of opportunities in different segments of the market becoming available over time. That will take time. And it will be different one country and one market from the other, but we do see those segments becoming available over time, and our strategy will be to really think about the sequential approach.","Elliott Sigal","Yes, Chris, with regard to the hepatitis C market, I think at this time it's prudent for a company to envision some segmentation geographically. And our strategy is based on that. For example, in Japan, I see -- since the genotype of the virus is predominantly 1b, and we have very high cure rates in Phase II with the protease and the 5A, that oral regimen, I think, looks like it could have a very, very important contribution and hard to improve upon perhaps. And in the developing countries, specially with a predominance of the host genotype leading to a very good response of interferon-based regimen, and the access pressures being such that a lot of the new oral medicines may not be as attractive over there, we have a strategy based on improved interferon that will improve the number of patients and be a very good value to enable access without a very complicated or expensive regimen. With regard to the rest of the world, especially U.S. and Europe, I think we're off to the start of simplicity of perhaps 2 agents, and the question's whether it will be 12 weeks or 24 weeks. And then what to do with the smaller percentage of patients that don't respond to regimens. And our program, as you see, is directed in those large segments.","Operator","And we go next to Mark Schoenebaum with the ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I thought perhaps I'd address these for Elliott, if it's appropriate. Noticed you partnered with Medavir and Tibotec on their protease inhibitor. Are you interested in a partnership with Gilead or would you rather go it alone? The second question is some companies in the hep C space have said -- have made statements that the FDA might allow them to move into a Phase III trial, combining novel oral agents without a significant Phase II experience. Is that consistent or inconsistent with the feedback that you've gotten? And then finally, on your NS5A, Elliott, you mentioned you think it's best-in-class. I was wondering if you could help us understand what the attributes are for your 5A that may be better than the other ones out there?","Elliott Sigal","So taking some of these questions in the reverse order. What we look for, we've had a lot of experience with NS5A, and we have a whole series of backups and improvements should they be needed. And a lot of experience of how the different molecules perform. The 3 criteria we look at, of course, are the PK to make sure that at reasonable doses, you're getting appropriate drug levels. We look at resistance profile, whether one mutant or multiple mutants are required to escape the regimens drugs. And we look at potency across different genotypes. And in those 3 categories, I'm quite pleased to-date, but never complacent for tomorrow with regard to where our 5A is. And I think, I would not make assumptions that all compounds are the same. I don't think we've ever done that in pharmaceutical development. Chemical changes and dose changes and resistance changes, ask new questions that have to be answered typically in a good Phase II study. So that's the assumption we have made. That's the feedback we get, although, with our experience, there are a lot of ways for us to have very, very competitive timelines. Well, you asked specifically about Gilead. We've offered for a matter of months a pure and simple clinical collaboration to get these 2 lead compounds together in Phase III data that would benefit patients, instruct physicians, when both compounds come to market. So because that regimen can be, I think, in a significant lead position in the field and make a major contribution. I think it's good for patients. That's our business model. It's very good for us. If it's determined to be good for Gilead, we're open to the collaboration.","Operator","And we go next to Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll start with Elliott on dapa. Do you have any sense at all what the FDA bar is based on the interactions you've had with them or do you need an official meeting for that? And then a bigger picture question for the team, from an M&A perspective, is the company open to acquisitions that enhance existing commercial franchises, but then don't have much of a pipeline elements? Or you can just answer the question that you think I'm probably asking.","John Elicker","Well, let me just take that one first, Greg. It's John. We're not going to comment on any rumors or speculation. Charlie can comment in a minute about our capital allocation priorities, but Elliott do you want comment on dapa?","Elliott Sigal","Yes, I'm not sure yet because the complete discussions have not occurred with regard to the FDA. Of course, we are very pleased to have received a positive opinion from the CHMP on April 19, and expect that will be followed by European approval. I took note of their comments, of their concern about the increasing prevalence of the disease, the progressive nature of the disease, the need for combination therapy. And the note -- as we note, that other drugs that are out there have side effects. And therefore, their determination of the benefit risk was in keeping with the way we saw the clinical data. And while we are working on our approvals around the world, we will be meeting with the FDA soon to discuss a path forward. And we hope that a similar recognition of the unmet medical need will guide our discussions with the agency.","Charles A. Bancroft","Let me just briefly touch on BD. I would say in summary, nothing has changed regarding our overall BD strategy. As we've said many times, business development is one of our top priorities as evidenced by our recently completed acquisition of Inhibitex. And even with that transaction, we continue to view business development as a key priority within the framework of a balanced capital allocation approach. We continue to be interested in small molecules, as well as expanding our biologics capabilities that are aligned with our key therapeutic areas. And we will continue to look for BD opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth. And we are also interested in near-term opportunities that would improve the overall growth profile of our company. And of course, we will remain disciplined with regard to focusing on transactions that are strategically, scientifically and economically sound.","Operator","And we go next to Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, can you give us an update just on SPRYCEL and the share that's going on and how much are you taking there? First line versus second line and how that's moving? And second on ORENCIA, can you talk about just how much of the sales are subcu right now? What percent of shipments? Just give us some sense of what's going on and your share of that marketplace?","Lamberto Andreotti","SPRYCEL, progress -- significant progress in establishing it as important medicine in CML. In the very competitive market, we grew the business by 51 -- 52%, in fact, in the U.S. and 27% in international markets compared to Q1 of last year. In the U.S., we saw growth, driven by both continued adoption in the first-line setting and our continued leading share in the second-line segment. Outside of the U.S., I'm very pleased by the strong adoption of SPRYCEL in first line in Japan. And our European business continues to do well now that we have first-line reimbursement in many countries that include Germany, Italy and Spain. Do you want to add something Giovanni? And maybe you can also continue on ORENCIA.","Giovanni Caforio","This is Giovanni. Just to add on what Lamberto said, we had very strong performance in the U.S. with SPRYCEL similar to what happened in other parts of the world. We grew over 50% versus prior year, and 8% versus prior quarter, driven by demand, primarily. We continue to see the GLEEVEC business slowly eroding. There are approximately slightly under 76% of patients in the U.S. now still on GLEEVEC, but we continue to make inroads in both first and second line in both segments of the market. In first-line, we're slightly ahead of the TASIGNA. In the second-line setting, we're capturing about 58% of that opportunity. So the SPRYCEL business continues to grow very nicely. On ORENCIA, we also had in the U.S. a strong quarter versus last year. We had over 20% growth in sales versus last year. And let me make you a couple of comments and describe how we are doing in the IV segment, which to-date has been our core business, and then what is happening with the launch of subcu. So we have strong performance in IV. We grew volume by 4% versus last year. The total IV market grew less than 1%. Our current share in patients in IV is about 24%, and we are capturing approximately 30% of the new patient opportunities. In Q1 versus Q4, our IV business was stable, which we consider to be very important. Since October, we've been focusing on the launch of ORENCIA subcu and that launch is going well. In the first part of the launch, we focused on access and reimbursement, and approximately at the end of Q1, approximately 80% of commercial lives are covered, and we have open access in more than 60% of that market. We've seen good uptake in demand for subcu in the first quarter. Our sales were $31 million, which also included $2 million of inventory work-down. And what we've seen is a couple of things. First of all, the base of prescribers and trials has grown very, very nicely. And the majority of the prescribers are not heavy prescribers of ORENCIA IV. So they're new prescribers for us. And second, over 80% of the business we've captured so far has actually been new business that has not been the result of cannibalization of existing IV business. And so this is very consistent with our objective of leveraging the launch of ORENCIA subcu to establish a strong presence in the 60% of the market, which is subcu.","Elliott Sigal","And Giovanni, I'll follow with a brief research update that following the approval last year in the U.S., we've submitted in Europe the subcu application, and we're pleased to be presenting at EULAR. I think one of the first comparative studies of its kind head-to-head with ORENCIA subcu and HUMIRA. And that will be in early June.","Operator","And we will go next to John Boris with Citi.","John T. Boris - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One on ELIQUIS, do you have launch quantities built since there's only a couple of months here before FDA action, and then have you completed label negotiations with the FDA on ELIQUIS? And if so, have you done any market research testing with that label and what are the top attributes at least that would cause physicians to want to pen a prescription for that of ELIQUIS? And then I have a follow-up for Elliott on hep C.","Elliott Sigal","With regard to ELIQUIS, both sides are heavily engaged in this very extensive file. We don't comment on the details until the FDA is completed. The label is one of the last things completed, but I am pleased with the progress and confident in the presentation of the data that I expect to be in the label.","John Elicker","And then in terms of launch quantity, Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Sorry, I didn't understand I was supposed to give this answer, but we are in shape. Yes, of course, yes.","John Elicker","John, we may have lost you for your follow-up on hep C, so please give us a call once the call is over.","Operator","And we go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I dialed in a little bit late, so I apologize if I'm repeating anything, but Elliott, I was hoping that you could just talk about your process of figuring out the right dose for the nuc, plus NS5A used in Phase III. Specifically, I know that there is an 90-patient study #094 in combination with PEG interferon and ribavirin. But I'm just not sure if that will help you understand the toxicity better. And specifically, how that will inform the decision on a different combination for Phase III. So if you could just talk about the process and the additional data that you'll be looking at to help you decide by the end of the year the right dose for Phase III that would be helpful. And then the second question on that is, do you still plan to do Phase III, plus or minus ribavirin? And then the final question is a commercial question, and I apologize if this was addressed, but obviously, YERVOY did not grow sequentially in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter in the United States as expected given the BRAF introduction. Just wanted to get your sense for when you would expect YERVOY in the U.S. to start growing against sequentially?","Lamberto Andreotti","David, you might have called a little bit later, so I suggest that the information about YERVOY that Giovanni gave before, and I'll repeat it now. But the good thing is that, as we said, and Giovanni confirmed. the trend of prescriptions is positive in the last few weeks.","Elliott Sigal","And I can give a quick answer to what we were discussing before, David. That the current Phase II you referred to of 90 patients, we believe will contribute, important to our safety database. But we are designing for starting this year a Phase IIb of daclatasvir in combination with a variety of doses of our nuc. And the result of that Phase IIb will define the dose and regimen with or without ribavirin for our Phase III next year.","Lamberto Andreotti","So thank you for your many and good questions. Summary, good quarter. We are working hard on delivering both our short term and long-term objectives, and we are excited about this transition to new post-AVAPRO, post-PLAVIX era that we have initiated. Thank you.","John Elicker","Thanks, everybody. That concludes our call.","Operator","And again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Jake, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us on the call today to discuss our second quarter results. With me this morning are Giovanni Caforio, our Chairman and CEO; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer; Tom Lynch, our Chief Scientific Officer. We have Johanna Mercier who runs our U.S. business and Chris Boerner, who runs our international business. Giovanni and Charlie will have prepared remarks, and then Tom, Johanna and Chris will be here for Q&A as well.","Before we get started, I'm going to handle the safe harbor language. During the call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in our SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.","We'll also focus our comments today on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations to these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. I'm proud to speak to you today about a very good second quarter with outstanding performance across the company. Before I talk further, I want to acknowledge the contributions and leadership of Murdo Gordon, whose departure we announced on Monday. As you know, Murdo helped build a high-performing commercial organization, developing some incredibly talented teams and leaders, including Chris and Johanna, who are here with us today. We are in a very strong position, and we will be finalizing a successor for the Chief Commercial Officer shortly.","Now, let me discuss the quarter. The results we reported today were driven by strong commercial execution in our key franchises of Opdivo and Eliquis and across our portfolio. As I mentioned, our commercial teams continue to deliver at a superior level in a dynamic and highly competitive environment.","At the beginning of the year, I spoke about a focused set of opportunities with Eliquis and Opdivo that we saw driving future growth for the company. Now, at the end of the first half, I'm very pleased with where we are. With Eliquis, I see considerable room for the market to expand, which we saw during the quarter. Eliquis delivered exceptional performance, with continued increased adoption based on the clinical benefits that have made it the leading NOAC. Looking forward, Eliquis is poised to overtake warfarin in the broader oral anti-coagulant class, and I'm confident Eliquis will continue to be an important driver of growth for the company.","With Opdivo, earlier this year I described a number of really important opportunities to further establish Opdivo as foundational in multiple lines of therapy and in multiple tumors. We have made good progress in these areas, and I'll focus more on some of these in a moment. For example, the strong launch in first line renal cell cancer builds on our success in second line and reinforces the important role of Opdivo in earlier lines of therapy. Similarly, we saw continued strong uptake for Opdivo in adjuvant melanoma, which is now standard of care in this setting.","The role of the Yervoy continues to be important. As you know, the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy is now approved in three tumors, renal, colorectal and melanoma. In fact this quarter we saw a return to growth of Yervoy in the U.S. compared to Q1, driven by the strong uptake of the first line RCC launch. The rapid uptake we are seeing in the U.S. is a result of strong commercial execution and the compelling overall survival benefit demonstrated in this population by Opdivo plus low dose Yervoy.","Knowing the importance of this regimen to patients with RCC, I'm very disappointed to share that we have just learned that we will be receiving a negative opinion from the CHMP in first line renal. We strongly disagree with this opinion and in the interest of patients, we will pursue a re-examination under the EU regulatory process. Tom can provide more color during the Q&A.","Strong increased demand for our medicines and not pricing has driven our results. Now, we've all seen the developing discussion on pricing and affordability, which is an important topic for us and for the industry. As a company, we welcome the opportunity to improve the system with a focus on patient affordability and on addressing misaligned incentives in the supply chain. We're following this issue very closely and we are committed to working with the administration. We can answer any specific questions you have later in the call.","During the quarter, there was significant scientific advances in immuno-oncology, in particular with the data presented at ASCO. I was pleased to see the evolution in the discussion of tumor mutation burden or TMB and believe that TMB will play a role in lung cancer and more broadly as we further define its value in treatment with I-O agents. In Europe and the U.S. our applications for Opdivo plus Yervoy in first line lung cancer were accepted and remain under regulatory review. Going forward, the role of biomarkers in I-O is an important part of our strategy that we continue to investigate across our pipeline.","Looking ahead, we had some very important near term catalysts. For Opdivo, we're looking forward to important data readouts in the next six to 18 months for non-small cell lung cancer, HCC, small cell lung cancer, gastric and head and neck. I'm also excited by the progress with our diversified pipeline and the work we are doing in cardiovascular disease, immunoscience and fibrosis. As you know, we recently signed a collaboration with Janssen for our Factor XIa compound in thrombosis and that is moving forward.","Additionally, I'm particularly encouraged by the profile of our TYK2 compound. We believe the mechanism for TYK2 is promising not only in psoriasis where we present data in Europe in September, but in a range of other immunologic disease targets. This is an exciting compound and we expect to start registrational studies in the next few weeks.","In closing, we are executing very well and I believe we are focused on the right strategic opportunities for the future. We are investing commercially and in our pipeline to drive growth. And I feel very good about the progress we're making.","With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good morning, everyone. We delivered an outstanding quarter highlighted by strong revenue growth. The sales increase of 26% for our prioritized brands was driven by substantial gains in demand for our two key growth franchises, Eliquis and Opdivo.","Let me start with Eliquis, which delivered 40% growth during the quarter. Eliquis is already the number one NOAC in the U.S. and in many other important top 10 markets around the world including Germany, France and the UK. As Giovanni said, we soon expect Eliquis to overtake warfarin and become the leading OAC in the U.S. We also continue to see prescription trends that signify further expansion of the NOAC class. For example, in the U.S., we expect significant further decline in warfarin usage as it currently has nearly 40% share of total prescriptions but has only about half of that share of new prescriptions. As NOAC usage expands, we expect Eliquis to maintain its leading position in the class with substantial growth momentum going forward.","I'll now turn to our I-O franchise, where in a highly competitive environment we delivered 36% growth for Opdivo during the quarter. In the U.S., this growth is driven primarily by uptake in our new indications, first line renal cell and adjuvant melanoma. For first line renal cell, we've seen rapid adoption of Opdivo with low dose Yervoy. Having just launched in April, this regimen already has roughly 30% share of new patients, making it the leading treatment in the U.S.","Uptake of Opdivo in adjuvant melanoma in the U.S. has also been very strong, and this indication is an important opportunity for us. We exited the quarter with Opdivo having close to 70% share. We're also seeing early signs that the compelling efficacy and safety profile, coupled with the four-week dosing option, are driving up treatment rates for early stage melanoma patients.","With respect to lung cancer, we've seen our share of second line I-O eligible patients remain stable, despite some expected contraction in the size of the second line lung I-O market. Outside the U.S., where we expect a longer period of stability for the second line market, execution remains strong across our key markets. We have also secured reimbursement for most current indications earlier in the year, and we are preparing for the European launch in adjuvant melanoma, given the positive CHMP opinion. With these trends in mind, we continue to view Opdivo as a growth brand, both this year and in 2019.","As Giovanni mentioned, Yervoy has returned to sequential quarterly growth. This is a function of three factors. Firstly, we continue to see leadership for Opdivo\/Yervoy in first line melanoma. Secondly, we have now worked through the shift to Opdivo mono in adjuvant melanoma, and lastly and very importantly, the rapid uptake of the Opdivo\/Yervoy regiment in renal cell. We've also been encouraged to see first line renal cell driving an expansion of the Yervoy prescriber base, with about 50% of use in renal coming from new prescribers.","Now I'd like to highlight a number of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by product mix, offset by favorable FX compared to Q2 last year. Once the FX favorability in the quarter is excluded, gross margin is roughly unchanged from Q1.","As I've described in the past, other income and expense has increased this year, mainly due to diabetes royalties and the recognition of net pension benefits now recorded in other income. Looking forward to the second half of the year, this line will be affected by the loss of the Erbitux royalty in North America at the end of Q3.","Regarding OpEx, we remain disciplined in our spending as we continue to drive efficiencies in our MS&A line to facilitate investment in R&D. And finally, with regard to our tax rate, the favorability in the quarter compared to last year is largely due to the impact of U.S. tax reform.","Turning to capital allocation where we continue to take a balanced approach, business development remains a top priority for use of capital, as does our commitment to our dividend.","I'll now provide some comments on guidance. Based on our strong sales trends in the business, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the mid to high-single digit range. With this in mind and based on strong business performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.20. As always, our guidance assumes current foreign exchange rates.","To close, we had a very strong quarter with the Eliquis and Opdivo franchises continuing to drive quality growth. We remain disciplined in prioritizing our resources to the areas that we believe will deliver the highest value. And lastly, we believe our business continues to be well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities.","Now I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Charlie. And, Jake, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A session, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will begin with Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. A couple. I'll start with Tom, since it was offered that you could expound on the CHMP disappointing decision. Can you put some more meat on the bones there and talk to any read-through there as it relates to other settings and other situations?","And secondly on the TYK2 program, obviously, a high bar in that disease state. You've made the decision to spend a lot of money and resource going forward in pivotals. Is route of delivery the key hook there? Or is there more to it than that, Tom? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Gregg, thank you for your questions. Let me start off with talking about the renal finding. And we just learned about this yesterday actually from the CHMP. And they offered a negative opinion on study 214. And the basis for their finding or their discussion was really that they did not feel that we had demonstrated the contribution of components sufficiently well to grant this. And they were worried about establishing a precedent in that setting.","We believe strongly that the combination of Opdivo\/Yervoy is an extremely important regimen, something doctors are going to want to be able to treat their patients with. And when we designed the study, we seriously considered whether or not a single agent arm would make sense. And after discussing with key opinion leaders around the world, we felt it did not make sense given the low single agent activity we had seen. Now, our reaction to this is we're going to proceed with asking for a re-examination and we look forward to a discussion with the CHMP regarding this application.","Gregg, I think it's important to note that we don't believe this has any real read-through to other parts of our I-O program. We believe that we have designed studies which are able to position our compounds within a broad market and I'm not worried that the CHMP opinion here really says anything else about any other tumor types down the road at that point.","So your second question is regarding TYK2 and very excited about TYK2 and what TYK2 can mean for Bristol-Meyers Squibb. And I think, Gregg, one of the things about TYK2 that really excites me is that it's not just a potential compound for psoriasis. And I think that TYK2 reflects some of the best work that's been done at Bristol-Meyers Squibb. This is really a very clever discovery chemistry picture here, in that what makes TYK2 different from other members of the JAK family inhibitors is that we've gone ahead and we've actually targeted the pseudokinase. And I could not be more proud of what our discovery group has been able to do in targeting the pseudokinase of TYK2.","As you know, we'll be presenting data at the European Society (sic) [Academy] (15:46) of Dermatology and Venereology in September of this year and we look forward to a publication in a journal at the same time. I'm not going to go into the details of the data except to say that we think that this will be very impressive data that will make a big impact in the market and it certainly has convinced us that moving forward with a Phase 3 program makes sense.","I think, Gregg, it's the oral convenience of a biologic would be a terrific attribute of a drug like this and I think it would make it appealing to patients who are thinking about options in psoriasis.","And finally, I think what makes TYK2 particularly exciting is, again, it just doesn't target one pathway. You get both the IL-12\/23 pathways as well as interferon. The possibilities in lupus and inflammatory bowel disease, I think, are extremely exciting. So we have a lot of enthusiasm for TYK2 as we move forward and we look forward to sharing that data with you in Europe this fall.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Gregg, this is Giovanni. Maybe just to go back for a second to the discussion about renal in Europe. Obviously, as Tom said, it's disappointing news that we've received. I think it's important for patients that we go forward. I just want to step back and put this into the context of a significant number of growth opportunities we have. Charlie stated clearly we see Opdivo as a growing brand next year and this development, which is still happening, does not change our perspective there.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Gregg. Jake, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Of course. We'll now hear from Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just to follow up on the European decision, maybe, Johanna, from a commercial perspective, how should we think about the commercial opportunity in Europe for renal? Would this or will this still, or I don't know how to think about that, but just in thinking about the sort of opportunity lost, was this about a quarter of the global opportunity for renal? Help us to think about what the revenue opportunity could be, may have been, et cetera.","And also just if you could explain the incredible resilience that we're seeing in Opdivo in the second line lung market. You said, Johanna, at our conference that you expected a 30% decline over the next two years. That is much more moderate than I think what the Street is expecting. Can you explain why only a 30% decline and really just what kind of feedback are you getting from physicians? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jami, thank you. This is Giovanni. So let me just, obviously we're not going to be able to elaborate further on the regulatory front. But let me just ask Chris first to give you his perspective on the dynamics in Europe in renal between second and first line. And then Johanna can go back to your question about the evolution of the first line lung cancer market.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jami, thanks for the question. Let me just start by saying we're obviously very happy with the growth that we've seen with Opdivo outside of the U.S. It's really been across markets and across indications. As we think about the Opdivo business going forward, really the way I think about it is in two tranches.","So first, our base business continues to be strong with Opdivo. We expect the second line lung cancer market to stay relatively stable outside of the U.S., with shares at roughly 40% to 50% range. While we do expect the dynamics of the frontline lung cancer market to impact second line, we won't likely see that until well into 2019 for a number of reasons, notably the timing of regulatory approvals and then access decisions in first line as well as the fact that we didn't see an earlier approval for PD-1 in chemotherapy in first line outside of the U.S. So the second line lung cancer business remains stable.","And then beyond lung cancer, we think there are additional opportunities for growth with Opdivo in our base business, notably renal cell. Metastatic melanoma continues to be strong. We're starting to see some uptake of Opdivo plus Yervoy in the metastatic BRAF mutant population. And as we continue to see additional access decisions, we'll see growth in other tumors such as head and neck.","Obviously, as we look forward for more significant growth outside of the U.S., that will be based on new indications. We're obviously disappointed with the decision on renal cell. We'll have to await additional regulatory interactions to know what opportunity there will be there. But in the near term, we have opportunities potentially with indications such as adjuvant in melanoma.","And then in the longer term, front line lung cancer and have had our cellular opportunities as well. And then clearly, the gating factor for those growth opportunities will be the timing of approvals and access decisions. But we're still very optimistic for the opportunity to grow Opdivo outside the U.S. Johanna?","Johanna Mercier - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Good. So, Jami, in regards to second line lung, I think second line lung is absolutely part of our strong base of business in the U.S., and one of the reasons for that is we've been able to maintain our leadership share of about 30%, 35% in a very dynamic market, as you pointed out. We've seen slow erosion of the patient eligibility, as predicted, as we had planned. And it's important to understand kind of like what we spoke to at the Goldman Conference, it's important to understand that the patients today that are on Opdivo actually were on chemo six, nine months ago and have actually progressed into second line. So there's a temporal effect to this.","So if you assume that that erosion will accelerate in 2019 because your I-O penetration in first line accelerates in 2018, we are assuming about 70%, 75% of the market penetration in I-O towards the end of this year. That does mean that there's still about 25%, 30% of patients that are actually on chemotherapy in first line that will eventually progress to second line and feed into that second line marketplace. In addition to those chemo patients, you also have some second line plus EGFR out positive patients as well as some I-O retreatment because they have no other options.","All of that together represents about 40% to 50% of that patient eligibility, which is the drop from about 80% today and towards end of 2019, which is still a substantial market in second line. And obviously, we get more than our fair share in light of the fact we are market leaders in second line.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Jami, for the questions. Jake, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Yes. The next question will come from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just two here. Maybe first on just a little bit more color on OpEx trends for Bristol over time. In the past, you've commented I think flat OpEx in 2020 relative to the 2017 baseline. Are we still on track for that type of spend? And I guess, when we think about PD-1, and more broadly, I-O investment in R&D, when do we think about that? Is that starting to peak or at least plateau over the next year or two? Or should we continue to see a ramp in spend on that piece of the business?","My second quick question was just can you run through Opdivo sales by indication at this point, both U.S. and ex-U.S.? And just specifically, where does lung stand as a percent of your sales at this point? Thanks so much.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah, so Chris, how are you doing? So regarding OpEx, we've been pretty consistent in how we have really driven resource allocation across the company, and really as you saw in last year and as you saw in our guidance this year, really managing MS&A and improving that year over year and also then increasing what we feel is the lifeblood of our industry and particularly our company in R&D.","Since we gave the original guidance back in 2016 regarding flat OpEx, it assumed no additional BD opportunities and no enlargement of our oncology portfolio. In addition, where we were at with our earlier assets. So as you know, between Halozyme and Nektar and the expansion of our initiation of earlier and mid-stage trials, we have increased our OpEx. But we continue to manage it in those areas where we feel will drive the highest value for BMS.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Johanna?","Johanna Mercier - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yes. So, Chris, in regards to the business mix, let me start with the U.S. and then Chris will cover international. Across our I-O franchise, our lung business is about 35%, so that's kind of diminished a little bit and that's because our melanoma and renal business are increasing in light of some of the launches such as adjuvant in melanoma and also in renal. And what's interesting here is that if you look at Opdivo and Yervoy together you're looking at about 35% of our mix is melanoma, so in line with what our lung mix is. And then about 20% for renal, 5% for head and neck and a little bit of all others in the bottom five, ten parts. Chris.","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. Chris, let me just take the allocation of business outside of the U.S. It's a little bit different than in the U.S. Approximately 50% of our business ex-U.S. is in lung cancer. That reflects a couple of things. First, the timing off of our approval and access decisions as being later than what we had in the U.S., but also the strength of our business in lung cancer vis-a-vis competition, resulting from the timing of our approval in second line and the success that we've had on the access side.","So it's about 50% of our business is lung cancer, 15% to 20% of our business is in renal cell and approximately 20% of our business in is melanoma. And that piece, as you will note, a bit lower than what we see in the U.S. and that's reflective of the fact that we don't yet have adjuvant melanoma in our label outside of the U.S.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So I think that's a good summary from U.S. and international, Chris, that confirms that we are effectively diversifying the revenue base within Opdivo and Yervoy across tumor types. And we have a very balanced set of opportunities now with some of the franchises for Opdivo and Yervoy growing very rapidly, driven by new indications, and it's become a very diversified franchise, which is important obviously.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please, Jake?","Operator","Of course. We'll hear from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Olivia Brayer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Olivia Brayer on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the questions. I just have a couple. With regards to Eliquis expansion, are expectations still that Eliquis should experience continued growth until warfarin's declining share hits around 10%? Do you continue to see a linear relationship on TRx trends? And where is NRx relative to that? Just curious how you're thinking about that market.","And then turning back to lung, with the upcoming PDUFA date in first line early next year, can you provide us some sort of color on ongoing launch preparations and where your expectations lie after AACR and ASCO? Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you. So both questions, I would say let me just give you my perspective. I'm very pleased with where we are with Eliquis as both Charlie and I mentioned. We are continuing to see Eliquis having significant potential incremental growth opportunity. There is more in terms of growth coming from the cannibalization of warfarin and that is now happening around the world. But most importantly, all of that, most of that growth really is enabling us as the leading brand in the NOAC segment to grow very rapidly. So Johanna, why don't you comment on Eliquis.","Johanna Mercier - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Sure. Thanks, Giovanni. So thanks, Olivia, for your question. I think Eliquis, as Giovanni mentioned, just incredible growth story. We're still growing at between, anywhere between 35%, 40% growth year on year after six years of launch, and we are now closing the gap to overtake warfarin as the number one NOAC. And that should happen within the coming weeks.","So the opportunity as you think about the TRx and the NBRx, you still have about 36% of TRx for warfarin in the U.S. NBRx is about 22%. I think what's important here is actually look at cardiologists. Cardiologists are actually the leading indicator for us of what's going to happen. And where you see the TRx and NBRx with cardiology for warfarin, about 20 points. And so there's still a big opportunity today to really continue to erode the market share for warfarin and of course, Eliquis being number one gets more than its fair share.","I think that's one piece of the puzzle from a market opportunity. I also think we're thinking about market expansion opportunities as well. As you think about, there's still 30% of those TRx patients on warfarin that are actually uncontrolled. There is about 1 million patients that are diagnosed and not treated and then there's about another 1 million that are actually just undiagnosed. And so I think important market opportunities for the future as well. So I do believe that we will continue to grow this brand, and we are currently on that linear trend that you referred to.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","I think what's good also there is that what you heard from Johanna is very consistent with what's happening internationally. You look at France, you look at Germany, the key markets for this brand, we are in a leading position across the board. The access environment in France has actually improved significantly now, and we have opportunity because Eliquis will be able to be used in the first line setting now with the evolution of the reimbursement situation there. So I think the future is very positive there consistently across the board.","With respect to your question on launch readiness for lung, I would just probably say that we've demonstrated with every one of our launches the strong commercial execution of our organization. And every one of the launches we've executed has been very successful. So I'm very confident in the capabilities of our commercial organization. I'm actually really happy that we are seeing a strong penetration of renal because that is an Opdivo plus low dose Yervoy indication. And you've heard about the good uptake in renal in the U.S. What's important there is that about 50% of the prescribers are prescribers that did not have experience with Yervoy in melanoma. So that will broaden significantly the experience base and the adoption of the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy has been quite good.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Olivia. Jake, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. We will now hear from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to come back to in the U.S., the first line, second line lung dynamics. We've done some survey work that suggested, I actually kind of confirmed what you guys were saying that it seems like community oncologists still plan on using chemotherapy only in the front line setting in about 20% to 30% of their patients within two years from now. And so I'm just wanting to get a better sense, why is that? Do you feel like that's just community oncologists being slow to change? Do you think that that's likely to reverse after two years? Just trying to get your general sense how sticky that is and how that's going to ultimately alter the first line, second line dynamics in lung. Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Jason, let me give that a stab as a oncologist, as someone who practiced oncology for a long time. I think that when you have new therapies, uptake is variable, depending upon different groups of oncologists. I do think there will still be patients who won't get I-O first line for a number of reasons. And if you look at the penetration of any new therapy, it rarely gets to above 70% to 80% right away. So I'm actually not surprised that there are doctors who still continue to go with first line treatment with chemotherapy.","And the other key thing is a lot of physicians like to keep in reserve a great second line therapy as well. And that's been something that we've seen over the years with Taxol\/Taxotere and even EGFR inhibitors where people have held back on using them altogether. So I'm actually not surprised by seeing that, by the behavior of physicians in this setting. And I think it's something that accounts for some of the dynamics that's you're seeing.","Johanna Mercier - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And maybe just to add to that, what we're seeing when you think about all of the other tumors that I-O has penetrated, you're looking at a penetration rate of I-O anywhere between 60% and 70%. So even if you take second line lung as a proxy, there's no more than 70% penetration after a couple of years on the marketplace. And so that's just within the I-O marketplace. And what we were just referring to just a little bit earlier, if you go outside of oncology, you look at warfarin and you look at the products that are available on the marketplace that their profiles are so much stronger, you still have 40% TRx of warfarin.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Johanna. Thanks, Tom.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Jason, for the question.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jake, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","We will now hear from Andrew Baum with Citi. Go ahead, please.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, could you tell us the last time you had a look at the 568 dataset and when we should expect the presentation of that data? I understand competitive issues, but my initial sense was it's going to be before the end of this year. But that seems to have moved.","The second question is to Giovanni. Given the President's, the proposal that's been sent to the President in relation to either negating or amending rebates, could you share with us your understanding of the extent of the proposal, as much as you have any additional information, whether it is just within federal plans, whether you think PBMs would extend any change to federal plans to commercial book of business? Any sense on potential timing of impact? And I appreciate the uncertainty here. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Andrew. Tom, why don't you start on 568.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Andrew, thank you for the question on 568. So let's just think about what is 568 and why do we do 568. So 568 was a study that was initially a practice-informing study, a study that looked at Opdivo\/Yervoy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It enabled us to get some translational data that we were able to use to help support the development of TMB as a biomarker. We then amended that study to add an important safety lead-in on 568.","And so we were able to amend it to look at the two cycles of chemotherapy along with Opdivo\/Yervoy, which became the basis for study 9LA. And as you know, study 9LA is our study which will be done in front line non-small cell lung cancer and we hope to have data by the end of the next year on study 9LA, large randomized trial looking at the potential advantage of two cycles of chemotherapy given with Opdivo\/Yervoy in that setting.","The safety lead-in that was done suggested the safety profile was compatible with something which would be acceptable in this patient population. And then when one looks at the data so far, we have accrued approximately 500 patients in 9LA and we have not seen any untoward safety readouts yet that have changed our opinion about this. So we think 568 has been a very helpful study to us in the development of these other indications.","Andrew, in terms of presentation of that data, we have not yet decided upon the appropriate venue for presenting that. We will continue to watch the data mature and we look forward to presenting it at a future medical meeting.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Tom. Andrew, so very important question here. I'd like to make maybe three points. So the first one that I'd like to make is that we agree with the need for change. If you look at dynamics in the market today at a time in which rebates continue to increase, net price of medicines in many cases are not growing versus prior years. There is increased out-of-pocket cost for patients and affordability for patients is an issue. So it's clearly important to look at that issue. It's important to look at the fact that incentives in the supply chain have become misaligned with the interest of patients and so we agree that there is a need to change there.","The second point that I would like to make is that we are working with the administration. We are really looking to continue to work with the administration on these topics. I think it's very early to speculate what changes will be. There definitely is a need to look at rebates and the comments I made before. Looking at the past, in some cases changes in the Medicare space have over time translated into a change in dynamics in the commercial space, but again, I think at this point it's very early. It would be speculation.","I think what we want to see is a system that evolves and looks at three priorities. The first one is we want innovation to be rewarded and the market to be driven by market forces. We want patient affordability to be the driver of any change, and we definitely support that incentives are realigned. And these are all elements where there is a potential to cooperate with the administration and work together and really think about what changes are needed in the system.","The third point that I'd like to make is that as an innovation company with very innovative differentiated medicines in areas of high unmet medical need, we are very well positioned. And when you look at our growth in the first half of this year, significant growth across our prioritized brands, it's all volume because net prices were flat for the first six months of the year and the growth that we are experiencing net in the U.S. was really driven by volume.","I would say we have made a decision. We are not going to take price increases in the second part of this year. I think this is an important time when we're working through some really important potential changes to the market. I believe there will be the need for transition periods and in the interest of patients, I'm pretty sure that all parties will be working through the right transition time. But I believe that we at BMS are very well positioned because of our medicines and you see that reflected in our performance.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Andrew, thanks for the question. Jake, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","We'll hear now from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much and good morning. A couple of questions on I-O, if I may. Tom, how do you think about the competitive horizon in first line RCC? We've seen some encouraging data from PD-1 plus TKIs. I think that there's sets of pivotal data out next year. And even Keytruda monotherapy had some interesting data with 38% response rates at ASCO. So wondering if you think the early impressive launch in RCC will be sustainable?","And then I'm wondering if you could provide your latest comments on the NKTR-214 data, now that the dust has settled after ASCO. There was some confusion around that data that I think still persists. Thank you.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Alex. So starting off, let's talk about renal cell. I could not be happier with the way that the community physicians, academic physicians have reacted to the study 214. We think this is an extremely important trial that demonstrated really for the first time that there was a therapy that could beat Sutent. It's a very active TKI in renal cell carcinoma. So I'm delighted with the launch of Opdivo\/Yervoy. It's low-dose Yervoy in this setting and it's being well accepted by doctors and patients and we're delighted to so that.","However, I think, Alex, as you point out, this is not the end of the evolution of therapy in renal cell carcinoma. When I think of my own practice and I think back when to when I first treated renal cell carcinoma 30 years ago, we were using single agent, Velban. So we've come remarkably far in this time in how we approach this.","I am impressed with some of the data with the PD-1s and the TKIs. Obviously, this is early data. We have a trial that we're doing with cabo and Opdivo that we look forward to pursuing, our study 9ER, which will be looking at a PD-1 plus a TKI. I think there may turn out to be a population of patients where a PD-1 plus a TKI will be important. But I think Opdivo\/Yervoy will continue to play a very important role in renal cell carcinoma moving forward.","And I think a lot like you're seeing in lung cancer, I think you will see the market continue to segment where different patients may be treated with different approaches depending upon the characteristics molecularly and the characteristics of the patient as we move forward. So again, look forward to more data in renal cell carcinoma as we move forward.","Now, another place we might get some data in renal cell carcinoma is with NKTR-214, which is your second question, and where do we stand with NKTR-214. So, let me just start off by saying that I am extremely enthusiastic about NKTR-214 because of the fact that it's one of the proven mechanisms in I-O. There really are only three drugs that have been shown to improve outcome in I-O and that's the PD-1 class, that's the CTLA-4 class, and that's IL2. With the NKTR compound, the pegylation process, we have the ability to still deliver the T-cell stimulation which is crucial within the tumor, at the same time possibly increasing the Treg population in the periphery which has the ability to potentially ameliorate side effects. So mechanistically, I think there's a lot of reasons to pursue this agent and pursue the development of this agent.","So what have we seen so far? We've seen some encouraging data in melanoma that's led to the design of a Phase 3 trial which you will see soon on clinicaltrials.gov. And we hope that that trial will start accruing very soon. You'll also see by the end of the year the design of a study in renal cell and the design of a study in bladder cancer based on our initial evaluation of the Phase 2 data in PIVOT-02, a study that's being run by Nektar but which we are working very closely with them in as we move forward.","So I think that NKTR has terrific promise. I look forward to seeing the evolution of other tumor types. As you know, we have an agreement with Nektar to look at up to nine different tumor types in this setting. So I look forward to seeing how this evolves and seeing where this makes a difference. But just to put your two questions together, it may well be that NKTR-214 plus Opdivo eventually one day plays a role in renal cell carcinoma.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Alex for the questions. Jake, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","Yes, now we will hear from Dave Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions, please. First, you provided an update on 9LA, mentioning that you continue to expect the timing for readout to be late 2019. Just wondering if you have any additional comments on the 227 readouts ahead for TMB overall survival and PDL-1 positive overall survival.","And then my second question is could you please comment on the evolution of gross margin going forward? Obviously it depends upon mix but it's difficult to assess whether one should be forecasting gross margin improvement in any future years. Thanks so much.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Dave, thank you for your question. I'll answer the first part of it since I tend to probably contribute to the decay of gross margin in the company rather than the growth of gross margin in the company. So first, to your question on 9LA. So on 9LA, again, this is something we're very enthusiastic about as a approach. As you know, it's two cycles of chemotherapy along with Opdivo\/Yervoy, so combining what we believe to be perhaps the most potentially effective regimen in this setting.","We have decided to increase the accrual slightly of this study. It was accruing extremely well, and so the accrual has gone from about 500 patients to about 700 patients. Again as you know, Dave, these are event-driven occurrences, and so we think the readout's going to be in late 2019. But again, if the events happen quicker or slower, that could certainly impact when that readout would occur at this point.","Regarding 227, there are a couple of places where 227's going to produce some data. So the first would be overall survival in 227 in the PD-L1 positive group from part 1A of this trial \u2013 from part 1 of this trial \u2013 part 1A of this trial. We expect that data, again, we haven't seen any survival data from that. That's been looked at by our data safety monitoring committee. It's event driven. As we've been saying, we think that's probably early 2019. But again, it could be sooner. It could be a little bit later than that.","And then finally, the other part of your question would be the overall survival from part 2 of 227, which again is chemotherapy. It's our Opdivo chemotherapy regimen versus chemo. We expect that to be early 2019, again, Dave, with the caveat that this is an event-driven process, could be a little bit sooner, could be a little bit later.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Hey, Dave. This is Charlie. Regarding your question, gross margin, you're right. Mix will always play a big part of our gross margin evolution. As I mentioned in my comments, the sequential gross margin from first quarter to second quarter was benefited by FX. We don't expect that same impact to happen for the back half of this year and will remain within our guidance of roughly 70% for gross margin.","Moving forward, as I mentioned in the last quarter, we're predicting now that our gross margin going forward, we're sort of at the trough now of gross margin. So as you've seen over the last several years, we've had, primarily because of mix, the strong growth of Eliquis, we've had margin degradation, but we feel that we're now bottoming out on that gross margin.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Dave, for the questions. Can we go to the next question please, Jake?","Operator","You'll now hear from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'd like to follow up on Chris's question on operating expenses and apologies if I didn't catch the answer. But given the new needs on which to spend, what would be the new guidance versus the prior guidance of flat operating expenses in 2016 through 2020? So for instance, should we look for low-single-digit growth in operating expenses?","And second, why do you think the first line lung Opdivo plus Yervoy filing using TMB based on CheckMate-227 did not get a priority review from the FDA? And did Bristol ask for one? It seems that TMB offers a differentiated approach, a very useful approach, and I'm just wondering why the FDA didn't see it that way. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Steve, so I'll ask Charlie to comment. But broadly speaking, we are not providing new guidance. We're not really changing guidance with respect to OpEx. We've always said we saw that roughly flat in the period. We also discussed the fact that we would fund incremental opportunities as needed, and we feel we are executing against that.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. I think you may have heard most of my comments earlier where we are continuing to decrease in MS&A, and we've continued to invest in R&D. And when we gave guidance, we excluded BD, and we've had a number of different BD opportunities, the most notable ones of size were Halozyme and Nektar as we think about it going forward. But broadly Steve, I would look at it that we will leverage our business though going forward. So we will be growing our sales at a higher rate than we will be growing our OpEx.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Difficult to speculate on interactions with regulatory authorities. Steve, obviously the lung cancer market is a very dynamic market. We do agree with you on the potential value of TMB and the fact that it is important to really be thinking about different approaches in segmenting the lung cancer market. But ultimately, the decision on submissions stays with the FDA, and as Tom mentioned, we are working with regulatory authorities around the world.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Steve, thanks for the questions. Jake, can we go to the next one, please?","Operator","You'll now hear from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I had two on CheckMate-227 if I may. First, did you contemplate filing I-O chemo from the Part 1b of CheckMate-227s in the PD-L1 low? And I ask because I wonder if regulators could potentially be open to the idea despite the staff plan change. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that first.","Secondly, now that 227 has been filed for the I-O, I-O and TMB high, and we've seen CHMP be extremely rigorous and stringent with the extent to which they've drilled down biomarkers by subgroups, my question is have you looked at data on 227 by more onerous TMB cutoffs? Like TMB above 20 versus TMB 10 to 19? Because what I'm trying to get as is do you foresee any risk to CHMP limiting the indication to a more narrow one in first line lung? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tom.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So let's take both of these. So, Umer, thanks for your questions on 227. So the first part is, and again, we're not going to comment on our discussions with the regulators, except to announce major decisions that they reach. What I will say about 227 Part 1b, we were very happy at ASCO to present that data and that gave us the opportunity to really share some important findings in the evolution of the treatment of lung cancer.","And I've said, one of the things we've said, Umer, from the very beginning of this process, is that the treatment of lung cancer will continue to segment and that we think that there are multiple approaches that are going to be important for patients. And we learned in, as you point out in Part 1b of 227 some important things. We learned that Opdivo chemo has a benefit in PD-L1 negative patients, which is we think as good, if not better, than what other groups have produced in a similar patient population.","We also learned if you're TMB high PD-L1 negative, you may actually do better with Opdivo\/Yervoy in that setting. That was another part of the ASCO presentation. And then finally, a finding that I think is going to be important to see evolve in the marketplace is if you're PD-L1 negative TMB negative, it doesn't appear that you learn a heck of a lot, that you benefit a heck of a lot from being treated with I-O in that setting. So I share your enthusiasm for the data from 227 Part 1b and we look forward to seeing how that evolves.","Regarding your second question on the cut-offs for TMB, as you know, we use a number of sources. We use patients from study 568 as well as patients from study 026 to be able to generate the curves that suggested that a TMB of 10 was the appropriate cutoff for patients being treated with I-O, I-O therapy in that setting. And again, we look forward to the discussions with regulatory authorities around that. As you know, we don't discuss the nature of how those discussions are evolving at this time.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Umer, for the questions. Can we go to the next one please, Jake?","Operator","Yes, you'll now hear from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So just two slightly different topics from what's been covered. One, you recently got approval for Opdivo in China. And I'm just wondering how you think about pricing there, especially as we see more PD-1s enter that market including some from potential Chinese companies. So curious how you think pricing might hold up there in that large market.","And then the second one more on the Eliquis side. You recently announced a collaboration with J&J on the Phase 2 Factor XI inhibitor. And I'm just curious, the thinking there given how well the collaboration with Pfizer seems to be going now on Eliquis, the decision to shift gears and move to a different partner for the Factor XI. Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Chris, do you want to discuss China?","Christopher S. Boerner - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Sure, I'd be happy to. So thanks for the question. We're obviously very happy with the approval of Opdivo in second line lung cancer in China earlier this quarter. Lung cancer, as you may know, is a significant public health issue in China and this is an exciting opportunity. Unfortunately, many of the patients who are diagnosed with lung cancer in China are diagnosed very late in the disease and so there's a real need for drugs like Opdivo that improve overall survival in that setting.","We're obviously not going to comment on price at this point. We are in the process of submitting pricing materials to health authorities. We can't comment on the specifics. However, as is true in other markets, we would think about price here to reflect the value of Opdivo in this market and recognize the high unmet need in China.","Price is one of the complexities of this market. It's obviously a potentially large opportunity. However, I think it is important to recognize some of the realities of the China health care system. This is a very large and highly fragmented market in China where basic availability to care is still somewhat of an issue. While the access environment has improved over time, this continues to be an evolving landscape.","Opdivo will launch into a cash pay market before we secure, ultimately, provincial and national reimbursement. And as you point out, there's going to be competition in this space, both from multinationals as well as from local competitors. All of that notwithstanding, we're excited about the potential opportunity for Opdivo in this space and very much look forward to working with Chinese health authorities to make the product available later this year.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Chris. Vamil, just on the Factor XIa agreement, obviously we believe that has the potential to be a first-in-class and a best-in-class program. It's early days. It's going into Phase 2, and we're quite excited about partnership with Johnson. If you think about it, the two companies together today have great experience in thrombosis. And obviously, for any program, this was a partnership we discussed with many companies. We're just very happy that we were able to sign an agreement with Johnson because of the combined experience of the two companies in cardiovascular. So we look forward to advancing this. This is a great opportunity we have to expand our presence in cardiovascular disease over a longer period of time. And I think it's an important program for us.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks. Jake, I think we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Now we'll move to John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. First couple for Tom just on the NKTR-214 program, clearly, nine indications. When you think through the indications that you go into first, Tom, in terms of probability of success, how are you thinking about the tumor types? And have they changed or evolved over time? On the Factor XIa, can you give some commentary about how you plan on differentiating the product relative to current standard of care within the class?","And then last question, just on the commercial side of the U.S. Appreciate the color you gave on the U.S. market breakdown by tumor type. But can you discuss the academic centers and how they're using Opdivo\/Yervoy, in particular, in the academic centers and how that might be over time influencing community centers? Thanks.","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, John, thank you. Just with NKTR, I think we'd just emphasize what I said earlier about NKTR. I think we've decided to proceed in melanoma, renal and bladder. And we're going to follow the data where it emerges in these other areas as well. So I think it's difficult to know until we see where the data emerges which of the other tumor types are going to be most likely to benefit in that setting. But we keep a very open mind to that.","Second question regarding Factor XIa, our initial work with Factor XIa will be in the area of secondary stroke prevention. And we look forward to working with our partners at Janssen to be able to develop this compound. As you know, the field of anti-coagulation is quite broad. There are many areas where there's unmet medical need. And we will continue to look for that. There are reasons to believe that Factor XIa may actually have a superior profile to the Factor X inhibitors. We don't know this yet. But we have to see how the data emerges with time. And secondary stroke prevention will be our first place of looking at that.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Johanna, on academic centers.","Johanna Mercier - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yeah. So to your question, John, I think it's important to look at is actually metastatic melanoma in our combination with O plus Yervoy, as well as in first line renal in the recent launch that we've just had. I think what's been interesting to see is metastatic melanoma, you're seeing definitely a little bit more from a academic standpoint than community. We were assuming the same thing in first line renal. We've been pleasantly surprised.","And I think that supports the strong uptake that you've heard about in how we're already the number one treatment for first line renal. And that is that we've seen a real mix between both academia and community. So a lot of these folks are trying it. And I think for the first time, as mentioned by Giovanni earlier, about 50% are new users of the combination of Opdivo and low dose Yervoy.","I think that's really interesting because the overlap of the treaters, the targets, the target treaters, is actually 80% when you think about renal to lung. And as you think about lung and potential future indication of Opdivo\/low dose Yervoy, I think that's an interesting piece in just making sure that we build that experience across academia as well as community.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Johanna. Great. Jake, can we go to our last question, please?","Operator","Yes. And our final question will come from Matt Phipps with William Blair.","Matthew Phipps - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Two kind of earlier clinical questions for Tom. Obviously, we've seen a little bit of a return to growth of Yervoy from the new indications, but you do have two kind of slightly different CTLA-4 compounds in earlier stages, fairly large trials. When do you think we see some results from that? And are those large enough where, once you have a confidence signal, you can really advance that straightforward, almost supplanting Yervoy with combinations of Opdivo? Or is there room for multiple of those compounds to move forward?","And then also, an interesting orphan drug designation for your fixed-dose combination of the LAG-3 antibody with lirilumab with nivolumab in gastric cancer. Can you comment at all on the strategy for a fixed-dose combination there?","Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., M.D. - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Matt, thank you. So a couple questions. So as you may have picked up from prior calls, I'm very enthusiastic about CTLA-4 as a target. I think it's a very important target in cancer, and I think we have the opportunity with both the CytomX Probody compound of CTLA-4 and the non-fucosylated CTLA-4 that we have to really expand upon the therapeutic index of our anti-CTLA-4 program. So I share your enthusiasm for them. Both of these drugs are in early phase trials. They're still in Phase 1 trials at this point. So we really don't know what the promise of these drugs will be until we sort of see what the profile is coming out of Phase 1. But I would imagine that you can look at this as potentially expanding the role of what CTLA-4 can do in cancer.","The second question is about LAG-3. We think LAG-3 is a potentially very interesting compound. It addresses the concept of T-cell exhaustion, and we presented some data last year in melanoma with Opdivo and LAG-3 in patients with previously-treated melanoma. We look forward to seeing that data emerge. But we also think that gastric cancer might be a place where LAG-3 could have a role. And the ability to have a fixed-dose combination of Opdivo plus our LAG-3 lirilumab compound offers a very interesting therapeutic approach in that setting, and we look forward to getting that Phase 2 trial up and running.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Matt, and thanks everyone. Again, this was a quarter that pointed to very, very strong execution in the first half of the year. There is good momentum in the business going into the second half. We have a number of important catalysts that we're looking forward with, and I am feeling pretty good about where the company is today. Thanks everyone for participating in the call.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"3905":["Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs. Please go ahead, sir.","","John E. Elicker","Thank you, Alicia, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining the call this morning to discuss our Q4 results and 2013 guidance. With me this morning are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Both Lamberto and Charlie will have prepared remarks. And then joining us for Q&A are Elliott Sigal, our Chief Scientific Officer; Beatrice Cazala, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Giovanni Caforio, President of U.S. Pharmaceuticals. Again Lamberto and Charlie will have prepared remarks and then Elliot, Beatrice, and Giovanni will be here for Q&A.","Before we get started, I will take care of the legal requirements. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date.","We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.","Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. Well, we had a strong close to a very important year. In just the last quarter, we grew our in line and new brands by 16% with especially strong performance by ORENCIA, YERVOY, SPRYCEL, ONGLYZA, KOMBIGLYZE, and BARACLUDE. ","We made some important clinical advances; most notably with respect to our immuno-oncology and Hepatitis C abscess. And we had several key regulatory successes with the European approval of FORXIGA, and especially important for the company, multiple approval of ELIQUIS, including in the U.S. In fact, these regulatory accomplishments underscored the importance of 2012 as a year of significant transition for Bristol-Myers Squibb, one that brought our portfolio of the future into sharper perspective, and laid the ground work for this year\u2019s focus on our commercial opportunities.","ELIQUIS was the big story of the quarter by gaining back-to-back approvals in Europe, Canada, Japan, the U.S. and South Korea. This differentiated asset has set us up for a strong start to the New Year. Next week along with our partner Pfizer, we will be launching ELIQUIS in the U.S. Our teams have been working together, planning for this day, preparing for our launch. We're ready to move forward and while we have already launched in few markets such as the UK, Germany, and Denmark, we are making similar preparations in the other markets too.","This is an important development for patients and physicians. For the past 60 years Warfarin has been the gold standard for this patient population, but now that has changed. ELIQUIS is the only anticoagulant that demonstrated superior risk reduction versus Warfarin in the three critical outcomes of stroke prevention, major bleeding, and all-cause death in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.","With respect to diabetes, FORXIGA\u2019s European approval during the fourth quarter has significantly strengthened  our franchise and kept an important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb in this space. Central to our expansion in diabetes was our acquisition of Amylin, announced last June, and the announcement of our five-year old partnership with AstraZeneca. Both of these developments have reinforced our leadership with respect to type 2 diabetes and have better positioned us to address the significant unmet medical need that still exists for these patients.","Regarding Amylin, our integration continues to go well. Our cross-trained sales force is already hard at work in the U.S. market, and by the beginning of the second quarter, we should largely assume full commercialization of the two Amylin assets outside the U.S.","As I said before, we also made significant pipeline progress last year including during last quarter. With respect to immuno-oncology PD-1 nivolumab\u00a0 is already in multiple Phase III trials for lung, renal, and melanoma. We presented important data at ASCO last year and we are looking forward to their read out of the very broad Phase III programs we had initiated. Similarly, elotuzumab for multiple myeloma is also in Phase III trials. We presented some interesting data at ASH in December. We suggested that elotuzumab may be promising for patients with relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma.","With respect to hepatitis C, we continue to advance our portfolio. Japan in particular provides significant opportunity with its 1.5 million patients. We expect to file an all oral regimen in Japan by the end of this year and expect to be in the market next year in 2014. And having presented interesting Phase II data at the AASLD conference in November, we are also expecting to move our triple regimen into Phase III trial in 2014.","So taken together, 2012 was a very important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb, one that embodied our transition to the portfolio of the future, one that reflected the continued leadership of our Company in a range of therapeutic areas, one that sets the stage for sustained, long-term growth.","Going forward, I\u2019m optimistic. 2013 will be a year of clinical advances, launches, commercial execution, investments, all of which will allow us to deliver our full long-term potential.","And with that let me now turn it over to Charlie. Charlie?","Charles A. Bancroft","Thank you, Lamberto. Overall, we had a good fourth-quarter while building a solid foundation for sustained long-term growth. In addition to the important regulatory approvals for ELIQUIS and FORXIGA that Lamberto mentioned, we also saw strong sales growth among our key products as we continue to move toward our portfolio of the future and a more diversified global footprint.","During the fourth quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.99. This includes the dilution due to the acquisition of Amylin in August.","Net sales for the fourth-quarter were $4.2 billion, down 23% compared to the fourth-quarter last year, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity of PLAVIX and AVAPRO\/AVALIDE. Price was favorable by 1%, and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on sales in the quarter. Excluding PLAVIX and AVAPRO, , global sales grew 13% lead by gains in key brands that are important to our future, YERVOY, ONGLYZA, ORENCIA, and SPRYCEL.","I will review some of the product highlights. YERVOY had a very strong quarter; global sales were $211 million, up 18% sequentially from the third quarter. In less than two full years on the market, YERVOY\u2019sglobal sales topped $700 million for 2012, making YERVOY one of the best oncology launches of the last decade.","In the U.S. we are focused on the efficacy message of YERVOY, shifting the focus of treatment in metastatic melanoma to the potential for long-term survival, and expanding the prescribing base beyond large institutions. Both of these initiatives seem to be gaining traction. U.S. sales rose $141 million in the quarter, up nearly 15% from the third quarter. We are also in the process of fully launching YERVOY in Europe and continue to work with health authorities in other regions to ensure patients have access. We believe there is still ample opportunity for YERVOY to grow.","In diabetes, worldwide sales for the ONGLYZA franchise rose 29% to $198 million during the quarter. The DPP-4 class is becoming more crowded, but we expect ONGLYZA to be competitive in this class, and we expect the class to continue to grow.","In the U.S., we now have the combined strength of the Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amylin, and AstraZeneca diabetes sales forces promoting both ONGLYZA and the exenatide franchises and the launch of KOMBIGLYZE\u00a0 XR in Europe during the quarter strengthens our competitive position there as well.","We reported $152 million in revenues for BYDUREON and BYETTA. This includes just $5 million in royalties from international markets. We will begin reporting direct sales for exenatide outside the U.S. after completing the transition of commercial responsibilities from Lilly. We expect that to occur by April 1.","The ORENCIA franchise was up 26% in the quarter to $325 million. Full year sales were nearly $1.2 billion. ORENCIA SubQ now accounts for 25% of full year ORENCIA sales in the U.S. and we recently launched SubQ in Europe.","SPRYCEL sales grew 24% to $281 million in the fourth quarter compared to last year and surpassed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. We continue to see strong growth for SPRYCEL in the U.S. and international markets, with sustained first line adoption in CML and our continued market leadership in second line CML treatment.","ABILIFY sales were up 11% to $819 million; ABILIFY sales during the quarter benefitted from a reduction in the estimated amount of certain managed Medicaid rebates attributed to prior periods. As you think about ABILIFY for 2013, I want to remind you that our share of ABILIFY revenues in the U.S. will be lower in 2013 as we shift from a flat 51.5% to the new tiered revenue structure, which we approximate to be 35% in 2013. Finally, HIV franchise sales were down to 6%. While global sales were $777 million for the fourth quarter and $3 billion for the year, we continue to see increased competition in many markets.","Now, let me highlight a few items from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. As John mentioned, reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website. Gross margins were 76.4% during the quarter, up 120 basis points compared to the same period last year. This improvement is mostly attributable to favorable foreign exchange and a one-time benefit from the renegotiation of a supply agreement.","Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were $1.1 billion, down 5% from the same quarter last year. This was driven by no PLAVIX or AVAPRO spend in the quarter and certain one-time expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2011. This was somewhat offset by increased investment due to the Amylin acquisition and the launches of new products, including ELIQUIS and FORXIGA.","Our non-GAAP tax rate of 15% during the quarter was driven by two factors; the evolution of our earnings mix and our tax planning initiatives. Regarding mix, PLAVIX has a relatively higher tax rate as compared to the rest of our portfolio. Secondly, in Q4, we restructured some legal entities, which improved our earnings mix. We saw the impact of these changes in Q4 and we expect this impact to be sustained going forward. The Q4 rate does not include the R&D tax credit on risk in January.","Before I turn to our 2013 guidance, I will briefly comment on our capital allocation strategy. We have the balanced approach to capital allocation with business development remaining a top priority. We are also committed to the dividend. In December, we increased the company\u2019s dividend by 3%, demonstrating our confidence in our near and long-term business and our focus on creating value for shareholders. This is the fourth consecutive year that we have increased our dividend.","Turning to guidance; you will see that we have set our 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $1.78 to $1.88. I will now provide some color on select line items; we expect our gross margin as a percent of sales to be between 72% to 73%, a decrease of approximately 300 basis points compared to last year. This is driven by expected growth for ELIQUIS and diabetes portfolio where we booked our respective partner share and cost of goods sold, causing downward pressure on gross margin.","We project MS&A to be flat and AMP to increase in the high single-digit as we will continue to invest in our growth brands and our portfolio of the future. Remember that, in 2012, we had virtually no spending related to PLAVIX and AVAPRO as we had pulled back on commercial investments in those products in 2011.","Moving into 2013, we are committed to making the right commercial investments in the important new product launches such as ELIQUIS and FORXIGA and we have a full year of investment behind the exenatide franchise. We also need to ensure continued growth of our key brands and we will appropriately invest to optimize our portfolio. While we continue to drive efficiencies throughout our P&L as part of our everyday business, we believe there is a balance between short-term results and building a solid foundation for sustained long-term growth.","Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. There are three main reasons for the decrease in the 2013 tax rate. First, 2013 reflects the impact of the R&D tax credit for both 2012 and 2013. This has an impact of about 2.5 percentage points compared with 2012. Second, as I said previously, we have seen an evolution in our earnings mix with PLAVIX having relatively higher tax rate. Lastly, in 2012, we did a structuring of some legal entities, which has a positive impact on earnings mix. We saw the impact of this in Q4, and we expect the impact to be sustained going forward.","In summary and as Lamberto mentioned, 2012 was an important year for the company as we begin to transition to a more diversified portfolio and the potential for longer term growth. and we believe our guidance for 2013 reflects the appropriate investments to help position the company for that longer term growth.","I would now like to turn it over to your questions.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thanks, Charlie. And Alicia, if you could go to questions and if I can just remind everybody that try to keep them focused as we will try to get through as many questions as possible. Alicia?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Greg Gilbert from Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks, I have two, I\u2019ll ask them upfront. Charlie, can you talk a little bit more about the massive tax changes is massive relative to what we \u2013 I think the market we are expecting going forward. And make sure we're all on the right place in terms of the ongoing sustainable rates, and perhaps a commercial question on ELIQUIS, J&J talked about strong Tier 2 access (inaudible) also, and even though you have the best profile, is it you or Pfizer\u2019s plan to pay up to ensure that acts as a similar to the competition, or do you have another strategy in that regard? Thanks.","Charles Bancroft","Thanks, Greg, it's Charlie. As I mentioned in my comments, there were three main reasons for the drop in our overall tax rate, let me go through each one and take you through, which ones are sustainable as we think about our rate going forward.","So with regard to the R&D tax credit which we have a double dip in 2013 as we have in 2012 benefit as well, obviously the piece that relates to 2012 is not sustainable going forward. As we talked about PLAVIX, PLAVIX is now out of our business, so that benefit we also see going forward. But remember, earnings mix will always play a role as we think about our tax rate. And then lastly, the restructuring we did, that had a positive impact on our earnings mix, we expect that this impact will be sustainable going forward.","Lamberto Andreotti","As to your question on ELIQUIS, while Giovanni will address specific question, so let me repeat a couple of things about ELIQUIS, and add a few things.","First of all, as I said before, the approval of ELIQUIS last year was a significant accomplishment for us. We had the approvals in all those geographies, U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada, South Korea, all in just over one month\u2019s time. This is an achievement there.","And as I said before, we continue to believe that based on the data from our clinical trials, ELIQUIS has a real differentiated profile, and we were very encouraged to see the approvals in different parts of the world, reflects the risk rate action versus Warfarin in all three important outcomes of strong reduction, nasal bleeding and all because of that. So good clinical data and labels reflecting that clinical data.","This unique and differentiated profile of ELIQUIS will resonate with (inaudible) and will position us well against Warfarin and against all other anticoagulant including the one you mentioned.","We are working to secure pricing in access, and as I said the launch will happen in \u2013 is happening in these very weeks, in these very days. So one last point, the quality of the product as I said, there is strength for the label as I said, but there is also the fact that we both Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer have a strong experience, and we are leader in the cardiovascular field. All these made me very confident that we\u2019d be very successful. Giovanni, why don\u2019t you continue from here.","Giovanni Caforio","","Yes, good morning, this is Giovanni. Just following up on what Lamberto said, we are getting ready for launch in early February. But in fact, access is our number one priority. So our access teams are actually already working there in the field. We\u2019ve scheduled many meetings with all of the key brands both commercial and Medicare and some of those meetings have taken place already. To add what Lamberto said, we believe that the strong profile and the quality of the label will be extremely important to access and we don\u2019t expect significant barriers.","We also have put in place specifically for commercial patients a very good set of programs in place to manage the out-of-pocket cost for patients. And that will be important in the commercial space at the beginning as we improve our access situation and then it will of course, continue to be important going forward. But we are very focused on this and the profile and the label would be very important.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thanks, Greg. Do you have the next question at least here.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thank you. And Jonathan or Elliot on the call, but I wanted to ask sort of a big picture question on PD-1, obviously this is going to be an important year for their disclosure of PD-1 read out, so I am wondering if you could just update us on where you are with your Phase III program, what other additional trials do you have planned, how you see the competitive dynamics playing out, you are not alone in this field, there are other companies also pursing PD-1 and PD-L1. And specifically what can we expect to see at ASCO this year? Thanks.","Elliott Sigal","Thank you, Jami. This is Elliott, yes, we continue to advance our leadership position in immuno-oncology in PD-1 as you state clearly as an important part of our platform. We were quite encouraged last year by the day that we presented at the Clinical Oncology Meeting and appeared at The New England Journal of Medicine showing that monotherapy with this patient is clinically active and non-small cell lung cancer metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma with durable responses in most patients and an acceptable and manageable safety profile. We've got \u2013 had experienced now in multiple dose levels, and we believe the activity is encouraging because it is significant in heavily pretreated patients. We show some updated results at the end of the year.","So we basically have moved on this data from a Phase 1, Phase II compound into five significant Phase III studies that are all ongoing now. There are two lung studies in second-line squamous and second-line non-squamous our strategy to stratify based on that histology is based on data that we've seen. We are also doing extensive analysis looking for biomarkers, which could be a distinguishing aspect of the program. We have a renal cell carcinoma study in Phase III, and we now have two melanoma studies in Phase III, one in advanced patients post at the ipilimumab and one in untreated patients versus chemotherapy.","Also we have a Phase I combination of study with YERVOY and I think one of the exciting aspects of our program is getting early experience with combinations particularly with different mechanisms to boost the immune system. That will be I think very interesting data that we\u2019ll be able to present hopefully at ASCO this year. At ASCO, we\u2019ll be giving updates of the Phase 1, Phase II in terms of survival data, in terms of biomarkers and all these five Phase III studies will be ongoing.","And we clearly acknowledge that there is competition in this field. We are gratified to be in the position we are in. We are not going to be complacent, and I think it's important to move fast in this area with high-quality molecules that are well characterized with biomarker studies and I would say with combinations that we are in a very good position to administer and to explore.","We do have a PDL-1 mechanism and that's respectable competition from Genentech in Phase I in their program I believe. Our view is, there may be a theoretical advantage to targeting anti-PD-1 because you can cover both the PDL-1 and the PDL-2 ligands. We will have to see whether that that matters. Essentially we had enough information and extensive information on PD-1 to move as we have.","John E. Elicker","","Great. Thanks, Elliott, and thanks, Jamie. Can we go to the next question Alicia please?","Operator","","Yes sir. We will go next to Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","","Hi guys. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Maybe this question is for Charlie on the taxes to push a little bit. So if we just add back the 1.25%, which will be half of the 2013 total R&D tax credit, would it be roughly that 17% to 18% that you advised us to use is sustainable or will be something or might have be something slightly more than that. And then I was wondering if you could maybe give us general thoughts on how we should be thinking about share repurchases in 2013? Thank you.","Charles Bancroft","","Okay, thanks, Mark. This is Charlie. Regarding the rate, I think your basic math that you use there is reasonable. To think about it going forward always in the business our size and diversified the global footprint, earnings mix will always play a role in the rate but overall I think that your math certainly makes sense to me. And regarding to the share repurchase program, as you know, we had two authorizations totaling $6 billion. Year-to-date were through $4.2 billion, so we have $1.8 billion remaining on that authorization. As you know, we have to build a \u2013 to suspend or utilize our share repurchase program on the discretionary basis.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thanks, Charlie, thanks, Mark. Can go to the next question, Alicia, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Thank you. If I can just go back to tax rates again, presumably all drug companies try to optimize their legal entities to take their tax rate as low as they can, yet your rate is markedly lower than any other companies that I cover at least. And so I\u2019m wondering, why your tax rate might be unique in that regard, and can you explain a little more on the legal entity restructuring and how much Amylin plays into that? If I\u2019m not mistaken, Amylin had a bunch of NOLs and I\u2018m wondering if that helps to take the rate lower.","And then on ELIQUIS, can you just give us your thoughts about the potential competitor Edoxaban in your long reign planning assumptions for ELIQUIS, or you assuming that Edoxaban will be a viable competitor?","Lamberto Andreotti","Yeah. Let me first talk about the tax rate. In regard to the NOLs for Amylin, we did mention when we purchased Amylin by the NOLs, almost fully when we then basically sold the portion of the business to AstraZeneca, so that worked as a capital gain for us offset by the NOL. So there is no benefit of the Amylin NOLs going forward.","As far as our tax rate vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, I really don\u2019t have the visibility into their earnings mix, their own tax planning strategies, and that\u2019s something that I don\u2019t feel perfect that we talk about in real detail.","Elliott Sigal","Yes, Tim, this is Elliott, and perhaps Giovanni would collaborate some of our joint feeling about this. First of all we\u2019re very happy to be in the position we are globally with the label that we have, and it\u2019s impossible for us to know what profile any compound will have, short of knowing the Phase III data, so (inaudible) is considered a very important compound for us to watch it will clearly depend on their data as to what the opportunities are for that compound. We have been under the belief scientifically, that because the half-life of this drug is similar to both (inaudible) and ELIQUIS, that adhering to what we think we have shown pretty well of a rather stable blood level, and low peak to trough ratio by going VIV with be part of the reason that you\u2019re seeing the differentiated profile with ELIQUIS and very significant reduction risk in stroke.","A very significant decrease of bleeding, which is very important to the practicing community, and for the superiority we\u2019ve seen in All-Cause Death. So I think we need to wait and see and of course, we are prepared for the competition for that once-a-day dose, which I think is going to, now have to meet the bar of superiority in all those three outcomes.","That\u2019s it from my perspective from a commercial prospective, we will have to see data on label, but we are very focused on executing our launch of the data, we have versus warfarin in terms of superiority with throat bleeding and mortality is very, very compelling, and we are focused on our launch and the significant opportunities we have.","","Tim Anderson \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","And you may also mention some scenarios about the YERVOY data, which is an interesting element of differentiation of ELIQUIS, right?","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes. Our company did something that was not all that conventional at the time, and I\u2019m very pleased with how it turned out, and that is to look at the unmet medical need of the patients that are not judged to be not suitable for warfarin, which is a size of the AF population, perhaps 40% to 50%, and these patients are often given aspirin. So the (inaudible) study that went head-to-head to aspirin does two things for us, and I don\u2019t think a study like this could now ever be done again, and that is to show the power of efficacy of the agents in its full form. But most importantly, to have a competitor leading, and there is no statistical difference in major bleeding rates between ELIQUIS and an aspirin, and I think that was part of our development plan, it was part of our evaluation with payers and their opinion while we were designing the Phase III, and I think it\u2019s a strong part of our label and competitive position.","John Elicker","Thanks, Tim. And Alicia, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Tony Butler from Barclays.","Alison Yang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning. this is Alison Yang, asking the question on behalf of Tony. Heading back to the oncology franchise, a couple of questions for YERVOY, can you just ask your current share in the market, and personally secondly relative to sort of some of the small molecules, and also it looks like there may be some additional indications in Phase III wrapping up prostate cancer, chemorefractory prostate cancer. Can you kind of discuss your vision for the other indications from YERVOY? Second question on oncology and elotuzumab, can you discuss sort of the strategy envisioned for multi-myeloma, and also can we expect to see any of the ELIQUIS to refractory data this year? Thank you so much. Giovanni, why don\u2019t you start?","Giovanni Caforio","Yeah, this is Giovanni. With respect to our performance with YERVOY and our share, we were very pleased with our performance in Q4 in the U.S. with significant growth versus Q3, and previous year. And as Charlie mentioned before, our share in first-line is we estimate at this point to be above 30% when you look at the total market in the 10% range in BRAF-mutated patients, and clearly significantly higher in the BRAF wild-type population. That the utilization in first-line continues to grow, and it\u2019s really one of the drivers of growth that you see in the fourth quarter versus previous periods.","B\u00e9atrice Cazala","B\u00e9atrice speaking, we also very pleased with the growth in Europe, this product is now commercially heading for the (inaudible). The adoption has been very good. Our sales trajectory in countries like Germany and UK have been better than all of the oncology launch, I\u2019ll present you, so very satisfactory growth plan.","Obviously the second time to get National Formulary across Europe, we have been very pleased with the progress we have made, and during recent months we have added to all key market, country like Spain. We also got approval from NICE in the UK, and now we have ongoing discussion with the remaining markets, which will conclude in the coming months.","So we\u2019re looking forward on the products we have made and continue building that products and we are aligning with obviously the global strategy working hard on the long-term survival data, and that data is going to be cheap for us to continue growing our market share across the world for that product.","Charles Bancroft","And before I really speak about the new indications, let me add something in. I mean obviously YERVOY is supported by great days, okay, but what is very important to me I\u2019m very proud of the fact that, our analysis shows that YERVOY has been the best oncology launch in the U.S. and Europe over the past 10 years, which show a combination of good product, well developed and good commercial execution.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, so to the question of the lifecycle management, which we\u2019re working on very hard for YERVOY, we do have Phase III trials and multiple indications including adjuvant melanoma, two trials in prostate cancer and you mentioned, yes, one of them should have data internally at BMS in the first half of the year and hopefully we will find a way to present that this year at a conference, and the one that will be coming due first is the Phase III trial in castrate resistant post-docetaxel prostate cancer and these are patients who have progressed on that taxane.","It was initiated in 2009, we project to have the number of events to analyze and present this year. The other trial will take longer. We have two trials also in lung cancer, one in non-small cell lung cancer, one in small cell lung cancer. We are doing combination therapy with other chemotherapy agents and we are actively exploring studies in other tumor types with the National Cancer Institute.","With regard to your question on elotuzumab, this too is a form of immunotherapy using a different non-T-cell based mechanism and we've been very excited about the updates we get from the Phase II study. One such update was presented last December at the ASH meeting and these are patients that have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and are being treated with the combination of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with and without the additional elotuzumab. That eloquent study we won't have data for this year, it\u2019s a Phase III study now, and we are also looking at earlier lines of therapy and that will take a little longer.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thanks, Alicia. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Catherine Arnold from Credit Suisse.","Catherine Arnold \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hello, good morning.","Lamberto Andreotti","We lost you Catherine there for a minute.","Catherine Arnold \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. I wanted to ask you about the Amylin integration and how we should be interpreting the sales trajectory of that franchise. For instance 2014 you'll be launching the dual chamber pen, and I'm wondering as we look at your results for U.S. this year, should we be thinking about the sales trajectory having another very important inflection point such that the sales curve is really probably not completely visible and projectable and so we see the trend because of the convenience. And then also with this transitions happening in Europe, I think you guys takes full control in the second quarter, but I'm wondering how we should be thinking about interpreting the ex-U.S. sales once you start booking them additionally. So Alan could you elaborate that would be great?","Unidentified Corporate Participant","Okay, Catherine, good morning. Let me start here with a couple of comments about our diabetes franchise and let me reviewing a little bit why we bought Amylin and why we expanded our AstraZeneca partnership. And then Giovanni and B\u00e9atrice will give specific comments on the Amylin products and what we are planning to do with that.","In the morning I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, in fact, I feel good about also our diabetes franchise. We have now \u2013 we have strong diversified comprehensive franchise with \u2013 since we are the only company with three novel classes of medications. On ONGLYZA component, we have FORXIGA that has moved into Europe, and I was very pleased to see that Europeans recognized the need of additional agents when they approved FORXIGA, and I was pleased to see that they included this additional agent product like FORXIGA with an insulin-dependent mechanism. And then we bought Amylin, which gives us the third leg as GLP-1 leg in our franchise. So, we have a good portfolio, diversified portfolio and with the portfolio and not only focusing on glycemic control within diabetes but we are also looking at CT protection. So I\u2019m sure that we are all following the fact that we have [CD] outcome programs in place for (inaudible) product.","So the Amylin acquisition made a lot of sense to us to make this program more complete and we start seeing first indicators of how we are doing with the product in the market. Long plan is to what Giovanni is going to elaborate on as far as the Amylin products are concerned.","Giovanni Caforio","","Yes, Catherine. This is Giovanni. So from a U.S. perspective, as we mentioned before in Q4, we have virtually completed the integration of the teams in the U.S. with the Amylin AstraZeneca. We now have full integrated sales, marketing and medical teams that are promoting the entire portfolio. When we started working on the integration we clearly articulated three objectives for 2013 for the GLP-1 franchise. The first one was to increase and improve access. The second one was to have a competitive share of voice and the third one important in order to enable growth was to broaden the prescriber base.","And we made good progress in these areas, I will give you an example about access when beginning January 1 at Aetna, we now with BYDUREON\u00a0 have a preferred position in both the commercial and Medicare spaces which we think is very, very important.","As we think about GLP-1s, there clearly is opportunity for significant growth in the market given the availability of a weekly product, the efficacy profile, the reduced nausea of BYDUREON\u00a0, the product can and will be adopted more broadly in earlier lines of therapy, and we are very focused on that. And obviously the availability of the pen will be later important to continue to fuel the growth of BYDUREON\u00a0. But overall, we have really good organization in place, we are very focused on executing against the three objectives and optimistic about the performance of that franchise going forward.","B\u00e9atrice Cazala","So you were asking also the transfer in international market, Catherine, , so it\u2019s clear that it may take some time in terms of the transfer of marketing authorization and also non-commercial responsibilities, and that is likely to go on for few quarters. However, with our partner AstraZeneca, we are expecting a full control of the commercial operation at the end of the quarter, and we should book sales starting Q2 of 2013. You heard Giovanni mentioning the potential, I think we all agree behind the growth potential of that product. Actually, our teams across the world are very impatient outside of the U.S., to get control of the product, with the mindset of launching those products, BYETTA and BYDUREON\u00a0. If we need to do that, it is clear that transition period was optimizing the sales of the product. So, the teams are currently being fully trained, and we will be fully operational as of Q2 to take over and grow that franchise in the international market.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thanks Catherine. Alicia can we go to the next question please.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go to David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Thanks very much. I guess I have two questions, one for Charlie and one for Elliott. Charlie, I was hoping that you could just talk about any 2015 inflections in the tax rate, when ABILIFY and SUSTIVA go generic?. So, I don't know if they are in 2013 being taxed above that corporate average of 16% or below that corporate average of 16% to understand if there is an inflection to anticipate for 2015. And then Elliot, could you just discuss the transition of the PD-L1 development strategy away from cancer and to virology, and then how you expect to develop that product in virology? Thanks very much.","Unidentified Company Representative","Charlie it seems that your good work during 2013 on taxes make if you work a lot of this morning on answering questions.","Charles Bancroft","","Thanks David. Without commenting specifically on ABILIFY and SUSTIVA, I do want to point out the differences of those products and the rest of our portfolio actually vis-\u00e0-vis PLAVIX, which did have the ability to decrease our rate, given it was higher relative to the rest of our portfolio. PLAVIX we had unique structure with Sanofi, where it was a JV, and we had the minority interest component. So I don\u2019t see that there is going to be a major difference in ABILIFY and SUSTIVA to the rest of our portfolio excluding the PLAVIX component.","David R. Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Thanks.","Elliott Sigal","David, this is Elliot. What I can say at this time is that, as I mentioned before we had a lot of good reason to move forward in oncology with our anti-PD-1. We have a very valuable asset with our anti-PD-L1. There is a scientific basis for hypothesizing that the PD-1, PD-L1 mechanisms are relevant not only to oncology but to virology, help clear viruses for example, and they perhaps do affect cures in viruses that are sustained chronically.","Now we have studied our PD-1 compound on a small number of patients with HCV. At this time, our plans are to develop PD-1 in oncology, and we\u2019re conducting early works on the utility of PD-L1 in a variety of virologic infections and hopefully we\u2019ll have more to say as time progresses.","John E. Elicker","Thank Dave. Can we go to the next question please Alicia.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Seamus Fernandez from Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez \u2013 Leerink Swann","Hello, thanks very much. So a couple of quick questions; one for Lamberto; Lamberto historically when we kind of talked about the pace and direction of earnings, you had established 2013 as a trough year, are you comfortable reiterating that now with the expectation that 2015 would actually be a higher earning year? And then separately for Charlie; Charlie can you just walk us through a little bit on the gross margin mix going forward given the high volume of partnerships and then the loss of high margin ABILIFY? How should we be thinking about margins post 2015? Thanks a lot.","Lamberto Andreotti","I don\u2019t think we are going to give guidance today about years beyond 2014 and 2015 which you shouldn\u2019t take \u2013you should just take this as we\u2019re giving guidance for 2013. But at the same time, you should have heard and I let me repeat it my comment before that we are seriously investing behind many growth drivers we have in our portfolio and pipeline, and therefore our focus on the entire company is long-term growth while delivering short-term results.","Again, we\u2019re giving that guidance today for 2013 and we are committed to deliver according to that guidance.","Charles Bancroft","Thanks. Let me quickly talk about your question on gross margin. Let me start by saying PLAVIX overall, which is the major product for us in the U.S. had roughly the same gross margin as the total company had. So when we have lost now PLAVIX, which acted as a big stabilizer on our gross margin, we will see more quarter-to-quarter variability and we will also see variability related to as I mentioned in my comments, our partner products, so ELIQUIS in our diabetes franchise where we book the partner share up in cost of goods. Those products have clearly a lower gross margin than the rest of our portfolio, which generally had a slightly higher margin than for example, PLAVIX. So net-net, it will be a combination of our product mix. But I do see in the medium term, more downward pressure on our gross margin related to how we see the growth of our partner products.","John Elicker","Thanks Seamus. Can we go to the next question please, Alicia?","Operator","Let\u2019s go to Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Christopher Schott \u2013 JPMorgan","Great, thanks very much. Just had two questions here, both on diabetes. First on the GLP-1 space, Lilly recently announced a positive top line data for their GLP-1. Can you talk about how you think about the competitive dynamics with another potential once-weekly product coming to market as you are looking to build out this franchise over time?","Second on ONGLYZA, just latest timing on the outcome study and just \u2013 can you just remind us, as you are speaking about ONGLYZA, how important is that outcome study in terms of both the ultimate ramp of the product as well as your market share within the DPP-4 class? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","This is Giovanni. So let me start by giving a perspective on the potential for BYDUREON, and the growth of the GLP-1 class. So, I would say a couple of things. First of all, it\u2019s important to remember that less than 10% of patients with diabetes in the U.S. today receive a GLP-1 agent at some point during their treatment journey. And given the profile of this product, as I\u2019ve said before, now that we have a weekly agent available, very good efficacy, good tolerability profile, will reduce nausea, there is opportunity for broader penetration into the primary care setting, there is an opportunity for earlier use during the treatment continuum and as a result of that significant opportunity for growth in the class.","So we are very well positioned as an exenatide franchise, because physicians are experienced with the franchise, because we have the only available weekly agent. Today, the efficacy is non-understood, the tolerability as I said before is very good. and as a result of that, we are very well positioned. we believe we will have a pen available \u2013 the Dual-Chamber pen available well before other weekly agents are available in the market. And so, we will be able to consolidate our market position ahead of other competitors?","Elliott Sigal","\t","So, Chris, hi. This is Elliott, and I\u2019ll start and in B\u00e9atrice will complement to answer your question about the significance of that outcome trial for ONGLYZA, it\u2019s called Savor. It\u2019s the cardiovascular outcome trial. And recall that, in this staying age, we expect most diabetes agents to undergo a cardiovascular outcome trial. And it\u2019s important to do so to show that there is no cardiovascular harm. So one scenario and B\u00e9atrice will address this commercially is the significance of showing no cardiovascular harm. This is a 16,500 patient trial. It enrolls very well. We increased the enrollment and we\u2019re able to buy to predict that we\u2019ll have some read out this year, based on the number of events and the way the events are being gathered.","We also took the opportunity however to add the question of could we see a cardiovascular benefit. So this is ONGLYZA on top of standard of care not including GLP-1 or GPP-4s versus standard of care, and it\u2019s powered to show superiority. It can also test for non-inferiority on a composite cardiovascular outcomes and we have enrolled patients so that we can make statements with regard to primary prevention and secondary preventions. This one is the unique aspects of this trial.","And the best case would be to show some advantage of using the GPP-4 beyond incurring no cardiovascular harm, which is suspect in many older compounds. There is two hypotheses; one pre-clinical and one clinical, that makes one want to ask these questions, but this is an experiment.","Pre-clinically, GPP-4 does metabolize a variety of compounds other than GLP-1 and there has been a lot of research done talking about the advantages to Cytacon and other inflammatory processes relevant to the cardiovascular flag. The second of all, not only ONGLYZA, but every GPP-4 that\u2019s been submitted has done meta analysis as a precursor to make sure there is no cardiovascular harm and interestingly all of these show a benefit, but these are just net analysis of short-term trials and it\u2019s just hypothesis generally, the a definitive trial for ONGLYZA, should read out this year, and B\u00e9atrice, the two scenarios.","B\u00e9atrice Cazala","Obviously commercially until we see the final results. We are planning to hold up what is in those scenarios. So you can understand that if the outcome of the trial in neutral this will strongly confirm the ONGLYZA, if you get in 50 profiles, as you know the GPP-4 clock has continued to grow. Yes less than 80% of the patient in the U.S. and less than 12% of the EU patient are being treated by that category of agents. So that\u2019s up from Savor showing that I think neutral effect on cardiovascular would reinforce the suitability of the product for broad use as a sublime agent to treat, with improving particular ONGLYZA","So knowing in the scenario where we could have demonstrated the clinical meaningful benefit in term of the outcome, we know GPP-4 so far including our label of such a benefit. So given the high rate of that in short, in a population with Type 2 diabetes, these numbers are in a significant increase adoption formula.","In addition, as we move this, categories are very focused on the prevention. This will also appeal towards a broader segment of the physician not just on the cardiology physician, also (inaudible).","John Elicker","\t","Thanks Chris. Alicia we have less than five minutes less. I\u2019m not sure how many questions we\u2019re going to be able to get through but take the next one please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Baum from Citi.\t.","Andrew S. Baum \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","","Good morning, a couple of questions. First to Charlie please, within your revenue and earnings guidance for next year, what have you factored in for European pricing as well as potential relating for the geological in the U.S.? And then secondly, with regard to the CML, obviously the environment is looking increasingly dynamic in terms of treatment both with generically where new competition from imatinib as well as the vast dysfunctional pure trials running. I understand that you\u2019re running that PD-1 combination trial with SPRYCEL. Perhaps you could outline your timing and expectations for that? Thank you.","Lamberto Andreotti","Thanks, Andrew. In regard to European pricing, we don't see any led up some of the measures that we have seen, so we think it will be consistent with what we've seen in 2011 and 2012. In regard to dual eligibles you had a potential risk, but we don't have any impact of dual eligibles in our current guidance.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, this is Giovanni. Let me just comment on the CML market specifically in the U.S. and the current dynamics. As we mentioned before, we continue to have very strong performance with SPRYCEL. We had very good sequential growth from a demand perspective quarter-on-quarter and versus prior year. That's driven by two things, the profile of SPRYCEL is increasingly valued once-daily long-term survival data, no food restriction and a good tolerability profile. And as a result of that in our commercial execution we have, a good sharing first-line and maintain our leadership in the second line setting.","The most important dynamic is that Gleevec business continues to be eroded, it\u2019s now slightly above 70% of the market in the U.S. down again sequentially every quarter and we continue to be focused on that. We have not seen significant impact from the launch of Bosutinib, which is probably predominantly used in much later lines of therapy, and it\u2019s clearly too early to say whether we are seeing any impact from Ponatinib, but our performance continues to be strong.","We clearly have strength and our focus on access in the U.S., because we understand that over the course of the next few years, we believe that generic will have an impact on the market, but we are very focused on that. Early on, we have good programs in place and again a strong position in the marketplace.","Lamberto Andreotti","","Thanks, Andrew. Alicia, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Good morning, thank you for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. First on ELIQUIS access, would you be able to provide any update on number of lives covered and how you compare versus competitors?","And finally, do you have any updates sort of timeline of the monthly exenatide combination? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","This is Giovanni. Let me start from ELIQUIS access. As I said at the beginning, this is our number one area of focus and we are already working on it. It\u2019s clearly too early to give you any figure on lives covered on access, because we are just at the beginning of our meetings with payers. As a reminder, we will launch from a promotion perspective in early February, so we\u2019re very, very close to launch.","As I also said at the beginning, the profile is very strong, the data is very well reflected in a good label, so we don\u2019t expect barriers to accent and we expect to be able to execute our plans effectively.","As you know, it will be faster on the commercial space than Medicaid and Medicare. Our focus will be on working with Medicare plans immediately in order to ensure we have access in 2014, but we also will be discussing the potential for our cycle reviews early on, which could impact Medicare coverage in 2013 primarily in the second half.","Charles Bancroft","Yes and with regard to the representation of BYDUREON, we understand to keep competitive on this now first, once weekly administration of the GLP-1 preparation we have to continue to improve the presentation, the dual chamber, we aim to submit this year should be an improvement on the current presentation. we started the Phase III last year on the once weekly suspension. we are interested in the monthly. We are still working on the technical aspects of it, I have no significant update at this time.","John E.

Welcome to today\u2019s third quarter earnings 2013 earnings release conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, senior vice president, investor relations and public affairs. Please go ahead, Mr. Elicker.","John Elicker","Thanks, operator, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us to review our Q3 results. With me this morning with prepared remarks are Lamberto Andreotti, our chief executive officer, Charlie Bancroft, our chief financial officer. And this morning, also with prepared remarks, will be Francis Cuss, our chief scientific officer. And then joining for Q&A are our two commercial leads, Executive Vice President B\u00e9atrice Cazala, and the president of U.S. operations, Giovanni Caforio.","Before I turn it over to Lamberto, I just want to cover the Safe Harbor language. As you know, during the call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. ","These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change. ","We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website, bms.com.","Lamberto? ","Lamberto Andreotti ","Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. This is an important time for Bristol-Myers Squibb. The third quarter marked our return to growth with respect to both sales and earnings, as we made our way through the Plavix loss of exclusivity. And that, combined with our continued pipeline progress positions us well for the future.","Let me elaborate on these points. With respect to sales, not only was our growth strong, up 9%, but also it was diversified, cutting across our portfolio. We drove double-digit growth in Yervoy, Orencia, Sprycel, and Onglyza, and the contribution to the top line results from Eliquis and Bydureon started to become meaningful.","This is important. It demonstrates the breadth and quality of our diversified portfolio. Yervoy remains the cornerstone of our growth in our oncology platform. I\u2019m excited, in fact I\u2019m very excited, by the data presented at the European Cancer Congress in September, as it confirms long term survival with Yervoy in metastatic melanoma and reinforced the overall value of this product.","Last quarter, Yervoy continued to deliver growth, most notably in Europe and our international markets. Yervoy results in the U.S. were also positive, notwithstanding the impact of a significant number of new clinical trials targeting melanoma patients with other agents. In Europe, the CHMP recently recommended that Yervoy be approved as first-line therapy in advanced melanoma. ","With respect to Eliquis, I\u2019m encouraged. We are still very far from the sales levels these products can achieve, but we are seeing definite signs of progress, especially with cardiologists, a target audience for us. We continue to execute against our strategy to clearly define the differentiated and unique profile of Eliquis. ","In other countries, we will increase our peer-to-peer medical education activities, and in the U.S. you may have seen that we began our DTC advertising campaign in September for Eliquis in atrial fibrillation.","We are also working to expand our label, as we have filed an NDA for VTE prevention in the U.S., which is already an approved indication in Europe, and we plan to file our application in VTE treatment this year.","With respect to our diabetes portfolio, we continue to find our way through this very competitive space. In the third quarter, Onglyza sales grew 19% year over year, and within our exenatide franchise, Bydureon sales showed encouraging gains.","And with Dapagliflozin, we are looking forward to the FDA Advisory Committee meeting in December and the PDUFA date in January.","Now, let me make a couple of comments about our pipeline. With respect to hepatitis C, we believe that we have an interesting opportunity and we are looking forward to AASLD conference next month, when we will present new data on the Phase III trials pre-trial of our all-oral dual regimen, and we are still on track for its important submission in Japan this year.","And with respect to immuno-oncology, 2013 has been a year of exciting data for our immuno-oncology platform. Data we have presented so far this year spoke to the very real possibility of paradigm-changing treatments for a range of cancers, and next week we will present additional immuno-oncology data at the World Conference on Lung.","Now, because there is much happening related to our work in immune-oncology, I\u2019ve asked Francis to spend a few minutes this morning to walk you through our thinking with respect to this increasingly important area for us. Francis?","Francis Cuss","Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning everyone. As you well know, we\u2019ve been focused on expanding our efforts in immune-oncology as an area where we see a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with certain cancers. We believe that immuno-oncology has the potential to be transformational in the treatment of patients suffering from various types of cancer.","The durability of response and long term survival in some patients are quite unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in the past, as demonstrated by the long term survival data for Yervoy recently presented at the European Cancer Congress. Additionally, early data suggests that the immunotherapeutic approach has the potential to provide a benefit not only in tumors traditionally considered immunogenic, but also in other tumor types that have not typically been thought to be immune mediated. ","As the field continues to evolve and expand, we believe that there may be roles for monotherapy, combination therapy, and biomarker-directed therapy, and we are therefore building our development programs to prepare for all possibilities.","Certainly, the approaches are likely to vary by tumor type as well as by line of therapy. Through our experience with Yervoy and broad programs with Nivolumab, we have a unique understanding in the field which gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to find the ultimate way to utilize these innovative therapies.","As you know, we\u2019ve made a very large commitment to immuno-oncology. Currently, for Nivolumab alone, we have over 25 ongoing clinical trials across more than eight tumor types. We continue to explore Yervoy monotherapy in additional tumor types such as prostate and lung, as well as in combination with Nivolumab.","In addition, we have a broad portfolio of exploratory immunotherapeutic agents with varying immune mechanisms of action that allows us to explore multiple combinations. Today I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on the status of our major programs. Let me start with lung cancer.","As a follow up to the data we presented at ASCO in June, we will be presenting updated two-year survival data from the lung cohort of prior treated patients in the Nivolumab monotherapy study known as 003 at the World Conference on Lung Cancer at the end of October.","Next up will be data from the Phase I combination study of Nivolumab with Yervoy in non-small cell lung cancer, which we expect to have in house by the end of the year. This study will provide important information on the feasibility of combinations in this tumor type and potentially inform our plans for Phase III trials starting in the first half of 2014.","Following that, we expect to have data in the first part of 2014 from our Phase II study in third line squamous non-small cell lung cancer. If the results of the study demonstrate a favorable benefit risk profile, we plan to discuss the data with the FDA and other health authorities.","Finally, we have two ongoing Phase III trials in second line non-small cell lung cancer, one in squamous and one in non-squamous, with both studies collecting information on PD-L1 tumor expression. We expect to have data from these studies later in 2014.","In melanoma, we have a broad program ongoing with trials covering all lines of therapy, which includes monotherapy as well as combination of Nivolumab and Yervoy. In previously untreated patients, both monotherapy and combination Phase III trials are underway, and a Nivolumab monotherapy Phase III trial is ongoing in advanced patients who have progressed post-Yervoy.","In renal cell cancer, our most advanced trial is focused on focused on metastatic disease, comparing Nivolumab with everolimus. Early trials are exploring the combination of Nivolumab and Yervoy in first line renal cell cancer, and we expect the data in house by the end of this year. And also, we expect early data on the potential role of biomarkers in this tumor type.","In all these three tumor types, we remain committed establishing the benefit-risk profile of Nivolumab as quickly as possible, and are closely collaborating with health authorities. ","Now, regarding public data presentations, after the lung data at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, we expect the next set of presentations to be at ASCO in 2014, which may include data on the Phase I combination study in non-small cell lung cancer and potentially data from the third-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which is ongoing.","In addition to the programs for Nivolumab that I highlighted earlier, we\u2019re also exploring its use in additional solid tumor types, including pancreatic, gastric, small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer, as well as hematological malignancies.","So, in closing, I think you can see that we have a significant commitment to advancing the field of immuno-oncology through a broad program that is science-driven, diversified, and well resourced. We believe that this commitment, together with our expertise and experience, puts us in an excellent position in this tremendously exciting area.","So now I\u2019d like to turn it back to you, Lamberto. ","Lamberto Andreotti ","Thanks, Francis. Well, clearly we see immuno-oncology as an important and exciting opportunity for us, one in which we will continue investing heavily, dedicating even more resources, time, people, and money, not only in R&D but also commercially, as we prepare for potential launches.","We are also committing the right commercial resources to our key growth drivers, most notably Eliquis, diabetes, and hepatitis C. These products and these therapeutic areas are our future, and my management team and I are determined to set the stage for long term, sustainable growth while at the same time driving short term performance.","Now, with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie to talk through some of our key numbers. Charlie? ","Charles Bancroft ","Thank you, Lamberto. Net sales were $4.1 billion in the quarter. We also had solid sales performance across our entire portfolio, especially for Yervoy, Sprycel, Orencia, and Bydureon. Let me provide a few highlights. ","Yervoy sales increased 33% year over year to $238 million. Yervoy continued to show strong performance in Europe. We recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP for first line use of Yervoy and hope to have marketing authorization later this year. This is an important addition to our label in Europe and will allow a broader set of patients to potentially benefit earlier in their treatment. ","In the U.S., Yervoy sales softened somewhat from the second quarter. As Lamberto mentioned, we have seen an impact from a significant increase in new clinical trials targeting melanoma. Patient enrollment in metastatic melanoma trials has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, with some of that increase coming from our own clinical trials with Nivolumab.","While these clinical trials have affected the commercial opportunity at several large academic institutions, we continue to focus on growing Yervoy in the community setting, which represents approximately 60% of our U.S. sales. Recent weekly sales trends are encouraging.","We believe having the first line indication in Europe, along with the survival data presented at the European Cancer Congress, will enable us to continue to deliver strong growth. Sales of Eliquis were $41 million during the quarter. ","As Lamberto mentioned, we have several initiatives focused on helping prescribers, patients, and payers understand Eliquis\u2019 differentiated profile. Recent prescription trends are improving as we have seen consistent weekly growth during Q3. As an important leading indicator, our overall new to brand share has improved and is now nearly 20% with cardiologists.","Our diabetes portfolio had sales of $411 million in the quarter. After a period of transition in our diabetes organization, we are beginning to see more positive trends in this business. Sales for the exenatide franchise were up $193 million, up nearly 14% from Q2, mostly due to renewed new to brand growth for Bydureon and GLP-1 market expansion. Byetta sales were essentially flat versus Q2.","Sales for the Onglyza franchise grew 19% year over year to $211 million. We have stabilized our market share in the U.S., where total prescription growth is slowing. We believe the data from the SAVOR cardiovascular outcomes trial provides important clarity regarding the safety profile of Onglyza. We continue to work through the pricing and reimbursement process for Forxiga in Europe and look forward to a potential launch in the U.S. next year.","Orencia sales increased 22% to $375 million. Subcu sales have nearly doubled since Q3 2012, and now represent nearly one-third of all Orencia sales.","Sprycel sales rose 20% to $316 million. First line use of Sprycel also is growing, as we reinforced Sprycel\u2019s broad indication to treat patients in all phases of CML.","Now, let me highlight two line items from the rest of our non-GAAP P&L. Advertising and promotion spending increased 16% to $194 million. This is driven by our increased investment behind our key commercial opportunities such as Eliquis and our diabetes portfolio. We expect to continue these investments as well as ensure we are prepared for the expected hepatitis C launch in Japan and potential launches for Nivolumab.","As I mentioned during our second quarter call, the decrease in other income and expense is largely due to the change in the structure of our relationship with Sanofi, whereby we now record royalty income in net sales.","As you have seen, we are confirming our full year 2013 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges. ","Before we turn to your questions, I want to make a few comments about capital allocation. Business development continues to be our top priority, and we remain committed to the dividend. Regarding share repurchases, you will recall that overall repurchase has slowed significantly in Q2, and this trend continued in the third quarter. Moving forward, we do not anticipate future share repurchases at this time.","We are now happy to answer your questions.","John Elicker","Thanks, Charlie. Lastly, we can go to Q&A now, and I would just remind everybody that in addition to Lamberto, Charlie, and Francis, we have both Giovanni and B\u00e9atrice here to handle any questions you might have. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann ","Just a couple of quick questions. First off, on the trajectory of the Eliquis franchise, can you just give us your thoughts and expectations for should we anticipate stronger performances internationally than in the U.S.? And then why has it been so difficult? Can you just give us a little bit of a lay of the land of the competitive landscape and perhaps what competitors may have convinced physicians of early on, and how you\u2019re going to hopefully change their mindset? ","And then separately, Francis, you made an interesting comment with regard to how the Phase I trial in lung may inform a potential move into Phase III in 2014 for Nivolumab plus Yervoy in lung cancer. Can you help us better understand the thresholds as we think about it? There\u2019s been a lot of circulating concern around potential toxicity there, but obviously the prospect of improved efficacy is something important. So just wondering how Bristol would be thinking about the threshold or at least how we should think about your move into Phase III with this potential combination, should that be the decision that you make in 2014.","Lamberto Andreotti ","I will start, and then I will ask Giovanni and Beatrice to add comments on Eliquis. First of all, we expect growth for Eliquis in both the U.S. and international markets. And in some of the international markets we have just launched. In the U.S. we launched earlier. In other countries we launched earlier. So we are at a different stage of launch, but the launch continues in both the U.S. and internationally.","We were third to the market, and we found two other agents that were entrenched in the market, especially one of them. The good news is that our clinical data is very significant, very differentiated, both the ARISTOTLE and the [unintelligible] data is good. Nobody can make the same claim.","And so we are dealing with especially one agent that is basing their strength on having launched earlier, and speaking about convenience, which we don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a great claim. So we will continue to work and will continue to work, and Giovanni, why don\u2019t you start with the U.S., saying what we are doing.","Giovanni Caforio ","Just to follow up on what Lamberto said, if you think about our focus in 2013 in the U.S. market, consistent with what we discussed on the last call, we are focused in a number of areas. At the beginning, we had a very heavy focus on access, and we made rapid progress there. ","Then we, in parallel, shifted our focus on our presence in the hospital, and the process of entering the hospitals from a formulistic perspective and stocking is a process that requires time. We discussed that at the last call. We\u2019ve made significant progress in the third quarter in that area. ","At this point, we are stocked and present in over 80% of our focus hospitals. Our use in the hospitals has been increasing, and we\u2019re quite satisfied, at this point, that we are at the same level of hospital presence, where [unintelligible], for example, was at the same time during their launch. ","As we discussed earlier, we have a very heavy focus on medical education and peer-to-peer programs because we really have the broadest and the deepest data set in atrial fibrillation of all agents, and understanding that profile requires time and the right setting for physicians. So we have actually increased very significantly our investment in that area. We are executing a very large number of programs, and we continue to see that when physicians have the time to understand the data, they really understand the differentiated profile of Eliquis.","We also started DTC and the TV ads, and that will have an impact over time. As was mentioned before, although our uptake clearly has been slower than we had expected, we actually are making good progress in the third quarter. ","Our growth over the last four weeks in key Rxes is 23%, our growth in NB Rxes is close to 20%. When you look at the cardiology setting, in a quarter during which the new to brand prescriptions of both Pradaxa and Xarelto were flat, we experienced very, very good growth. Our NB Rx share in cardiology now is close to 19%, which compares to 12% for Pradaxa. So we are continuing to make progress, and the areas of focus going forward are the same as I just described. ","B\u00e9atrice Cazala","Regarding international, first let me talk briefly about Europe. We have now launched Eliquis in about 13 countries. And we saw significant growth, more than 100%, quarter over quarter. We are planning to launch in another four countries across Europe, including Italy. So this target launch also accounts for possibly the slower pace that you can see. ","We are feeling positive now about access. We are focusing our launch effort mainly on the cardiologists, and we are allocating resources strongly at the hospital, but also differentiating versus the level of [unintelligible] penetration in various markets. ","What makes Europe also is very different penetration of the [unintelligible], which gives us a lot of opportunities, because you go from countries where [unintelligible] are only at 2% penetration, and others where it\u2019s already 25%. So we are clearly differentiating our investment there, and we will be very competitive in other segments of the market, in all the various markets. ","We are continuing to do strong medical education. Let\u2019s not forget that [unintelligible] [authorization] starts with the hospital. Most of the patients go to the hospital in Europe. Then we also [unintelligible] the cardiologists and the general practitioners. So we are trying to accelerate the hospital discharge and the prescription at the hospital [unintelligible], moving to cardiologists and general practitioners. ","A lot of education needs to take place, and this is happening now. We are reinforcing our resources there. And as we see now more recent market data, we see that the differentiated profile starts being perceived by the cardiologists, which are [unintelligible] very important for the long term growth of the products."," ","Francis Cuss ","We were very encouraged with the melanoma data with the combination, and we were pleasantly surprised with the tolerability that we saw there. But as you appreciate, lung cancer is a different indication, and we will be looking, clearly, at the therapeutic index. We don\u2019t have the data yet, and I can\u2019t speculate about what we will see. But just to remind you that of course what we believe is one of the most valuable aspects of immunotherapy is the durable response. And that data set will be evolving over the next 6 to 12 months. And of course our hope will be combination that we will see an enhanced, durable response. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group ","On diabetes, I was wondering if you could tell us what you were able to realize in price for the DPP4 franchise if possible, in the quarter, in the U.S., most importantly, if that\u2019s possible. Number two, I\u2019d love to get your perspective on the increased rates of hospitalizations for heart failure seen in the SABRE trial, whether or not you think that\u2019s going to generate any kind of regulatory scrutiny. And then finally, on Nivo, the upcoming potentially pivotal Phase II third line refractory squamous trial, what level of response would you define as success in that trial?","Francis Cuss ","So, as you noted, one component of our secondary endpoint hospitalization for heart failure did occur, specifically more than the untreated group. But it is important to note, I think, that there was no increased risk of death due to heart failure overall, and in patients who entered the trial with a history of heart failure, there was no statistical different between the treatment and the primary endpoint. ","So we\u2019ve been discussing with consultants about what this may mean, and we\u2019ve had discussions with the regulators and we\u2019ll be making a submission of this data to see where any change to the labeling will come. That will be happening early next year.","I think it\u2019s important to also mention that if you take the SABRE trial overall, there was clearly some benefits there in terms of diabetic control. While that wasn\u2019t the point of the trial, it was very reassuring from that perspective, that patients treated with [Onglyza] had better control, and I think there was reassuring data around pancreatitis, even though the numbers were small in the end, and pancreatic cancer. So, overall, we felt the SABRE trial did really inform quite considerably on the use of DPP4 inhibitors, specifically Onglyza. ","As far as squamous is concerned, unfortunately, like all these things, it will depend exactly on the data we see. We think, and I\u2019ll repeat, it\u2019s very important to consider that this is a patient population with no other options at all at the present time, and that it\u2019s a very important aspect of this to see what the long term durable response rate is, not just the overall response rate. We think that\u2019s important.","Charles Bancroft ","Mark, I think your question was more related to the U.S. in regard to price. Overall, as we think of the Onglyza franchise, we continue to be at roughly parity with Januvia, and we did take a 5% [unintelligible] price increase in August of this year.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs ","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","I just have a couple of questions. Lamberto, first to you, I guess that given the significant commitment to immuno-oncology and the 25 trials ongoing with Nivolumab, and others, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re signaling to investors that we should assume a change in the rate of growth in R&D, different from what we\u2019ve seen the past couple of years? ","And my second question relates to the hep C program. Not sure who will take this, but if you could just help us to think about the commercial opportunity in Japan from your all-oral dual regimen. The reason why I think this is tough for us to figure out is that Telaprevir was a big disappointment in Japan, even though it produced much higher cure rates from peg\/riba. Your combination obviously excludes peg\/riba. So how should we think about the commercial uptake, pricing, etc.? And then secondly, how long do you expect to be on that market without competitors, which, you know, as I understand, will be on your heels. ","Lamberto Andreotti ","Thank you for this question, because this allows me to expand on the subject of investments that both Charlie and I mentioned in our remarks. Let me say that we will continue to invest to support this immuno-oncology portfolio, and we will continue to invest behind Eliquis, hep C, and diabetes. ","And all this will get the resources that they deserve, and this will increase our expenses, mostly the commercial expenses, because within R&D we have a number of programs that are ending now, and therefore we will have resources coming from within R&D to finance the additional expenses that immuno-oncology will especially require. And they are significant, by the way. ","But in commercial, we have already eliminated a lot of the expenses behind the old products, and therefore we will think about increasing commercial expenses. We will be ready to launch Nivo, and we will continue to support Yervoy. And as we said, Yervoy will launch as a first line in Europe. So we will expand the commercial activities behind Eliquis in the U.S., in the early launches, and we will launch outside the U.S. and the most recent countries. ","And then Charlie will speak about the investments that will be required by the launch of hep C in Japan. And finally, we have Forziga hopefully approved next year, so we will have a launch of Forziga in the U.S. ","Having said that, we are extremely aware, my management and I are extremely aware, of how important it is to deliver short term results, and we will deliver them, but we consider equally, if even not more important, to build a solid foundation for sustained long term growth. So we will devote resources, in summary, as I said, to all the great opportunities we have. ","Charles Bancroft ","As Lamberto mentioned in his opening comments, we are very excited about our opportunity to bring the first all-oral hep C regimen to market in Japan with our genotype 1B strategy. Our registrational Phase III study of daclatasvir and asunaprevir in Japanese genotype 1B patients will be presented at AASLD in a couple of weeks, and we plan to file in Japan later in this quarter.","Remember that there are about 1.2 million people infected with hepatitis C in Japan, and about 70% of them have genotype 1B. These patients are largely elderly and many either cannot tolerate the current interferon-based standard of care or are ineligible to receive it. So that speaks to the real opportunity and why the current standard of care has not done as well, to your earlier point.","And finally, we believe we have up to an 18-month lead on both [ABVI] and Gilead in Japan. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. ","Christopher Schott \u2013 JPMorgan","Just had three here. I guess first, we\u2019ve seen your competitors in the PD-L1 space focusing a bit more on PD-L1 status, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer. Can you just elaborate on your view on this dynamic and what implications it has either to the size of the market or the competitive positioning of Nivo?","Second, on Eliquis, with the slower launch - I know things are accelerating a bit now - have you changed your internal peak sales assumptions on the product based on the experience thus far?","And then finally, switching to diabetes, in light of some of the moves by payers to narrow their formulary to one or two products in some of these major categories, can you just talk about how formulary dynamics play out in the space over time? And are things just becoming more challenging with payers on that portion of your business?","Lamberto Andreotti ","I have a very quick answer to your question on Eliquis. No, our peak sales have not changed. And we are still very confident about Eliquis, and what the product can achieve.","Francis Cuss ","Can I say a word about the PD-L1? As you remember, Chris, we reported biomarker data last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested PD-L1 might be a predictive marker for the activity of Nivolumab. And as a result, we\u2019ve been studying this throughout our broad Phase III program. ","Now, it\u2019s important to note that our clinical development plans are designed to explore both the potential predictive biomarker and to ensure that the patients who may benefit are not excluded if they\u2019re biomarker negative. So our objective is to conduct well-controlled Phase III studies that will establish the validity of any biomarker based on overall survival. And again, it\u2019s an important element, not just about response rate, overall survival.","And I think finally it\u2019s hard to predict exactly how this will come out, because as you understand, the approach for developing immunotherapies is rather different from what we would use in [unintelligible] in medicines. So in immuno-oncology, we\u2019re really targeting the host and the interaction of the tumor and the host\u2019s immune system, as opposed to tumor mutations such as KRAS or BRAF.","That being said, I think I would say as far as we\u2019re concerned in BMS we have a lot of experience with KRAS and [unintelligible]. We do understand what\u2019s necessary to have a pharmacodiagnostic properly validate and to develop the data that\u2019s going to be required for the regulators to make a decision. So I think we\u2019re generating the data, we\u2019ll see what the data is, and we\u2019ll debate and collaborate with the regulators to provide perhaps a biomarker or perhaps an accelerated submission if that\u2019s appropriate.","Giovanni Caforio ","Let me make a comment on diabetes access. Clearly, as you know, this is a very big market, very competitive and crowded. And obviously it\u2019s an area of focus for payers, and that will not change going forward. From our perspective, this is the one area in fact having a broad portfolio really creates a good platform for us to negotiate with payers through the three classes. ","When we look at our competitive position, our access with Bydureon is improving, and following following the loss of Caremark at the end of last year, our access position this year with Onglyza and Kombiglyze has been good and stable.","Going into next year, as you probably know, we had two very important wins with ESI, which is a very important customer, both with respect to our position with Onglyza and [unintelligible], and most importantly with Bydureon as the preferred GLP-1. So it continues to be an area of focus for us, but we\u2019re working very actively. We have a good portfolio, and we\u2019ll be able to continue to compete.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. ","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","First, for Francis, I realize it\u2019s a bit early, but could you please comment on some of the other cancer immunotherapies that you have in the clinic, and roughly when we can expect data? And then a follow up on Forxiga. Is the FDA outcome later this year simply a follow up to earlier issues? Because it doesn\u2019t seem like one is expected for [unintelligible]. ","Francis Cuss","Let me be just very brief. We have ongoing trials with combinations of ipilimumab, Nivolumab, with our [unintelligible] and IL-21. Those are ongoing exploratory trials, so it\u2019s very hard to say. They\u2019re [unintelligible], so we\u2019ll see when those come out. And I think excitingly, we\u2019re going to have, before the end of the year, the LAG-3 entering the clinic. And again, those [unintelligible]. Again, very exciting.  ","The outcome for Forxiga, we know we have an outcome in December that the FDA, I think it\u2019s important to note, has been working through, despite the government shutdown. We feel we\u2019ve answered all the questions that came from the CRL. And we added additional data to the submission. Some of that was presented at the EASD in September, and some more on hypertension will be presented at the AHA in November. And this will be part of the outcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford Bernstein ","If I can go back to biomarkers, your positioning over at least initially was a little bit uncertain whether L1 expression would be highly predictive. But when I look at the data that has continued to come out, it seems like that body of evidence does increasingly support that L1 expression predicts efficacy. And I guess my question to you is has your thinking changed over time? I know your development programs are set up to look at it, but are you kind of warming up, the more data you see to the idea of L1 being predictive? ","And then related to this, what other predictive biomarkers are you looking at, or is anyone in the industry looking at, that\u2019s been promising? ","And then the last question is, going back to your comment, you said the next public data downstream of World Lung Conference would be ASCO, but I\u2019m imagining you\u2019ll have top line results of various sorts in between. If that\u2019s right, maybe you could outline what some of these would include. I would imagine that would be the Phase II lung cancer data and the combo data with [ipi], for example.","Francis Cuss ","So I think it\u2019s fair to say our data and others suggest that the PD-L1 biomarker will enrich full response. However, it\u2019s also very clear that there\u2019s a number of patients who are apparently PD-L1 negative who also respond. And I think it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t exclude those patients from the potential benefit. And I think it\u2019s particularly important to say also that the data set will evolve, and we\u2019ll get some sense of the long term response.","But that being said, we\u2019re leaving ourselves open to take the data we generate and in discussions with the regulators to come up with the best approach.","Lamberto Andreotti ","Can I make a comment, please? Not obviously very scientific, but aren\u2019t others drawing conclusions a bit too early at this point? I mean, don\u2019t we need more patients, more experience, before we draw final conclusions on these very important aspects?","Francis Cuss ","Well, I think that\u2019s certainly our point of view. I think we\u2019re leaving ourselves open to go with a biomarker if that\u2019s what the data shows, but we also want to make sure that we make sure this therapy is open to the broadest number of patients. I think as far as other predictive biomarkers are concerned, there\u2019s a lot of work ongoing in terms of understanding that interaction between the host and the tumor. And I don\u2019t think at this point I want to share that data, but it\u2019s certainly an area of considerable work, both internally within BMS and externally with our collaborators.","As far as the next public data, let me reiterate what I said. The two-year lung data will be presented from 003 at the World Lung Conference in Sydney later this week. And then we will be getting considerable amounts of data over the next six months, within BMS, but the next time we\u2019re planning to present publicly will be at ASCO, and there will be data sets, probably further data sets on 003 survival, 004, which is the combination, and potentially the third line Phase II study in non-small cell lung squamous cell.","John Elicker","And Tim, you\u2019re right, we will also have the combo Phase I lung study in house, hopefully by the end of the year. ","Francis Cuss ","Both the non-small cell and renal cell.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew Baum - Citi ","Three questions please. First, can you give us an update on Urelumab, your anti-CD137? When should we expect to see some of the data from your ongoing trials? Second, could you help us understand the lower pneumonitis grade three rates that you\u2019re seeing with Nivolumab of late? To what extent is this just a function of patient selection and management? And in actual fact, when you start looking at combination therapies, the [unintelligible] benefits of PD-L1 target data may look somewhat better? And then finally, how will the GBA decision on Galvus reimbursements in Germany impact the pricing of the class in the rest of Europe?","Francis Cuss ","Urelumab, we have a couple of studies ongoing. They\u2019re exploratory studies. They\u2019re event-based studies. So they will be probably reporting out sometime in 2015, perhaps a little sooner. As far as the pneumonitis rate, we\u2019re not seeing very high rates at all. We have seen [unintelligible] with both PD1 and our PD-L1. And it\u2019s very difficult with very small numbers. I think it\u2019s an important potential adverse event, but it doesn\u2019t happen very often, and we do expect, as the numbers grow, to have a better sense of that. But I think it\u2019s very hard at this point to interpret at all about whether it will be greater or lesser with either PD1 or PD-L1.","B\u00e9atrice Cazala ","Regarding the GBA, you probably all heard that on October 1 a ruling was made after a class review of all the DPP-4s, and their combinations. So we\u2019re very pleased to see that in a very difficult context in Germany for diabetes, our products, [Onglyza] and Kombiglyze, were given an added minor benefit over [unintelligible] metformin. So that happened with [unintelligible]. The others, as you mentioned, did not get any benefit. ","So, what happens now in the process, and to understand what could be the outcome, is that negotiations on pricing are going to start with [unintelligible]. So obviously each company will negotiate their pricing, and we\u2019ll see then the outcome. For us, we feel that with an additional benefit, we will be able to conclude pricing negotiations relatively quickly, and we cannot speculate what exactly [unintelligible], but we will be ready to face any opportunities [unintelligible]. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen. ","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen & Company","I have two followups from points made on the second quarter call. I apologize if you\u2019ve already given this piece of information, but what is the share of Eliquis among cardiologists? I think on the second quarter call you said it was about 15%. ","And on Nivolumab, on the second quarter call you stated that there was no more public disclosures this year, when indeed you do have this two-year update that you referenced a couple of times on the call coming this week, or next week. So three months ago you probably didn\u2019t have the two-year data, but now you do, the two-year update. So I\u2019m wondering if receipt of the data changed your language or characterization of the event.","Giovanni Caforio ","Let me start with the cardiology MB Rx share. The latest data point we have is 18.9% share for Eliquis from a new patient share in cardiology.","Francis Cuss","Just to say that we always planned to present the long term data at the World Lung Conference in Sydney. You\u2019re right, that\u2019s not new. That was always the plan. But you\u2019re right, the next date after that is ASCO.","John Elicker","And I think part of that we\u2019re seeing the view that this is data from an existing study that had already been presented, so we weren\u2019t presenting data from any new studies the remainder of this year. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. ","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse ","I\u2019ve got one on the pipeline and one on the market side. On the market side, about Orencia, you mentioned the subcu formulation. And I think you said it\u2019s about a third of the use is now with that formulation. I think that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re hearing too. Just wondering if you\u2019re sensing that that\u2019s helping position you to get more comfortable moving Orencia up earlier in the algorithm, and maybe what else you can expect in terms of lifecycle management.","And then on Nivo, I realize it\u2019s a bit early to be asking this question, but we\u2019ve been getting this question a lot ourselves. And so on the pricing side, and there seems to be a lot of wide range of assumptions there in terms of how the combo could potentially be priced. And once again, I realize it\u2019s early, but if there\u2019s anything you could say just in terms of directionally how we should be thinking about that, what your framework is in terms of thinking about pricing, just because it is such a key variable in our model and I think others as well.","Lamberto Andreotti ","You\u2019re right, the pricing on Nivo is a very important subject, but we\u2019re not willing to discuss it today. We are devoting a lot of attention to that subject. We are discussing it internally. We are collecting the right data. And obviously we will make the decision over time, and we will announce it at the very last minute.","Giovanni Caforio ","Maybe let me start with Orencia in the U.S. We had a very good quarter in the U.S. The brand was up 17% versus previous year. The subcu formulation was up significantly, both versus prior year and then sequentially over the previous quarter in the U.S. That is happening exactly as you mentioned, as a result of physicians feeling more and more comfortable in using the subcu formulation earlier in the treatment paradigm. And in fact, even our promotional strategy has shifted really to promoting the value of Orencia subcu as a first line biologic. As you may have seen and know, we\u2019re now the third most prescribed subcu agent in the U.S. and the trends continue to be positive.","B\u00e9atrice Cazala ","Similarly, in international and in Europe, things are going very well for Orencia. In Europe, particularly, the market was 70%-plus in subcu, so having now the addition and the reimbursement [unintelligible], but in most markets for subcu it\u2019s very helpful to those who are growing by more than 40% in the last quarter. So, similarly, we see more and more use, first line biologic [unintelligible] and more and more thinking about the first line biologics. [unintelligible], but also what we have noticed in the last quarter is that our IV business seems to be bottoming out and stabilizing and regrowing, so that\u2019s also good, because we have additional growth coming from new patients, not just cannibalization.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America. ","Gregg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","For Giovanni and Beatrice, I was curious how much does your oncology commercial effort need to expand is Nivo is approved in lung cancer, and when would you begin that expansion? And for Charlie, on tax rate, wondering what a good tax rate to use longer term would be, now that you\u2019ve had some more time post-Plavix LOE. And does that new rate give you adequate flexibility to raise the dividend if you were choose so, and to buy back stock, if you were to choose to do so again in the future. Just wondering how much flexibility is left within your new tax structure.","Giovanni Caforio ","Very quickly, on the U.S., as you know, we have a very good organization in the U.S., with a strong and diversified portfolio. We are well-resourced for [unintelligible] in melanoma. Obviously we are thinking about lung. That\u2019s a bigger opportunity, it\u2019s a larger prescriber base, and we will be ready to launch that as well. So we clearly will invest and grow the sales organization in the U.S..","B\u00e9atrice Cazala ","And as you know, lung is really a global issue, from China to Japan to the U.S. So the global team are working with all our original team to assess in the next fiscal year how much resources we need to be ready and start early on. It\u2019s clear that with the competitive landscape, we want to be ready and not to have the reorganize every year, each time we have an additional indication of an additional evolution. So we are working on that very actively with all our regions.","Lamberto Andreotti ","Yes, this is the new paradigm in oncology, where we have multiple indications potentially coming very quickly, and therefore we are thinking, in the U.S., as Giovanni said, and outside of the U.S., as Beatrice said, of creating an infrastructure and a structure that doesn\u2019t need to be changed at every indication. And also we need to start very early with these new prescribers, the new indication with new prescribers. Remember the work we had to do with the melanoma prescribers at the beginning to familiarize them with immuno-oncology? Well, the same needs to be done now, to much grow the base in the U.S. and internationally, to familiarize them with immuno-oncology. And they are especially the lung cancer prescribers.","Charles Bancroft ","","On the tax rate, you may recall that we benefited in 2013 by having the double up of the R&D tax credit from 2012. Going forward, our tax rate is very dependent upon where our earnings mix comes from. And we\u2019ve said at least in the intermediate term we view our tax rate in the mid to high teens area. I can\u2019t give more than that. We\u2019re going to have to roll up the numbers and see where all the different earnings come from.","As far as the dividend, that\u2019s an annual board decision, and that\u2019s not one I can talk about at this point. And in regard to share repurchase, I would just reinforce what I said in my opening comments, that we do not anticipate any share repurchases going forward at this time.","Lamberto Andreotti ","Thank you, Charlie. Even though this is a decision of the board, we are aware that the board and we are committed to the dividend. So I know that every comment we make on dividends might be misinterpreted. I just don\u2019t want your comment to be misinterpreted. We are committed to the dividend, and the board will decide on it quarter by quarter and year by year.","Let me conclude the session by repeating that this is an important time for Bristol-Myers Squibb, with return to growth, our pipeline progress, and our balanced approach to delivering the results of today while laying the foundation for the results of tomorrow. Taken together, Bristol-Myers Squibb is strong and I\u2019m convinced we are well-positioned for the future. Thank you very much, and you have a great day.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Elicker.","John E. Elicker","Thank you, Lea, and thanks, everybody, this morning for joining us on the call. I know it's a busy morning for all of you. With me today, we have Lamberto Andreotti, our CEO; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, with, as you may know, also additional commercial responsibilities. Both Lamberto and Charlie will have prepared remarks. And then joining us for Q&A are Elliott Sigal, our Chief Scientific Officer; and Beatrice Cazala, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Giovanni Caforio, our President of U.S. Pharmaceuticals business.","So let me take care of the legal requirement.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website, bms.com.","Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter for a number of reasons, and especially due to the discontinuation of the 094 development program. While I am disappointed, very disappointed with that situation, I'm certainly proud of the way we handled it, quickly and decisively to preserve patient safety. Importantly, we remain committed to and focused on delivering against our strategy. Nothing has changed in that regard. We remain fully committed to business development in our therapeutic areas of focus and we remain fully committed to the field of hepatitis C.","Further, a lot happened during the quarter that continues to give me confidence that we are on the right track. The strong performance of our key and new products, the clinical and regulatory advances, particularly those related to YERVOY, anti-PD-1 and ELIQUIS; the simplification of our long-term alliance with Sanofi; and of course, the completion of the Amylin acquisition and the expansion of our alliance with AstraZeneca.","Let me just spend a few minutes on some of these highlights. Commercially, I was encouraged by the performance of a number of key products, namely ORENCIA, SPRYCEL, Baraclude, ONGLYZA and YERVOY, which has experienced solid growth partly due to progress with access and reimbursement abroad. All of these products had a strong quarter, all experienced double-digit growth.","Clinically, immuno-oncology remains a key part of our future and we made progress last quarter on 2 fronts. At the European Society for Medical Oncology, we presented long-term survival data on YERVOY, data that is very important, very valuable for patients with metastatic melanoma. And we also began Phase III trials on anti-PD-1, 2 for lung cancer and 1 for renal cancer. And we are expecting to begin soon, possibly later this year, a Phase III trial for melanoma.","On the regulatory front, there were significantly developments with respect to 2 key products: ELIQUIS and FORXIGA. Regarding ELIQUIS, we received a positive opinion from the CHMP in Europe, and we are expecting a decision by the end of the year. In Japan, our application is progressing and could lead to a decision by the end of the year. And in the U.S., we now have a new PDUFA date on March 17 from the FDA. Regarding FORXIGA, we are hoping for a decision in Europe by year's end, and in the U.S., we now have Klaricid at path forward with the FDA and are planning to resubmit our application by the middle of 2013.","Regarding hepatitis C, we believe we still have some interesting opportunities. Data on some of them will be presented at the AASLD conference next month. And in Japan, we pursue our genotype 1b strategy and expect to file an oral regimen by the end of next year.","And finally, regarding diabetes, we now have a very broad, robust portfolio of treatment options for patients, physicians and payers. With a strong performance by ONGLYZA, encouraging regulatory progress on FORXIGA and the recent acquisition of Amylin, I am excited about the evolution of our joint Bristol-Myers Squibb-AstraZeneca portfolio into a comprehensive diabetes franchise.","With respect to Amylin, I am pleased that we finalized the acquisition in August and has started to cross-train our U.S. sales force. In fact, our integrated sales force has just begun promoting our entire franchise.","Taken as a whole, the quarter reflected a significant transition underway at Bristol-Myers Squibb toward the portfolio of the future. And going forward, we plan to maintain our balanced approach driving results today while taking the stage for tomorrow.","Though we, together with the entire industry, continue to face macroeconomic headwinds, especially in Europe, I believe our strategy and our product and geographic diversification will support us going forward. As such, I remain optimistic about our future. And now, Charlie will provide you with some of our key numbers. Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft","Thank you, Lamberto. This was an important quarter for the company as we take another step towards our transition to the portfolio of our future. In the third quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.41. We reported net sales of $3.7 billion in the quarter, down 30% compared to last year due to the exclusivity loss of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, causing volume to be down 28%. Price was favorable by 1%, and foreign exchange had a negative 3% impact on sales. Excluding PLAVIX and AVAPRO, global sales grew 7%, driven by the trends of our key brands that are important to our future.","Let me provide a few highlights. During the quarter, we reported Europe worldwide YERVOY sales of $179 million, with U.S. sales contributing $123 million. We are making good progress gaining access with YERVOY internationally and are focused on delivering longer-term growth.","In the U.S., we believe that the demand we saw in the third quarter provides a strong base from which to build YERVOY in the future. It is important that we continue to reinforce the value of the potential for long-term survival. The 4- and 5-year survival data recently presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology will be important as we work with all stakeholders in the patient's journey to shift the treatment goal to long-term survival.","As Lamberto mentioned, with the acquisition of Amylin and regulatory progress with FORXIGA, we now have what we believe is a very strong diabetes portfolio with a broad range of options for patients, physicians and payers.","ONGLYZA franchise sales were $178 million, up 40% compared to last year. In the U.S., prescriptions grew twice as fast as the DPP4 market. In Europe, planning is well underway to launch KOMBIGLYZE XR during the fourth quarter. Longer term, in addition to glycemic control, we are focused on the potential for cardio protection and have studies ongoing across the portfolio. We are looking forward to the ONGLYZA SAVOR study results, which should report out next year.","The exenatide franchise had sales of $75 million in the quarter. Following the closing of Amylin in August, the teams have been focused on ensuring the right level of access in the U.S. and the alliance salesforces have recently begun full promotion. Outside the U.S., the process of transition with Lilly is underway and we should be substantially complete by mid-2013.","SPRYCEL was up 25% in the quarter. We continue to make share gains in both first line and the continued expansion of the second line opportunity. Outside the U.S., we are seeing strong adoption in Japan and the EU business is doing well, particularly in markets where we have first line reimbursement, including Germany, Italy and Spain.","The ORENCIA franchise was up 32%. ORENCIA SubQ, which was launched in the U.S. at the end of last year, had sales of $61 million in Q3 and now accounts for 28% of our franchise sales in the U.S. Our ORENCIA SubQ was recently approved in the EU, and we are in the launch process.","REYATAZ sales were down 7%. While U.S. sales were up 5%, international sales were down 18% due to 3 factors. Firstly, the overall market is becoming increasingly competitive. And secondly, we have seen lower inventory levels in Europe. Finally, there is a variability of timing of orders in Russia and Brazil where we had government purchases in Q3 last year but took place in Q2 this year.","Before I move to expenses, let me touch on the restructuring of our agreement with Sanofi. The revised agreement simplifies operations and supports our strategy and focus on delivering our portfolio. We expect that the EPS impact of the restructuring will be minimal from 2013 through 2018.","Now let me give you just  a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliation to our GAAP results are available on our press release and our website.","Gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points compared to third quarter last year. This favorability was primarily driven by foreign exchange. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 19%, reflecting decreased spend behind PLAVIX, AVAPRO and life cycle flexing of certain in-line brands. The effective overall tax rate was 20.5% in the quarter, the decrease compared to third quarter of 2011 is primarily due to earnings mix.","Now turning to guidance. You have seen that we have confirmed our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.90 to $2 and expect to be at the upper end of the range. This includes the estimated $0.03 dilution related to the acquisition of Amylin. You will also note in our press release that we have updated our line item guidance. Let me comment on 2 of the changes.","We now expect full year gross margin as a percentage of sales to improve approximately 100 basis points versus last year. This is in part driven by sales mix and favorability in foreign exchange. And we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23%, which assumes the extension of the R&D tax credit. Earnings mix and effective tax planning are having a positive impact on our full year rate.","I would now like to turn it over to your questions.","John E. Elicker","Thanks, Charlie. And Lea, I think we're ready to go to questions. And I would just remind everybody that in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, we have Elliott, Beatrice and Giovanni here for any questions you may have. Lea?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of things. First, on ABILIFY, can you talk about whether this initiative by CNS in May, has had any impact on that market? Second of all, can you talk about Baraclude a little bit OUS? It seems a little weaker than we would've thought if there's anything going on there. And then third, just on the GLP market, BYDUREON, is this some slowdown in the ramp just because of the turnover in companies and change in sales force and stuff or is there something else going on?","Lamberto Andreotti","Why don't we -- and why don't we do the following? Why don't we ask Giovanni to comment on ABILIFY and the GLP market in the U.S., and Beatrice, you will follow-up with a comment on Baraclude.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, this is Giovanni. On ABILIFY, the first thing I would say, the key trend in the marketplace in the U.S. right now is really the genericization of the market and the entry of generic competitors for many of our products. With respect to the ABILIFY performance, the performance continues to be stable quarter-over-quarter and versus prior year and very much in line with our expectations and our focus has not changed. We continue to be very focused on promoting the differentiated profile of ABILIFY with the efficacy as early as week 1. So we have not seen any significant change in access, trends and the performance of the brand continues to be strong. With respect to the GLP-1 market, as you know, the market is growing rapidly. GLP-1s were initially adopted primarily by endocrinologists in the U.S. and they have started usage in relatively late-stage patients. With the entry of new products such as BYDUREON, because of the weekly dosing and the convenience, we expect that the growth of the market and the GLP-1 segment will continue, because those products will be adopted more broadly by primary care physicians and they will be used earlier in the treatment paradigm. With respect to BYDUREON and our trends, as Lamberto mentioned at the beginning, we have very rapidly accelerated the integration of the Amylin business. We have cross-trained our sales forces. We recently began promotion of the full portfolio, including BYDUREON through the AstraZeneca, the BMS and the Amylin teams. Those teams are in the field that we do see significant potential for growth, not only because of the increasing penetration with endocrinologists, but also we do see that we will be able to grow the prescribers base, including primary care physicians. So we're optimistic with the growth prospects of BYDUREON and our exenatide franchise within the GLP-1 market.","Lamberto Andreotti","Wait, wait. Before Beatrice speaks about Baraclude, right, I will like to say a couple of things about our presence in diabetes. I think that -- probably, I said it before in my prepared remarks, but I want to repeat that with this strong performance for ONGLYZA, the encouraging regulatory progress for FORXIGA and the reacquisition of Amylin, I'm really excited about the evolution of our joint Bristol-Myers Squibb-AstraZeneca portfolio into this comprehensive diabetes franchise. And what I wanted to -- also to say is that we are focused not just on glycemic control within diabetes, but also in CV protection. With that in mind, we have CV outcome programs in place for all the free classes of agents in our portfolio, DPP-4, SGLT2 and GLP-1. And we see the first results beginning with SAVOR next year. This is what I wanted to say about the diabetes franchise. And then, Beatrice, why don't you speak about the good results of Baraclude?","Beatrice Cazala","So Baraclude's 2012 performance versus last year, we recorded a plus 11%, so we see contrasted views, very strong market in China. We are growing more than 34%, so very successful there. We are also are continuing growing in the rest of this year, with very strong growth there of 15%. What you're talking about are possibly a slowdown, it's mainly in Europe, where we have seen the impact of some government and action against usage of Baraclude, and we do think demand, especially in countries like Italy. So overall, a picture where we still see a very strong growth globally versus last year, very strong market share. Recognition of the ability of the products to really deliver on this long-term efficacy and safety and position very well as a market leader versus Tenofovir.","Operator","Next question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question is to Charlie, if there -- the margin progression this quarter was a bit confusing. Gross margins were much higher than expected, but the tax rate was a lot lower, and at the same time, marketing, admin and promotion expenses -- or rather marketing, selling, admin and R&D were about $200 million higher relative to our expectations. So can you try to clarify what is going on? I mean, should we assume -- what should we assume going forward? Are the heavier promotional and R&D expenses front line loaded or is this now the new normal at Bristol-Myers? How should we think about gross margins going forward? And to what extent the mix should be sustained? And then also, on the new tax rate guidance of 23%, how we should think about that going forward? And then I have a follow-up question. I don't know if Elliott's on the call, but interested on your comments on dapa and the path forward. What additional work have you been asked to do? And what were the key areas of focus by the FDA? And if you can just provide a little bit more granularity on what that submission package will look like relative to what you've submitted before?","Elliott Sigal","Jamie, this is Elliott. I'll take the dapagliflozin FORXIGA question. First, we, as Lamberto indicated, have had extensive discussions with the FDA in the last several months. Based on evolving data, clinical data of patients who've been treated following extensions, the FDA's benefit-risk profile assessment of dapagliflozin may have shifted in favor of the drug. Our discussions have, therefore, resulted in a well-defined path forward. We don't require starting any new clinical data, but we are planning to resubmit in the middle of 2013 with more clinical data from our extension of some studies, plus the results of some dedicated blood pressure studies with dapagliflozin. This medicine, as you know, offers the triad of potential benefits of glucose control, weight reduction and blood pressure reduction. And we do expect to have an advisory committee and a 6-month review. So resubmission of ongoing clinical studies, another look at the benefit-risk, including probably an advisory committee and a 6-month review. Meanwhile, in Europe, we are encouraged by the progress and do feel that we will have this drug approved in Europe by the end of the year.","Charles A. Bancroft","Okay, Jamie, this is Charlie. In regard to gross margin, expenses and taxes, in one respect, we are absorbing now, for the first time, Amylin in both the third quarter and as we've guided for the full year 2012. And also, you may recall that in the Q4 last year, we had unusually high MS&A expenses, which we commented in previous earnings calls that we don't expect to repeat this year. Gross margin, as I mentioned in my comments, is benefited by exchange for the contracts that we record there, so I can't comment going forward how that would potentially look, not knowing where exchange rates will go. And on the tax side, as I mentioned, it's component of earnings mix and tax planning. Without giving guidance for 2013 on the tax line, I would say earnings mix is always going to be a variable. But on the tax planning side, some of that we see should be a positive going forward. In regard to 2013 overall, we have talked about this previously regarding the dynamics not only impacting the industry but impacting us specifically. And as we stated, we intend to provide 2013 guidance in January of next year.","Operator","Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.","Tim Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can you narrow down your expectations and the timing of U.S. approval of ELIQUIS? Specifically, do you think the agency will take the full 6 months or could it be something less than this? And is there any chance the product might need to go before an FDA advisory committee or do you think you've answered all of the agency's questions at this point? And then on emerging markets, on a constant exchange rate basis, growth was, I think, around 2%, which is fairly low. Any color on your expectations for future growth in emerging markets?","Elliott Sigal","Tim, this is Elliott. On ELIQUIS, we do not expect nor have any indication there will be an advisory committee. As I mentioned on our last investor call at the end of July, we had a set of questions. We felt we could submit answers too. By mid-September, we did that. The official receipt by the FDA of those answers were -- was September 26. I am confident our answers addressed all the questions in front of the FDA. That submission date triggers a potential 6-month review. Therefore, we had announced the PDUFA date of March 17 of '13. I am personally hopeful that the decision can come earlier.","Beatrice Cazala","In emerging markets, for your question, we are strongly encouraged to see continued growth for our new brand in key growth drivers, Baraclude, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA mainly. They have been partially offset by a decline and softness in some of our mature brand and REYATAZ. So we saw very strong growth in China and we saw weakness is more in Russia and Brazil linked to the tendering of REYATAZ, which accounted differently between Q3 and Q2. So overall, we have strong growth in those markets, Brazil for ORENCIA, SPRYCEL. We have a strong also growth for Baraclude in Russia and China continued to be very strong for us.","Operator","Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple on ELIQUIS. First, what is the earliest that the commercial organizations of Bristol and Pfizer could be ready to launch ELIQUIS in the U.S.? And Elliott, do you have any views on edoxaban and how that will compare with current players and ELIQUIS based on what has been presented thus far? And then on HCV, with marketing moving to 1 pill once daily seemingly, do you have efforts underway to compete on that front?","Lamberto Andreotti","Giovanni, I think you want to take the ELIQUIS question, but I can summarize the answer. We are ready, right? So why don't you go? We have more to say.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. So as you know, we are working very actively with Pfizer to prepare for launch. The answer is we are ready to launch. As we've said before, a couple of other comments. The first one is we are really excited with the profile of the product. It is differentiated not only versus warfarin but also versus the other agents and that's going to be very important for us. The second point is we will launch with the combined strength of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer. We have significant experience in cardiovasculars. We have a strong presence in cardiology. We will have a broad reach and a primary care and a very clear focus on access. When we launch, we will focus on establishing access for the first 4 to 6 weeks post-approval. And at the same time, we will train our sales and medical teams to begin promotion of ELIQUIS. And we are ready for -- and we are ready to launch. Our first objective when we launch, given the differentiated profile and the strength of the data, will clearly be to establish ELIQUIS as the leading new agent. We also believe we have the potential to increase the percentage of na\u00efve patient new to brand Rxs that go to new agents. As you know, the new agents right now are capturing about 1\/3 on -- of NBRxs, and we believe we that the launch of ELIQUIS, given the differentiated profile, will be able to significantly grow that percentage.","Lamberto Andreotti","Elliott?","Elliott Sigal","Yes, Greg. I'll answer your question on edoxaban and then HCV. Edoxaban, of course, is the potential competitor in the 10a space, an ongoing Phase III trial that may be read out next year. Clearly, our data, as it stands now, is differentiated with superior efficacy and less bleeding and a mortality benefit. We believe the differentiated data from 2 trials, ARISTOTLE and AVERROES, will be reflected in the label and it will be a best-in-class product, answering the significant unmet need. It is impossible for us to know for sure what the profile of edoxaban will be. It clearly will depend on their data that we will review and we take serious for next year. I will note that the half-life of this drug, edoxaban, is similar to both rivaroxaban and ELIQUIS. And our experience -- and the experience in the field so far would predict a BID dose would be necessary to achieve a profile like ELIQUIS of both superior efficacy and superior bleeding. So we're pleased with our regulatory process going forward over the summer. We are working expeditiously with the FDA and I mentioned our preparations in Europe. With regard to HCV, this is a very competitive area, of course. We are -- we do see some important milestones this particular quarter. Particularly at the liver meeting, we will present several things that represent the value we see in this space. We believe there is room for several regimens. We look forward to present exciting data on a sustained viral response on our triple combination of our 5A and protease inhibitor, plus our non-nuke NS5B. You'll note that the 5A and NS3 protease inhibitor is what we have been calling the dual. The dual is in Phase III in Japan. The protease inhibitor has been dosed in over 1,000 patients, our 5A in several thousand patients. So now we begin to add NS5B to this dual regimen and we have seen, in a 12-week regimen, a very impressive sustained viral response. In fact, it corresponds to 100% in the small number of patients tested, if loss-to-follow-up are excluded. We're looking forward to being able to advance this regimen potentially in Phase III registrational studies, starting in the first half of 2014. In the meantime, we will be obtaining more safety data on the third component, the non-nucleotide NS5B, and completing the formulation work to combine the 3 drugs into 1 pill that will be administered twice a day for a up to 12-week regimen. In addition, our dual, as mentioned, is progressing in Japan and there's a significant number of patients, over 2 million patients infected there. 70% of them have genotype 1b. The dual has had a very high SVR [ph] after the regimen there of the dual. And we will see the Phase III data in the middle of next year and hope to file by the end of the year. We've also initiated a Phase III Quad program, with the dual on top of peg\/riba for GT1a and GT1b null patients. We continue to develop Lambda in parts of the world we think -- where we think an interferon will remain an important option. We also will present at the Liver Meeting's proof-of-concept for Lambda and hepatitis B, which I think is an important medical opportunity.","Operator","Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Some of these -- some of my questions were asked. I had one financial question and a couple of pipeline. The first was -- I still don't entirely understand. The tax rate in the quarter, a little lower than we were expecting. Maybe provide a little more color on that if you don't mind. Second question I had was on PD-1. Could you just give us an update on the timeline for the Phase III? Is there any enrollment that has already occurred? And then also, the YERVOY combo trial with ZELBORAF, what the status is for combining YERVOY with ZELBORAF? And my final question is on dapa, just to build on a prior question. Did I hear you right, Elliott, that you said that you think you may have -- that the FDA's mind may have changed about the risk-reward on this?","John E. Elicker","Well, Mark, I'm not sure what happens if we didn't answer most of your questions in advance.","Lamberto Andreotti","So who starts -- you start with the tax rate.","Charles A. Bancroft","Yes, let me just review what I said before regarding the tax rate. Our tax rate is variable to where we have our earnings and we have earnings differentials between countries. So it's just purely a function of earnings mix where we earn our income for the quarter.","Elliott Sigal","Yes, Mark, so on PD-1, ZELBORAF and dapagliflozin, starting on the reverse order. Yes, I said that after extensive discussions with the FDA, we believe that the FDA -- well, clearly it's willing to reconsider the benefit-risk of this drug. This will require a review and probably an advisory committee. And their sense that they convey to us is that the benefit-risk has shifted in the favor of the drug. That's as we have evolving data, plus we think we can shore up that argument by supplying more data over the next 6 months. So since I don't have all that data in hand, I have to add that important caveat. But I feel we will be submitting an even stronger application for this important medicine by the middle of '13, have a 6-month review, including probably an advisory committee. With regard to PD-1, we have a very significant, dedicated, intense team on this in development and with our commercial colleagues for advice and involvement in this. It's a very exciting area in specific and in general. We have just recently launched 3 Phase III studies, 2 are in lung studies. Those -- so patients have started to be dosed in second line squamous cells and second line non-squamous cell. A renal cell carcinoma study has also been started and soon, there will be a comprehensive Phase III program, covering all lines of therapy in melanoma probably to start before the end of the year. With regard to ipilimumab data with ZELBORAF, we did feel we would have this data in house by the end of this year. It might take into next year. There's -- it's a 50-patient study with ZELBORAF and ipilimumab used together, primarily for safety and advice. We will present at ASCO combination data, including PD-1 and ipilimumab.","Operator","Catherine Arnold with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Catherine J. Arnold - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could step back maybe and talk about your priorities for business development. Obviously, you're still very -- planning to be very aggressive about deals. But given Amylin and given Inhibitex, what are the therapeutic areas where you might say, I really want to pursue this based on where the body of science is going or based on your strategic objective? And then when it comes to ELIQUIS, could you talk about getting the patients that are in sort of the less -- the more stable patients on warfarin sort of switched over to ELIQUIS, and what you've learned about where the market is in Xarelto and Pradaxa that you will sort of incorporate into your plans, whether it's the bleeding concerns, without a lack of an antidote or pricing or patient stratification? Give us a bit more granularity there.","Lamberto Andreotti","Giovanni, you will take the ELIQUIS question. Let me make a couple of comments about business development. As I said before, we are disappointed by the discontinuation of the 094 program, which -- well, which is a stark reminder of the high-risk nature of our business. Having said that, nothing has changed with regard to our business development strategy. And you might be aware, but we recently announced that Fran Heller has joined the company as the new Head of Business Development. Business development has been one of our top priorities and we're pleased that we closed our acquisition of Amylin and our expansion of our AstraZeneca during the quarter. Now we continue to be interested in small molecules, as well as expanding our biologics capability, and the areas are aligned with our key strategic disease areas. So they remain CVMET [ph], virology, neuroscience, immuno-oncology and immunology. We will continue to look for business development opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth and -- but we're also interested in near-term opportunities, opportunities that could improve or would improve the growth profile of the company. What I want to say also is that we will remain disciplined with regard to focusing on transactions, business development transactions that are strategically, scientifically and economically sound. So in summary, nothing has changed as far as business development is concerned at Bristol-Myers Squibb.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, Catherine, this is Giovanni. From an ELIQUIS perspective, as I said before, the very important point is that the profile of ELIQUIS is very differentiated. Not only versus warfarin but also versus the other agents. And also that we will have Pfizer and also Bristol-Myers Squibb very focused on ensuring a successful launch. With respect to the patient pools, as I mentioned before, we are very focused on looking at new-to-brand prescriptions or NBRxs. And the new agents to date in the U.S. have captured approximately 1\/3 of NBRxs. It's important that we believe that's primarily because of a convenience perception from physicians on Xarelto and Pradaxa. And when we launched with ELIQUIS, we will have really strong data. The efficacy data is important, the bleeding data is extremely important. So as I said before, our first focus really is to establish ELIQUIS as the leading new agent, accelerate the erosion of NBRxs from warfarin and clearly, over time, there will be patients that are well controlled on warfarin or currently on aspirin at a later point, that will begin to be accessible to us, but I think it's really important to focus on the profile and how we will be able to derive establishing the brand as the leading agent from the beginning.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowan.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for Elliott. First, will Bristol take an interim look at the PD-1 lung study in 2013? And if so, if you could tell us when in 2013. That would be helpful. And secondly, what is the nature of the dialogue the FDA on ELIQUIS' resubmission? Is there daily discussions? Are any new questions arising? Are any of the questions that are arising requiring clarification or are there no questions? And if so, what does that mean?","Elliott Sigal","Okay, Steve. Taking ELIQUIS first, we typically don't comment on the daily interactions with the FDA. For you, I'll make an exception today. It's -- this is a very good interaction. There are frequent interactions, just for clarification. I do not expect any new questions, as I said before. I feel the answers should be sufficient for a decision and we're moving forward. I just -- I think I'm encouraged that, as I said at the beginning, the FDA has a willingness to work expeditiously with us. With regard to the question on PD-1, as in most Phase III trials, there are interim analyses built in to our squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, as well as non-squamous non-cell lung cancer and the renal trials. The -- I don't have a prediction on when. We usually don't announce the interim studies, but the regulatory pathway for each indication will be determined by the results. I can assure you that we do have an aggressive program to properly qualify this with the feeling that if the data continues to evolve the way it is, it will meet a very important unmet medical need, and there's great enthusiasm in the field as well as in the regulatory agencies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And just to follow-up on Steve's question on PD-1. Elliott, maybe you can just give us your thoughts on the PDUFA 5 and I guess a little bit of the FDA's new breakthrough kind of treatment paradigm, and again, what that might mean as it relates to the need for survival data versus response rate data, specifically in squamous non-small cell lung cancer given the unmet medical need there as it relates to PD-1? And then you guys are making what seems to be unusually strong statements behind the SAVOR study. This is the CV outcome study, obviously. Just can you give us a sense of -- in the meta-analysis, that you've conducted on CV outcomes? Have you actually looked at that on top of statins? And are you seeing a comparable sized effect in the meta-analysis and patients that were also on statins?","Elliott Sigal","Okay, Seamus, I think it's too early for me to be able to comment on how PDUFA 5 will impact practice. I think it is important the way the agency has tried to balance the amount of time allocated, so that we may have more predictability, perhaps more first-cycle approvals at the cost of some, perhaps, less time upfront. I do sense that there's great interest in breakthrough therapies, certainly the oncology division's approvals go forward the PDUFA dates even now would indicate that. And the enthusiasm we see on some of our drugs that offer breakthrough possibilities would confirm that, although one has to wait to see the final profile and the benefit-risk in all these cases. We are making people aware of SAVOR, but there is no new information until we see the results of the Phase III trial. We were encouraged to do long-term cardiovascular assessments initially of new diabetes agents, as you remember, primarily to rule out cardiovascular harm. We took the position that these should be -- it should be done in a way to detect a benefit if there was one. We were struck with the prescribed meta-analysis in our own program to rule out harm that the hazard ratio was very, very favorable for saxagliptin. And we noticed that others have made a similar calculation and the meta-analysis across all, and I would emphasize, short-term trials, is encouraging. So what we have now is a hypothesis. There is biological plausibility that there are other substrates involved that are affected favorably with DPP4 inhibition, but the mechanism should it exist as relatively unclear. The reason we point this out is because we've had a great deal of enthusiasm enrolling this study. We've expanded this study and the timelines have been brought forward by maybe a year and hopefully, we'll see the data in-house the middle of '13.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions here. The first was on ELIQUIS. The roughly 1\/3 of new-to-brand kind of patients who are going to novel agents. Is this in line with where you would've expected share to stand at this point with Xarelto and Pradaxa? And I guess, the question is, are you thus far finding that warfarin stickiness is as expected? Is it stickier? Is it less sticky maybe than you would've expected as you kind of think about this market evolving? The second question, ELIQUIS, there's obviously has been a lot of noise around Pradaxa out there. It's obviously a different mechanism, but do you see any risk that, that noise impacts the uptake of all novel agents, such as the patients are less willing to adopt a new agent because of, again, the noise that's out there? And then the final question is on shifting gears to hep C. The triple combination moving into Phase III in 2014, will that be with a single pill you commented on earlier or is the single pill a future program?","Elliott Sigal","I'll start with hepatitis C. The triple regimen is starting some time in early '14 as of now. It must await expansion of our ongoing Phase II that will give us more safety information on the third component, the NS5B. And it's also affording us the opportunity to do a fixed dose combination, which will be 1 pill, twice a day, and that's what we intend to use in the Phase III studies. On -- on ELIQUIS, Giovanni?","Lamberto Andreotti","Giovanni.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, on ELIQUIS, this is Giovanni. I would say the following. First of all, clearly, we are following -- we followed from the beginning the launch uptake of Pradaxa and Xarelto very carefully. As we've commented several times, there is a need to educate physicians over a period of time when you are changing a practice of medicine that has been established for a very long time, and that clearly has been the case with warfarin. And this is really the reason why you've seen the initial uptake and the reason why the uptake has been primarily in the specialist segment versus primary care physicians at the beginning. When I made the comment about 1\/3 of NBRxs now being having shifted to the new agents, it's also important to remember 2 things: First of all, that percentage continues to grow; and second, that has been really the result primarily of a convenience perception with the new agents. We do have a very differentiated profile. As I mentioned before, efficacy, bleeding, those will be extremely important with the specialists and it will also be important to the primary care physicians. And that's why we see our ability to grow NBRxs and establish ELIQUIS as the leading new agent.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris [Charles] Butler with Barclays.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, it's Tony Butler. Two very brief questions. Elliott, one really on elotuzumab. We've heard some very good information coming out with respect to elotuzumab and multiple myeloma. And I'm curious -- I believe the refractory trial is due to complete enrollment quite soon. Will there be an interim analysis next year? And will we get a readout or when would you expect a readout of that total data? And then finally, for Lamberto, given the delays in ELIQUIS, I'm just curious how you keep the troops of the sales force motivated? Because I might expect that if they felt they would have launched earlier and given the FDA concerns, that's not going to necessarily -- that's not been the case. How do you continue to motivate them through this bit of low period?","Elliott Sigal","Yes, Tony, this is Elliott. I'll take the question on elotuzumab, which is our essentially another immuno-oncology approach, this time, focused on a specific antigen that's relevant to multiple myeloma. We are anxiously awaiting these trials. We're going to have to wait a little longer for the final Phase III, which should come in early 2014 in one study, maybe the second quarter of 2014 in the third study. And these studies involve both relapsed multiple myeloma patients as well as relapsed -- or refractory multiple myeloma patients.","Lamberto Andreotti","So let me take your question on the motivation of the sales force. Everybody at Bristol-Myers Squibb is disappointed because of the delay of ELIQUIS, not only the salesforce. The good thing is the entire company believes in what we are doing, so there is a strong motivation and a strong belief in our strategy and you'll find this throughout the entire corporation, which I find very encouraging and I'm very proud of. The sales force is not idle and Giovanni, you can explain what the ELIQUIS sales force is doing today waiting and be ready for the launch of ELIQUIS.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, we've clearly been training our sales teams. They've been doing business planning and preparation for launch, but we've also been able to leverage the ELIQUIS sales force, particularly in the hospital in support of our diabetes franchise. So they're -- they've been working on our diabetes franchise and they'll be moving to ELIQUIS as soon as we receive approval.","John E. Elicker","Elliott, did you want to follow-up?","Elliott Sigal","Yes, there was a question I didn't fully answer earlier about whether the Pradaxa issues should or will cloud the perception around the 10as. I don't think we should consider these all the same class, they're not. They're not -- they may be oral approaches to anticoagulation, but clearly, there's a 10a class and a Factor IIa class, the thrombin inhibitors. They behave differently preclinically, they behave differently clinically. We chose specifically 10a for the ability to get a wider therapeutic window to get more efficacy and less bleeding. The issues around Pradaxa in terms of GI disturbance have led to about 15% of discontinuations, doesn't exist in the profile that we have. And I think because we went after this mechanism and the BID dose, we have less bleeding than the other agents with more efficacy. And so those are clear differentiating points that I hope we can make clear to the practicing public.","Operator","Last question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess I'll just keep it relatively brief. My questions are for Elliott. Elliott, I was just hoping that you could walk us through what we should expect with respect to PD-1 data disclosures over the next 9 months or so. Will we see any press releases before ASCO? Or is it really going to be sort of the May, June timeframe for the next efficacy updates on PD-1? And then second, with respect to the saxagliptin SAVOR study, typically, we think about cardiovascular trials ending a year early as entailing risk that the active drug and the drug being studied is not successfully keeping people healthier over a longer period of time, but you did increase the size of that study by, I think, about 1\/3. And so anyway, could you just juxtapose those 2 and tell us how we should think about the SAVOR trial?","Elliott Sigal","The SAVOR trial is enrolling well. We had no difficulties. We wanted to increase the targeted enrollments so that we could increase the number of events that we would have over a given period of time and that has resulted in an earlier potential readout. And I won't have any more information to -- other than to repeat that, in the middle of the year, internally, we hope to see the result of that trial. With regard to data flow on PD-1, we've just started our Phase III. I do know, at this point, targeted for ASCO. We will have updated studies that will help characterize even further response and durability from our early studies in multiple tumor types, and we will have a combination data of PD-1 with ipilimumab and melanoma. And at this point, that's, I think, the next data point to think about.","John E. Elicker","Great. Thanks for your questions. Lamberto?","Lamberto Andreotti","Yes, let me close this call saying that, again, this was a challenging quarter for us at Bristol-Myers Squibb, but it's also a quarter that demonstrated our ability and our determination to straight through to our strategy. A quarter that underscored our commitment to building a solid foundation for the future and as such, one that reaffirms my optimism about our future. Okay. Thank you everybody. Thank you.","John E.

Sales were strong across all indications.","From a regulatory perspective, we continue to make progress, mainly the U.S. Opdivo approval in bladder, the Japanese approval in head and neck, and the CHMP positive recommendations for bladder and head and neck in Europe.","We shared important new data from our immuno-oncology portfolio at AACR [American Association of Cancer Research], including overall survival data from Study 67, the TNB analysis from Study 26, and the early data from our IDO inhibitor.","We also advanced our diversified portfolio with encouraging data from our FGF21 for NASH at EASL [European Association for the Study of the Liver], and we will work with the regulatory authorities to initiate a registrational program as soon as possible.","We made significant progress from a business development perspective, investing in translational capabilities through deals like GRAIL and Foundation Medicine and broadening our immuno-oncology clinical development program through agreements to study combination approaches with different mechanisms across a range of tumor.","As I look at the company going forward, I see tremendous opportunity, driven by our industry-leading portfolio and the very best people in the business, all focused on maximizing value for our marketed products and advancing our pipeline.","Certainly, all of you are focused on our I-O portfolio and our lung cancer program in particular. This is a key focus for us as well. The first-line landscape has become very dynamic, and the outlook for this market is continually evolving. Our teams have done a great job maintaining our position, and we believe we have the most comprehensive program in first-line. I'm sure you'll have questions about our development program in lung, but let me just say here that over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see a lot of important data.","But we are not just a lung cancer company. Over the next 12 months, we are also anticipating important data readouts for Opdivo and Yervoy in renal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer. We also have many important opportunities in a range of other tumor types. This is particularly true with respect to our next wave of I-O assets, with 10 new mechanisms in addition to PD-1 and CTLA-4 in clinical development.","During the year, we plan to present additional data from first disclosures for many of our next wave I-O assets, beginning at ASCO, where we will show IDO, GITR, and LAG-3. Tom will speak more about all of this in a moment, underscoring the critical importance of translational medicine to the work we are doing here as well as across our other therapeutic areas.","And we are not just a cancer company. This is clear by Eliquis' continued strong performance in the U.S. and other key markets and by the double-digit growth of Orencia and Sprycel. Eliquis has now exceeded $1 billion in revenue in the quarter and is the leading NOAC in the U.S. based on total prescriptions. And importantly, we are continuing to see warfarin usage decline in terms of new-to-brand scripts, and we expect this trend to continue as the NOAC class expands.","It is also clear by the fact that we will have data to potentially support three registrational starts in the next 12 months in our fibrosis and immuno-science portfolios. Our fibrosis pipeline includes first-in-class and best-in-class opportunities, with a focus on fibrosis of the liver and lung. And we believe our first compound for NASH, PEG-FGF21, has significant potential in an area with great need for new treatments. In immuno-science, we are pursuing novel mechanisms to treat a number of different autoimmune diseases, including lupus, RA, inflammatory bowel disease, Sj\u00f6gren, and others.","Beyond our strong performance and pipeline, we continue to look at a balanced approach to capital allocation as a key part of our strategy. Business development continues to be a priority for us, and we are sourcing external opportunities across the preclinical and clinical areas, as well as building our translational capabilities. Charlie will talk later about our progress in that area during the quarter. All-in-all, I feel really good about the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead.","As John mentioned, we are pleased that Tom has joined our company and is with us here today. Tom brings an important mix of experiences to his new position: his deep scientific expertise as a researcher, having led clinical trial design and drug development, primarily in lung cancer; his work as a practicing physician who has treated thousands of patients; his years of collaboration with academia and the larger scientific community; his leadership experience in large organizations, most recently at MGH, where he gained a deep understanding of the payer environment and the importance of value in ensuring access to medicines for serious diseases; and of course, his work as a member of our board for the past few years. Taken together, Tom has the experience and energy needed to realize the full potential of our pipeline.","Here, let me again express my personal gratitude to Francis Cuss for his more than 13 years with our company. Francis made significant contributions to our R&D organization during a transformative year for Bristol-Myers Squibb, and I couldn't be more grateful.","And with that, I will turn it over to Tom. Thank you.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I'm truly delighted to be joining my first earnings call as Chief Scientific Officer of Bristol-Myers Squibb. As Giovanni mentioned, there is great potential in our pipeline. I knew this from my role on the Board of Directors, and it was the major reason I decided to join the management team.","Our breath, and particularly our depth, in I-O position Bristol-Myers Squibb to make a major difference in how common cancers are treated and even allow us to begin to think about the possibility of cure for many types of cancer. In the short time that I've been in this role, just over six weeks, I've become even more enthusiastic about the opportunity with our pipeline and our people, both within oncology and across our cardiovascular, immuno-science and fibrosis assets.","As I meet with my discovery and development teams here in Princeton, in Redwood City and across the globe, I'm struck that BMS is a company with remarkable R&D talent, particularly in antibody technology, medicinal chemistry, clinical development and in our regulatory operations. This, coupled with the strong integration between R&D and commercial, makes me very optimistic about our ability to execute and to continue to deliver transformational medicines to patients.","As a leader, I have always believed that culture matters. At MGH and at Yale, I worked hard to build a patient-focused research environment. Ever since I joined BMS as a director, I knew the company had a patient-centered focus. But as I've been meeting more and more people in this role, I've been struck by just how patient-focused the mission is here. In every meeting, we hear the patient voice. Our research teams are driven to improve the lives of people with cancer, heart disease, fibrosis and rheumatologic disease.","There are some key capabilities that I will look to build in the coming months. These will focus on three principal areas. First, we will enhance our translational medicine capability. Biomarker development to select the right drug for the right patient at the right time is key.","Second, we will invest in cancer biology. Translational medicine starts with fundamental research. And the scale of our pipeline demands that we have the best understanding that we can of our patients and of their diseases.","Third, we will invest in data and analytics. We are at an inflection point as a society and as an industry. In order to execute our pipeline of about 20 oncology assets, 20 cardiology, immuno-science and fibrosis assets, 15 compounds in pre-clinical development and nearly 80 programs in discovery, we need to enhance our analytic capacity to execute this pipeline with deliberate speed.","In addition to what we do at BMS, we will pursue strategic external collaborations to help meet these needs. Some recent examples include the expansion of our international immuno-oncology network and new collaborations with the Parker Institute, Foundation Medicine, and GRAIL. Working together will enable us to move even faster and to identify patients most likely to benefit from our medicine. This is not just good to do scientifically, but it's good for patients and is what payers and regulators expect.","As a cancer researcher and through my experience running the Massachusetts General Physician Organization, I know that it's impossible for one company or institution to do it all. And given the fast pace of scientific innovation happening today, collaboration across the entire healthcare ecosystem is becoming increasingly important.","In the near term, my most important priorities for the R&D organization include the four areas; first, accelerating the delivery of our next wave of I-O assets like IDO, which we recently presented data on at AACR. We'll also be presenting early results for LAG-3, GITR, and the Incyte IDO at ASCO this year.","Second, understanding the biology of I-O resistance, both intrinsic resistance and acquired, and bringing a laser-like focus to overcoming this. We will focus on expanding into tumor types where I-O hasn't had a broad impact yet, tumors like breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer. We will use our next-wave assets to create options for patients who progress on their initial I-O therapy.","Third, we will continue to develop combination regimens, including I-O\/I-O combinations, I-O\/targeted combinations, and I-O\/chemotherapy combinations where these make sense.","And fourth, we will accelerate the development of our most promising assets in the cardiovascular, immuno-science, and fibrosis pipeline. As Giovanni mentioned, we recently presented promising Phase 2 data on our FGF21 asset in patients with NASH at the International Liver Congress. The results showed an improvement across multiple aspects of NASH, including a significant reduction in liver fat versus placebo. And we look forward to sharing these data with the health authorities.","In closing, BMS has accomplished much in the last five years, but its true impact lies ahead. I'm excited about the opportunities and proud to lead an R&D organization that is focused, science-oriented, and data-driven, and one that is driven to deliver medicines that have the potential to transform the lives of our patients.","I'll now turn it over to Charlie.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone.","As Giovanni described, we delivered very strong financial results for the quarter due to robust performance across our portfolio. Let me provide some color on the performance of our key products.","I'll start with Eliquis, which for the first time sold over $1 billion in a single quarter. In the U.S., Eliquis is now the leading agent in the NOAC class, which continues to grow as warfarin use declines. During the quarter, sales in the U.S. were driven by a sequential 8% increase in TRx and from the positive impact of lower Medicare coverage gaps compared to Q4 of last year. Internationally, Eliquis delivered strong growth of 51% compared to the same time last year, as the gains in established position as the standard of care in stroke reduction for AFib around the world.","Sales for Opdivo in the U.S. increased 6% sequentially, driven by the demand growth that Giovanni described and some favorable inventory movement compared to Q4. We continue to expect our U.S. lung business to be under pressure this year assuming KEYNOTE-021G is approved next month. However, given the stability in second-line lung in Q1 and strong trends we've seen across other indications in our U.S. business, we now believe that there is potential for Opdivo to grow in the U.S. this year compared to 2016.","During Q1, we saw sequential growth in international Opdivo sales when adjusting for the approximately $250 million revenue recognition catch-up for France and Germany we booked in Q4. We successfully negotiated reimbursement for Opdivo in several markets during the quarter, including a pan-tumor agreement in Canada as well as agreements for renal cell cancer and non-squamous-cell lung cancer in Italy. Based on positive sales trends and reimbursement successes, we continue to expect international sales for Opdivo to grow for the full year.","Additionally, we saw Yervoy return to growth in international markets during the quarter, as access and reimbursement approvals for the regimen facilitated greater adoption.","Orencia also delivered double-digit growth, with solid underlying brand trends as we continue our commercial focus on the early rapidly progressing RA patient. U.S. sales in the quarter were up 13% despite unfavorable inventory movement. In addition, as we've seen in other years during Q1, we saw softer demand in the subcu market at the start of the year, which we believe is due to coverage resets early in the year.","Now I'd like to highlight a couple of items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was down 160 basis points compared to the same time last year, driven mainly by product mix, though this was partially offset by FX due to recognition of hedge gains and favorable FX on inventories from Q4. Going forward, we expect the continued strength of Eliquis and decline of our high-margin virology business to pressure our gross margin.","Other income and expense is down by approximately $72 million versus prior year, primarily due to the change in the tiered AZ diabetes royalty rate last year to a flat 12% this year. This was partially offset by our accrual of PD-1 royalties from Merck in Q1 of $30 million.","We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation, with business development remaining a top priority. As Giovanni mentioned, this quarter reflected a significant level of strategic activity to support our immuno-oncology pipeline and translational capabilities. We executed multiple transactions since our last earnings call, spanning investments and collaborations with biotech and academic partners, adding registrational clinical opportunities and capabilities in diagnostic platforms and genomic profiling that strengthened our pipeline and our capabilities in translational medicines.","In addition, we delivered against our new share repurchase authorization with a $2 billion ASR in February, and we plan to begin repurchase activity under a 10b5-1 program once the ASR process completes by the end of the second quarter.","I'll now provide some comments on guidance. Based on our strong performance, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $2.85 to $3.00. As always, this range assumes current foreign exchange rates. We are increasing revenue guidance to the mid-single-digit range due to the strong trends across the business, particularly our key products, Opdivo, Eliquis, and Yervoy. As I mentioned, gross margin saw some FX favorability in Q1. However, at current rates, we expect margins to decline as the year progresses and continue to see our rate in the 72% to 73% range for the year.","For R&D, we are now expecting an increase in the low double-digit range, as we see opportunities for slightly higher investment across our portfolio, including some of the new clinical collaborations I mentioned earlier.","As Giovanni said, we had a very strong quarter from a financial and operational perspective. We continue to pursue important opportunities in our pipeline, both in I-O and in our specialty portfolio, and we are committed to putting resources where we can deliver the greatest value.","Now let me turn it back to John to kick off the Q&A.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Okay. Thanks, Charlie. So we're ready to go to questions, Melody. We can go ahead and start.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to our first caller.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","I think the operator is not going to announce the callers. So once you get prompted, if you can, go ahead and introduce yourself.","Operator","And, caller, your line is open. Please check your mute function. With no response, we'll move to the next caller. Next caller, please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi there. It's Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Can you guys hear me?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","We got you fine, Chris. Thanks.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, perfect, just two questions here, maybe the first one for Giovanni and for Tom, just a question on lung and this ongoing debate around I-O\/I-O versus I-O\/chemo combinations. I think one of your competitors today announced that they're also going to be looking at chemo combos with PD-1 in addition to their I-O\/I-O combos. I'm just interested in your latest thinking on the role you see chemo playing in this I-O landscape relative to CTLA-4 and some of the other next-generation agents you're developing.","My second question was specifically on IDO and just more thoughts there on IDO as a combination agent and your approach to this target as you balance your internal asset versus the external partnership. So just any more color there would be helpful; and maybe as your answering that, just latest timelines on when we could potentially think about that internal asset moving forward into registrational studies. Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Chris. This is Giovanni. Let me just start, and I'll ask Tom to comment on both of your questions. On lung strategy, as you heard from me and Tom, we are very comfortable with the fact that we have a very broad approach to first-line lung cancer, a very broad program. We are indeed investigating various treatment modalities, including I-O\/I-O, I-O\/chemo, and as you know, potentially the combination of the two approaches with I-O\/I-O coupled with chemotherapy. And I am pleased that over just a few months, we have been able to evolve our lung cancer program, taking advantage of ongoing studies and that enrollment has progressed I would say very much in line with our expectations.","With respect to IDO, the one thing I would say at a very high strategic level is that we see really promising modalities. I think the ability to complement external collaborations as we advance internal programs provide, again, in the same spirit, a very broad set of options for us in order to be competitive from a timing perspective at the same time as we develop potentially best-in-class.","But let me ask Tom to give you his comments on both.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Chris, thank you for your questions. And I just want to start by saying lung cancer is a really hard disease to treat. And you don't need to go any further than this morning's New England Journal, the paper by Charlie Swanton's group, looking at the genomic diversity of this disease, both within tumors and between tumors. It's a tough disease to treat. And we believe it's important for us to have multiple approaches to treating patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.","We think the approach at Bristol-Myers Squibb that includes I-O\/I-O and I-O\/chemo and I-O\/targeted drugs gives us a broad and diverse and balanced approach to how we're going to go after lung cancer. And I think that there may well be certain patients that are going to benefit from I-O monotherapy, I-O\/I-O, and I-O\/chemotherapy. I don't think there will be a one-size-fits-all approach to this disease.","I want to comment on CTLA-4 and how important a target this is in lung cancer and other cancers as well. CTLA-4 I think has been validated as an important partner with Opdivo. Just look at our data in melanoma and the 067 study, which showed that we actually have a survival advantage, the only I-O\/I-O combination that's been shown to have a survival advantage. And we think CTLA-4 matters in this disease and requires investigation.","I think just to show you how deep our commitment to CTLA-4 is as an agent, we have two additional compounds with CTLA-4 that we're developing as targets. The first is the non-topopulated (25:55) CTLA-4, which has now entered into clinical study. There's a trial that we describe on ClinicalTrials.gov that you can take a look at. And our relationship with CytomX has developed the CTLA-4 compound as a Probody that we think might have a different toxicity profile with this agent. So we believe it's important for Bristol-Myers Squibb to be looking at CTLA-4 as an important target.","Now, that doesn't mean that next-gen agents aren't important. And you mentioned IDO. This is target that Bristol-Myers Squibb is intimately involved with in two ways. Last year, we went out and we purchased Flexus and we acquired the IDO compound. And at ASCO, we presented data on our IDO with Opdivo, which we think gives us a compound that may be differentiating. It gives us a PKBD (26:47) profile that may well describe an opportunity for us to have a unique place in the marketplace.","And this year at ASCO, you're going to see data on the Incyte IDO along with Opdivo in important settings. And we plan by the end of this year to begin randomized Phase 3 trials of the Incyte IDO with Opdivo in lung, head and neck, and melanoma.","So, Chris, I think it's important to say that we're committed to CTLA-4, and we also think that IDO and our next-gen agents are also important to develop in lung cancer. It's a complex marketplace, and we need to develop the right drugs for a very broad and diverse group of patients.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Chris, for the question. Melody, can we go back to the first group in the queue? I got an email from the team at Barclays saying that they were having trouble recognizing that they were up. So I don't know if it's Geoff Meacham or Paul Choi, but could you go to them please again?","Operator","Yes, definitely. Just one moment. And, Mr. Meacham, your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. So thanks a lot for the question. It seems the biggest opportunity longer term in I-O is really the cold tumors, breast, ovarian, colon, et cetera. To follow up on the earlier comment, CTLA-4 combos, do you guys feel, at this point, CTLA-4 combos plus a PD-L1 is going to be a component of that? Are there other targets across the I-O landscape and many different targets that look more viable in cold tumors versus hot? Thank you.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Geoff, thanks for your question. I think this echoes what I mentioned earlier, the concept of looking at resistance. Resistance is incredibly important, and it's really characterized a lot of oncology drug development. Just looking at where your drugs don't work tells you as much as you learn from looking where your drugs do work. What I explained earlier and outlined is the two areas I'm most worried about in terms of resistance \u2013 or think of as actually opportunities is what about the cold tumors that don't respond, and then what about the patients who have initial response to anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapy who then progress?","Now, as you know, we have 10 targets in I-O that we're working on and 12 agents in those 10 targets. So we think we have multiple opportunities to look at combinations of I-O\/I-O agents in these cold tumors. We presented data with our IDO asset, as you mentioned, and we also will be presenting initial data at ASCO this year with our GITR compound, which could be the type of agent that might play a role in the cold tumor space. But we will increasingly look at combinations of agents in that setting that might make a difference.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Geoff. Melody, can we go to the next question? And if you have it in front of you, could you announce them on the line so that they know that they're ready to go? Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you for that double prompt. Maybe, Tom, here's an opportunity for you to straighten us out of the timing of 227, whether it's final or interim, that would be helpful. And curious, Tom, if you have a view on whether PD-1s and PD-L1s can be different from one another other than by trial design strategy.","And one for Giovanni real quick. In light of the activist investor interest and significant change in the board, curious if you can comment on what's changed in terms of how you're spending your time, the company strategy, options you're exploring to enhance value. Or do you see this as business as usual stuff? Thanks.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Gregg, thank you for your questions. I'll start off by commenting on the timing of 227. As we have published on ClinicalTrials.gov, we expect the data from 227 to report in the first half of 2018. And as we also have announced, there will be an interim look. And we'll look at that data with our data safety monitoring committee as the data matures. But we expect the data to be the first half of 2018.","So the second question comes down to differences and similarities between PD-1 drugs. And I think my feeling is that I think there's highly likely to be much more similar between these drugs than there are going to be differences. Now we know, for example, that pembro [pembrolizumab] and nivo [nivolumab] recognize slightly different epitopes and there are slight differences in these compounds. But clinically when you look at the totality of the data, they really behave fairly similarly to each other. So I actually don't think we're going to find enormous differences between the various different PD-1 drugs.","Now the difference between PD-1 and PD-L1 agents, certainly there's a possibility that there will be more information. We're looking out on that, and I remain open to looking at the data as it emerges across that area. Giovanni?","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Gregg, thank you. So from my perspective, let me say that I'm really very happy with the ability that we have to have broadened and strengthened the capabilities on the board. That's clearly very important for a company like ours.","With respect to what our priorities are, they really have not changed. We are, as you have seen today, extremely focused on continuing to execute as well as we have for the short term. And we are extremely focused and I am extremely focused on delivering the value of an extraordinarily promising pipeline, which is probably the broadest and the deepest the company has had. So that's where we are spending our time. Those are our priorities, and clearly they are mine as well.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Gregg. Melody, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Certainly, we'll go to Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities.","Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. Thank you very much, two brief questions. One, if I may around Eliquis, tremendous number for the quarter, but the COMPASS data will read out later this year at European Heart [ESC]. And I'm curious if it does possibly have an effect on the NOAC class as a whole. Or could it be viewed somewhat negatively for Eliquis at least in CAD\/PAD? And that is does the class actually increase, or is this just dependent upon \u2013 or do we single out rivaroxaban?","And then secondly, Charlie, an excellent gross margin quarter, but the question really is, how should we think about that going forward in the year? They bounce around little bit, at least they had last year. This is clearly a change from what we've seen in the last two years. Thanks for the time.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Tony. It's Murdo here. I'll address the Eliquis question and pass it over to Charlie for your second part. First off, we're really pleased with the Eliquis performance in the quarter and continuing what was a great year last year. As Giovanni mentioned, total prescriptions, now we're in a leadership position in the NOAC class. And we continue to feel good about growth based on leading indicators that we look at in the market, which are NBRx trends as well as our cardiology trends. We're also seeing strong performance across the rest of the world.","Now as I think about the COMPASS trial, it's actually an interesting question. And obviously, without data, it's hard to speculate. What I do see happening though is a continued strength of our profile and the divided daily dose of Eliquis in atrial fibrillation and VTE. What we need to wait to see is the quality of the COMPASS data at a different dose that Xarelto used in that trial versus the dose that they currently use in VTE and in atrial fibrillation. So it's hard to compare the COMPASS data to any of the data that exist already in the marketplace.","And then the other question remains is what's the utility of a NOAC versus antiplatelet drugs in the patient population that was studied in the COMPASS trial? So I probably have some more questions related to that trial than I have answers, but we do not see it impacting our AF and VTE business going forward.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Hey, Tony, it's Charlie. Let me address your margin question. As you know, our gross margin is heavily influenced by product mix, with Eliquis, given the structure of our relationship with Pfizer, having a lower than 50% margin. So the growth of Eliquis with the loss of our higher-margin virology business has put pressure on our gross margin. So the uptick that we saw in the first quarter is almost solely due to foreign exchange when we think about it exiting out of the fourth quarter of last year, and that's more of a one-time impact that we see in the first quarter and not really repeating for the balance of the year.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Tony. Melody, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. We'll go to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Yes, Seamus, we've got you.","Seamus Fernandez - Leerink Partners LLC","All right, great, so a couple of quick questions. Can you guys talk a little bit about how in the wake of the settlement with Merck, how you plan to prosecute your rights around the patent estate that you've built up around PD-1? Obviously, it was successful with Merck, but they had a different time-to-market and there are many, many other PD-1s out there. So just wondering how aggressive you feel that you can be as a company, or if you think that that's not a value-added strategy.","And the second question really is, I look at the trends on Eliquis and the still overall market opportunity with the substantial amount of warfarin out there. This feels like it could be well more than a $10 billion category. In fact, Eliquis may have an awful lot of runway ahead of it, particularly given your opportunity to extend the patent. So I just wanted to get a better sense of how much incremental opportunity you think there really is to grow the category in the U.S. and internationally. Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Seamus. This is Giovanni. So let me start, and then I'll ask Murdo to give you his comments on Eliquis. So first on the settlement with Merck, we think that is an extremely important recognition the strength of our IP estate with respect to immuno-oncology and PD-1s. And I think that settlement is critically important, but also it reinforces our perspective that we will continue to vigorously defend our IP across the board, and that clearly is a priority for the company. It has not changed. If anything, it actually has become stronger post the settlement with Merck.","Let me just also say that we also are very focused on Eliquis, and we agree with the significant long-term potential there is in this market. And I'll ask Murdo to comment on that. Obviously, before I do that, let me just get back to the IP. It's clearly an important priority for us. It's also one that we share with our partner, Ono, and we are working very closely with Ono on any IP-related issue. Murdo, on Eliquis?","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Giovanni. Thanks, Seamus. We're also, as Giovanni said, we're very enthusiastic about the trajectory of Eliquis so far, and we're working closely with our partners at Pfizer to capitalize on the untapped opportunity that still exists in the market. As you mentioned, over half of the TRx business is still a warfarin-based treatment patient population. And if you look at the leading indicators, new-to-brand shares, warfarin is about 27% of the OAC [Oral Anti-Coagulant], so still a good delta to capitalize on in terms of leading indicators. We continue to invest appropriately in Eliquis.","The other thing I would mention is, outside of the U.S., in some markets around the world, the NOAC class is even more underpenetrated in the market. So when you combine the U.S. opportunity and the European opportunities, we continue to feel that there's a large growth trajectory and a high ceiling for that brand.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Seamus. Melody, could we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. We'll go to Tim Anderson with Bernstein.","Timothy Minton Anderson - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. A couple of questions. If I look at the totality of things that have happened over the last call it six months, including programs you've advanced like IDO and chemo combo and backup CTLA-4s and other things like that, a bear's point of view could say that this foretells problems with Yervoy and Opdivo, specifically in front-line lung. So my question is can you say you're as confident as ever in the possibility that CheckMate-227 is going to deliver the goods in this regard in front-line lung, or is it fair to say that Bristol's internal confidence in this is less than what it was perhaps a year ago?","And then the second question is still on CheckMate-227. There have been some rumblings about additional changes potentially to the construct of that trial above and beyond what you talked about earlier. I'm wondering if you can just clarify whether any of this is correct since the latest updates that we've had. And this includes things like expanding various arms to new subgroups and timelines for readouts and sizing up the trial and that sort of thing.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Tim, thank you. This is Giovanni. Let me just start. So obviously, a lot has happened in the last 6 to 12 months in first-line lung cancer. As I said earlier and Tom reiterated, this is a very difficult disease to treat. It has evolved very rapidly. You just think of the data that was released in the last 12 months, and it's clear that our competitive position has changed and continues to evolve. My perspective is that today we have the broadest program for first-line development for our immuno-oncology portfolio in lung, and we are extremely focused on executing that program. Execution is on track, and I'll let Tom answer you with respect to study design.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And, Tim, thanks for your question. I think a couple things to say. I think the first is that again, just emphasizing how complex and difficult a disease lung cancer is to treat, it's highly unlikely that there's going to be one approach that's going to fit every patient who presents in first-line. We believe strongly that Yervoy\/Opdivo is certainly one of the options that needs to be pursued and developed, and we're looking at that in first-line lung cancer. And we're also looking at it in the setting of what appropriate biomarkers might be important in evaluating the potential for this combination and for really all of our drugs in first-line lung cancer. So I think that's important to emphasize.","The second question you asked was about changes to CheckMate-227, and there have been no changes to CheckMate-227. The design is the same design as it was the last time it was discussed.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks for the questions, Tim. Can we go to the next question please, Melody?","Operator","Yes, we'll go to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, a couple questions, and maybe, Murdo, you can answer this first. CheckMate-067 at AACR generated more questions about the combo than answers. Do you see the results leading to an increase in market share for the combo in melanoma or a decrease? And following up on data that came out at AACR, there was an interesting study that showed high tumor burden as a marker of success for PD-L1. I just was wondering if you were able to adjust CheckMate-227 to account for this new learning, if at all.","And then lastly for you, Tom, and I appreciate your introductory commentary on your priorities. That's very helpful. Just wondering though, you have been on the board for two, three years, and I appreciate you've only been in this position for a couple months, but just curious to know what sort of changes you have thought about putting in place. What are you planning to do differently compared to the former head of R&D? For example, are there plans to change the way that you go about study designs?","I think initially Bristol's focus had been on creating high-value trials showing overall survival. Those trials certainly make a lot of sense, but not when your competitors are trying to beat you to the market. So I'm just wondering if you are changing the way you approach some of these clinical trial designs. Do you have the right people in place? Do you have the right regulatory people in place just compared to where the priorities were before? Thanks very much.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Jami. Murdo, why don't you start?","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Sure, thanks for the question, Jami. On CheckMate-067, first off, I thought Dr. Larkin did a great job presenting these important data from CheckMate-067. And as Tom mentioned, the first overall survival data set we have with an I-O\/I-O combination. We have been out, obviously, getting feedback from customers in the U.S. and around the world. And I would say that the data have largely been viewed positively as confirmation of the effectiveness of Opdivo plus Yervoy in this patient population.","I would agree with you; there are more questions that still people have because everybody is trying to segment patients in first-line metastatic melanoma. And we continue to work with physicians and investigators on the trial to answer those questions as best we can. I will say, for those physicians who have used the regimen and continue to believe that they're getting the best results possible in terms of response rates or overall survival in metastatic melanoma, this data set confirmed that belief.","I would say for those physicians that were skeptical or overly concerned about the toxicities, and the toxicities are significant, we recognize that, but we're able to help most experienced treaters through the toxicities and we're able to help them also discuss them with their patients. For some of those physicians that remain, I would say, still concerned about the balance of efficacy and safety, particularly in the high expressers.","Now, there are other descriptive analyses that have been completed. And I will remind you, obviously, it's hard to compare the active treatment of the combination to PD-1 monotherapy because the study wasn't powered to do that. So people are inferring from the data set certain things that we've yet to statistically prove. But we have seen also some good descriptive results in BRAF mutant patients where the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy looks particularly good. So there's a lot still to unfold here. But nonetheless, my summary to all of that is net positive. Thank you.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Jami, Tom Lynch here. So a couple things. First, you have two questions I'll address. One is the mutational burden question. The second are the changes within the R&D organization.","So regarding mutational burden. I think this is a great example of data that we're very excited about. As you know, when we went back and looked at 026 and we found that when we stratified patients by mutational burden, we saw that the response rate was superior for nivolumab versus chemotherapy. But it's early data and it's going to require confirmation in larger data sets and it's going to require more evaluation to have a sense of what its ultimate role is.","And what I really want to stress is how difficult it is to develop the appropriate biomarkers. And just think about a drug like trastuzumab. And when we started developing trastuzumab, we thought that expression of immunohistochemistry of HER-2 was going to be the ultimate marker. It turned out to be HER-2 amplification that was the marker.","Think about the development of erlotinib and gefitinib. We thought it might be expression by IHC. We then thought it was going to be amplification. It turns out it was EGFR mutation that was the most important. And then also think about siltuximab and its development in colorectal cancer. It wasn't EGFR expression, it turned out to be RAS mutation. So these are all very complex areas that require a very committed and disciplined approach to biomarker development.","So the second question you asked comes down to the changes within R&D. I want to just start off by saying, and I emphasize what I said in my opening remarks, is that the quality and depth of the people and the talent at Bristol-Myers Squibb in R&D I think is exceptional. We have 11 approvals in two years of I-O agents. That is an extraordinary track record. I think the execution of our regulatory team in particular is one that is beyond reproach. And I would say, I tell Giovanni, I said this is an example, I said, of the kind of execution even Tom Brady would be impressed with.","However, what are our opportunities for moving forward and thinking about how we can do even better? And that's really where I think we have a couple of key priorities. The first is we've got to execute our pipeline. We've got to develop our next-generation drugs. And to do that, we're going to need to invest in tumor biology and translational medicine as well as data and analytics. The pipeline is not going to develop itself. It's going to need us to look at the totality of what we have and understand the best combinations to put together. And I think that's going to be a very important part of what we are going to do. So, again, translational medicine, investing in more cancer biology.","And then, again, I keep coming back to the data and analytics piece and our relationships with GRAIL and Flatiron and looking at how can we look at a complex portfolio, not just in cancer, but also immuno-science, fibrosis and cardiology, to be able to execute this pipeline in a reasonable timeframe.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks Jami. Melody, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. We'll go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. Sorry if I missed this earlier. But was there any inventory or deferred revenue impact on your I-O franchise, particularly in Yervoy? I'm just following up on an earlier question. How should we think about the patent life for Eliquis in major markets? Thank you.","Charles A. Bancroft - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","This is Charlie. As I mentioned in my comments, in the fourth quarter of last year, we booked the deferral that we had on our books from France and Germany. That equaled about $250 million. So that happened. When you look fourth quarter versus first quarter, we did have that one recognition last year. We did see some slight inventory builds for both Opdivo and Yervoy in the U.S. Opdivo was about $30 million, and for Yervoy about $20 million.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","And with respect to your question on Eliquis patents, so our composition of matter patent expires February 2023. We have a pending request for restoration of patent terms, which goes until November of 2026.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Alex. Melody, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Dave?","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry, I was on mute. My apologies. So I have a few questions for Tom, please. And congratulations on your new role, Tom. With respect to the first one, that is Opdivo's chemo lead-in strategy to enhance Opdivo's performance in lung cancer is something new. Could you talk about that a little bit more?","And then second, with respect to the forthcoming MYSTIC trial readout this summer, I guess what would you focus Bristol-Myers investors on when we're looking at those MYSTIC study results and thinking about cross-trial implications for CheckMate-227?","And then finally, I think you had mentioned that in the first half of 2018 you'll have the CheckMate-227 results. But CheckMate-227 is a very complex study with three segments. Do you expect all three segments to be reporting in the first half of 2018? And also, what is the interim look in the fourth quarter of this year? Is that just in the positive cohort? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, David. Let me just start by giving you our perspective with respect to your question on MYSTIC. And as we've commented before, these are different trials with different molecules and different study design. We've actually I believe really worked hard to optimize dosing and schedule. So it's very difficult to really speculate on any implications on the results of one study versus the other. Now I'll ask Tom to answer your question with respect to chemotherapy and then provide some context on timing for CheckMate-227.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Dave. So regarding the rationale for looking at Opdivo in chemotherapy, I like to think that there might be two ways that this could be helping in this. As you know, chemotherapy has been the backbone of how we've treated lung cancer for the past 30 years. And in studies, and again it's not just with I-O, but it's also looking at targeted agents. There may be a rationale for the fact that the rapid progressors might be better suited by getting chemotherapy on board early, that there may be some rationale for that. The second thought is perhaps the addition of chemotherapy to I-O agents could help to create a more favorable environment for immune recognition and activation of the immune system.","So I think there are good rationales for looking at chemotherapy with Opdivo, and I think one of the things that we're very interested in is how the combination of Opdivo, Yervoy, and chemotherapy performs. And we'll be looking at that quad combination to see where that might fit into the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.","Regarding the timelines, obviously, these patients were accrued to the different portions of the trial at different times. I don't anticipate that we would have all of the data in the first half of 2018. As you know, this is an event-driven world that we live in, in these trials and that we're going to need to see how the data matures. But we do hope to have the first data in CheckMate-227 at that point. Thanks.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Dave. Melody, can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","We'll go to Andrew Baum with Citi.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you, a couple of questions, please. Just continuing on the theme of chemo at your CheckMate-568 trial, if I were to ask you whether your intended rationale by combining chemo with dual checkpoint blockade is simply addition or some form of immunopotentiation, I'd be interested in your current thesis.","Second, you mentioned Charlie Swanton's papers recently published, where he clearly showed that chemo increases subclonality, and thus may actually impair subsequent long-term outcomes arguing against increasing chemo as first-line. Do you think there is merit to that hypothesis?","And then finally, I noted you had started a fairly substantial Phase 1 trial with your next-generation CTLA-4. I know you consolidated serum (56:11), presumably enhanced T-REG depletion. I know that that mechanism has been downplayed by Bristol as being contributing to Yervoy's efficacy. I'm just interested in whether there's a rethink of that and obviously the implications given the other CTLA-4 molecule in Phase 3 trials. Thank you.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, Andrew, thank you for your questions. I'll break them down into the three parts. The first is the rationale behind CheckMate-568, whether it's due to addition basically of the two mechanisms versus whether it might be more immunostimulatory. Again, I think that there might well be arguments you can make in both respects, and I keep an open mind to both of those. And I indicated that in response to Dave's question earlier. So I actually don't know which of those two is going to turn out to be most important.","I think again with regard to Charlie's work on the complexity, the genomic complexity and heterogeneity within tumors, I do think we need additional time to see how this plays out in terms of understanding how this impacts the therapeutic classes that we use. And again, I await the collaborations that we'll be doing to look at those endpoints.","And finally on CTLA-4 and our next-gen areas, I think that T-REG depletion still is a valid endpoint in developing I-O agents. Whether it's the principal activity of CTLA-4 or not I think is something that is an open question. But among our agents that we're developing in I-O, we have multiple drugs that we think have as part of their mechanism depletion of T-REGs. So I do think that there is potential for T-REG depletion to be important in the activity of I-O agents in our next-gen compounds as we bring them forward.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, Andrew. Melody, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","We'll go to John Boris with SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on your new role, Tom. First question for Murdo, just if you look at Opdivo's use currently, what percent is coming from lung, melanoma, renal, and if we can get a split in lung, in particular in first-line versus other line use in the U.S.?","The second question has to do with the use of the diagnostic for PD-L1 testing. It seems as though many centers have gone to an exclusive use of testing, and a very high percentage of the centers are now testing. Just any thoughts on how that may shape the landscape, especially as Merck is attempting to pivot into first-line lung use?","And then third and final question on the FGF21, just your thoughts, Tom, around single-agent use in fibrosis and NASH versus combination use. So one of the major competitors that has farnesoid X antagonists has certainly moved very aggressively on developing relationships and combination relationships with both the Tobira and Addis assets to maximize efficacy in this area. Just your thoughts and your openness on the importance of combination relative to single-agent therapy would be helpful.","Murdo Gordon - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","John, I'll address your question on testing first. Basically, what we're seeing in first-line is about 80% of patients are receiving a PD-L1 test. It is becoming, I think as you mentioned, a standard practice, and we continue to feel that that will happen in markets outside the U.S. as well as testing proliferates. So all new early diagnosed first-line lung cancer patients will have a PD-L1 result.","In terms of Opdivo use overall, we've been very pleased. I think the team in the U.S. as well as the teams around the world have done a great job both defending competitively as well as establishing the launch trajectory of Opdivo. And right now in the U.S., about 55% to 65% of our total business is in lung, all lines and non-small-cell lung cancer all lines. And when you go worldwide it's higher than that given that we have a significantly lead over Keytruda.","Thomas James Lynch - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","So, John, thank you for your questions about FGF21. I'd be delighted to have a chance to offer some thoughts on this. We're very excited about FGF21 because it's the first of our agents to come forward from looking at fibrosis and NASH, and we think this drug has a number of favorable features about it. It impacts the metabolic drivers, fat accumulation. It has anti-inflammatory properties, and we also believe it's going to impact fibrosis within the liver itself.","And when you think about the kinds of patients who get NASH, these are patients who are dealing with obesity, patients who are dealing often with diabetes, metabolic syndrome. It's a difficult group of patients to treat. And so how we develop these drugs, whether they're single agents or combinations, I think a key look at side effect profiles, at lipid profiles, at making sure that we're able to achieve endpoints that are meaningful, meaning reduction in fibrosis ultimately, I think will be the ultimate goal.","Whether it's a single agent or combination, I obviously remain open to both opportunities. I think there are reasons to think our drug might work as a single agent. However, I think it would be important for us to also consider what combination therapy in the future might look like in this setting. It's an important unmet medical need that we are very happy to be able to offer some options for.","Giovanni Caforio - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thank you, Tom. Again, we are in a very strong position financially, commercially, clinically, and I believe we are well positioned to continue to grow the company and play an even more important role in the lives of our patients. Thanks, everyone.","John E. Elicker - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.","Thanks, everybody. This concludes our call. As always, if you have any follow-ups, give us a call or shoot us an email.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","John Elicker","Good morning, Anna, and thanks everybody for joining us today as we talk about our quarter, and importantly the outlook for 2020 and beyond. I'll take care of the legal requirements, before I turn it over to Giovanni. Both Giovanni and David Elkins, our CFO will have prepared remarks. And then joining us for Q&A, as well are Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Development; Chris Boerner, Chief Commercialization Officer; and Nadim Ahmed, our President of the Hematology business.","During the call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.","We will also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website. And just to remind everybody in case you haven't seen them there are slides to go along with today's call.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Giovanni.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. I am pleased to be here today to discuss the earning results of our new company for the first time.","On slide 4, let me start by reminding you who the new Bristol-Myers Squibb is today. Our mission hasn't changed. We are focused on discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines that help patients living with serious diseases. We aspire to be the leading biopharma company in the industry. Our strategic foundation remains centered on combining the scale and resources of a pharma company with the agility and speed of a biotech. I am proud of the strength and talent of our people, who are focused on transforming patients lives through science.","Moving to slide 5, I am more encouraged about our company's potential today than I was a year ago. The strength of our performance in 2019 has positioned us very well for the future. As I look at 2019, we've delivered strong in-line performance across our businesses and geographies, and we've made important progress on our late-stage pipeline.","I'm pleased with how integration is going so far, with good progress across our business units and functions, as we remain on track to deliver $2.5 billion in synergies. Of course, we have more work to do to integrate our processes systems and platforms, including IT pricing and accounting. Based on what I've seen to-date, I'm confident about the successful integration of our company.","Turning to our financial outlook, I feel really good about the financial strength of the company. Our guidance reflects the earnings power and significant EPS growth outlook that we have as a company. We continue to see potential for significant cash flows to support debt reduction and continued investment in innovation.","Finally, as I look forward, we have an unprecedented number of new drug launches in the near-term horizon. These are all either first-in-class and\/or best-in-class medicines, and I am very encouraged by how prepared our teams are to maximize these launch opportunities.","Now, let's move to the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 6, I'll give you my perspective before David provides more color on product performance. We've delivered strong growth across multiple key brands many with double-digit growth. With respect to the I-O franchise, I'm pleased with the excellent work of our teams in this area.","Opdivo grew on a full year basis. And though we are seeing some pressure in the U.S. as expected, we saw growth internationally and continue to view 2020 as a year of transition for the brand.","Looking forward, we have the potential for new launches supporting an expected return to growth in 2021. This includes first-line lung cancer, which studies 227 and 9LA, our first line renal cancer opportunity with 9ER and moving into earlier-stage disease with a number of adjuvant opportunities.","Regarding lung cancer, let me talk briefly about Study -227. While we're disappointed by the position taken by the CHMP, we continue to view the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy as a differentiated regimen with the potential for long-term survival and one that should be available to patients globally.","Going forward we continue to focus on the review of Study -227 in the U.S. where it was granted priority with a PDUFA date in May, as well as the filing on -- of 9LA in the U.S. and globally.","In summary, I am very encouraged by the strength of commercial execution across the enterprise in oncology, hematology, cardiovascular and immunoscience. This is a clear demonstration of our leading commercial capabilities, which will be important to deliver on the exciting potential near-term launch opportunities ahead.","Now let's turn to slide 7. In December, we attended our first medical meeting as a combined company at the American Society of Hematology just a few weeks after we closed the Celgene transaction. Importantly, we saw very good data at ASH for our hematology pipeline including pivotal data for three products, which are potentially approaching launch and encouraging data from the early pipeline. I believe that this reinforces the opportunity we have to broaden the hematology portfolio and sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma.","Let's turn to slide 8. I feel good about the earnings power and growth outlook for the company moving forward. I am encouraged by the financial strength of the company this year. We see significant non-GAAP EPS growth from this year into next year and we project continued non-GAAP EPS growth into 2022 though this will be moderated by the impact of generics on Revlimid. David will provide more details on this guidance but I am pleased with the strength of our in-line business, our launch opportunities, our financial flexibility and the breadth of our pipeline.","And with respect to our launch opportunities, we expect important potential milestones over just the next few months; in March, the U.S. approval of ozanimod in multiple sclerosis; in April, the expansion of Reblozyl in MDS; in May, the U.S. approval of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer.","Additionally, we continue to advance our regulatory filings for liso-cel, ide-cel and CC-486. Taken together, the company is in a strong position and this is reflected in the performance of our business and the outlook we are providing today.","Turning to slide 9, to realize our potential, we will continue to deliver on the in-line business, drive integration and synergy capture, maximize the value of our launch opportunities and advance our pipeline. Beyond this, I continue to be encouraged by our financial strength and flexibility and how this enables us to continue to invest in innovation to deliver important medicines for patients.","All of this is what gives me confidence in our near and long-term opportunities as a company. I'm looking forward to our Investor Day, which will be held on April 2nd in New York City when my team and I will be able to talk in greater detail about the many opportunities ahead of us.","Speaking of my team, I am very pleased to be joined today by David Elkins and Nadim Ahmed. Welcome to both.","At this point, I will hand it over to David, our new CFO to walk you through the financials. David?","David Elkins","Thank you, Giovanni, and good morning, everyone. Having benefited from working in this industry for over 20 years, I could not be more excited about the growth potential and earnings power of bringing these two companies together. I've been very impressed by the employees of the combined company. I'm encouraged by the breadth of opportunities we have ahead and our ability to deliver important new medicines to patients.","Now let's turn our focus to the performance in 2019. To start, the business continued to deliver strong performance in the fourth quarter with 6% revenue growth on a pro forma basis. This performance serves as a strong foundation for the future outlook of the company, which we will cover in a moment. Giovanni gave you some brand insights, but let me provide you with additional color on the underlying performance of the business.","Beginning with Opdivo on slide 11, we had continued strong commercial excellence in the quarter where our teams continue to operate very well in increasingly competitive markets. Let me provide you with a perspective on how we see the business at the moment.","From a U.S. demand perspective, we are seeing sequential low single-digit decline driven by the headwinds we've described in the past. Note that demand trends are more steady than reported sales, which were incrementally impacted by buying patterns both in the government channel and from wholesalers.","Now with respect to some key indications, we expect steady performance in our melanoma business driven by our leadership in both metastatic and adjuvant setting. In non-small cell lung cancer, the size of the eligible pool of second-line patients is leveling off at roughly one-third. In first-line RCC space, we continue to perform well where Opdivo-Yervoy remains the standard of care in intermediate and poor-risk patients and we've seen stabilization in this indication as well.","Internationally, we've seen very strong commercial execution in all our key markets, resulting in encouraging growth in the brand. We expect further growth as we continue to secure reimbursement in first-line RCC. With respect to first-line lung, we look forward to the opportunity to launch 9LA in the same setting and making Opdivo available for patients in these markets.","So stepping back, we continue to see 2020 as a transition year for Opdivo, with demand pressures in the U.S. and growth in our international business. More importantly, as we move into 2021, we believe we have a strong foundation for growth fueled by potential new indications including first-line lung.","Now let's turn to Eliquis on slide 12. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued strong sales growth of 19% globally due to increased demand in both AFib and VTE. In the U.S., we saw 18% sales growth in the fourth quarter versus prior year, despite increased discounts for the Medicare coverage gap.","Eliquis continues to increase its share at the expense of Warfarin and an expanding NOAC class. As the class has expanded, we've seen Eliquis taking share at the expense of other NOACs. Shown on this slide is the difference between new brand share and total brand share in the U.S. for both Warfarin and Eliquis. This highlights the continued growth opportunity for the class and the brand.","We are also very pleased with the growth of Eliquis internationally, where we have a leading share in a growing number of markets resulting in 21% sales growth in Q4 versus the same quarter last year. We continue to view this brand, which remains the number one NOAC globally as one positioned for significant future growth and continued opportunity for patients.","We also see strong growth in our multiple myeloma franchise. As you will see on slide 13, Revlimid continued to grow in the fourth quarter, driven by triplet regimens and increased treatment duration increasing 10% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Pomalyst saw significant growth of 23% in Q4 versus last year on a pro forma basis, driven by increased demand and duration of therapy. We expect growth to continue across both brands due to increased adoption of the triplet regimens and increased duration of treatment.","I'll now turn to slide 14 and review our fourth quarter P&L. This was an unusual quarter for the company as a result of the close of the Celgene acquisition on November 20. Included on our reported P&L are the approximately six weeks of results from its legacy Celgene business post the transaction close.","As it relates to the non-GAAP P&L, we now include the impact of stock-based compensation in our operating expense, which was previously specified for Celgene when it was a stand-alone company. With respect to OI&E since the close of the transaction, we have incorporated both the interest expense on legacy Celgene debt and have begun recognizing interest expense on acquisition financing that had previously been specified since its issuance last May. Also, our Q4 tax rate was primarily impacted by several one-time favorable items including the resolution of uncertain tax provision and provision adjustments for filings in the U.S. and other markets.","Looking to 2020 from a financial perspective on slide 15, we provided guidance reflecting the strength and momentum in the business, plus our new launch products and indications and the realization of synergies. First, it's important to note that our guidance on non-GAAP earnings per share reflects the expected 40% accretion to the BMS standalone P&L and includes significantly higher operating margins than in the past.","Given the unique circumstances as a new company this year's guidance includes more detail than we typically provide. So, let me provide some color on the key line items.","Revenue represents growth on a pro forma basis driven by opportunities we see in our prioritized portfolio, more than offsetting declines in our established brands. We expect a continued decline in established brand portfolio due to strategic course choices and competitive dynamics.","First, we expect BARACLUDE to continue to decline based on the maturity of that drug and generic competition. We expect VIDAZA will be impacted in 2020 by generics in Europe. And we expect the rest of the established brands portfolio to decrease by about one-third compared to the 2019 pro forma results. This is driven by the full year impact of the OTEZLA divestiture as well as further generic erosion of the HIV portfolio.","OI&E includes incremental interest expense offset by royalties. From an interest perspective in our non-GAAP P&L, interest expense will be driven by approximately $45 billion of debt at a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%. Note that royalties from the AstraZeneca are stepping up in 2020 and we also expect higher royalties on our PD-1 patents. Altogether we expect royalties to roughly offset interest expense in the year.","Our separate line items for R&D and SG&A each include the impact of stock-based compensation as well as deal synergies. We expect to realize about one-third of the total $2.5 billion synergies this year.","With respect to stock-based compensation, BMS includes the impact of Celgene's employee stock-based comp in our operating expense which negatively impacts our non-GAAP P&L.","The full year amount of the stock-based compensation for Celgene in 2019 was roughly $800 million on a non-GAAP basis which was incremental to the BMS standalone stock-based compensation. We expect levels of stock-based compensation to remain elevated in 2020 and begin to taper down over time as the Celgene and BMS legacy plans converge.","We also want to remind you on slide 16 the evolution of our share count. Basic share count as of the end of 2019 was impacted by the $715 million of new issuances as a result of the Celgene conversion and by the impact of the ASR.","Going forward, our 2020 basic share count will be impacted by three factors; the number of stock options exercised, the finalization of the ASR program, and additional share repurchases which provides us flexibility to manage the potential future dilution.","Remember, there will continue to be a dilutive impact for the stock options that remain in the money. That said, no additional options will be granted under the legacy Celgene plan. So, over time this impact will lessen as the compensation plans from the both legacy companies converge. As you can see, we've guided our weighted average share count for the year to be approximately 2.3 billion shares for the year.","Now on slide 17, as we look beyond 2020, we see a robust growth in 2021, driven by the current portfolio as well as new expected launch opportunities and the impact of continued synergies all of which is reflected in the EPS guidance.","We expect continued growth into 2022, while acknowledging this will be at a moderated growth rate due to generic competition for Revlimid. It's important to mention that we do not anticipate continually updating our long-term guidance throughout the year.","Now, let's turn to capital allocation on slide 18. As we've said in the past, we continue to expect significant cash flow from the newly combined businesses and we will continue to employ a balanced approach to capital allocation.","Business development is a key enabler of our strategy and therefore remains a top capital priority. We also remain committed to the dividend as evidenced by our 10-plus year track record of annual increases and our recent increase of almost 10% in December.","At the same time, we remain fully committed to deleveraging and achieving our 1.5 times gross debt to EBITDA ratio by the close of 2023. As you are aware we have approximately $10 billion in bonds maturing over the next three years, providing an opportunity to reduce total debt.","Finally, related to share repurchases. We repurchased 105 million shares in 2019, 99 million in Q4 under the $7 billion ASR, mostly due to the 80% retired upfront. The remaining roughly 20% of the ASR is expected to be completed by the end of Q2 this year.","As we announced today, we've increased our share repurchase authorization by $5 billion to $6 billion. This provides us with the flexibility to execute disciplined share repurchases to manage the dilution from stock-based compensation and stabilizing the share count into the next year. Although, typically we don't provide quarterly guidance, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality of the legacy Celgene portfolio, specifically Revlimid revenue is historically a bit lighter in the first quarter than the full year average run rate.","Before we move to the question-and-answer session, I just wanted to reiterate that we feel really good about the growth outlook and financial flexibility of the business and have reflected this in our guidance. The company is in a strong position to embark on its next chapter in delivering important medicines for patients.","I'll now turn the call back over to John and Giovanni for the question-and-answer.","John Elicker","Thanks, David, and I think we're ready to go to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks so very much for the question. Maybe just two here on Opdivo. First, I know, Giovanni, you touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but can you just elaborate on the first-line lung strategy in Europe post the last week's 227 update? And then when we think about first-line lung in the U.S. is Opdivo+Yervoy and the 227 data the primary focus? Or do you feel that the 9LA regimen of chemo Opdivo+Yervoy will be the bigger focus? I'm trying to figure out how you're balancing those, I guess, two data sets.","And then my second question was, another one, just as we think about 2020 for Opdivo. When you look at where the Street is shaking out here, which, I think, is about a 5% erosion for Opdivo this year versus 2019, do you feel like consensus properly captures the balance of the second-line lung erosion relative to the growth you're seeing in some of these other indications? Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. Thank you, Chris. So first of all, let me just say, as I mentioned in my remarks, our focus in Europe for first-line lung cancer, obviously, has shifted to 9LA, which we believe has -- and we've said before, is an important study. Let me just ask Chris Boerner to give you a perspective on our overall strategy for first-line lung cancer in the U.S., as we think about the two trials. And then, Chris can provide some perspective on Opdivo performance and the various components of that in 2020 as well.","Chris Boerner","Yes. Chris, thanks for the question. I mean, I think we continue to see 227 and 9LA as being thought of in the U.S. very much in conjunction with one another. If you go back, what we hear consistently from physicians who have seen the 227 data is that; number one, they're impressed with the potential for long-term survival with dual I-O therapy.","They note the depth and durability of complete remissions, all coming with a very manageable safety profile. And so, they see that as an important opportunity for patients who either don't need or don't want chemotherapy. And incidentally, I would say, that the NCCN listing, 2A listing that we got back in December is a recognition both of the unmet need that continues to exist in first-line lung cancer, as well as the potential that exists for dual I-O therapy.","What 9LA then brings to the table is, answering the question, for those patients who do need chemotherapy, does concomitant chemotherapy, two cycles in this case, along with dual I-O therapy, provide a benefit? And we're very happy to see a second study that demonstrates overall survival. So as physicians in the U.S. think about these studies, they very much think about them in combination with one another. And that's an important part of how we are going to think about our long-term strategy in first-line lung cancer.","As it relates to 2020 and how we think about the business, let me say just a couple of things. First of all, the business for Opdivo in the U.S. continues to perform in line with our expectations. In second-line lung cancer, eligibility is still on the order of 30% to 35%. We expect that's going to flatten out around 30% this year.","Our shares are holding stable in the 35% to 40% range. The business continues to be stable in metastatic melanoma. We continue to have a leadership position in adjuvant melanoma. And again in first-line renal, our business is stable in our approved indications.","As we think about this year, as David mentioned, the business is going to continue to still be under pressure. As a reminder that pressure really comes from three tumors: it's second-line lung cancer, where we've talked about the dynamics there; and it's small cell; and head and neck. And in those two tumors it's a very similar dynamic to lung cancer, where you've seen competitive approvals in the first-line impacting eligibility in the second line. But I would say importantly, our assumption for this year is that our shares in the second-line setting across those tumors remain stable. It's just stable within a smaller pool of patients.","Giovanni Caforio","And again as I \u2013 we said earlier in the remarks Chris, while we're not commenting exactly on guidance for the growth of Opdivo this year. We remain confident with growth growing into 2021. And that's our focus, particularly as it relates to preparation for launches and commercial execution.","John Elicker","Can we go to the next question please, Anna","Operator","We take our next question from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Seamus Fernandez","Thanks very much. So actually I'd love to ask you guys about the Celgene portfolio a little bit and rather than focusing on the Bristol portfolio. One of the products that we learned about at ASH was the oral the data opportunity. I was just hoping, you might be able to help put that in context for us to help us understand what may be an underappreciated opportunity in the Bristol story. And particularly something that falls outside of the CVR maybe this is a bit of a surprise upside.","And then also would you update us on the CELMoD development opportunity, maybe just put in context where you see the CELMoD portfolio delivering the most upside? As we talk to physicians, some of the feedback that we get is that this is a pretty straightforward opportunity for physicians to treat patients that have progressed on both Revlimid and Pomalyst. So just love to get your thoughts on both of those opportunities. Thanks.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Seamus. Let me ask Samit to start and give you a perspective both on CC-486 and then CELMoD and Nadim will make some comments from a commercial perspective.","Samit Hirawat","Thank you, Seamus for the question. I think you already teed up the overall portfolio from a, what comes from the Celgene side of things in terms of hematology, where certainly beyond the ones that we've already talked about from [indiscernible] CC-486 certainly adds on to that.","CC-486 study in patients with acute myeloid leukemia was certainly a very important data set that we presented at ASH, looking at patients with AML, who have received induction with or without consolidation chemotherapy and then achieve a complete response with or without complete recovery of the bone marrow.","And what we saw over there is of course the overall survival improvement as well as an improvement in the relapse-free survival. And this is an oral agent, so convenience of delivery for these patients becomes very, very important. And this is the first and only treatment that has shown a survival benefit in the maintenance setting. So we remain excited about that and we're looking forward towards discussions with the health authority and the filings going forward. Of course, here we also continue to think about the overall life-cycle management plan with our portfolio and the combinations that could be available in the future.","As it comes to the CELMoDs and then I will pass it on to Nadim to comment more on I think CELMoDs are certainly a very, very exciting addition to the overall portfolio and in the armamentarium that we look forward to developing in multiple myeloma. We see this as absolute necessary opportunity. And one of the data sets that we presented in ASCO 2019 were for CC-220, where we saw that patients who had received prior treatment with IMiD, proteasome inhibitors, daratumumab they still went on to have a response rate of 31%. And these are durable responses that we saw in this late-line setting.","So we have additional plans for not only CC-220 but CC-480, which is another CELMoD looking at multiple myeloma setting. And there are a multitude of opportunities with our overall portfolio of cell therapies as well as the T-cell engagers, where we will continue to think about how to do treatments for further improvement in the outcome of these patients where cure still does not exist. So we'll be sharing those plans in the coming months as we look forward. But let me pass it on to Nadim to talk a little bit more from the commercial perspective.","Nadim Ahmed","Thanks, Samit. And then thank you for the question, Seamus. So if you think about frontline or newly diagnosed AML across EU5 and the U.S. about 33,000 patients. And about two-thirds of those patients are eligible for intensive chemotherapy and that's the patient group that we studied. And the unmet need even in newly diagnosed AML is very high. So with the elderly patients, you have a five-year survival of only about 15% and 80% of these patients will relapse within 18 months. So to have a treatment that adds 10 months of overall survival and doubles the relapse-free survival is going to be really important. So we're very excited about the opportunity in AML.","And I'll also remind you that this gives us another opportunity to once again establish the maintenance treatment paradigm in another disease after we did the same in multiple myeloma. So we're very excited about the opportunity. So that's CC-486. In terms of 220 and Samit covered it very well as well as 480, we are hearing the exact same thing from clinicians who have been using the drug on study. So certainly, we're seeing the CELMoDs work after our IMiD our in-line portfolio. But I think the additional opportunity as Samit alluded to is some of our life-cycle management opportunities where we then have the chance to move these treatments up earlier in the treatment sequence to displace the IMiD. So we're very excited about that opportunity also.","John Elicker","Thanks, Seamus for the questions. Can we go to the next question please, Ana?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning everyone. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple. For David or for Giovanni, for 2021 guidance, I know you guys don't want to give details, but generally should we assume that earnings growth will be mostly from the return to growth for I-O and maybe new launches? Or is it more from the operational synergy side of things? And then for Nadim, what is the credit field for BCMA-targeted therapies? Just curious about the status of moving bb2121 up to second-line myeloma and when you guys think about the BCMA modalities in your pipeline, how do you all reconcile bi-specifics with CAR-Ts and others? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Yes. Thank you, Geoff. Let me start. Obviously, when you look at 2121 as we've said, we have an opportunity to return to growth for Opdivo. We have a number of really exciting launch opportunities and I've mentioned several of those. And so there is real momentum in the business, which is driven by the portfolio and how new launches come into play. That's the reason why I feel really good about the fact that the guidance we provided from -- for 2021 is driven by dynamics in the portfolio that are very encouraging for us.","Of course, we will be disciplined with respect to continuing to execute on the synergies. And as you know, we've updated that we feel comfortable with the $2.5 billion about one-third will come this year and we expect about one-third to come next year. But I think the growth of next year, we're really excited about the portfolio opportunities playing out. Let me just ask Samit and Nadim to ask you -- to answer your second question.","Samit Hirawat","Thank you, Giovanni, and thanks Geoff for the question on the BCMA portfolio. So from a BCMA CAR T-cell perspective from ide-cel perspective, we've already shared some of the data last year at ASH looking at ide-cel in the fourth-line plus patient population where we saw a CR rate of 31% overall. And we're certainly excited towards continuing to expand that portfolio and towards filing of that data set itself. There are three additional studies that are currently ongoing as you can see on ClinicalTrials.gov. KarMMa-2 is the study I think that sort of answers your question that we are beginning to look at the second-line setting. So we're looking at using ide-cel in the second-line patient population.","KarMMa-2 is a randomized Phase III study looking at ide-cel versus a triplet therapy for patients in the third-line plus setting. And then KarMMa-4 was just initiated at the end of last year looking at the first-line patient population in a Phase I\/II study. So we're really excited towards looking into the outcomes of these studies and the data generation. And when we talk about the overall portfolio from a BCMA perspective, I think all the emerging data tells us that BCMA is absolutely an important target that we need to be able to attack from various modalities, whether it be through the cell therapies that we talked about or the T-cell engager that we have now shared the data from the Phase 1 Study -269 and certainly looking forward to now looking at how to bring that forward as more data matures and accelerate that development plan. And then, of course, we'll look into our pipeline how to combine these with as we previously discussed with CELMoD et cetera. But let me pass it on to Nadim to give you a little bit more on that.","Nadim Ahmed","Sure. Thanks Samit. And so one thing I will remind everyone is that once we had a good idea that BCMA was going to be a very important target for multiple myeloma, we strategically and proactively embarked on a multi-modality approach to treating this disease. And our thinking there was that you have very different patient segments that can benefit from CAR-T versus a T-cell engager and even ADC, which we have early on in the clinic.","So as you think about the various patient segments, patient profiles and patient preferences, you can envisage where a patient has the opportunity to receive CAR-T with a one-and-done treatment that allows them to have a very long treatment-free interval. So there's an opportunity to do that.","Physicians may choose to refer their younger and fitter patients for CAR-T for example. You may have somebody who prefers to be treated closer to home for whom a T-cell engager will be an ideal treatment. And then both treatments work differently. For a T-cell engager, you need to continue the treatment to stay on top of the disease. And with the CAR-T therapy it's a once-and-done treatment. So we think there's definitely room for both and even potentially three modalities to coexist one within the same line of therapy, but of course also across multiple lines of therapy in exactly the same way we approach Revlimid and Pomalyst in the multiple myeloma market. So we feel very confident that we're actually delivering on our strategy and there's the opportunity for multiple-patient segments to benefit from all these types of modalities.","John Elicker","Okay, thanks. And can we go to the next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Timothy Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions, originally you guys at the time of the deal gave 2022 and 2025 guidance on revenues and net income. That has not been updated since the Otezla divestiture. And I'm wondering, are you going to update that at some point? Or can you update that today I guess as it will have changed?","And then second question is at least for us the black box has been how to model Revlimid erosion. At the time of the deal, you made it very clear that your internal forecasts were much more conservative and cautious on the rate of erosion of Revlimid from 2022 onwards to the big product. I'm wondering now a year on as you see analyst models, do you think the analyst community is appropriately modeling that erosion? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Tim. Let me just start on both questions and then David can add more comments. So first of all with respect to guidance I think, as we said from the beginning, we were not going to go back and update the S-4 from last year. As you know there have been a number of things that have happened since last year; the divestiture of Otezla as you mentioned; the divestiture of our UPSA consumer medicines business; and on the other side continued really strong performance with our in-line business and significant progress with the pipeline, which obviously is a key driver of our performance in the next few years.","So overall as I mentioned also in my remarks, I feel better today about where we are than I felt a year ago when we first announced the deal. And the strength of our in-line business and the progress made with our pipeline make me feel really good about the future and the key drivers that were behind the confidence we had last year and we have today in the business.","Today we provided guidance on 2020 and 2021. I made some comments about our perspective on 2022 and we feel pretty good about where we are. So now with respect to Revlimid also there, there have been good developments. First of all, I would say the in-line performance of the brand continues to be strong and the teams are doing a great job continuing to support an important franchise. I think that's important.","We had two IPR decisions, which were favorable to Bristol-Myers Squibb. We did reach a settlement with Alvogen, which was aligned with our expectations. And I would say that overall, we continue to see the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid as a slope. That is driven by sort of all the same assumptions that we've discussed in the past. There has been good development and so nothing has really changed there.","John Elicker","Great. Tim thanks for the questions. Anna, can we go to the next one please?","Operator","The next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering first on Opdivo, if you can give us your latest thoughts on the opportunity in adjuvant bladder following the Roche data. Just wondering, if there are any notable trial design differences you could point to for your study versus their trial. And then on bb2121 and JCAR and the commercial ramp on the forward, anything you guys have learned from the competitive CAR T launches that you can leverage? And would you expect to have stronger launches as a result? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Thanks Terence. Samit, why don't you start and...","Samit Hirawat","Sure. Thank you for the question, Terence. And as it relates to the adjuvant setting, first of all, let me start by saying that immuno-oncology products are going to play a major role in the adjuvant setting because, the earlier we can utilize these treatments, it will provide an opportunity to not only shift the level of recurrence, but provide a potential for cure for these patients. And overall, as we move earlier and earlier from the metastatic setting to the earlier setting, the overall plan that we have in place, we feel very confident about it in non-small cell lung cancer melanoma, RCC, gastric and of course in bladder cancer as well. There -- it's no point trying to do cross-trial comparisons.","At this point, I think we are pretty close to where we will be starting to see the data emerging. I think just to keep in mind that, the overall patient population that we've enrolled seems very similar. And without getting into the specifics, the one major difference is placebo used in our trial versus observation in the other trial and the treatment duration is different. But I think, we should wait for the data for it to read out, rather than getting into the specifics at this time. But I think, Chris can give you more color on the commercial side.","Chris Boerner","Yes. So let me just say something on a macro level with respect to the adjuvant programs and then I'll talk specifically about bladder. Just a reminder, that as you think about the adjuvant setting, you need to think not only about the patients who are treated today, but also the potential for patients to be treated. So, what we saw when we launched I-O in the adjuvant melanoma space was that you saw treatment rates increase significantly. And then a number of the tumors in which we are pursuing our early-stage program, you see treatment rates in the low to single digits ultimately up to potentially around 40% for some tumors. But still there's plenty of opportunity for us to not only treat patients who are being treated today, but with improved therapies, improve the treatment rates overall.","With respect to bladder cancer specifically, this is a very large patient population. It's highly fragmented. And we have importantly multiple opportunities in the muscle-invasive space. About 50% of those patients are getting surgery today. We have CheckMate-078 which is in the periadjuvant setting. We're looking at the entire population with CheckMate-274 and we also have a non-muscle invasive bladder program as well. So, it's an important opportunity for us. We are still very confident in the opportunity for I-O in the adjuvant setting and we very much look forward to seeing the data.","Nadim Ahmed","Great. Thanks, Chris. I'll pick up on CAR T. So, I think a couple of things I would mention as you alluded to. So, clearly there have been some headwinds in the marketplace. And I think about things like reimbursement access environment, complexity of manufacturing, also the safety profile of current agents has led to most of the administration being conducted in the inpatient setting.","So, we're addressing all of those near-term headwinds. So a couple of things I would say. So if I use just liso-cel as an example, the data we showed at ASH of the pivotal data, we're seeing a safety profile where we're seeing significant reduction in the incidence and severity of CRS neurotoxicity, which we think bodes well to be able to give this treatment in the outpatient setting, which will allow us to expand our prescriber base. So we're excited about that.","The other thing that's important to point out from a differentiation of BMS is that, we do have very deep relationships with hematologists and that includes multiple myeloma that includes lymphoma. So, our footprint out in the community will really help us to drive those referrals into the treatment sites where CAR Ts will be given as well as expand out into the community with assets like liso-cel.","So from where we're looking, we think we're addressing the near-term headwinds. In terms of the access environment, ongoing work continues in terms of addressing the DRG issue. Great news last year that the National Coverage Determination wasn't implemented so that could have impacted site of care. So that's not an issue for us now. From a manufacturing capacity capability between Summit and Seattle, we feel very good about capacity at launch. And we also have longer-term plans to expand that footprint to make sure we continue to have great capacity.","But the other final thing I would add is, we've seen transformational data in very late-stage setting. But I think the true potential of these therapies is moving them up earlier in the treatment sequence from a long-term potential perspective. And you heard from Samit that we have a very aggressive life-cycle management plan for both of these assets that will allow us to unlock that long-term potential for these transformational therapies.","John Elicker","Thanks, Terence. Can we go to the next question please, Anna?","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Phipps from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Matt Phipps","Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could quantify the impact of buying patterns for Opdivo in the U.S. for the quarter, or do we just assume it's the difference between the 6% decline in quarter-over-quarter prices versus \u2013 I know you mentioned the low single-digit decline in demand?","Giovanni Caforio","Yes, Matt. Chris?","Chris Boerner","Yeah. So let me address that, Matt. So as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we saw Opdivo decline on the quarter versus same time last year about 2%. And let me just characterize that. That was entirely driven by the U.S., which was down about 10%, but virtually all of that decline year-over-year as a result of the dynamics we've been talking about quite a bit, which are the dynamics in second-line lung cancer.","As you look on a sequential basis the U.S. was down roughly 6%. About half of that was a result of the inventory work down with the VA. The remaining portion of that was mainly the second-line eligibility issue in lung cancer. We saw a little bit of an impact in eligibility in small-cell lung cancer and head and neck. But importantly, if you normalize for the VA inventory movements what you see in both Q3 and Q4 from a demand standpoint was Opdivo was down as David mentioned in low single digits around 2% to 3%. And importantly, as we see both 2020 and 2021, the impacts that you saw in the quarter will have no material impact on what we see for the year as a whole in 2020 and for the growth opportunities for Opdivo as we go into 2021.","John Elicker","Can we go to the next question please Anna?","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have two questions both for clarification. First, Giovanni to clarify on what you said about growth in 2022, did you say you see growth into 2022 or through 2022 although moderating? And if into, is there any scenario where earnings would be down in 2022? So that's the first question. And the second one is on the other income expense guidance for 2020. It appears way better than one would expect given the financing costs. Now you mentioned the step-up in royalties on KEYTRUDA and the AstraZeneca diabetes products in 2020. But I thought that the KEYTRUDA royalty was flat at 6.5% through 2024 and the AstraZeneca royalties are either flat at or step down in 2020. So are you saying that the royalty rates are the same, but the products will grow or something different? And I don't think there's a lot of optimism about the AstraZeneca diabetes portfolio. So I'm wondering again, is it the royalty rates are changing or the products' royalties are changing? So please clarify. Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you, Steve. Let me ask \u2013 let me answer the first question. So when I spoke about 2022, I'm speaking about growth in 2022 moderated by in terms of the growth rate by the potential beginning of the entrance of generics for Revlimid in 2022. So I see at this point our business growing in 2022 as a year with the moderation of the growth rate versus 2021 driven by the dynamic I just discussed. David?","David Elkins","Yes. And KEYTRUDA from a volume perspective continues to grow; and AstraZeneca the rate continues to increase. So that is being offset by the higher interest expense, as I talked about in my prepared remarks with the $45 billion of debt and average interest rate of 3.4%.","John Elicker","Hey, can we go to the -- I think we have time maybe for two more questions, Anna.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Thanks very much, and congrats on the disclosures. So, sorry to go back on this Giovanni, but just a quick question, I think that last year you had said that you expected a sort of growth EPS through 2025. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned continuing growth into 2022. Could you just provide any comments beyond 2022 please?","And then second with respect to CAR T hospitals are obviously losing significant amount of money on patients who are not in clinical trials, which are paid for by manufacturers. Could you just talk about prospects for changes to Medicare reimbursement and potential changes in DRG codes in the future? Thanks so much.","Giovanni Caforio","Sure. David let me start and then Nadim will comment. So let me just say again I feel really good about where we are with our business. We discussed very clearly in Q3 we would not update the S-4 going forward. And I feel pretty good about having provided visibility into the next three years, which clearly demonstrate the earnings power the growth outlook for the company.","Most importantly, I feel really good about the fundamentals of the business both in terms of the performance of the in-line portfolio and the speed at which the pipeline that will drive the long-term growth of the company is advancing. So I'm not going to make comments beyond 2022. But I believe I provided my perspective on where we are as a company and the real opportunity we have for the long term. Nadim?","Nadim Ahmed","Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think part of the issue around the access reimbursement environment has as I said previously has been driven a lot by the fact that many of these treatments have been given in the inpatient setting. So, one I would say if you have a treatment that has the potential to be utilized in the outpatient setting then you start entering into the Part B environment, which is very different to the inpatient capitated DRG environment. So that's one point I would make especially as it pertains to liso-cel.","I think in the inpatient setting the challenge has exactly been that decapitated treatment. Even having said that though, as things have started to improve, we saw the NTAP improve to 65% last year through CMS. I think there's been lots of talk and we've been working on a potential DRG for CAR T specifically. Currently, sites are having to use the DRG for stem cell transplant, which under-reimburses the cost of CAR T therapy.","So there is work to do, but the two things I would leave you with is outpatient represents a discrete different opportunity which isn't affected by capitated payments. But at the same time I think CMS is working on the opportunity to come up with a specific DRG potentially for CAR T. And I think that will help reimbursement in the inpatient setting also.","John Elicker","Thanks, Dave. Can we go to our last question, please Anna? ","Operator","We take our next question from Navin Jacob from UBS. Please go ahead.","Prakhar Agrawal","Hi. This is Prakhar Agrawal on behalf of Navin. So my first question is on the CheckMate oral trial. There were some interesting data at ASCO GI recently in first-line HCC for Opdivo cabo and Opdivo cabo Yervoy triplet regimen. So, any comment on the data presented and the potential for these two regimens in HCC?","And second question is on Yervoy. So Yervoy performed better than expectations this quarter. So the question is, is the impact from the uptake of KEYTRUDA and lighter regimen is in first-line RCC mostly done? And should we expect more tempered erosion in U.S. in 2020? Thank you.","Giovanni Caforio","Samit, why don't you start?","Samit Hirawat","Yes. In the HCC arena, our focus is primarily on the Opdivo-Yervoy combination. So beyond that we're not really looking to any expanded way of looking at it this time. So that's all I can share at this time from HCC perspective. But maybe Chris you have...","Chris Boerner","Yes. So Yervoy for the quarter was flat relative to the same time last year and we did show sequential growth of around 9% versus the third quarter of 2019. And that growth was driven really by both the U.S. as well as in ex-U.S..","We saw a bit of an uptick in the use of Opdivo+Yervoy, really across multiple tumors and the remainder of the business where we have Opdivo+Yervoy in the market today, as well as the use of Yervoy as a monotherapy in a selected number of indications was relatively stable for the quarter.","So what we're really starting to see is the increased use of Opdivo+Yervoy really spread across multiple tumors and that's happening both in the U.S. and to a lesser extent outside of the U.S.","Giovanni Caforio","Thank you. Thank you Chris and thanks everyone. So before we close I would like to thank John Elicker for extraordinary leadership of IR over many, many years. Thank you John.","Now in closing, we've had a very successful 2019 and I'm proud of the focus that our teams have had throughout a very, very busy year. We advanced our pipeline. We delivered strong commercial execution to make a difference in the lives of patients and we are very well positioned as we embark on our next chapter as a new company. Thanks everyone.","John Elicker","Thanks everybody for taking the time. As always if you have any follow-ups give us a call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
