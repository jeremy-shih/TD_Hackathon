And welcome to the Duke Realty Fourth Quarter and Year End 2012 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer period. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)","Also, as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, Ann. Good afternoon everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Denien, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you our 10-K that we have on file with the SEC dated February 25, 2011.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments during 2012. Christie will then address our financial performance and progress on our capital strategy. We\u2019ll then share more details on our 2013 guidance.","Our solid operational performance, strong new development starts and continued progress in repositioning the composition of the portfolio consistent with our strategic plan resulted in an outstanding year for Duke Realty.","A few of the highlights for the year were as follows. We signed a near record 29 million square feet of leases and achieved a record 83% tenant retention rate. We improved in-service occupancy to 93% and grew same property NOI 2.5%.","We commenced $520 million in new development starts and acquired over $800 million of industrial and medical office properties, and completed $153 million in dispositions, again in accordance with our repositioning strategy. And we issued $600 million of unsecured debt at weighted average yield of 4.2%.","I\u2019ll now touch a little bit on the overall market conditions that we are experiencing and how that is affecting our business. First, let me say that we did not really feel the effects of the fourth quarter negative GDP growth announced yesterday. Overall activity in all product types was reasonably consistent for us this quarter.","Industrial market across the country remained solid as reflected in our portfolio. All the three of our markets are over 90% leased and nine are over 95% leased. Leasing activity is robust and build-to-suite development is active on a national level. Net demand for warehouse space was 40.8 million square feet in the fourth quarter, making it the second strongest quarter since record keeping began in 1993.","An example of this strength is Indianapolis industrial market which is just 3.3% vacant, only 1.7% vacant in the bulk product. Most markets generally have well under 10% vacancy rates today. We are seeing an increase in speculative construction starts but it\u2019s still not look at a level that is concerning in any market.","The medical office business continues to benefit from ongoing structural changes in the industry. Hospital consolidation is happening at a strong pace, physician\u2019s practices are being sold to major hospital systems and all healthcare providers are adapting to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.","This is driving strong demand in our medical office business. Last year we started nearly 200 million of healthcare projects and we have a strong backlog of potential development projects that we\u2019re working on.","Another trend we are seeing is major hospital systems opening freestanding emergency facilities throughout major metropolitan areas. These projects are structured as long-term net lease transactions and we anticipate this will become a small part of our overall healthcare portfolio with a few of our major customers in larger markets.","As you know, we completed the acquisition of 14-building portfolio early in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re very pleased with our operations so far. Overall healthcare is a very strong piece of our business.","The suburban office business is still slow but activity seems to be stabilizing at a slightly higher level. We have seen more customers in the market for larger spaces, as well as an increase in build-to-suite interest from our major companies. And there is very little, if any speculative development happening with the possible exception of Houston, which I will touch on later.","As for operating results of our portfolio, the in-service occupancy was 93.0% at December 31st, up 50 basis points for the quarter and up 230 basis points from year end 2011 occupancy of 90.7%. This is our highest in-service occupancy in more than a decade, reflecting great leasing activity in our limited spec development starts.","We signed approximately 29 million square feet of leases in 2012, including 8.3 million square feet during the fourth quarter. We also achieved a lease renewal rate of nearly 85% for the fourth quarter and for the full year retain an all-time record 83% of our expiring leases.","The occupancy increase was driven by our bulk industrial portfolio, which now stands at an excellent 94.6%. This is reflection of the quality of our local operating teams and strategically located high-quality properties.","Same property NOI for the three and 12 months ended December 31st was a positive 1.6% and positive 2.5%, respectively. This is a great result when you consider the relative slow economic growth we saw in 2012, particularly in the fourth quarter.","Bulk industrial is also leading the way on same property performance at a strong 3.1% growth. This growth was driven by both occupancy growth and growth in our net effective rental rates at our bulk properties.","Now let me touch on some of the key results within each product type for the year and fourth quarter. Leasing activity was terrific in our industrial portfolio as we signed over 7.3 million square feet of leases during the quarter.","Some of our larger lease deals signed during the quarter included a 506,000 square foot renewal lease combined with 161,000 square foot expansion for 5.5 years with McGraw-Hill in Columbus, Ohio, a 463,000 square foot renewal with Genco Distribution for four years also in Columbus, a 600,000 square foot five-year renewal lease with Crossroads Centers in our Indianapolis market, a 275,000 square foot renewal for five years with Ford Motor Company in Orlando and we signed a 159,000 square foot new lease with Essilor of America for eight years in Dallas.","Despite the challenging office sector fundamentals previously mentioned, our team performed well in 2012 executing 3.4 million square feet of leases for the year and over 750,000 square feet in the fourth quarter, increasing our in-service occupancy to 86.3%, a 90 basis point improvement from year end 2011.","Some of our notable fourth quarter lease deals include a 94,000 square foot renewal lease with ATOS IT Solutions in Cincinnati, a 35,000 square foot new lease with the GSA in Cleveland and a combined 104,000 square foot expansion and renewal lease with Panera restaurants in St. Louis.","Our medical office portfolio continues to produce strong results with over 900,000 square feet of leases signed during the year, ending the year with an overall occupancy of 92.5%, a 350 basis point improvement over year end 2011.","We also made solid progress in our asset strategy during the quarter and for the full year. As you know, our asset strategy is focused on the acquisition and development of high quality industrial and medical office assets and the reduction of our suburban office portfolio.","In accordance with this strategy, we acquired 440 million of industrial and medical office assets totaling over 2.9 million square feet in the fourth quarter, bringing the total executed acquisitions to $800 million for the year.","On the disposition side, proceeds from the fourth quarter were $26 million and $153 million for the year. With this activity we ended the year allocated 51% to bulk industrial, 29% to office, 16% to medical office and 4% retail toward our strategic goal of 60% industrial, 25% office and 15% medical office.","We acquired four bulk industrial facilities in strategic markets during the quarter. We acquired two properties in key Northern California Central Valley Submarket, a 726,000 square foot facility, which is 100% leased to ConAgra for their main western region distribution center and a 552,000 square foot facility, 100% leased to Delicato Wines.","In the Chicago market we acquired a 288,000 square foot vacant industrial facility in an off-market transaction in the I-55 corridor where we own 10 existing facilities.","In a testament to our best-in-class local market teams, simultaneous with the closing of this acquisition, we lease 66% of the space to an existing tenant from one of our other nearby facilities that was looking for expansion space.","We purchased the building at roughly 25% below replacement costs and we expect the investment to general -- generate a stabilized yield of approximately 7.7%. Finally, we acquired 135,000 square foot industrial facility in the Southeast Houston Submarket that is also 100% leased.","During the quarter we close our previously announced medical office acquisition of Seavest Healthcare, a very high quality 14 building, 1.2 million square foot primarily on campus portfolio that was 89.2% leased at closing.","Through an existing customer relationship we also acquired a small 60,000 square foot medical office building in Cincinnati and on-campus facility that is 100% lease for 15 years.","As we stated recently, going forward, you will see our medical office focus on build-to-suite developments with limited acquisitions occurring through existing Tenet Healthcare existing healthcare relationships.","We are very happy with the high quality mix of acquisitions this quarter, which combined our estimated earnings 6.9% weighted average stabilized yield with solid annual rent growth over the average lease term in place of six years.","Turning to development, we started 19 new projects during 2012 totaling $520 million in projected stabilized cost, an excellent year which shows its strength of the Duke Realty development platform. During the fourth quarter, we started four build-to-suit projects, one industrial and three medical office.","Starting with industrial, we are under construction on a 1.02 million-square-foot bulk industrial facility in South Seattle off Interstate 5. Facilities are 100% leased for 15 years to a major retailer.","The three medical office build-to-suit projects totaled 126,000 square feet are with existing hospital system relationships, Scott & White and Good Samaritan. One facility is located in Cincinnati, Ohio and the other two are in North and Central Texas. All three projects are also 100% leased for 15 years. On a combined basis, our fourth quarter build-to-suit projects have a weighted average GAAP yield of 7.8%.","And finally, I\u2019d like to deliver some exciting news in our Houston market that occurred shortly after year-end. The office market at Houston is extremely strong and as you know, we started 155,000 square foot speculative project in third quarter of last year on our one remaining office site. I\u2019m pleased to report in January, we signed 109,000 square foot new lease with Forum Energy Technologies take 68% of the space of this project.","The lease term is for term of 10 years and will commence immediately upon completion of the project in July of this year. We have solid prospects for the remaining space and hope to open this project substantially pre-leased.","Also in January, we signed two contracts to sell some or all of our interest in two primarily office joint ventures. The total sales price for our interest is approximately $150 million. We expect both of these sales to close before year-end -- before the end of February and generate net proceeds to us net of debt of nearly $90 million.","So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Christie.","Christie Kelly","Thanks Denny, and good afternoon everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide a recap of our 2012 financial performance and progressed on our capital strategy. I\u2019m please to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.27 per share, up from $0.26 per share in the third quarter and $1.02 per share for the full year.","Core FFO for the year was at the midpoint of our previously communicated guidance of one penny per share higher than consensus. More significantly, we are pleased to report AFFO of $0.82 per share for the full year and $0.21 per share for the quarter. AFFO per share for the full year represents over 5% improvement from 2011 results and translates into a conservative payout ratio of slightly below 83%.","As we projected this growth in AFFO over the prior-year as a result of executing our strategic asset repositioning, which was accelerated by the Blackstone office disposition in December 2011, while steadily increasing our investment in less capital intensive bulk industrial properties and medical office facility.","As Denny mentioned earlier, our near-record leasing volume in 2012, combines with the fact that we enjoyed our first full year of rental rate growth on lease renewals since the beginning of the Great Recession, enabled us to achieve 2.5% same property NOI growth over 2011.","Our efforts to reposition our investment from suburban office properties into what we believe to be stronger bulk industrial and medical office product types were also key in achieving this growth.","From a capital strategy perspective, we issued 22.7 million shares of common stock during the year pursuant to our ATM program, generating net proceeds of approximately $315.3 million. We also generated $600 million of capital through two unsecured debt offerings that bear interest in an average interest rate of 4.2%.","During 2012, we redeemed our $168 million, up 6.95% Series M Preferred Shares. We also repaid $200 million of unsecured notes before interest at a weighted average effective rate of 5.87%. $102 million of secured loans that had weighted average effective rate of 5.18% as well as a consolidated subsidiary of $41.3 million variable rate lending facility.","We use the proceeds from our capital raising activities to further increase our investment in quality, industrial and medical office acquisitions as we planned and fund our strong development pipeline. We ended the year with $285 million outstanding on our line of credit.","As most of you are aware, just after year-end and in early January, we took advantage of stable capital market conditions and executed our common equity offering to significantly advance our capital strategy. We raised $572 million of net proceeds, which was used to pay off our $285 million year-end line of credit balance and leaves us with additional capital to redeem our 8.375% Series O Preferred Shares in February of this year.","The offering was well-timed given market condition, was executed at an efficient calling, cost and reduces our leverage in alignment with our plan. The strong global demand for the offering resulted in one of the lowest follow-on offerings in the last 12 months.","We had orders for over 85 million shares at the high end of our range. So we upsized our original 30 million share offering to 36 million shares and the underwriters exercised issue to fill more of the demand. We now estimate that nearly all of our leverage goals we have presented will be met by year-end 2013 without significant further equity offerings.","As we look forward this year, we have $547 million of debt maturities, which we plan to repay through a combination of disposition proceeds and refinancing with long term unsecured debt. As previously communicated, we expect to selectively tap our ATM program to fund a high quality, strong yielding development pipeline, on roughly a 60:40 basis with equity to debt overtime, which will also contribute to continued overall de-leveraging in alignment with our plan.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Christie. Yesterday, we announced a range for 2013 FFO per share with a midpoint of $1.07 and AFFO per share with a midpoint of $0.86 per share. This guidance supports what we have been saying for the past three years that our asset repositioning strategy would not be dilutive on a cash-flow basis and would ultimately put the company on an upward plain of growth which is now occurring.","Overall, we expect continued slow economic environment in 2013 which is reflected in our guidance. A few specifics on some of the anticipated key performance metrics outlined on the 2013 range of estimates page provided on our website are as follows.","Our average portfolio occupancy range for 2013 is expected to be 92.0% to 94.0%. Lease expirations are slightly below average at 9%. Same property NOI is projected at a range of positive 1% to positive 4% growth. Occupancy growth is slowing but we expect slightly improved rental rate growth.","On the capital recycling front, we project proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $400 million to $600 million and proceeds from land dispositions of between $15 million and $25 million. Again, our disposition program will focus on suburban office assets and our remaining retail properties.","As previously noted, we are already under contract on 25% of the high-end of our guidance. Acquisitions are projected in the range of $300 million to $500 million. We remain selective and focused on high-quality industrial assets in alignment with our long-term strategy.","Development starts are projected in the range of $400 million to $500 million. These will be primarily industrial and medical office building build-to-suit projects. We\u2019re very pleased with where we are in our strategic plan efforts and the result is producing for our shareholders. We\u2019ve consistently believe that execution of both our asset repositioning and capital de-leveraging strategies would drive above sector average performance and that is reflected in our strong performance in 2012 and are expected continued growth in 2013.","With that, thank you again for your support in 2012 and for joining us today. And now, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Paul Adornato from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Good afternoon. Denny, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that spec development is returning in a lot of markets but it\u2019s still had a level that\u2019s very not very concerning. I was wondering if you could just tell us who is developing spec now and how they\u2019re getting financing?","Denny Oklak","I would say it\u2019s a mix Paul of the usual suspects, I guess I would say. I think there is some of the public REITs that have started spec project in some of the major markets. I think we\u2019ve seen a little bit from again the usual folks, PLD, EGP started some in their market\u2019s, DCT. On the private side, again I would say it\u2019s some of the usual suspects. IDI has several speculated projects underplay in various markets around the country.","But again the interesting thing is I would say with the possible exception of Southern California, we\u2019re only seeing maybe one or two in most markets. So it\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s -- really overwhelming out there today.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And looking at the suburban office portfolio, what\u2019s the appetite out there for acquiring suburban office assets that is what are your disposition prospects. And do you have any buildings or markets that are for sale?","Denny Oklak","I think the advertise is pretty good, Paul. The interest rates obviously have remained low. And the banks are lending. What we\u2019ve really found which is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying, I would say over the last year or so. Is that in order to have a successful sale today, we really need properties that are in -- at least the mid-80s lease, so above 85%.","We are paying a lot of attention to the lease expiration schedule during the next three years. And if you can keep that at a fairly reasonable level, those properties are very saleable today. We\u2019ve seen different folks buy. We are seeing some private, smaller private equity folks. We\u2019ve seen some larger, I would say private equity folks in the market.","And we\u2019ve been actively marketing certain properties and I think you will see us actually list some additional properties for sale here in the next month or so. And again, it\u2019s really focused on the markets that we want to downsize our suburban office presence in, which is really our remaining Midwest cities because that\u2019s really where our older suburban office projects are today.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And what kind of cap rates are you seeing in suburban office these days?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we are probably going to be seeing somewhere again in the 8.5% to 9% on in place NOI today. Again, it just depends on the portfolio. I think we\u2019ll do better than that on some properties, and maybe a little bit worse than on some depending on how old they are and just really the quality of the property.","We\u2019ve got some, I would say real true Class-A properties in the suburbs and I think today they are probably at sub-A percent cap. And then again, when you look at some of our 25 or 30 year-old industrial projects, those are probably going be closer to the low 9s.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Paul.","Christie Kelly","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Attie with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","All right. Good afternoon. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Josh. Denny or Christie, I\u2019m just curious just in terms of the way you approach sort of capital plans and capital issuances, and whether that\u2019s going to change in the future. And I guess, I\u2019m sort of thinking back to, when you did the medical office portfolio in the fourth quarter and put it on the line with the target to do asset sales and those asset sales ended up falling out of bed.","And the market with hospitable at the time you did the offering, which was good. But there was a significant likelihood that it may not have been, clearly everything that happened in D.C. with the fiscal Cliff. The market could have reacted a lot different. We could have been in a much weaker situation, and then you would have been in a very difficult situation with high leverage and extended underlying the credit.","So, I\u2019m just curious sort of as you go forward, are you going to shift to make sure that you are even more under leveraged to be able to not put yourself into any sort of box where you are going to be the hold into the equity market to delver?","Christie Kelly","Michael, I\u2019ll start off. First, just from an operating perspective, we\u2019ve been very conservative in terms of managing our line of credit and our liquidity has been quite, quite strong. As you know, we rarely, outside of just timing differences run any balance on our lines and that\u2019s been since the \u201809 time period. And we\u2019re continuing to focus on that operating principle. Nothing has changed here at headquarters in Indianapolis.","And specifically as it relates to the third quarter, we were looking at a strong disposition pipeline, a couple of those dispositions. As we discussed in the process and in the presentation, for the equity offering moved away for us. But again, we are looking at this year with a very strong disposition pipeline.","And in fact we went to the market here at the beginning of January and executed an excellent transaction for our shareholders and have put the capital strategy, goals and objectives substantially behind us as we had articulated. And then as I mentioned in my comments, we are going to continue delevering as the opportunity presents itself and we continue to drive value for our shareholder with our exceptionally strong development pipeline.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Okay. I guess, how do you think about the offering also relative to your own views of NAV? I think you have expressed at Investor Meetings, an $18 to $19 number, and while the stock is above you need to be offering at $14, $25, obviously doing the amount of that you did as well as the ATM in the fourth quarter. It obviously has a pretty big dilutive effect to NAV. It was earnings enhancing because you didn\u2019t sell assets but it was NAV dilutive. I guess how do you think about those dynamics?","Christie Kelly","I think there are couple of things, Michael. First of all, we did a significant amount of third party diligence in order to be able to really stand behind this equity offering. And bottom line, our stock price over the past 12 months had traded below our issuance price, 70% at the time.","And as we said in \u201809, the things aren\u2019t always going to work out perfectly and that it is going to be a sequence of events with the journey and I think to that point, the $590 million overnight offering that we executed was [de-tighted] as side offer discount that had been seen one of the tide as they\u2019ve been seeing in the market over the past 12 months.","And our investors have responded extremely favorably and our stock prices up over 7% since then. And so from that perspective very well received, well retimed and excellent results for our investors and we will continue to approach the market with the same focus, diligence and prowess.","Josh Attie - Citi","Christie or Denny, this is Josh. Can you talk about in more detail, why the sales didn\u2019t occur in the fourth quarter? Was there a lack of demand or was an inability to kind of to get the price between with you and the buyer?","Denny Oklak","Josh. Really, there was one larger transaction that we had been working on for a period of time prior to our call at the end of the third quarter, call at the end of October. And that transaction just -- the buyer just walked away from it and I quite honestly can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t explain why the buyer walked away from it because we had essentially agreed on price long before that. So, I wish I could give you a better answer but I can\u2019t.","Josh Attie - Citi","And just lastly, I know there was a smaller dollar amount but the $25 million of assets sales in the fourth quarter and in the \u201811 cap, can you just explain why that cap rate was so high?","Denny Oklak","Yeah. That was a small portfolio. We called it industrial, but it was really much less. I mean, it was really sort of single-story suburban office stuff that had been built and it was in Indianapolis and it was -- I think it was 440,000 square feet or something like that and it was built in the early 80s. It just was -- it\u2019s not great property and it was just again one of those projects we had taken off the list. And as you saw, it was $120 million transaction.","","Josh Attie - Citi","And did you mentioned -- I\u2019m sorry if I missed it. But did you mentioned, what cap rate you are assuming on $400 million to $600 million of sales in the 2013 guidance?","Denny Oklak","Around 8% in place cap rate.","Josh Attie - Citi","On a cash basis?","Denny Oklak","Yeah.","","Josh Attie - Citi","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brendan Maiorana from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","All right. Thanks. Good afternoon. So, Denny, I just wanted to clarify. So, I thought you said cap rates were 8.5% to 9% on in place NOI for suburban office assets that were 85% leased kind of give or take. But then did you just say 8%, you thought was included in guidance.","Denny Oklak","I think overall, that\u2019s what we are assuming in our 600 million acres we\u2019ve got some of our retail assets that we believe we\u2019ll sell this year and I think those will sell for a cap rate a little less than that.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Okay. Yeah.","Denny Oklak","It\u2019s really significantly less than that.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Yeah. So, I had a couple of questions. One, I guess if I look at your suburban office exposure and what you like to sell. St. Louis is 74% occupied, Cleveland 75% occupied, Cincinnati is 85. Is that -- is that 85% threshold number sort of a hard number or do you think that you sell? Do you sell St. Louis and Cleveland which are materially below that number?","Denny Oklak","But I think what you are going to see us do initially is take the assets that within those markets that are at the 85% plus, lease up occupancy and put those on the market and sell those and then our local teams are working on leasing up that vacant space. So as you will see us as project -- projects are leased up and ready to go, we will start listing those. So that\u2019s really how it\u2019s going to work I believe, Brendan.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Okay. And if I go back to, I think you guys provided maybe with NAREIT, maybe it was sometime around then. My recollection was there was $500 million of non-core suburban assets left to sell and then $300 million I think was retail. So at the midpoint of your guidance for \u201813, you are about $300 million short. Is that just something that maybe bleeds into \u201814, just to give it -- it\u2019s hard to get $800 million of sales done in a year?","Denny Oklak","Well, right now, what we put in on the range of estimates of $400 to $600 million is really just our best guess of what we can get done this year. So, I believe I would answer your question, yeah. And I just point out something again on the range of estimates. ","We\u2019ve been doing that every year for a long time now and I think you can look at 2012, but you can look at previous years and we are pretty accurate on all those, and getting our numbers to fall within those ranges. Probably the couple that we occasionally missed are the size of our disposition pipeline and the size of our acquisition pipeline, because that\u2019s really hard to predict. And it\u2019s been harder because we have been doing more recycling in the last couple years.","As you know, we are now a lot closer to our target product mix. So that recycling is slowing down a little bit but those are very hard to predict because you don\u2019t know if a big transaction is going to come along or not. So the $400 million to $600 million is really our best guest right now.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Sure. And then as I look at that capital plan for the year, I just wanted to clarify what\u2019s in guidance, I know the development starts at the $400 million to $500 million, if I look at what\u2019s in the current pipeline and what the spend is likely to be, it\u2019s probably in that range too. So Christie, if I heard your comment correctly on the ATM issuance, I guess that probably implies $250 million or $300 million of ATM during the year and is that accurate and is that included in your FFO range?","Christie Kelly","","Yeah. We\u2019ve got cash Brendan. And we\u2019ll be generating operating cash flow and we\u2019ll be going forward essentially matching dispositions with acquisitions. So from an ATM perspective that\u2019s a little high and we\u2019ll see how the development pipeline comes about.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Yeah I mean I know you\u2019re retaining some cash flow as you get the AFFO payout at and give or take 80% but you\u2019ve got and your dispositions are offsetting your acquisitions as you mentioned, but you\u2019ve got the development spend. So I think you mentioned in your comments 60% of the development spend is likely to be funded on ATM is that how we should be thinking about it going forward?","Christie Kelly","Yes. We should but that\u2019s also you\u2019ve got to take into account the cash, with that cash in the offering.","Denny Oklak","","We actually overfunded that equity with the offering earlier this month Brendan.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","","But is that really the case - I mean if I look at your debt-to-EBITDA trailing, I think it\u2019s, I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front of me but I think in itself, that\u2019s like 8.2 times and I think your target debt plus preferred and I think your target 7.75 and if I look at debt plus preferred, this is pro forma after the equity offering and then if I look at your debt plus preferred to GAV it\u2019s $52 million and I think you target is some $50 million, so I mean have you really over capitalized as you guys look at it, or am I just missing something on those?","Denny Oklak","","But I think we\u2019re pretty much there.","Christie Kelly","","We are.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Christie Kelly","Thanks, Brendan.","Operator","We go to the line of James Sullivan from Cohen & Company.","James Sullivan - Cohen & Company","","Thank you. I have a couple of question on the development pipeline, Denny one of the things that I found pretty impressive over the last six months is how rapidly that\u2019s grown. And so going back to the just kind of midyear 2012 and where you ended the year and what I\u2019m focusing on is the page in the supplement that provides the in-service date by quarter.","And I suppose in industrial of course we\u2019re used to that kind of product going up pretty quickly but not so much in Medical Office and so maybe, you can just think a little bit about how rapidly you\u2019re growing that Medical Office development pipeline? And whether all of these projects of project that Duke has developed from the ground up and by that I mean these are not projects that someone else maybe the user had started and you took them over or what but they\u2019re coming from announcement to completion and service they\u2019re coming fairly rapidly.","And also part two to that question, you talked in your prepared comments about being very pleased with the backlog, I think you specifically referred to your Medical Office Building and I am curious whether you think that\u2019s - whether that backlog at this point this year how that compares with where it was a year ago. So maybe if you could talk about to those points?","Denny Oklak","Sure, Jim. Yes. All those projects are projects that we started from the ground up. And my comment on those would be substantially all of these projects are with healthcare systems where we have really a fairly long relationship. You look at places like (inaudible), [Tri Health] that\u2019s a group in Cincinnati, where we\u2019ve had long relationship. Scott & White is healthcare system in Central Texas that we\u2019ve, I think now done four or five projects with over the last roughly 12 to 18 months. [Baylor], we done a number of projects with Baylor over the last five years primarily in the Dallas area market.","So of all those healthcare systems that we have these relationships with are really growing they\u2019re very, very solid healthcare systems they are highly rated they are growing as I mention there are also gearing up for this portable care act as it\u2019s going to drive more folks into the system. We\u2019re also seeing a trend of more acuity type services going into the MOB facilities and that\u2019s something they\u2019re gearing up for.","So we\u2019re seeing just a lot of growth in that area and those are all projects all those MOB projects are projects, we\u2019ve sourced directly with the healthcare institutions. We\u2019ve done the predevelopment services, we\u2019ve done the development services on the land and we\u2019re in some cases, we\u2019re actually doing the construction in a lot of cases, the healthcare systems have relationships with general contractors and we\u2019re using their general contractor relationship folks to actually built them but again it\u2019s a great business right now.","And then looking back I would say today the backlog is probably maybe a little bit higher than it was last year but again if you these projects tend to take longer than say an industrial project on a spec or build-to-suit basis, either one, and so we had a pretty strong pipeline at the beginning of last year when you think that we actually started almost $200 million worth of projects during 2012.","James Sullivan - Cohen & Company","","And I guess the follow-up question as you talked to potential requires obviously we know the product in the segments that you\u2019re interested in selling and I\u2019m sure that some of the folks you\u2019re talking to would be interested maybe in buying some MOB assets as well and the MOB market has been fairly strong. And I\u2019m curious what your opinion is if you think back over the last 12 months is to how cap rates might have moved down for any particular segment in your portfolio, how you would rank to movement in the cap rates for MOB, some of that period?","Denny Oklak","","Well, I think, I just make a couple of specific points on their one is I think the cap rates have been decreasing very significantly and relatively rapidly on the MOB product and in the MOB space in general and the reasons for that as I think people are now starting to understand that product type better and realize all the benefits including long-term leases very high credit, very stable tenant base, low lease expirations. So I think that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been going on probably for 2 or 4 years now, those cap rates keep going down and down and down.","And then again just looking in our portfolio, we\u2019re really not trying to sell our Medical Office portfolio, I would say, we have a couple of isolated assets in there that we might move this year because they just don\u2019t for whatever reason strategically fit-in with what we\u2019re trying to do, but generally speaking, again we really like that product type, we want it to be around 15% of our business right now as of today its about 15% to 16%. We have opportunities to continue to grow that business as we grow our company and again I think it\u2019s a great product type for us to own long term to provide very good stable and growing cash flow for our shareholders.","James Sullivan - Cohen & Company","Okay. Then finally from me in this respect the as you commented the business that has been done primarily so far has been very much relationship driven, where you\u2019re doing multiple projects for healthcare services and then practices that you\u2019ve done business with before, and I\u2019m just curious geographically whether there is in your opinion also scope to grow this your portfolio into geographic markets where you really are less well represented in terms of MOB business.","Denny Oklak","The answer to that question is yes, Jim. And the first point I\u2019d make on that is when we talked the last quarter about doing the Seavest acquisition in the MOB space that we did early in the fourth quarter, one of the reasons of that was very attractive to us, is it helped us begin relationships with some new hospital systems. A Florida hospital in Florida, we did not have a relationship there and we didn\u2019t really have any MOB in Florida and no healthcare system which is in the basically in the Washington DC, the mid-Atlantic region. And that\u2019s helped us start some relationships with those hospital systems.","And then one of the things we really haven\u2019t done yet is look much in the Western half of the country for that piece of the business, but with our abilities there, I think going forward there will continue to be opportunities for us to expand geographically including west.","James Sullivan - Cohen & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Jim.","Christie Kelly","Thanks Jim. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of [Eric Franco] with Green Street Advisors.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon. I was just wondering could you go through disposition pipeline and just give a broad mix of what will be retail, will be office?","Denny Oklak","","Well again, I think Brendan said it a little earlier, I think if you look at our target disposition less its probably, roughly 50% suburban in office and may be 30% the retail assets that we have left, which again primarily consist of 3 assets and then a little bit as I said, we\u2019ve got a little bit of MOB probably 2 or 3 projects we may try to move this year and then we still have a little bit of that flex industrial space but not much of that as we continue to sell that.","So that\u2019s really what the pipeline is and again in dollar perspective, the MOB is probably in the 300 to 500, excuse me, the suburban office is in the $300 million to $500 million range. The retail is in the $250 million to $300 million range, the Medical Office will certainly be below $100 million and I would say the Flex product price below $50 million. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And is that a (inaudible) interest as well, like is that gross number?","Denny Oklak","Yes. That\u2019s a gross number.","Unidentified Analyst","Gross number, okay. And Denny, I think you talked about last call which is about couple of move outs in your industrial portfolio including a Walmart warehouse in Savannah, just wondering is that included in guidance that is maybe progressed in really some of those spaces?","Denny Oklak","Well, I\u2019m glad, you asked that Eric. Actually yesterday we signed 500,000 square foot backfill of that 800,000 square feet, come on down time with Walmart and in the new tenant moving in. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that and quite honestly we didn\u2019t have all of that in our guidance but that\u2019s not a -- in the overall scheme of the company it\u2019s not that but what I would say that\u2019s say as and as I said in the prepared remarks, the industrial business is really pretty strong all over right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Congrats on that. Just also curious on the development starts, do you intend on purchasing additional land or most of the stock land bank or I guess some of your Medical Office projects?","Denny Oklak","Well first of all I start on the MOB side, we virtually acquired no land there. 95+% of those projects are on leased land that the hospital owns. And then any other land there is just land that we acquire as we do the project. So we don\u2019t really care any land bank inventory for the MOB business. On the rest of the development, again virtually all of that will come out of our land bank that we have today we\u2019re not acquiring any new land. Occasionally, on the build-to-suit industrial business we would also acquire a parcel of land that the building is starting on as immediately as we\u2019re starting destruction.","Unidentified Analyst","Would it be difficult to venture a guess of how much you intend to monetize that (inaudible) in this year, I think you said about $500 million in your developable land bank is that right?","Denny Oklak","Yes. That\u2019s about right. I would say this year we probably used $25 million to $40 million I would say roughly, I would say probably in that range again this year somewhere between $25 million and $50 million.","","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then I guess just follow-up question on development, how far are you away from spec development a lot of different markets are rents still pretty low or where ours or is it just not enough tenant demand to justify it?","Denny Oklak","Well we started a couple of spec projects last year I guess three including the office building and that I mentioned. We have a spec project under construction in Indianapolis, 600,000 square feet, we have the spec project out in [Chino] which is finishing up here shortly of 420,000 square feet. I think you\u2019ll probably see us start a few more spec projects and again on the industrial side this year, but under a handful is what I would think. Again demand is good, our occupancy is good but the demand backlog has been good but I wouldn\u2019t say again that\u2019s a solid enough position that we will be thinking about starting any more spec buildings in that this year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you. So I am looking at sequential occupancy growth in suburban office. Can you talk a little bit more about where you are seeing some strengthen in that portfolio then your expectations?","Denny Oklak","Well I would say, if I am looking at the markets where I\u2019ve seen some pretty considerable strength clearly Raleigh has been a very strong office market, it continues to do well. Indianapolis has done fairly well. We have seen some big lease activity in what is not a very big portfolio that we have here, but it\u2019s doing well.","Activity we have signed a few leases in Cleveland and that in those handful of remaining buildings that we have. We\u2019ve seen some increase in activity in Cincinnati and in South Florida. St Louis has a few larger prospects they are working on. So I mean again that business isn\u2019t booming Jamie, but we\u2019re starting to see a little bit more consistent leasing activity again around the system. Again I am -- Houston is pretty much unbelievable on the office side right now. I think there are like seven or eight spec office buildings going up down there now and proposed signing our lease this month I think those are in the 50% to 60% lease range now.","So and again I can\u2019t really think of another market where we\u2019re seeing any speculative office projects. So and any other one I would say South Florida we\u2019re starting to see some bigger interest from some of the tenants down there.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","With you is there any -- characterize the kinds of tenants like are there certain sectors that are coming back to life maybe more housing related or is there anything where we are in the cycle you can point to?","Denny Oklak","Jamie I would say no. I think it\u2019s fairly broad based, I can\u2019t think of any one sector that we\u2019re starting to see a lot of activity in. Clearly Raleigh is always driven a lot by tech and pharmaceutical and I can\u2019t, nothing is jumping out me that I would say is an industry that\u2019s really growing.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay and then I am sorry if I missed it. Did you guys give any expected yield on your acquisition activity?","Denny Oklak","We did not, but I think again we\u2019re focused on the bulk industrial in the key distribution markets around the country. So today on acquisitions if we\u2019re doing some core acquisitions it\u2019s probably 6.5 to 7.25 maybe. If we\u2019re doing some value add like the one we did in Chicago its probably 7.5 to 8. So that\u2019s really where we are looking for these yields to fall this year and again that\u2019s an in place yield.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","I thought [Clove] was lower.","Denny Oklak","Depends on what markets you go to. It\u2019s clearly lower in Southern California today, but you haven\u2019t really seen as buy much there since towards the beginning of last year we didn\u2019t really do a whole lot in Southern California in the second half of the year, because it\u2019s gotten very expensive. But I think the core properties again in markets outside Southern California, but still core distribution markets are in that range.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay. And then of the $300 million to $500 million range how much of that you think will be core versus value add?","Denny Oklak","Well it\u2019s a little hard to say because generally the value add are probably going to be more one-off buildings. Core could be not large portfolios, but portfolio so I think it will probably be 50-50 or maybe 60-40 core to value add this year.","Christie Kelly","Just to give you a little perspective Jamie, since fourth quarter of \u201809, we have moved or we\u2019ve invested in and what\u2019s better than core and value add I\u2019d call it over 90% leased and under 90% leased. We have invested over $1 billion and a billion and some change in 90% leased or higher, and we\u2019ve invested $1.4 billion at less than 90%. So I think some of these numbers are pretty good and I wonder further out there because we get a lot of commentary around, gee with why don\u2019t you guys do a little bit more on the lease up side and I just think it\u2019s important to remind ourselves that we\u2019ve actually done a lot of investment as it relates to less than 90% and really driven the performance in those investments as well as on top of the development that we have.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay. So just to make sure, you said $1 billion is 90% or higher and $1.4 billion is 90% or is lower than 90%.","Christie Kelly","That\u2019s correct.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay. Then finally just thinking on medical office and healthcare in general, what are your basic thoughts just on, I mean, there is a lot of discussion about Medicare reimbursement risks or public pay. How are you guys thinking about just the changes and the potential cost structure changes as you guys are putting money to work in that sector.","Denny Oklak","Well again this has I would say relatively little effect on the portfolio that we own if any, because this is all healthcare systems that for the most part are private pay. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there are some Medicare reimbursements from patients that are in those hospitals and are being served by the doctors in those facilities, but again it\u2019s just not a very significant piece of the kind of business we are doing. So we don\u2019t have any concerns about any changes there at all.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","If you underwrite their credit with some lower revenue in the future or not really, or you think it\u2019s not even that significant? ","Denny Oklak","It\u2019s not even as significant, but I am telling you the credit we are getting in these MOB\u2019s is unbelievable. I mean, we are getting generally above A rated credit on all of our leases, because the trend that\u2019s happening now Jamie is the hospital systems themselves are buying these physician practices and they are putting them in their MOB\u2019s on their campus and the hospitals are actually on the leases themselves. So we are getting better and better credit in those facilities too.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon. Just want to go back to Brandon\u2019s question. Is the ATM issuance needed to fund the pipeline you betted in the guidance at this point or is it not?","Christie Kelly","We are substantially done Michael. I mean, you know to the extent that we issue on the ATM. I mean, you\u2019ll see us do that very selectively. We overfunded on the equity offering. We are driving cash from operations and were net disposition activity based on our plans. So\u2026","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So the balance is expected to be funded with net disposition proceeds and available cash?","Christie Kelly","Potentially yes, that\u2019s correct.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. You gave expectations for the overall portfolio. Can you give kind of same store expectations for the industrial portfolio in \u201813, kind of your thoughts in terms of rent rules as well as kind of the occupancy target for year end?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think, you know, we had very nice same property NOI growth in the industrial portfolio in 2012 at 3.1%, which I think was very strong which included - again some of that was from some average occupancy increase and some of that was from the increase in rental rates. Obviously at 94.6% leased at the end of the year I think in the industrial portfolio there is going to less improvement in NOI growth from occupancy pickup, but we do have some good rental rate growth and now embedded in that portfolio particularly on acquisitions as we have done more and more of the markets we operate in have annual rent bumps in the industrial leases. So I think you will see that the NOI growth on the industrial business fee in the probably 1% to 1.5% range this year and then a little bit more of that growth coming from the suburban office just as we anticipate some occupancy increases and from the strong MOB portfolio, which will again come from a little bit of occupancy improvement. Some of our acquisitions had some vacancies in them. Some of our, I would say a little bit older developments had some vacancy that we are getting leased up and then those leases all have very strong rental rate growth built into it.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Hopeful, of the $400 million to $600 million that you expect to sell, how much of that is currently on the market and you have $150 million under contract and how much of that would be on the $150 million that\u2019s under contract how much of that would you expect to be kind of portfolio sales versus kind of one off transaction?","Denny Oklak","It\u2019s always a little hard to define what\u2019s on the market. I mean, a lot of people know what we are trying to sell so we get, we are in discussions with a lot people that on selling some of those assets it may not necessarily directly be marketed through a broker. So a fair amount of that is already out there on the market. I would say on the retail side those three centers we have will probably be one off transactions just because of their geographic location. The suburban office sales will probably be a combination of single asset sales and smaller portfolios more two, three, four assets rather than I don\u2019t anticipate this year seeing a bigger portfolio transaction occur.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. As we think about the mix between development and acquisition, what spread do you need between let\u2019s say a speculative property versus - a speculative construction versus an acquisition as well as a build-to-suit versus an acquisition today, just given the 7.25 that your pipeline is currently going at?","Denny Oklak","Well, I would say today probably there is not a whole lot of difference between the build-to-suit and the acquisition yields today in this market to be honest with you. In previous cycles there was probably more, but today it\u2019s maybe 25 to 50 basis points. Then I would say between acquisition yields and spec development it\u2019s probably 150 to 200 basis point spread before we are willing to take that lease up risk today.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s across the MOB sector as well as the suburban office sector as well?","Denny Oklak","Yeah. But we\u2019re, two things on MOB. First of all as we said we are really not looking for acquisitions there. We did the one, larger one last year to again because it was very strategic for us and then we are really focused more on the development side there and any more there is very little speculative space in that MOB stuff that we are developing. It\u2019s for the last, you know, I would say year and half it has been almost all substantially preleased.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","That would characterize you come by that kind of 20 to 30 basis point spread you talked about for build-to-suit. Am I looking at that correctly?","Denny Oklak","Yeah. But I guess I would clarify that that I think our yields on the development even the build-to-suit development on the MOB side are probably more in the 120 to 150 basis point spread above acquisition yields today.","Christie Kelly","And we are good at that.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s from me guys. Thank you.","Christie Kelly","Thanks Michael.","Operator","And our next question comes from [Thom Tupelo] with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, the equity issuance, obviously you guys came a long way in getting towards your balances sheet goals that you outlined in that strategic plan and assuming that you do achieve the kind of the growth in the portfolio, you\u2019ve laid out and you do accomplish all those goals. Do you think these goals are still appropriate, since you laid them out all of your competitors had a delevered even further. And even there\u2019s new balance sheet goals that still seem a little out of (inaudible) versus your peers, a little too wide so just some commentary on whether or not you think it\u2019s still appropriate there?","Christie Kelly","I think what I had mentioned in the remarks is that, we\u2019re substantially of the way there, as it relates to the capital strategy goals that we set out in the \u201809 time period and we\u2019re going to continue to work at - even further strengthening our balance sheet while maintaining substantial liquidity. So we\u2019re going to keep at it, and we\u2019ve made a lot of great progress, as you know.","Unidentified Analyst","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dave Rogers with Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers - Baird","Hey, Denny you mentioned you were positive on both industrial and office and then at least your outlook in your view, how much of the activity that you\u2019ve seen if you can [handy camp] it would be, kind of reconfiguration, trading up or actually net growth in the market?","Denny Oklak","I would say, let\u2019s start with the industrial business. But I think more of it is net growth to date, than we\u2019ve probably been seeing over the last 3 or four years, but clearly when you look at the overall industrial statistics Dave. For the last, really two and a half to three years, it\u2019s been positive net absorption, here so, it\u2019s net growth. I would say there\u2019s a little less consolidation than we saw inactivity of probably two or three years ago, although there\u2019s still some of that going on. So I think mostly it\u2019s net growth.","Again, on the office side today I would tell you it\u2019s mostly net growth also. These are tenants that are whatever reason are their business is good, getting better and so they need space to grow. There\u2019s still some consolidation going on there that we try to be a beneficiary of with our product but we\u2019re starting to see some true net growth in the office sector too.","Dave Rodgers - Baird","Thanks. And maybe just focusing on industrial then real quickly, it sound like you expect to see some positive rents spreads for the year, but are you surprised that you haven\u2019t seen more positive moves in market rent growth, and do you expect to see more of the market rent growth in the course of the next 12 months?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we\u2019ll see some Dave. One of the issues, it\u2019s still in the industrial businesses is the low interest rates are keeping the cap rates really low. And so that could pressure on the rental rate growth but now as you\u2019re starting to see a lot of these markets get up into the mid-90%s percent leased overall and again still fairly limited spec development. And they\u2019re starting to be some nice upward pressure on rental rates which is great.","Dave Rodgers - Baird","You are starting to see that okay. And then how much development do you think you can handle with your current G&A load before you want add some personnel?","Denny Oklak","I think we can easily wherever we are today and probably, if you think we start at $520 million last year I think easily another $100 million to a little bit more. You know, and some of it depends on the mix, as I mentioned earlier, a fair amount of our healthcare related development is built by outside contractors but, bottom line is, you\u2019re not going to see us adding any overhead, because I just don\u2019t think. We\u2019re not inclined to grow that development pipeline, you know a whole lot more than the $500 million to $600 million. And that\u2019s pretty good, that\u2019s a pretty good annual pace.","Christie Kelly","And to that point Dave, remember sort of back in the \u201809 time period we really sized our business to that $500 million to $600 million development pipeline that Denny\u2019s talking about. Two points, you know, one; we want to manage the development pipeline and risk profile appropriately, in relation to our total growth assets, to make sure that we are performing above our ratings as it relates to Moody\u2019s and S&P. The second thing too is that, as it relates to spec, as a piece of development within, there we\u2019re also managing that such that the speculative developments that we take on is also appropriately managed. So that it doesn\u2019t take away from the overall strong performance of our company in terms of occupancy and total dollars if you will at risk from a spec perspective.","Dave Rodgers - Baird","Okay. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a fair question, but I\u2019ll ask it anyway, how much better would the balance sheet need to be if the build-to-suit pipeline became a more speculative oriented pipeline? Would that change your view on where leverage and coverage metrics were?","Christie Kelly","No. No it wouldn\u2019t. I mean, a couple of the things as it relates to leverage. If you guys look at sort of the leverage at debt plus preferred, less than 50% as well as driving our coverage ratios below 7.75 and above 2 fixed charge coverage, we\u2019ve made substantial progress in that regard and you know the rating agencies are pleased with our progress and we\u2019re going to continue to drive that EBITDA particularly given the strong performance at the investments that we\u2019ve made today, together with the strength of our development pipeline. So no, it would not.","And leverage to part of that just from a total market cap perspective, will also come into play are multiple further improves.","Dave Rodgers - Baird","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Christie Kelly","You bet.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And there are no further questions in queue.","Christie Kelly","Thank you everybody.","Denny Oklak","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you during the year at various industry conferences as well as getting you out towards some of our regional markets. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"8003":["Duke Realty Corp (NYSE:DRE) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 30, 2015  3:00 PM ET","Executives","Ron Hubbard - IR","Denny Oklak - Chairman & CEO","Jim Connor - Senior EVP & COO","Mark Denien - EVP & CFO","Analysts","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities","Stephen Dye - Robert W.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we refer you to our December 31, 2014, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement I will turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight our key metrics for the quarter and some of our thoughts on the overall real estate and economic environment. Jim Conner will give you an update on our leasing activity and development status. I will review our disposition activity, including some of the major transactions that closed just after quarter end in April and Mark will then address our first quarter financial performance and balance sheet activity.","We followed up our very strong 2014 with a solid start to 2015. We signed 6.5 million square feet of leases in the first quarter and ended with overall occupancy at 94.5%, including projects under development. The occupancy of our in-service portfolio was 96%.","Rents and renewal leases for the quarter grew by nearly 8.4%, reflecting continued strong and supply demand fundamentals and pricing power. We started $80 million of new bulk industrial development projects and we have a strong backlog of both industrial and medical office projects and expect development starts to accelerate in the coming quarters.","With the closing of the previously announced $1.1 billion office sale, bulk distribution now makes up over 70% of our total NOI and medical office is approaching 20%. The overall fundamentals and operating environment for our business remains strong. On the industrial front, our occupancies remained at or near historic highs. New supply in substantially all markets is in balance and demand for modern bulk space is still high. Our outlook is for these fundamentals to continue to be favorable for the remainder of 2015.","The medical office development business is also seeing a significant pickup in demand, driven by major hospitals adjusting their service delivery models. At this point in the cycle, we see continued opportunities to create value through our development platform.","Now I will turn it over to Jim to give you some color on our first quarter operations.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Denny. Operationally we had another solid quarter with leasing of 6.5 million square feet, as Denny noted earlier. Our total in-service occupancy ended the quarter at 96%. That's up 70 basis points from the previous quarter.","Our tenant retention was high at 77% and our rental rate growth on renewals continues to be strong across the portfolio with growth of 8.4%. We're very focused on pushing rents throughout the portfolio, in particular on the industrial side.","Now let me touch on some of the key activity within each of our product types. With respect to our industrial portfolio, we continue to see fundamentals improve with completion of 6.2 million square feet of total leasing, including 1.2 million square feet of build-to-suit or partially preleased developments and 842,000 square feet of leasing in our recently completed spec projects. Overall, industrial market fundamentals remain positive with 21 of our 22 markets at 94% occupancy or better and all realizing positive market rent growth.","In-service occupancy in the bulk industrial portfolio at the end of the quarter was 96.8%. That's up 100 basis points over a year ago. Compared to the general market vacancy in 22 markets, our in-service occupancy is outperforming those markets by 330 basis points.","Regarding specific lease activity, we signed six deals totaling 842,000 square feet in four speculative projects in Houston and northern New Jersey. Two notable leases, including a 358,000 square foot lease with McKesson Corporation to occupy 100% of our Gateway Northwest One project in Houston and a 282,000 square foot lease with a food and beverage company to lease 57% of one of our two speculative projects in our Legacy Commerce Center in Linden, New Jersey.","We also signed three other leases totaling 144,000 square feet to bring the second speculative project in Linden to 100% leased. With these leases, occupancy in Houston has improved from 86.2% at year-end to 98.4% and New Jersey has improved from 73% to 83.8% which is evidence we continue to deliver on speculative projects ahead of pro forma.","Also contributing to growth in our industrial occupancy were four new leases signed in Savannah totaling 692,000 square feet, bringing occupancy up there to 94.7% from a year-end occupancy of 85.9%. With the tightening of conditions across most of our markets and high occupancies in our own portfolio, we continue to be able to push rents as indicated by the rent growth on renewal in our industrial leases of nearly 9% which is a range which we expect to be able to maintain throughout 2015.","Now let me touch on the medical office portfolio. We continue to have strong momentum with our in-service occupancy remaining at 94.2% and a robust list of prospects for future development to go along with our existing development pipeline. The development fundamentals for modern medical space coupled with long-term leases with rent escalations and top tier tenant roster provide an excellent risk-adjusted return component to our overall portfolio.","I would also like to make an announcement on a leadership transition in our medical office platform. Jim Bremner, the President of our Healthcare division, will be stepping down this summer after leading the reins of that business for the last 10 years.","Looking back, Jim and his deeply talented team grew our healthcare business from just under 800,000 square feet and nine buildings in 2007 to over 6 million square feet and 77 buildings today, representing 18% of our overall business. On behalf of the Duke Realty team we want to acknowledge Jim's great leadership and hard work in growing the platform, his flawless execution of strategic and profitable investment and development transactions and an appreciation for his cultivation of a very deep and talented medical office leadership team.","As many of you know or have seen firsthand in our markets, Duke Realty has always been very focused on talent development and retention of the best professionals in the business. With this, we're pleased to announce that Keith Konkoli, an 18-year veteran of Duke Realty, will assume leadership of the Healthcare team effective July 1, 2015.","Keith has been a leader and an integral part of our healthcare business for the past seven years. We have the utmost confidence that Keith will assume this new leadership role and continue to generate profitable, relationship-driven medical developments with our premier healthcare system clients. As Denny alluded earlier, Keith and his team have a very strong pipeline of the development deals for 2015 and beyond.","We also note that Jim Bremner is not going away completely. Jim will enter into a consulting agreement with us for the next year to help assist with any transition needs. Let me also say that the team of professionals at our medical office have risen to be one of the very best development franchises of the country, a development franchise that has fit very well into the Duke Realty culture of being reliable, highly-trusted partners.","While operationally there may not be many synergies between the medical office and industrial business, the medical office niche is a complementary growth business from a development and construction franchise perspective, particularly the build-to-suit strategy. And medical is complementary from the long-term durable nature of cash flows perspective, very similar to our bulk industrial product.","Turning to development for the quarter, we started 80 million square feet of build-to-suit and partially preleased projects totaling 1.3 million square feet with a weighted average GAAP yield of 7%. As Denny noted, we have a very solid pipeline for prospects for the remainder of the year.","We started two projects in Chicago in our Butterfield Corporate Park totaling 742,000 feet. Both facilities were 100% preleased build-to-suits for Shorr Packaging and Fellowes corporation, with lease terms of 12 and 10 years, respectively. We also started a 451,000 square foot build-to-suit project in our AllPoints Midwest Park in Indianapolis. This facility is 100% preleased to Integrated Distribution Services for a term of over 13 years.","Finally, in Washington DC we started a 94,000 square foot industrial project at our TransDulles Center near Dulles International Airport. That facility is 57% preleased. On the land side, during the quarter we sold $35 million of nonstrategic parcels at a book gain of $5.5 million, or a 16% margin. Additionally we monetized another 14 million of land in related development projects.","From an overall development pipeline perspective, at quarter end we have 19 projects under construction totaling 5.2 million square feet and a projected $405 million in stabilized costs at our share that are 55% preleased. These projects have an initial cash yield of 7.1% and a GAAP yield of 7.8% and provide evidence of our ability to create significant value as they are being developed at high-teens margins of value over cost.","Given that we have title land positions that can support roughly 48 million square feet of bulk industrial product and given our relationships and track record at winning major build-to-suit proposals with top customers, our development platform is in a dominant position to drive incremental cash flow growth over the long haul.","I will now turn it back over to Denny to cover our investment activities for the quarter.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Jim. With respect to the investment activity, we closed $161 million of dispositions during the quarter, including transactions that represented the completion of our exit from the Cleveland office market and the exit from the retail property sector. Further, on the disposition front, we announced early in April that we successfully closed a $1.1 billion suburban office portfolio sale to an affiliate of Starwood Capital that was originally announced in late January.","The transaction divests all the company's wholly-owned, in-service, suburban office properties located in Nashville, Raleigh, South Florida and St. Louis and is consistent with our strategy of opportunistically reducing our investment in suburban office. After the closing of the Starwood office sale, our percent of NOI from suburban office is down to roughly 12% and in the context of our 2015 earnings guidance and disposition strategy, suburban office should be in the single digit percentage by year-end.","Let me also once more frame the office sales strategy as follows. The abundance of private capital chasing commercial real estate now and given the unencumbered nature of the portfolio which made it attractive from the buyer's perspective, we firmly believe the execution pricing and the use of the proceeds toward industrial and MOB development and towards significant balance sheet deleveraging is a big win for our shareholders.","Also, just after the Starwood closing in mid-April, we closed on a 5.2 million square foot older industrial portfolio primarily located in the Midwest, generating proceeds of $270 million. This transaction represents the majority of the 5.9 million square foot Midwest industrial portfolio we began marketing in the fourth quarter of 2014 and as we've previously disclosed on the October and January earnings calls. The other 700,000 square feet of this portfolio was sold in a separate transaction in the first quarter.","The average age of these industrial properties was 23 years compared to 10 years for the remainder of our industrial portfolio. With these two post-quarter transactions, dispositions for the year already total $1.5 billion, just below the midpoint of our guidance. The remaining dispositions for the year will be focused on additional suburban office properties.","So with that, I will now turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and capital transactions.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Denny. Core FFO was $0.31 per share for the first quarter of 2015, compared to $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in FFO was primarily due to realizing the benefit of the full-quarter dividend savings from the preferred stock redemptions that we completed in late 2014.","In addition to the preferred dividend savings, the increase of $0.03 per share and the $0.28 per share of core FFO reported in the first quarter of 2014 was driven by improved occupancy and rental rate growth, as well as the impact of developments being placed in service. We generated $0.28 per share in core AFFO for the quarter which equates to a dividend payout ratio of 61%.","Same property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended March 31, 2015, was 5.4% and 6.8%, respectively. Same property operating expenses decreased from prior periods due to milder winter conditions the first quarter of 2015, but this was generally offset by a decrease in reimbursement revenue, so this did not really have a significant impact on overall net operating income.","The significant growth for the quarter in NOI was mainly due to our positive results in driving occupancy higher and rental rate growth. We anticipate that same property growth for the remainder of 2015 will moderate a bit from the first quarter level as occupancy growth slows, but will continue to be strong which resulted in our increased guidance for the year.","As Denny noted, shortly after the end of the quarter we closed on a $1.1 billion suburban office portfolio disposition and a $270 million Midwest bulk industrial portfolio disposition. Using the proceeds from these transactions, we've repurchased $425 million of face value unsecured notes as part of a $500 million debt tender offer, repaid a significant portion of our unsecured line of credit, repaid an additional $137 million of secured debt and still retained enough cash to cover our capital needs for the rest of the year.","All of these capital transactions, coupled with our operational performance, resulted in a continued trend of improvement in our key financial metrics. We reported a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.7 times for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and we expect fixed charge coverage to approximate 3.0 times by the end of the year.","Net debt to EBITDA for the rolling 12 months ended March 31, 2015, was 6.9 times compared to the 7.8 times that we reported for the rolling 12 months ended one year ago. After adjusting for the April dispositions and debt repayments, pro forma net debt to EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2015, is down to 6.2 times.","We're very proud of the progress we have made in improving our overall leverage profile and having reported another strong quarter. With that I will turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Mark. Yesterday we narrowed our guidance for FFO per share for 2015 to $1.13 to $1.19 and also raised our guidance for adjusted funds from operations per share to $0.98 to $1.04 per share. We also raised same property guidance from a range of 2% to 4% up to a range of 3% to 5% and raised our average occupancy guidance by 50 basis points to 95% to 96%. With solid results in the first quarter and capital markets execution in April, we set the stage for a continued strong 2015 and beyond.","I would also like to personally thank Jim Bremner for all his efforts on behalf of Duke Realty. It's been a great partnership between Jim and I and he has built a terrific business for Duke Realty that will continue to grow under Keith's leadership.","In closing, I will reiterate that we believe our team and our portfolio is in a unique position to take advantage of the strong fundamentals in our businesses. The value creation potential for shareholders is very high. We thank you again for your interest and support of Duke Realty.","We will now open up the lines to the audience and we ask that participants to keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions. You are, of course, welcome to get back in queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will go to the line of Vance Edelson. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson","So with the weaker GDP figures just out, there has been a lot of talk about the temporary impact from West Coast labor disputes and the severe weather in other parts of the country. Your leasing activity was obviously quite strong in the first quarter, so do you think there was any material impact from any nonrecurring events that might have weighed on GDP? Or do you feel more like it was business as usual for Duke?","Jim Connor","Vance, I will tell you I think it's been business as usual. There's been a lot of dialogue, particularly about the ports of LA and Long Beach. The quarter-end numbers that have just been posted out of California are very encouraging. March was the strongest month ever for the Port of Long Beach and the second-strongest month ever for the Port of LA, so clearly they are clearing up that backlog quicker than anticipated. We were recently told as of 10 days ago there were only five ships waiting in the bay; that's down from 30-some.","So I think that's one of those temporary things that happens every 5 to 10 years. It gets worked out and we're back to business as usual. I think if you drill down into the markets and you look at some of the absorption numbers in LA, particularly the Inland Empire, very, very strong numbers for the first quarter.","Inland Empire had 4 million square feet of net absorption. For those of you keeping track, that is a 400 million square foot market, so that's 1% net absorption in one quarter.","Vance Edelson","And then just for my second short question, you mentioned the strong office pricing making this a good time to divest. What can you tell us about the demand for land and your experience selling the 147 acres? You pocketed a modest gain there. Were you pleased with the bidding and have land prices continued to climb this year?","Jim Connor","I think, as you would logically follow, with the amount of development that we're seeing in all sectors across the country now is a great time for us to sell land. So we have been very active in selling primarily office land as well as some of the nonstrategic industrial land or some residual pieces that we might have. We were very pleased with the pricing and the amount of activity in the first quarter and what we believe is a very strong pipeline to continue to move that land for the rest of the year.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Jamie Feldman.","Jamie Feldman","So, Denny in your prepared remarks I think you said that you feel good about operations through the end of the year and we're in April already. I'm just curious if you have any window at this point on supply pipelines as we head into 2016. I know it's taking longer to build these days and entitlements are harder to come by, so just any preliminary thoughts?","Denny Oklak","I'm going to let Jim respond to that because we -- in all of our markets that we're in we very closely track all the, I will call [Technical Difficulty] plan developments. Our local market guys pretty much know what's going on, so Jim will give you some color on that.","Jim Connor","Sure. Jamie, just a couple of bullet points that I think we all see from the service providers and the different research companies. On the supply side, supply is up about 9% in the first quarter, but at the same time vacancy across the country is down. It's roughly 8.5%. You had totally last year 117 million of new supply and 130 million square feet of net absorption, so I think all the market dynamics are functioning well. And until we see a quarter or two of slowdown or narrowing of that gap, I think everybody is pretty optimistic right now that the foreseeable future looks pretty good.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then we have seen a lot of institutional capital flowing into the sector. Any interest in selling off portfolios of higher quality warehouse, given where pricing has moved?","Denny Oklak","No, Jamie, I don't think so. You know that -- I don't think there's anybody in the business that has sold more than we have over the last four or five years. The good news is we have really cleaned up the portfolio. And I say this and I think people are beginning to believe me; that we've got the highest quality industrial and highest quality medical office portfolios in the business today. And that now makes up 70% of our NOI -- excuse me, almost 90% of our NOI.","So we're very comfortable with that portfolio. It's performing really on an outstanding basis. As I noted in the remarks, we have still got a bit of office to sell and really what we have left after this is just some office properties in Cincinnati and Indianapolis and then some miscellaneous joint venture office assets that are spread around the country where we're a minority partner in basically all of those.","So right now we're focused on marketing some of the Cincinnati office assets that we have remaining and we're seeing pretty good activity on that. Then the other thing we did, obviously, was with this, what we call the Midwest industrial package, we really cleaned up the industrial portfolio. So we're very pleased with where we're and like our ability to really grow our earnings from this portfolio going forward.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Can you maybe comment on how you view your portfolio quality compared to that of the KTR deal that recently transacted? And if you want -- and feel free to comment on your opinion on the cap rate on that deal, if you thought it was in line with your expectations or lower or higher.","Denny Oklak","Well, I always hesitate to comment on what other people are doing, but I'll give you a few thoughts here. I think, we obviously looked at the disclosure that was made on that transaction; it's always helpful to understand what's going on in the market, like I'm sure you all did.","I believe the number was KTR's portfolio was average age of 18 years. Prologis I think pre was 23 years, so they are averaging down to 21 or something like that. As I mentioned in our remarks, after this most recent sale of our -- the smaller, older industrial stuff, we're at about a 10-year average age.","Now having said that, age doesn't always matter. It is location and particularly in high barrier industrial markets older properties generally do very well. I would say, if I'm looking at the KTR portfolio, we know that portfolio reasonably well because we compete with those guys and have known them for a long time.","They have a pretty good older, I would say, properties in places like New Jersey, some in Southern California, some in a couple submarkets in Chicago that are older properties but they are very good properties. They had really grown their portfolio over the last couple years with development projects which they hadn't really done very much of before that. One of their bigger customers was Amazon.","They have done a lot of development for Amazon over the last couple of years and, of course, we have done a lot of development with Amazon over the last few years too. So those were some of the newer, modern bulk facilities.","Guess what I would say is I think overall it was generally a good portfolio. It was quite a mixed portfolio. Ours really is today focused on the modern bulk, newer projects and as you can see, they are doing extremely well when you look at our occupancy.","As far as the cap rate goes, even I would say everybody can see all the transactions that are out there. I would say that was a reasonably aggressive cap rate, but there's a lot of pretty aggressive people chasing industrial product today so cap rates, I think, continue to compress. I am not one to try to predict what the right cap rate is, but it certainly looked like it was a line generally with the transactions we have seen in the market here lately.","Ki Bin Kim","That was all really helpful color. Just one last thing, one last question for me. You have really transformed the portfolio over the past three years in a pretty dramatic way. It looks like it's largely done, the major pieces that had to move, but if a deal of something similar of KTR's size or quality came to the market, would you be highly interested in that? Or at the point where you are, do you think, you know what, you don't need to do megadeal like that and maybe just incremental one-off acquisitions and development is where you want to spend most of your time on? So how do you balance maybe the two different possible options you have?","Denny Oklak"," I would say, for us the issue today I think on doing a major transaction a little bit is pricing. Pricing is pretty aggressive out there. So for a major transaction for us, if there was one out there, I think it would have to have a lot of significant strategic advantages for us.","And what I would define those as, generally speaking, is it would have to really expand our portfolio in some of the markets that we don't have a big presence in today. Then I think we would consider it, but we don't feel like we have to do anything. As I said, we're in great shape now that we've completed this repositioning.","We have terrific development capabilities within this company. We have a great reputation on the development side. We have a land bank that is in excellent position for us to do industrial development really in all the major markets. And, clearly, in today's market I would say development yields on the industrial side have gotten a bit compressed, too, but there's still a significant gap between the development yields and what you can buy anything at today.","We're very happy, at this point in the cycle, doing the development, funding it wisely and keeping our balance sheet in great shape as we look forward to the next part of the cycle.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Eric Frankel.","Eric Frankel","I was hoping you can give a bit of a breakdown of some of the dispositions that you've executed during the quarter and then the bigger industrial portfolio outside the quarter. If you could provide little bit more cap rate color just to get an understanding of where those traded. Thanks.","Denny Oklak","Yes, let me get the list here, Eric. And, you know, just we try not to disclose specific transactions. We have been very cautious about that for competitive reasons and for buyers' reasons, but I would say just some color on this.","As I mentioned in prepared remarks, the industrial portfolio got split out between two buyers, because we have one buyer that was very interested in the Minneapolis assets and the other buyer that we had didn't really -- wasn't -- they didn't need to have those assets I guess. They were fine with not -- closing of the rest of the portfolio without those. So we did close in the first quarter on the Minneapolis portion of that industrial which is about 100,000 square feet. Cap rate on that was kind of in the mid-6%s, so I think we did obviously very well on that.","And then we also, as we said, sold the rest of the office buildings in Cleveland and we sold the shops at Montage. Those were obviously higher cap rate assets and the occupancy was generally pretty low in those, so the in-place cap rate on those was in the high single digits. I would say between the 9% and 10% range.","And then overall, for the first quarter, we were at about 8.1%. We essentially disclose sort of the cap rate on a suburban office sale. You can see the NOI that we had taken out and we put it in the back of the supplemental this time.","The NOI that we took out in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter annualized there and that's very similar to how we showed the economics of the transaction with the Blackstone sale three or four years ago now. So I think that one's pretty self-explanatory. And then I think we also did very well on the Midwest, the rest of the Midwest industrial sale that closed in early April. And that cap rate we will disclose.","You will see that in the second quarter, but I think for the type of portfolio that it was, as we said, it was an average of 23 years old and basically just over 100,000 square foot buildings. I can't remember exactly what it was, because I'm still looking at the first quarter stuff, but it was I think a very competitive pricing.","Mark Denien","Eric, the only other thing I would add on those -- especially on the projects in the first quarter, those were all, if you just think about it, Cleveland office and the Montage retail were all very capital-intensive projects. So on a cash basis, the cap rate on those is a lot lower than the leasing OI cap rate.","Denny Oklak","Yes, their occupancy was low and it would cost you a lot of money to get the occupancy in those up.","Eric Frankel","Just a final question on Jim's departure from the MLB business. Maybe you could expand a little bit more on the platform you have there and the team you have in place and just the confidence of keeping the business going as you have for the past 10 years or I should say about eight years since you formally bought the business from him.","Denny Oklak","I will start, then I'll let Jim chime in. That has been a very stable business. Jim has been, as we both said, a terrific leader of that and really built a great business, but he really has built a great team. He had a great team that he brought with him when he came to Duke, as you said, about eight years ago now and a number of those folks are still with us and are planning on staying with us.","I would say even though the leader, Keith Konkoli, was with Duke pretty much right after the Bremner team came onboard, Keith moved over to work with them and has been an integral part of that. And then three of the other key leaders of that group going forward are all folks that came to Duke with Jim. So we've got great people there and I think we've got great customer relationships that we will continue to move forward. So we're not really worried about continuing the momentum in that business that we have built.","Jim Connor","I think the only other thing, as we transition to Keith, that team is very deep, as Denny alluded to. Our senior leadership there is going to stay the same in terms of the asset management, finance, construction and development leadership. All those guys have been in place, so we think from that perspective it's very stable and we don't think we will lose any ground on the development pipeline that we've got out there.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana","Your guidance outlook -- so your same-store is up 100 basis points. Your average occupancy is up 50, AFFO is up $0.01 at the midpoint and FFO is unchanged at the midpoint. Is it sort of the better NOI growth offset by earlier-than-expected dispositions or something on the capital plan?","Mark Denien","That is actually the main thing, Brendan. Our guidance on dispositions for the year was $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and we've already closed $1.5 billion, so we're already at the low end of the guidance. So I think it's pretty safe to assume we're trending much closer to the top end of the guidance and maybe even a little bit above that from a disposition side. And not only at the top end or a little above, but then your next point was right on as well, the timing of it.","As Denny mentioned, we're ready have several office assets on the market right now in Cincinnati and at the beginning of the year when we gave guidance we were probably looking more towards the end of the year to get some of those deals closed. Now I think we're thinking more like maybe even the end of the second quarter. So it's more about extra dispositions and earlier timing of dispositions that offset some of the good operating results.","The other thing I would point out, I think I mentioned this briefly, we're still sitting on some cash through these office dispositions because we want to fund our development pipeline here for the rest of the year without having to go back to the capital markets. So there is little bit of drag sitting on some cash for the next six months or so as well.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. And just point of clarification. Average occupancy 95% to 96% for the year. Does that compare to average commenced occupancy of 95.1% during Q1 or is that the ending lease-up occupancy of 96.0%?","Mark Denien","No, it does not compare to the 96.0%. It compares to your first number.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, so average kind of moves up a little bit during the year.","Mark Denien","It's an average lease-up basis, Brendan, not an average commencement and not an ending lease-up. I know we throw a lot of those numbers around. So it's average lease signed that 95% to 96% which compares to -- I believe we were at 94.5% last year, as an example.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. And then just last one, the development projects that came online were in line with your average yield last quarter, so it was 7.4 last quarter, 7.4 is what came online. The overall yield came down to 7.1 on the pipeline. Is it more competitive out there in terms of projects, either build-to-suit or spec which is having yield compression hit had current projects that are coming online?","Jim Connor"," Yes, the competition is out there, but I would tell you that is a very, very small component. I would make a couple of points. I would not read too much into the change in numbers from quarter to quarter, because there's a handful of things that change, one of which is the number of build- to-suits versus the number of spec that we have.","Clearly, the yields on build-to-suit are going to be lower than those on spec. It's a mix of industrial versus MLB, how many we've got at any given time. The other big contributing factor is how much of the active projects are in Tier 1 markets versus Tier 2 markets.","And then the last two points I would make, if you go back and you are looking at some of the historical numbers from years gone by or even a few quarters ago, we had some office development mixed in there that had generally some very high yields on it.","Then the last point I would make is just you have to remember in some cases some of those yields are a little bit more compressed because we never impaired any of the land was held for development. So some of that land was land that we bought back in the peak in maybe 2007 or 2008 and have carried it for a little while, but we're putting it in at our (inaudible) without any impairment an developing it. And those are the true adjusted yields.","Operator","And we will go next to line of Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Stephen Dye","Yes, this is Stephen Dye here with Dave. I'm going to switch gears back to kind of some more macro commentary, specifically with regards to the Midwest. You just disposed of maybe your non-core portfolio there. But Indianapolis and Chicago are they seeing strength really from demand from online vendors? And in general, can you just comment on the demand dynamics across the various Midwest markets? Thanks.","Denny Oklak","Sure, Steve. E-commerce continues to be a big driver in our business, so you will see not only the big-name retailers continuing to demand space. And that's not only existing space, spec space, but also build-to-suits. But it's beyond that. I would tell you that retail in general is still very strong. Food, food and beverage, all the food-related services companies are up. The other contributing vector is just the 3PLs which are doing more business with all of the different consumer products companies across the country.","Stephen Dye","And then with regards to the suburban office portfolio, moving into the single digits in terms of NOI by year-end; is there any opportunity there or does that go to zero at some point in the future? And do you have any guidance on that timing?","Denny Oklak","Well, I would say we don't know whether it's going to zero yet. As I mentioned, we're basically -- I think you will see us exit the Cincinnati market here over time, probably over the next 12 to 18 months. The joint ventures will play out with our partners since they're controlling. So the only assets we will have are in Indianapolis which is obviously our hometown. We're actually sitting in one of our office buildings right now which I enjoy being my own landlord. But there are a few Indianapolis, a couple Indianapolis office projects that we will sell here.","Part of the issue is, as Mark was saying, we don't need the money right now because of the two major transactions we just closed this month. We're trying to time the sales with our needs of funds.","Again, I think -- and the only other thing I would point out there is we have just a bit of office land left around the system. As Jim said, we sold a lot of it. We continue to sell a lot of it. We sold some that will come through in the second quarter as part of what we're calling the Starwood transaction.","But we do have a speculative project going up in South Florida and I think we can do two more buildings on that. And that market is still very, very hot, so we will likely develop those out and then decide what to do with them when that's complete. As far as opportunity, yes, there is a little bit there, but we're really now just focused on building the industrial MOBs.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Mike Salinsky. Please go ahead.","Mike Salinsky","So you got the balance sheet where you want right now. You are sitting on cash. Development pipeline is churning out good value creation and acquisitions you are pretty aggressive just in light of the KTR transaction. Any thoughts of potentially ramping up development a bit?","You are still delivering over 7% spread. I mean if you look where the KTR transaction is in place, I think you're talking almost 200 basis points of spread right there, yet you've got leverage now so you've taken risk -- you've reduced the risk profile. So just curious as to any thoughts internally about that.","Denny Oklak","It all depends on who you ask. I would tell you, yes, we could ramp up. We could do five or six spec projects and take that development pipeline up, but we would just be taking on that much more risk. You'd see that prelease percentage of that development pipeline fall dramatically from where it is now at 55%. Most of us, in this room anyway, remember what happened in the market in 2008 when we all had plenty of spec development out there.","We have been trying to be a little bit restrained and just manage that pipeline. We like it in that $500 million to $700 million range. We can continue to get some more build-to-suits. I think you'll see us tee up some more spec project because we have been covering our bets; as we reported this quarter and I think we talked a little bit about last quarter.","The success we had in Houston and New Jersey with those four projects essentially being about 80% leased in total. The next round are -- we've got a few under construction right now, but we will evaluate the market this summer and see where else we want to make some bets.","Mike Salinsky","Then just as my follow-up. In light of the KTR transaction and the pricing on that, is your expectation you will see more hit the market in the back half of the year? Just talking with local guys right now is that kind of an eye-popping price? Do you think that's going to motivate more product on the market than we're seeing currently?","Denny Oklak","Well, there is always a fair amount of industrial product out in the market, but more in smaller one-off or smaller portfolios. You just don't see the big portfolios that often. There aren't that many of them out there.","So I don't think that transaction, Mike, is really going to trigger a big flurry of some other kind of activity here. Because everybody now kind of knows who the major industrial players are out there. There has been a fair amount of consolidation when you look at it over the last few years in the U.S. industrial market.","A lot of it is still in institutional ownership hands; it won't trade much. So I don't think just that transaction itself would trigger a big flurry of other people saying. I think you will see continued assets out in the market, maybe a larger portfolio or two here, but I don't think a whole lot is going to change.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to the line of Michael Bilerman. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Denny, I'm just curious as you think about the KTR deal and one of the big things that drove their pricing obviously was the ability to bring in [indiscernible] for 45% and have the asset management platform and create the fee off of that.","I'm curious, as you look at the transaction, the ability to effectively get 60 million more square feet, well over a 40% increase to your platform which is already the second-largest industrial platform in the U.S., was there any appetite for you to find a capital partner and be able to bring that in-house?","Denny Oklak","Mike, the answer to that is, no, not really. I would just say this. I think our business model as to where we're in our lifecycle here, whatever you want to call it, is probably fairly significantly different than where Prologis is and their business. Obviously a big part of their business is aggregating assets and generating fees, doing development to sell into the funds, as well as operating the portfolio.","We're not looking to be a fee-generating company. We want to have the best real estate and give people -- give our investors return on the real estate assets and create value for our own -- for our shareholders by owning great assets long term that we develop.","And, for us, I guess what I would say is -- one thing I would say that we probably don't really agree with is that we need to be significantly bigger to chase deals with the big major customers out there. We have relationships with all the major customers. We've done deals with them all. They know us. I don't feel like I need 60 million more square feet to do that.","Now if I can find 60 million square feet that I really like and would like to own for the next 10, 15 years that I think is going to perform very well in the right markets, then that is a transaction I would be interested in. But to use somebody else's money to generate fees, that's just not the business model we're running right now.","Michael Bilerman","You talked a little bit about how the Amazon exposure that you have; obviously your largest tenant was KTR's largest tenant. If you think about the developments, the build-to-suits that you pursued with Amazon versus what they did, was there any difference in the lease structure or differences in assets? Because I assume you had probably a look at those build-to-suits as well. I'm just curious as you think about your Amazon efforts versus those or others that are in the marketplace.","Denny Oklak","Well, we don't specifically know probably the terms of their deals. We probably have some pretty good ideas on most of them, but I guess what I would tell you is a couple things on that kind of business and then Jim can chime in too. It's driven by a couple things. One is land positions. If you have the land position where these customers want to be, then you are going to get the business. All these major customers and I'm not just referring to Amazon here, but I think all these big players in the e-commerce business now want to have major -- have good relationships with several major developers.","They are not putting all their eggs in one basket, so they are spreading these deals around and you have seen other REITs do them. We did them. KTR does them. Other folks do them and I think that is -- from their point of view it's a good business philosophy.","And then from our point of view, too, we have been very select on where we build those and only really doing them in the major distribution markets, because a number of those big e-commerce build-to-suits have been done in what I would call tertiary markets. And we're not really interested in that.","And then I guess the last thing I would add is I think the terms -- the industry has evolved is the terms on these big e-commerce distribution centers from a lease structure standpoint have evolved to be relatively standard. They differ from market to market based on pricing and cost of development, but the structures are all fairly similar.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Can I sneak one other quick one in? Just on the operating expenses and I apologize if I missed this on the call, was there anything that drove that down to 2 in the quarter? I know last year was -- had some obviously weather issues on the East Coast. I just didn't know if there was anything particular this quarter versus last year that would have caused a 2% decline in OpEx.","Denny Oklak","Yes, Michael. It's all weather-related. While I know places like Boston had a very bad 2015, we really didn't have it in our markets compared to 2014. We had a ton of snow and actually colder weather driving up heating and things like that in 2014, so it's all weather related.","I would tell you that if you back about that out, that negative 2% change in operating expenses would've probably been more like a 2% increase in operating expenses. But what I did say in my opening remarks, all of those operating expenses are really offset by a decrease in reimbursement revenue as well.","It doesn't look like it in our supplemental because the revenue number is so much bigger. So if you have a dollar of operating expenses and you recover that same dollar, it has much less of a percentage impact on the revenues than it does the expense side. So the expenses look a little bit out of whack, but from a net operating income basis, that whole story is really negligible.","Operator","And we will go to the line of John Guinee. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Quick question, Denny. On the dividend and special dividends, etc., back of the envelope it looks like you guys are going to make a lot of money in 2015 and REIT rules usually require that to be taxed. Can you kind of walk through what that's looking like?","Denny Oklak","Well, I will start and then Mark can chime in and correct me here, John. One of the things we did when we structured the Starwood transaction that you all saw was we structured it as an installment sale basically for tax purposes. That's really what that $200 million of seller financing did for us. And that won't be paid until sometime in 2016. They can pay it off anytime during 2016. And so that will defer some of the gain on that transaction, fairly significant portion, into 2016.","Then we have some possible 1031 transactions. We put some money in escrow from that sale, as Mark said, to fund. I think acquisitions probably won't be very significant this year, but even a few acquisitions can move that taxable number pretty far. We can do some 1031s with that.","Then, third, there are some ways to use 1031 when you're doing some development, if you are buying land or something like that. So we think we can use some.","Truth is, John, we're not really going to know exactly where we're on that until later in the year, when all these other transactions occur. The sale occurred and we know what the gain is. We just don't know how much we're going to be able to push back into that to the deferral piece between now and year-end.","Mark Denien","John, the only other thing I would add to that is we have traditionally had a very conservative methodology on how we treat certain things from a tax perspective, mainly depreciation expense. And, quite frankly, it's because we didn't need any -- we didn't need to accelerate depreciation expense or anything like that because we have never really bumped up against a special dividend issue before.","So we're in the process of just getting started to take a look to see if there are some alternative methodologies we can implement from a tax perspective that may accelerate some depreciation and lower our taxable income and also reduce any special dividend requirement that way. So with all that moving around and going on and what I will call the 1031 clock having just started a week ago, Denny's right; we're not going to have a lot more clarity around with that number may be for probably at least another three to five months.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And speakers, there are no further questions in queue at this time.","Denny Oklak","I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in June in a little over a month. Or if not, we will reconvene during our second-quarter call and it will be scheduled for July 30. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference.

Welcome to the Duke Realty Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and then later we\u2019ll have a quarter-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, the conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead sir.","Ron Hubbard \u2013 Investor Relations","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2011 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now, for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will highlight some of our key accomplishments during the quarter in both our operational and asset strategies. Christie will then address our first quarter financial performance and progress on our capital strategy. Then I\u2019ll finish up with our prepared remarks with some comments about our outlook for the remainder of 2012.","By all accounts, the first quarter was a great success for Duke Reality and I am very proud of our team for their accomplishments. We signed over 8.7 million square feet of leases in the first quarter, the highest quarterly total in 5 years. We have positive net absorption during the quarter of nearly 3.7 million square feet, which rivals our annual net absorption for both 2010 and 2011.","We increased our overall occupancy by 144 basis points to 92.11%, which believe it or not, is our highest level of overall occupancy since the first quarter of 1997. We started development of a $121 million of 100% long-term lease industrial and medical office projects, which will have an average initial stabilize yield of 7.05%. We completed $157 million and $65 million of strategic acquisitions and dispositions respectively. We made continued progress on our asset repositioning strategy. And finally, we issued a $147 million of new common equity and redeemed a $168 million of our preferred shares reducing our overall leverage in accordance with our capital strategy. ","From the macro perspective, we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with the momentum in economic and consumer and business sentiment, which appears to be improving the confidence in our customers to execute new, renewal, or expansion lease decisions as well as execute construction and development transactions. Absorption and occupancies continued to trend up in bulk industrial and medical office, but suburban office continues to tread water with the recovery still a number of quarters in the distance. We are hopeful that the steady economic up tick will continue. They will give us still elevated macroeconomic and geopolitical risk in the Europe and the Middle East. And given the looming political showdown here in the U.S. this fall, we know there are still continued risks to our business.","Fortunately, the execution of our asset and capital strategies the last few years have placed Duke Realty in a strong position for future growth as well as being better able to weather volatility from occasional macroeconomic shocks.","We also renewed 84% of our leases during the quarter and attained an overall rental rate growth on these renewals of 1.8%. We achieved positive same property NOI for the three and 12 months ended March 31, a 4.7% and 3.6% respectively. Other than retail all product type\u2026.","Operator","Mr. Hubbard, this is the operator, we\u2019re not hearing you speak at this time sir. There you go. Okay, we can hear you now.","Denny Oklak \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","The national industrial market continues to slow improvement with demand drivers improving on all fronts. Early indication show first quarter vacancy levels decline to another 10 basis points or so down 20% to 30%, 30 basis points in some of our key markets such as Atlanta and Indianapolis. Rental rate growth is relatively flat nationwide, but some pricing power has returned in select markets. Another recent data point is that the Georgia Port Authority hit an all time cargo tonnage record in March growing at significant 8% over the same period a year ago, which we expect to bode well for our dominant position in Savannah.","With respect to leasing, in our in-service portfolio we completed over 2.8 million square feet of new industrial leases and approximately 3 million square feet of renewal leases, including new leases, on development build-to- suits, our industrial leases totaled over 7.4 million square feet, a record industrial leasing quarter for the company. This leasing activity increased our overall industrial occupancy to 93.6% at March 31. Some of our larger lease deals included the signing of a new deal to back sort of 1.1 million square foot distribution center in Atlanta, that was vacated at year-end.","The tenant is Carter\u2019s, a major children\u2019s clothing retailer who used the facility for their growing Internet sales distribution. This was a great transaction for us as the space was only vacant for three months. The rental rate on this deal was very competitive, but we get nice rent increases and our tenant retrofit cost to backfill this space for 11 years was very low at under $2 per square foot. We also signed leases totaling almost 1.4 million square feet on two build-to-suit development project, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly. Finally, we executed an expansion in renewal industrial lease totaling 321,000 square feet with Ashland Chemical, a Fortune 500 company at our World Park complex in Cincinnati.","The office leasing environment continues to be challenging as expected. Occupancy levels continue to be in the 85% to 86% range as they have been for the last year. Total office leasing for the quarter was 1.1 million square feet with average renewal rents growing just 0.5%. We did sign a sizable expansion and renewal in Washington D.C. with a major tenant Citor in our building in the Westfields. On the medical office front, leasing activity and development opportunities continue to gain traction. Our medical office portfolio occupancy increased by 115 basis points from year end to 90.1% and we started one new development projects, which will \u2013 I\u2019ll cover in a minute.","Healthcare providers appear to be gaining more confidence in their growth prospects and are pulling the trigger on expansion plans. We have a solid backlog of leasing and development prospects for the remainder of 2012. We also made good progress on our asset strategy during the quarter. We acquired $157 million of properties. These acquisitions included a two building, 1 million square foot bulk industrial portfolio in Columbus, Ohio that is 86% leased to three tenants. We also acquired an 827,000 square foot bulk industrial facility in Chicago that is 100% leased to Crate & Barrel. The rest of the acquisition activity was in medical office. We acquired a portfolio of three medical office buildings in Cincinnati from an existing customer. The buildings totaled a 109,000 square feet and are 100% leased for 15 years to Bethesda North Hospital. We also acquired a 105,000 square foot medical office building in Chicago that is 100% leased for 19 years to Loyola University Medical Center.","Disposition activity was relatively light this quarter with $65.3 million sold of which 46.2 million was from seven suburban office assets, which were only 81% leased and $17.5 million from six non-strategic mostly flex industrial assets in the rest from land. The non-core suburban office industrial dispositions comprised approximately 458,000 and 735,000 square feet respectively and had a weighted average age of over 21 years.","Now, turning to development, I am pleased to report that our development starts this quarter, are off to the strongest start in several years. A testament to what we believe is a best-in-class development platform. We began 1.5 million square feet of 100% pre-lease industrial and medical projects consistent with our asset and operating strategy. In total, at the end of the quarter we have 2.4 million square feet across nine projects underway that are over 96% pre-leased in the aggregate.","During the quarter, one new industrial development was started in Middletown, Delaware, totaling just over 1 million square feet, which is a 100% pre-leased for 12 years. One new medical office development was also started, a 117,000 square foot facility in Tampa which is a 100% leased to the VA for 20 years. And we started a 375,000 square foot industrial project in Indianapolis that is 100% pre-leased to a global manufacturing company Regal Beloit for 10 years.","I\u2019m also pleased to report that in April we executed another 100% lease new medical office building in Central Texas with an estimated project cost of just over $43 million. We also have a solid backlog of industrial build suite and medical office development opportunities, which we\u2019re working on. We\u2019re also planning to move forward on a 421,000 square foot speculative industrial building on the site that we own in Chino, California. This project is in the Inland Empire West submarket where the occupancy rate is over 93% and there is very little land to develop.","As we\u2019ve alluded to you on the previous call, this is one of the first markets that would make sense to develop speculatively. We\u2019re also considering other markets for speculative bulk development, but those starts were likely be very limited for the rest of this year. So, as I said, from an operational perspective, the first quarter was an excellent quarter.","And now I\u2019ll turn our call over to Christie to discuss our financial results for the quarter.","Christie Kelly \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everyone. As Denny mentioned, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our first quarter financial performance as well as progress on our capital strategy. Our first quarter 2012 Core FFO was $0.24 per share. The decrease in Core FFO per share from the fourth quarter of 2011 was expected and was reflected in our 2012 guidance and result from Blackstone sale transaction, which closed in December and reduction in third party construction income as a result of the substantial completion of the BRAC third party construction project in 2011, which was also anticipated.","For the quarter, we generated $0.20 per share in AFFO, which translates into a dividend payout ratio of 85%. AFFO for the quarter was equal to the fourth quarter of 2011, also $0.20 per share and up from the $0.19 per share recorded in the first quarter of 2011. As we\u2019ve communicated previously, our asset repositioning strategy is not expected to be dilutive on an AFFO per share basis, because we\u2019re reducing our overall investment in the CapEx intensive suburban office property. We\u2019re bearing this out with quarter-to-quarter equal AFFO even with billion dollar sales (indiscernible).","Overall, we are pleased with our operating results for the quarter and the momentum we\u2019re heading into the rest of the year. With regard to the execution of our capital strategy, we executed 10.8 million shares of common stock pursuant to our previously disclosed ATM program at an average price of $13.93 which generated net proceeds of $147 million during the quarter. Given the strong acquisition activity, the increasing funding needs for the development pipeline and our commitment to our de-levering, we thought it was an opportunistic time to dribble a moderate amount of equity into the market.","As you\u2019re aware, the ATM is highly efficient and cost effective and can be well matched with the size and timing of funding with the nature of our investment. Going forward, we will renew the ATM at approximately the same level and again intend to use it opportunistically as our business warrants.","We also generated $65.3 million in proceeds for non-strategic asset dispositions during the quarter. We also effectively utilized the remaining proceeds from the Blackstone transaction in accordance with the strategy we\u2019ve laid out for the announcement of that sale. On March 5, 2012, we redeemed our $168 million of 6.95% Series M Preferred Shares, which result in the $2.9 million ongoing quarterly reduction to preferred dividend. In addition to funding the redemption of the Series M Preferred Shares, we also utilized our available cash to complete $157 million in acquisitions as well as to fund our continued development activity.","At the end of the quarter, we had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit and $15 million of cash available with manageable debt maturities for the remainder of the year totaling $373 million. I will conclude by saying that I\u2019m very happy with our progress in the first quarter, as we continue to execute in all assets of our strategy.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Den.","Mark Denien \u2013 Chief Accounting Officer","Thanks, Christie. Yesterday, we also reaffirmed our guidance for FFO per share of $0.94 to a $1.06 for all of 2012. There are number of moving pieces as a result of all of our activity, but the suffice it to say that our subtle leasing activity in the first quarter is providing positive momentum, but we still have a long way to go to finish the year. We remain comfortable with the range of estimates for our key operating metrics we provided to you in January, but we do believe we will be near the high-end of our average occupancy because of our strong start and the fact that we have only 5% of our leases expiring during the remainder of the year. So, we are really, really pleased with our start to 2012. We see some signs of the positive momentum is carry over into the second quarter which gives us a general outlook that 2012 will be another great year for us.","Thanks again for your support to Duke Realty and now we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question from the line of Josh Attie with Citi. Your line is open.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citi","Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you talk about some of the yields that you are getting on the development projects and can you talk separately about industrial versus medical office?","Denny Oklak","Sure, Josh. Again when you look at the kind of development projects that we\u2019re doing right now, these are basically build-to-suit projects that we\u2019ve started so far. They all have long-term leases. I think the shortest lease term we did with a new development this quarter was a 12-year lease. So, there isn\u2019t at this point in time, it\u2019s a little hard to say whether there is much variance between the industrial and medical office. Again these are a big bulk warehouse buildings of credit tenants long-term leases and then medical office buildings are on-campus facilities, hospital taking basically a 100% of the space. So, the going in yields are really pretty comparable right now. ","And as I mentioned on the call, what we always call our initial stabilized yield, so it\u2019s basically our initial yield on these kind of build-to-suit, was just over 7%, but also in all of these projects we get annual rent increases for over the term of the lease. So, if you look at our average rents over the term of the lease it\u2019s probably closer to being in the 8.25% to 8.5% range. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing on the build-to-suit type today.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citi","And for the speculative projects that you mentioned in California, what kind of yield would you expect to get on that?","Denny Oklak","Well, I would tell you that today\u2019s market rates out in Southern California, the yield on that project would be kind of in the low 7s \u2013 high 6s, low 7s, which is still a pretty good spread over what things are trading for out there today.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citi","And the pipeline today is around $350 million worth. I guess what is the backlog of projects looks like and as you look out 12 months at the end of the year, do you see the pipeline being substantially larger than this today?","Denny Oklak","Well. Again I think our guidance for this year was sort of in the $200 million to $300 million of starts range and again, we are off to a great start in my opinion because we signed about $120 million in the first quarter and as I mentioned, we have signed another medical office building of about $43 million here in April. So, we\u2019re at $160 million through the first four months against that $200 million to $300 million. So, we feel pretty good. There is a backlog at both the build-to-suit industrial and the medical office.","I would tell you right now that backlog you can use a lot of different kind of projects. So, I had to take a put a number on it because of probability of execution varies quite a bit, but I do think the medical office backlog is a little bit bigger than the bulk industrial backlog today. But again, I think with the start we\u2019re at this year, I think we\u2019re very comfortable being in that range and hopefully closer to the top end of that range and development start this year.","And as far as looking ahead, I think things continue to improve in the economy, albeit very slowly like they are today. We would expect that pipeline to hold up and maybe grow a little bit. Really, what we think in a normal environment for our business model. Today, we think the development if you have a economy that\u2019s kind of hitting on all cylinders, that debt development starts for us can be in the $400 million to $500 million range.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citi","And as you didn\u2019t do a capital to fund that, if the development pipeline would increase in other $200 million. Does that necessitate more equity to fund that in order to keep the leverage mutual? Is that the way we should think about it funding for growth?","Denny Oklak","Yeah, that\u2019s the way you should think about it. We\u2019re certainly not going to increase our leverage profile as we go forward to grow.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citi","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of James Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","","Thank you. I guess along similar lines, you have 620 million of land in the balance sheet. Can you talk a little bit about where that land is located and how it aligns with may be where you see the opportunity for development especially spec development?","Denny Oklak","Sure, Jamie. About 120 million of that is really in the portfolio that we have designated for sale and I guess about 2.5 going on three years now. That\u2019s the land that we have picked impaired. And we\u2019re working through the sale on that, we had couple of sales in the first quarter. We\u2019ve got \u2013 our backlog on the sale of land is probably a little bit higher than it\u2019s been for a while. We\u2019ve got a few transactions in process. So, I think we\u2019ll make some nice progress on disposing of that land, some more of that land before the end of the year.","Then, there\u2019s about 500 million of land on the development side, 70% of that is bulk industrial land and it\u2019s really located across the markets. There is a quite \u2013 there is a fair amount in lot of our Midwest cities where we\u2019ve had land for a long time and it\u2019s relatively inexpensive to carry in scheme of things, but we have \u2013 we basically have bulk industrial land in almost all of our markets and again we will look at opportunities when the time is right to start speculative projects on some of that land.","But again we\u2019re also casing build-to-suits \u2013 build-to-suit and we signed here in Indianapolis in the first quarter was on land that we owned and then we have about 30% of that land is still some office land and it\u2019s really again also spread around the country. For the most part, we\u2019re marketing that land to do build-to-suit developments on. As you could imagine, they are just aren't a lot of build-to-suit developments. We signed a big one last year with Primerica, which is on our land down in Atlanta, but there was not a lot going on there, but we will work our way through that office land also.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. So, the 70% that\u2019s bulk industrial, how much of that would you say is kind of Main & Main where you would want to actually start construction? I guess I am getting like in the Inland Empire anywhere else you build spec, you think you will need to take down land to get started?","Denny Oklak","To buy additional land to get started is that what you are saying?","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","When you announced Inland Empire was that a land you owned or you have to buy the land?","Denny Oklak","It\u2019s our land, we own, yeah.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. So that over the 70% that you said is bulk industrial. How much of that is well located where if you were to build in that market that\u2019s the land you would use?","Denny Oklak","All of it.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","All of it. Okay.","Christie Kelly","We went through that \u2013 over the past couple of years Jamie since we refined our strategy in '09 which is how we ended up with the buckets of port sales and held and we view that to be Main & Main.","Denny Oklak","And anything we didn\u2019t believe we were going to develop, we moved over into that for sale bucket and we continue to monitor that.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. So it\u2019s safe to assume if you guys do additional spec you won\u2019t need to take down rent?","Denny Oklak","That\u2019s right.","Christie Kelly","","At 80%.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","","Okay. And then can you just give us a little bit more color about the pipeline of demand both on warehouse and suburban office kind of what do you expect for the remainder of the year in terms of conversations you are having on the leasing side? ","Denny Oklak","Starting with the industrial side, we are up to 93.6% leased now, which is starting to get back into the range of closer to where we think that stabilized portfolio would run. In a normal environment again I think we\u2019d run at 95%, 96% there. So I still think that business is pretty good. The demand seems pretty solid there. So, hopefully we continue to make progress on that 93.6% and get it up into the 94% range before the end of the year, and I think there is a good possibility if everything stays fairly stable. The suburban office business again as I said in our remarks, I\u2019m just not sure what\u2019s going \u2013 when that\u2019s going to turn around. I think we know what\u2019s going to drive it, which is going to be some increasing employment and people starting to hire again, but it\u2019s still really pretty hard to say when that\u2019s going to happen and I don\u2019t hold out any high hopes that we are going to increase that occupancy very significantly during the rest of the year.","Christie Kelly","","I think the only other point that I\u2019d add to what Denny just said Jamie is that, part of the running in place on the offices clearly given what\u2019s happening overall in the sense of macroeconomic environment, but the other thing too, it\u2019s a bit of a sell for selling process with us as well because as our team works to lease up the office portfolio to the extent that those properties are located and are part of our more non-strategic disposition list as outlined in our asset strategy, as we meet unless we\u2019re selling to make sure that we get appropriate value.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America","","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thanks good afternoon. Denny could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment for both distribution development as well as medical office development is it \u2013 has competition really returned to the development sector?","Denny Oklak","Yes. I think there is lot of competition on both sides. I will talk about each one specifically. I think on the bulk industrial, obviously there is still a lot of developers and I\u2019d say both on the public and private side and you know who they are that are chasing the build \u2013 the industrial build-to-suits that are out there today. Maybe there is not quite as many competitors as there was towards the end of the last cycle, but there is still enough that pretty much all of the projects are competitive and they are all competitively fair than I think that grows across all the markets. So I would say every industrial project we\u2019re bidding on has at least two or three developers usually more or like three to five developers bidding on a project. ","And then on the medical office side, again it\u2019s generally competitive, but the medical office side can also be driven more by the hospital system relationships that we have. So, again just as an example there, we bought those street buildings in Cincinnati from the TriHealth system down there and we\u2019ve got a long relationship with them. And I think there is opportunity to do development with that system, because we\u2019re really their real estate partner now. Those are not necessarily competitively bid, but everybody knows what the market is. So, our pricing has to be competitive to get it even with that relationship. And I guess one other thing I\u2019d say on the industrial side is again going back to really Jamie\u2019s question, a lot of time it\u2019s driven by the land parcels in the location of the land. So, again as I said, we\u2019ve got rate industrial land in all our market. So, that helps us get some of those deals.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And I\u2019m looking at the hurdle rate to start-up development project. Has that hurdle rate changed? Does the cost of capital has changed or is that an absolute level?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we held it pretty consistent, but for the most part, our hurdle rates are going to be clearly different, clearly significantly different for like specular project versus build-to-suits. We\u2019ll certainly be more aggressive on build-to-suit projects, good solid industrial or medical office buildings that are pre-leased. We\u2019re going to be pretty aggressive on those and as I mentioned that was really what all of our starts were in the first quarter. So, and sort of a 7% starting rental yield on those. On specular projects with the exception of Southern California, there is \u2013 you\u2019re going to see higher starting or stabilized yields than what you\u2019re seeing when we\u2019re in the build-to-suit business. Is that answered your question? Paul.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Yes, it does. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","","Thanks. If I could \u2013could you talk about your capital deployment activities. It seems like lot of the stuff that you bought this quarter were fully leased and lot of kind of Midwest capital markets and at the same time, your \u2013 it sounds like the one that you\u2019re buying and the one that you\u2019re selling as a most higher yielding assets and just curious what\u2019s the offside of buying assets that had 6 to 7 cap that\u2019s almost 100% leased?","Denny Oklak","Well these have long-term leases. They are stable. They\u2019ve all got well rate growth built into them both on the industrial side and on the medical office side. Basically on all these, those numbers you\u2019re seeing are really cash on cash yield that\u2019s going to grow because again your long-term leases and there is virtually no capital expenditures needed probably from anywhere from 5 to 10 years on these projects we\u2019re buying. So, again they are certainly accretive over the shorter and longer term. What we have been focused on really hasn\u2019t changed from what we\u2019ve been doing in the last couple of years. We\u2019re selling our older non-functional mostly office assets.","We sold a few industrial assets this quarter, but there were some older flex buildings down in Cincinnati that had been on our chart list and we\u2019re able to move those. But most of our older office buildings as I mentioned, they were only 80% leased and with an average age of over 20 years. So, the other thing that I would say is our cap rates, the way we code our cap rates is a stabilized yield and that stabilized yield that we\u2019ll code like on that 9.7 would assume that properties somewhere leased between 90% and 95%, while those properties may have not been at 90% to 95% leased for longtime. So, in place is probably closer to 8, 8.25 on those properties. But that\u2019s just the way we\u2019ve always done those. It\u2019s as much of an art as a science on calculating cap rates on dispositions.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","I just want to clarify that point. So, when you close stabilized yields for \u2013 when you for acquisitions and development is based on a stabilized yield based on occupancy or is that offering cooperating straight line rent?","Denny Oklak","Yeah, that\u2019s based on occupancy, but it would also consider the cost to lease up the property \u2013 our estimated cost to lease up the property.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","Why not you pursue \u2013 I mean you\u2019ve shifted your portfolio in a pretty significant manner in the past year-and-a-half and I think lot of heavy lift has been done so, why not you limit more strategic in your acquisitions or dispositions \u2013 and piecing and try to top take more of the bids. I mean the pursue kind of an under lease acquisitions where are \u2013 not just buying fully stabilized assets where you\u2019re starting to get a straight yield for 10 years?","Christie Kelly","I just want to jump in there even because we have been assets just in terms of the specificity associated with the asset repositioning strategy since '09. So, I just want to remind everybody that we spent of that 20%, I mean call it 50% of that $1 billion in assets that we were proposing to leased up. Taking a look back and what we did in South Florida as a Dugan transaction, I mean just to start to rattle them off. So, we haven\u2019t just combined stabilized assets. I know it seems like that as we become just even more later focused on specific markets that Denny want to be in for all the right reasons, but please don\u2019t forget about what we\u2019ve done over two years here and moving a couple billion dollars.","Denny Oklak","Well, the only other thing I would say is I am not sure what\u2019s your version to stabilized assets that means, there is nothing wrong with them. They\u2019re really great assets as I said they are immediately accretive to AFFO growth going forward because got virtually no capital expenditures and you got relevant growth. So, you\u2019re kind of talking about them like that\u2019s a bad thing, but I don\u2019t think it is.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","And I guess I\u2019m looking at a on a relative basis to maybe more development or lease look like we have a much higher return even at the build-to-suit level and at the same time I think last time we spoke, you guys mentioned that you guys were pretty close to your deleveraging targets, yet you still issued the equity at 13.60 a share. I think that\u2019s probably low 7 cap rate and I was just kind of just combining everything together seems like is that the best use of capital?","Denny Oklak","What we actually issued a 39 a share. You guys all got to remember that every time we issue on that cost us some fees to do that.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","Yeah.","Denny Oklak","As Christi mentioned, we \u2013 the ATM has a very efficient way to do that equity raise when you look at the fee side. So, again we used that strategically. I think it was a great time for us to use it in this quarter when you look at really mainly the development pipeline that we\u2019re building. We\u2019ve got $350 million development pipeline and as Josh asked at the beginning and I reiterate you can expect us to see us fund that kind of growth through development in line with our capital structure today. So that\u2019s going to require roughly 50% common equity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, because we\u2019re not going to increase our leverage ratios.","Christie Kelly","And I think even to in putting together the ATM programs, we put that in place in February of 2010. We carried executing on it after two years from inception. And we said that we were going to use that program opportunistically. When we announced it, it was ties at $150 million which was expected to be at 6% to the total shares outstanding. There are 40 other entities who have issued ATMs since 2011 through year-to-date that we know, as of the end of February 2012. 50% of those have re-upped on their ATMs and they\u2019ve been larger. And in terms of overall execution of \u2013 as Dennis said, we issued at a (indiscernible) that was better than the average \u2013 weighted average price since inception, that was better than the weighted average price over the trailing 12 months, that was better than the weighted average price over the past six months and that was better than the market price over the past month and half that we executed. And if you take a look at the volume that we executed on, we were executing a 3% to 18% of the total volume that day, taking advantage of the volatility in the market. So, I think it was all first of all immaterial. We don\u2019t take issuing equity lightly, but 150 million shares given the size of our business and we used the proceeds I mean it had no effect.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","Okay.","Denny Oklak","And I just want to add one other thing Ki Bin. We\u2019re talking about taking on more risk profile. I remind our folks all the time that we still have $10 million square feet of vacancy out there. And I\u2019ve got \u2013 there is plenty of risk left in that vacancy. We have lease explorations. Although, we\u2019re in great shape this year, we always have lease expirations coming in at us. So, there is still plenty of risk in our business and I\u2019m focused on managing the overall risk. So, I\u2019m not really inclined to go buy properties that add significantly to that vacancy, because I think we\u2019ve got enough right now.","Christie Kelly","And we\u2019re still working on de-levering we\u2019ve got goals out there as stated and we still got real work to do and we\u2019re going to keep chipping away at it as we\u2019ve communicated. So, we\u2019re in good shape.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","So are you \u2013 before I had taken a lot of time but are you trying to re-up the ATM and what are your thoughts on future equity expenses and are you going to try to \u2013 and that will be tied to certain activities or\u2026?","Christie Kelly","","No, I think in my statement I did mention that we are going to re-up, because it\u2019s a prudent thing to do, as I mentioned in other, 40 other REITs out there that are doing it. And we executed very effectively. So, yes and I think you would expect us to do that. And in terms of tying it to any one specific activity, no and I think our performance keeps for itself. We waited until it started to make sense over the past couple of years and I think we executed pretty well given the current operational profile and it\u2019s complementing our asset strategy and we will keep doing that with minimum effect to our overall performance.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","","Okay and just last quick question on your development page, on page 28 you guys have quoted your yields, productive yields part of being finished, so just a couple of quick questions one how do you account for land bases on those yields and second on page \u2013 to the page before why not just provide projected yields on stuff you have under construction?","Denny Oklak","Well number \u2013 your first question on 28. The land that are basis that we, which is basically our original costs because as we said we didn\u2019t really and we haven\u2019t impaired in any of the development land. There is a big reason why we don\u2019t show each development yield on page 27 that\u2019s a competitive reason I don\u2019t necessarily want to show my competitors or our customers exactly what might yield is on any specific building that\u2019s why we don\u2019t show here.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","","I guess I\u2019m in total, also, but okay. Thank you, I\u2019m done.","Christie Kelly","","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Dave Rodgers with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey Denny. Given the industrial build-to-suit that you have announced it seems that large block demand continues to be fairly robust in the bulk industrial business, when you look down at maybe the 30,000, 40,000 square foot blocks have you seen any more positive traction there over the last three, six months and do you feel better about the direction of the smaller spaces in industrial?","Denny Oklak","","Yeah, I say definitely Dave when you think about it, think about some of those stats that we mentioned, with 7.4 million square feet of industrial leasing. And so, you take out a couple million square feet, one for the build-to-suit, one for the Carter\u2019s deal. And then the only other one we really talked about that was large was that 300,000 square foot deal we did down in Cincinnati. So, the rest of those \u2013 you had 4 million, 5 million square feet, which were all smaller type deals. So, we\u2019re talking under probably 200,000 square feet for the most part. So, that activity, that\u2019s pretty good for a quarter to have that much activity on the industrial leasing side in that size basis.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Your effective rents in industrial I think in the first quarter, and maybe as a small sample size versus last year were down quite a bit. What were your cash leasing spread in the quarter? And was there a big mix shift from last year till the first quarter or was it just more aggressive pricing?","Denny Oklak","","That number is probably being driven by that deal at Atlanta, because it was such a big part of it. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a pretty competitive rate on that deal. But we liked it, because we only have three months of downtime. We got the space built. We didn\u2019t spend much at all in a way of capital expenditures on that tenant, and we get nice rent bumps and it\u2019s an 11 year lease. So, we have low CapEx. We\u2019ve spread that over 11 years, which is great. So, a lot of the metrics we use even though the initial rental rate was lower, we \u2013 that lease looks really good when you look at it. And then the other thing with that that I would \u2013 only thing I would add David is that tenant left in that space was side back at 2006 or 2007 and their rent was quite a bit higher. So, there was some roll down there. And I think a lot of times when you look at out those numbers David it just can really depend on the mix. If you got a lot of larger spaces in there, maybe those numbers are look little lower than they would have for smaller space.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Maybe to ask it in a different way and I appreciate that color. How do you feel about rental rates in the bulk industrial portfolio from the market perspective versus 3, 6, 12 months ago?","Denny Oklak","Well. I think it\u2019s getting better. I think it\u2019s getting better because in all markets pretty much occupancy is going up and we\u2019re starting to see in almost every bulk industrial market pretty solid occupancy. And as you mentioned I think you said in the beginning it\u2019s really \u2013 there is a lot of these larger vacancies has been taken. But it still little bit difficult to get a lot of traction on rental rate growth because it\u2019s still the demand is good, but it\u2019s not \u2013 it still not necessarily booming out there. I think when you look at it, there has just been a handful of build-to-suits around the country really so far this year, that business is starting to pick up, but until we really see that and then see the demand pick up, it\u2019s still pretty hard to get a lot of traction on rental rates. But I certainly think it\u2019s headed in the right direction. I think it\u2019s better than it was six or nine months ago.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Last just follow-up question for me, could you provide us a range and I know this will vary by market, but if possible, provide us a range of development and construction costs for each year three property types given kind of where the bulk of your land for new development is today?","Denny Oklak","Well that is kind of hard to do when you\u2019re looking \u2013 I would tell you, just to give you a range I think most Midwest markets are in $35 to $40 for bulk industrial, again depending on how big it is. If you look at Southern California it\u2019s more like $70 a square foot and just trying to think where other in places like Atlanta and Dallas you get probably $40 to $45 per foot.","On the medical office side, it\u2019s really hard to say because these buildings vary pretty significantly among all those properties that we owned. And it\u2019s not necessarily driven by geography, it\u2019s \u2013 some of it is a little bit because \u2013 but not a lot because most of those are on land leases. So we just have long-term ground leases in the \u2013 the length of the ground rest is just the path, the tenant really pays it. So it\u2019s just building cost and quite honestly those could range from in the low $200 a foot to up to close to $400 a foot depending on how the buildings built and what you have in it.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And is that with land?","Denny Oklak","No, that\u2019s without land because again they\u2019re almost all in ground leases.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","It would be industrial though I\u2019m sorry?","Denny Oklak","Yeah. That is also is with land, yes, sorry.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good afternoon. So looking at your same-store pool, it looks like occupancy decreased around 50 bps since Q4 and acknowledging that\u2019s not quite apples-to-apples sequentially, pretty big difference from the 140 debt increases on the total portfolio. Just wondering if you could give some color on reconciling the two of them?","Christie Kelly","Yeah, Blaine, I can take a jump in there for you. I saw that in the note the other night. Same store, I think you mentioned was about 50 or 60 bps in terms of the population for the quarter, that\u2019s correct. A couple of other things that we have going on in there, you\u2019ve got in terms of the total \u2013 the total versus same-store, the same-store population measures the same property population that\u2019s been in effect for 24 months, total is everything and so you\u2019ve got development starts in there, acquisitions, dispositions, which is about 15 to 20 basis points. And then you\u2019ll also have the impact of other leasing such as the quarter lease that Denny mentioned, which is the other piece of area, which is not in the same-store population.","Blaine Heck \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then second question. If I take your quarter results from the first quarter $0.24 and kind of assume that the savings from the preferred redemption roughly offsets the dilution from the ATM issuance that puts you at pace to be around $0.96 for the year. Just wanted to get some color on what do you thought the earnings progression for the rest of the year was going to be like and kind of what needs to happen to hit the midpoint to upper end of guidance?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think the first quarter I\u2019ll say couple of things about. It\u2019s generally our lowest quarter because there are just different things that happened in the first quarter. There are some cyclicality to our service business. There are some things on the overhead side that just always get recorded in the first quarter rather than spread and it\u2019s a timing difference. And then in this particular first quarter, we were still redeploying the proceeds from Blackstone transaction at the beginning of the year for really the first couple months of the year. So again obviously if we end up at the midpoint of our guidance, it\u2019s going to have increase a little bit on a quarterly basis going through and again as we\u2019ve said, we are comfortable with the guidance that we put out there so.","Blaine Heck \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We go to John Stewart with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Danny, could you give us a sense for which markets aside from the Inland Empire you would be looking at spec development on bulk industrial?","Denny Oklak","Well, if you ask my guidance, I feel I have to tell you all of those, love to \u2013 try to build the spec one but \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure. I\u2019d say I think we\u2019ve had some guys are seriously look at them, I mean possibly Indianapolis, maybe in Dallas if it was a certain fit-fit, a certain profile. And Houston probably is one where you could justify some and again it\u2019s certain submarkets there. In my opinion, John, it doesn\u2019t really go a whole lot deeper than that right now. And again I think I would probably include South Florida in that list, but we really don\u2019t have any developable industrial land in South Florida. That\u2019s one of the reasons we really wanted and are so happy we got the premier portfolio last year, because we didn\u2019t really have any land to develop down there. So, I think South Florida though for peoples who have land available spec product is certainly a consideration there.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And on the acquisitions for the quarter, had a pretty distinctly Midwest flavor. Is that a shift in the strategy at all or just a sample size?","Denny Oklak","Small sample size, I mean I think we got a really nice deal on those couple of buildings in Columbus. Clearly, Chicago is on our target list for bulk industrial, so we\u2019ll keep \u2013 you\u2019ve seen us acquire through last year and into this year in Chicago and then again if you look at the medical office business again is really less geographic focused and more health system focused and with the tri-health system in Cincinnati and about the loyal system in Chicago where our acquisitions where this quarter, both very, very good healthcare systems.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And I wanted to just come back for a moment to the capital allocation line of questioning, and certainly sympathetic to the desire to kind of reduce the risk profile and certainly continue to the reduce leverage particularly considering what we\u2019ve all went through the past several years. But maybe if you could just help us understand quite a hurdle you\u2019re trying to beat and let\u2019s \u2013 maybe focus on acquisitions. Again understanding that there is some built-in rent growth, but just when you\u2019re buying fully leased at a relatively lower going end yield, what\u2019s the hurdle that you\u2019re looking to beat?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we\u2019re looking at those on the basis of are they accreted to us and\u2026","John Steward \u2013 Green Street Advisors","On what basis?","Denny Oklak","I\u2019m sorry.","Christie Kelly","AFFO.","Denny Oklak","Yep, to AFFO, are they accretive to us on an AFFO basis. And if they are, then and its good property and we\u2019re executing on our asset strategy and we\u2019re not doing any damage to our capital strategy that I think the acquisitions make sense. So, the issue though is the company our size it\u2019s hard to notice the accretion when you\u2019re doing a $150 million in the quarter event. I mean, you don\u2019t see it for a while, but it will come into place, because once you get them, you\u2019re not going to see the accretion in the first quarter and then it\u2019s going to happen some in the future quarters, then you\u2019re going to get more as rental rates grow. So, it just takes a while for that accretion that come into place to. Does that answer your question John?","John Steward \u2013 Green Street Advisors","","Well, I guess, ultimately, where do you peg your cost to capital?","Denny Oklak","Well, I mean there are a lot of different ways to calculate it. The way we normally look at it is our cost to debt on a 10-year basis, plus sort of our FFO yield on our stock price. And if you\u2026","Christie Kelly","","May be now it\u2019s about 533.","Denny Oklak","Well, I would say higher than that, but\u2026","Christie Kelly","","50-50 leverage.","Denny Oklak","Yeah, it\u2019s in the probably 5.5 to 6 the low 6 range today.","John Steward \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And then, lastly, just a housekeeping question look like same-store expenses were up quite a bit sequentially and I wouldn\u2019t have expected to see that much seasonality here, slowing the whole was anything that you can explain for us there?","Christie Kelly","I think they are down John.","John Steward \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Just looking from the fourth quarter supplemental to the first quarter it looked like same store expenses were up $5 million or so?","Denny Oklak","It\u2019s hard to do John because you got a different population every quarter.","Christie Kelly","Right.","John Steward \u2013 Green Street Advisors","","And maybe we can pull it offline but it didn\u2019t look like there is much of a change in terms of square footage or anything else, so happy to follow-up offline?","Denny Oklak","Okay. ","Christie Kelly","Good John.","John Steward \u2013 Green Street Advisors","","Thanks.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, just a follow-up question on the same store NOI may be ask you a little bit differently. I mean it was a pretty strong result year-over-year this quarter. Was there anything seasonal in that in terms of the normal cost and should investors be looking for something in that upper forced range, guidance obviously is a lot lower than that for the full year?","Denny Oklak","No I think what your \u2013 it was higher this quarter again because as we said as we go through this year, we were building off a bigger base each quarter because we had nice same store growth throughout 2011 too. So we don\u2019t think the first quarter is indicative of where we\u2019ll end up for the full year and that\u2019s the guidance that we always give as for the full 12 months calendar year.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. But outside of increasingly difficult comparisons there is nothing else sort of seasonal in number this quarter? ","Denny Oklak","No, we always set the data, to have people look at quarterly numbers. So there can be something goes both ways within a quarter. But I don\u2019t think there is anything real specific in there today.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay.","Operator","Thank you and I will turn it back to our speakers at this time.","Denny Oklak \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, thanks everybody we appreciate being on that call and we\u2019ll talk to you again in next quarter.

Baird & Co.","Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Duke Realty First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ronald Hubbard","Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2016, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for a prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everybody. We followed up a very strong 2016 with a great start to 2017. We grew rents substantially, increased our already record high occupancy and added significant new developments to our pipeline, while increasing our preleased percentage.","During the quarter, we increased our in-service and total portfolio occupancies by 20 basis points. Our in-service occupancy is now 97.7%, and our total portfolio occupancy is now 95.8%. We believe this increase is impressive, given that we are already at record high levels of occupancy and the fact that this was primarily driven by strong re-leasing of existing space.","Nationally, industrial market momentum continues to be good. Supply in the local market is still imbalanced despite small increases in supply in several markets. Supply chain modernization and expansion is continuing to drive demand from e-commerce customers, 3PLs and traditional warehousing customers.","Preliminary net absorption numbers for the quarter are coming in at around 33 million square feet, which is down from about 47 million square feet last quarter. New supply in the first quarter was 44 million square feet, which is very consistent with previous quarters. Overall, we saw vacancies tick up slightly by 6 to 8 basis points to nationally 4.9%. Our outlook for these fundamentals continues to be favorable for the remainder of 2017 and into early 2018.","We continue to have great momentum in our portfolio with the completion of 5.5 million square feet of leasing for the quarter. Notable activity this quarter included the 646,000 square foot lease signed with Amazon for an existing facility in the airport submarket in Cincinnati. This space had been vacated at year-end, and the transaction exceeded our re-leasing expectations set at the beginning of the year.","In tandem with this new lease, we signed a renewal with Amazon, totaling 598,000 square feet, located in the same business park. This is a prime example of our scale on local expertise, offering site facility solutions, totaling 1.2 million square feet for a significant customer. With this strong leasing activity and our in-service industrial portfolio occupancy approaching 98%, we continue to be able to push rents as indicated by our rent growth on second-generation leases of over 23%.","I'd like to make one more note on our operating activities. As many of you are aware, one of our tenants, hhgregg, a retailer in the consumer electronics business, recently filed bankruptcy, and announced plans they were liquidating. They lease approximately 750,000 square feet from us in 3 Southeast markets. We have received rent through April. Rent payable for the remaining 8 months of the year is approximately $2.2 million, and will negatively impact occupancy by about 60 basis points. At this point in time, we're uncertain as to the ultimate outcome and timing, but feel comfortable with our ability to backfill these spaces which are located in Atlanta, Orlando and Raleigh. However, we have removed all of the rent as part of our previous revisions to FFO and AFFO guidance, which I'll expand on later.","Let me also note we that have a thorough tenant credit review and underwriting process that has resulted in rent loss of only 20 basis points annually over the last 10 years. In discussing the performance of the medical office portfolio, I'd first like to address a news report and some recent analyst commentary around the potential sale of this business. Consistent with past practices, we have a policy of not commenting on rumors in the marketplace. As such, we have nothing else to say other than our medical office business is in great shape.","In-service occupancy declined slightly to 94.3%, but this was the result of 2 new development deliveries totaling 182,000 square feet in Chicago and Philadelphia that were 67% preleased in aggregate. Excluding these development deliveries, MOB occupancy was relatively flat for the quarter. Co-leasing and operating fundamentals remain very strong in our MOB portfolio, along with good activity in our new development pipeline.","Turning to development. We started off the year very strong with $278 million of projects across 8 markets, totaling 3.4 million square feet that are 76% preleased in the aggregate. On the medical side, we started 1 project in Houston, a 99,000 square foot 100% preleased facility with Memorial Hermann, the dominant A+ rated health system in Southeast Texas. As a part of the same transaction, we acquired a 71,000 square foot medical office building in the sale-leaseback located on the same campus.","5 of the development starts totaling 2.5 million square feet were industrial build-to-suits. One of the larger transactions was a 477,000 square foot project on a land site in Southern California's Mid County submarket. Many of you recall, we put this 22-acre site under contract in very early 2016 and went through a complicated site cleanup and building permitting process. While we intended to start this project on a speculative basis during the quarter, just prior to construction commencements, our Southern California team successfully executed the 477,000 square foot lease for the entire space with UPS. We estimate the value creation on this transaction since the time the site was put under contract is in excess of 50% due largely to rising rents, increasing land values and cap rates continuing to compress. 2 other large build-to-suit transactions were 1 million square foot project with Amazon in Houston, a 557,000 square foot project with Shippers Warehouse in Dallas.","And finally, we commenced 2 other 100% pre-lease build-to-suit transactions totaling 440,000 square feet in Columbus and Indianapolis.","On the speculative development side, we started 3 projects ranging from 166,000 to 337,000 square feet in Atlanta, South Florida and St. Louis. Our overall development pipeline at quarter end had 30 projects under construction, totaling 11 million square feet and a projected $875 million in stabilized costs at our share. We expect these projects to create a 20-plus percent margin, and generate about a 6.4% initial stabilized cash yield. We believe these margins are impressive due to the relatively low risk nature of the pipeline, given that it is nearly 73% pre-leased.","With respect to capital recycling activity, we post $90 million of building dispositions during the quarter at in-place cap rate of just under 9%. Majority of these proceeds came from a suburban office portfolio in Indianapolis that closed in January, and was facing quite a bit of near-term rollover. We also generated $25 million in proceeds from surplus land sales.","On the acquisition front, we recycled disposition proceeds into a portfolio for newly constructed modern industrial buildings in Southern California, totaling 752,000 square feet. The facilities are located in the Inland Empire West and San Gabriel Valley submarkets. The portfolio was 75% leased when we placed it under contract, and subsequent to closing, we executed lease on 1 vacant building to bring the portfolio to 100% leased. With lease escalators of around 3% and submarket vacancies in the 2% to 3% range, we like the long-term risk-adjusted returns these assets will generate. We're pleased to make progress on our strategic objective of portfolio growth in Tier 1 high barrier markets.","We also acquired 100% interest - 100% leased, 225,000 square foot recently completed property in Atlanta, in addition to the previously mentioned medical office property in Houston.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark to discuss the financial results and capital transactions.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO was $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2017 compared with $0.31 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was the result of continued improved operational performance, as Jim just noted, in addition to a lease buy out in one of our few remaining suburban office assets. The lease buyout contributed an additional $0.02 per share to core FFO, which is net of $2 million of related tax expense recognized because the property is owned by our taxable lease subsidiary.","AFFO totaled $118 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $90 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2016 included approximately $15 million more of recurring capital expenditures compared with the first quarter of 2017, resulting from the timing of leasing activity.","Same-property NOI growth for the 3 months ended March 31, 2017, was 5.2%. This growth is a result of both increased occupancy and substantial rental rate growth that Jim touched on earlier.","And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thank you, Mark. In reflection of our strong operational performance in the first quarter of the year and positive outlook, we raised guidance for core FFO to a range of $1.24 to $1.30 per share or $0.03 per share increase at the midpoint. This includes the $0.02 per share from the lease buyout fee Mark just noted, in addition to strong overall operating fundamentals in excess of our original expectations.","Similarly, we increased the range of growth in adjusted funds from operation on a share adjusted basis to a range of 4.7% to 10.3% from the previous range of 1.9% to 7.5%. These improved expectations include the assumption that no rent will be collected for the remainder of the year from hhgregg, which is currently in the bankruptcy process, as I alluded to earlier. This assumption also included our decision not to change our same-property NOI guidance.","Regarding development expectations, given the strong start in Q1 and strong prospects for the remainder of the year, we raised our development guidance to $500 million to $700 million, up $50 million from the original midpoint. We continue to expect to drive strong pre-leasing levels in this pipeline. The estimate for acquisitions was also increased to a range of $100 million to $150 million from the previous range of $50 million to $100 million, reflective of the strong start to the year.","Finally, the estimate for dispositions was increased to a range of $300 million to $500 million from the previous range of $150 million to $350 million. The majority of the projected increase for dispositions is from a healthcare system in Ohio that approached us earlier in the year about buying properties they leased from us as a part of their corporate recapitalization. We executed on the sale of their 10 building medical office portfolio for about $155 million, which just closed this week.","In closing, the industrial and health care business drivers remain very strong. Our hospital system clients are growing and have increased demand for MOB care facilities. Our traditional distribution markets remain incredibly strong. E-commerce is continuing to create new customers and forcing competition for all players to modernize their supply chain strategies for delivering and storing goods. While these trends will cause disruption and create some winners and losers, we are comfortable that losing a handful of weaker tenants is more than being offset by the incremental demand from stronger growing clients. We view this as a net positive for the long term out performance for Duke Realty.","We're also very pleased with our team's execution through the first quarter of leasing performance, capital redeployment and development starts, and we are optimistic about our strong performance for the remainder of the year.","We'll now open up the lines to all of the callers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Carroll. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Jim, can you kind of run through your recent MOB, I guess, acquisitions and development starts? And what were the reasons for pursuing these deals? Were these with the existing relationships and you just wanted to expand with those relationships?","James Connor","Well, the Memorial Hermann relationship is a newer relationship, and the acquisition and the new development deal were tied together. We like both buildings being 100% leased on Memorial Hermann's main campus in Houston. So I think we're very pleased and happy with that transaction. And then as I alluded to in the latter part of the - of my prepared remarks, we were able to execute on the disposition with one of our major healthcare clients in Ohio that was doing a major corporate recapitalization and wanted to redeploy some of that capital back into their real estate holdings, so we were able to come to terms and close on that transaction.","Michael Carroll","Great. Can you give us, I guess - was there a cap rate given on that transaction that you can provide us?","James Connor","No because it closed after the quarter, so it's not in any of this information. But there's been market reports, and there's a fairly decent amount of information out there, and you'll conclude it's about a 5 cap.","Operator","We have a question from Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Could you just talk to your larger plans with the medical office portfolio in terms of, strategically, is this something that you want to hold on to longer-term or maybe at this point of the cycle, monetization looks even more appealing?","James Connor","Well, as we've consistently said, Guy, we like the business, and we're continuing to focus on growing the business. Executing on the acquisition of the new development deal with Memorial Hermann in Houston is a great example of that. It opens up a new market for us. It allows us to create a relationship with the top health care system in Houston who happens to have a great fantastic balance sheet. And then the other side of it was just strategic pooling. The portfolio in the Midwest, we're a little overweight in the Midwest in our MOB portfolio. Some of those were a little bit older, so we were happy to - with the pricing on those assets and like the remaining balance of our portfolio and the outlook for the business going forward.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And maybe a quick question on the supply. What is the kind of outlook for some of your bigger markets, like Indianapolis, because if we look at the brokerage part, it seems like supply is increasing pretty significantly.","James Connor","Well, supply is up a little bit. I wouldn't characterize it as pretty significantly. And I think we need to keep in mind that this is the first quarter, which for the industrial markets is typically a weaker performing quarter. But if you go back to the numbers I cited earlier, you saw supply outpace demand nationally by about 11 million or 12 million square feet, or I don't know, whatever it is, 13 billion square foot U.S. market. That's not a lot. I think we should all make note of it, and watch that as a trend coming forward if that continues in the second and third quarters. I think you'll see us and a lot of our peers probably rethink the supply side in the latter part of the year. But most of the people we talk to feel pretty bullish about the balance of the year, and we've talked about supply and demand meeting equilibrium, and that could happen later in this year or early next year. But right now, I think we're in pretty good shape, and I wouldn't read too much into that slight differential in the first quarter.","Ki Bin Kim","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Sumit Sharma. Please go ahead.","Sumit Sharma","So Jim, with regards to hhgregg, I understand this isn't a large needle mover for you, but as you look at the broader industrial market and the privately held or sort of retail developed, family-owned facilities, how concerned are you when you look at retailer bankruptcies and store closures that, that will spill over into some of the warehouse demand, maybe not for your portfolio or REIT portfolios, but across the market?","James Connor","Well, I think it's a trend that is concerning to all of us, and one that we're watching carefully. Thankfully, with the exception of hhgregg, all of the other retailers that have filed bankruptcy, we have not had as tenants. So one of the things I alluded to in my prepared remarks was we do pretty detailed a job of credit review and make what we think are pretty prudent decisions about where we're going to invest our capital, particularly as it relates to retail tenants. And one of the things on that subject that I've talked about at previous conferences and in meetings with you guys is this is no different than any other time in the past. There are always going to be winners and losers, and today, unfortunately, there's a few recognizable iconic retail names that are likely to be losers, and that's unfortunate, but that's life. There are a lot of companies who are succeeding very well, who are growing their sales, who are not having store closings, who are investing a great deal of money in their supply chain infrastructure, which is a big benefit to us and our peers.","So as I said in the comments, I feel bad for the hhgregg people, and I'm not particular happy about taking 750,000 feet back, but when your bulk portfolio is almost 98% leased, I'm not at all uncomfortable about re-leasing those spaces, growing rents and putting better credit tenants in there. So we'll take it in stride, and we'll keep watching the balance of the portfolio.","Sumit Sharma","One a little bit about the acquisition in - the portfolio acquisition in L.A., was this announcement transaction was - any kind of special circumstances? I guess the pricing suggests this is more of a core plus kind of purchase. And as Seinfeld would say, not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much you're willing to pay to gain exposure in top-tier markets?","James Connor","Well, I would say - it was a competitive process, so it was not an off market deal. It was a regular arm's-length deal, and we paid up to get it. But I - we liked the real estate. We liked the opportunity to lease the last building, so that we could create a little bit of upside for ourselves there. But as we look at the acquisitions and dispositions and developments that we have in the pipeline and for the balance of the year, and with the slightly increased disposition proceeds, we were happy to deploy that into core plus real estate in Southern California. So I won't tell anybody we stole the property, but I think we paid a reasonable fair price in today's marketplace, and we're happy with the real estate. And my acquisitions guys like to say, \"We'll own it forever.\"","Operator","We have a question from Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Jim, I appreciate your comments on tenancy, but if you look at your watch list today versus in the past, what are you looking at differently? Because it's probably not just about credit. It's probably a little bit about trend plus credits. So how do you approach your watch list differently? And maybe in that same light, how do you approach new leasing differently to make sure that 10 doesn't quickly end up on the watch list?","James Connor","Well, yes. We didn't have a significant issue. If we did in leasing or development, somebody was immediately put up on the watch list, I'd have a few questions for that, but it's basic fundamentals. The first and foremost is it's the creditworthiness of the entity. And even if they're not a publicly traded company with readily available financials, we get financials before we do the deal and on an annual basis, so we can monitor the health and well-being of our clients. But beyond that, you've got to look at industry segments. And we all can point to certain segments that have been affected by trends in the retail marketplace, whether it's e-commerce, whether it's competition from the larger suppliers, and I think the hhgregg situation is one of those unfortunate situations where you had a smaller regional player that unfortunately just got squeezed out by the bigger players and probably to some extent, by e-commerce. So those are the kinds of thought process we go through.","As we're looking in evaluating deals in the marketplace before we ever get into leasing is, is this a customer we're willing to invest money in, in terms of our real estate for the next 5 or 10 years, depending on the term of the lease? And again, given where our portfolio occupancy is, we can afford to be a little bit selective, much more so than the years gone by.","Emmanuel Korchman","And then maybe going back to your previous comment about something you want to own forever, you guys have been pretty nimble about selling off a piece of your portfolio that probably when you bought them, you thought you'd own them forever. How do you today make that decision about an asset or a market that seems pretty good, but just might not be forever? And so when do you make that sell decision?","James Connor","Well, let me make a point of clarification. My acquisitions guys say we'll own it forever. I don't necessarily agree that we'll own it forever. But all kidding aside, when we're looking at investing money, particularly when we're making acquisitions, if we're buying brand-new buildings, much like we're developing, and we can redeploy them at that capital into Tier 1 high barrier markets at what we believe are reasonable prices today, I think we're happy to do that when we've got surplus proceeds. It would be a very much different situation if we didn't have those proceeds coming in, I mean, we're happy to go out and raise equity and borrow money to do that. I think we'd be having a different conversation then.","Operator","We have a question from Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","James Feldman","Looking at the developments under construction, you've got several assets scheduled for delivery in the second quarter and third quarter that are not leased. Can you just talk us through those projects and you think you'll have those leased by delivery?","James Connor","Hold on, we're flipping pages to get those. Let's see. So I'm on Page 26 of our supplemental development projects under construction. Coming into the second quarter, a 600,000-foot project in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, a lot of activity there. I'm not particularly worried about that one, a small 150,000-foot building in Chicago that we've got a lot of activity as well from single users and multi-tenants. Camp Creek, which is a building where we've had a lot of success in Atlanta, down by the airport, 448,000 square feet. We've got good activity there. Looking at Washington, D.C., now that's the data center deals we talked about last quarter. Columbus is already leased. Southern California, that's an infill redevelopment project of about 200,000 square feet. And I think that data is actually a little bit off with the weather and the rain that California had. I think the delivery on that is a little bit behind schedule, but they're tilting walls, and they've got reasonably good activity there. So Jamie,","I would tell you, looking at the list that's coming at us; we've got prospects and proposals out multiple proposals for every one of those, so sitting here today. I'm not worried about any of them. I hope that helps.","James Feldman","So like, what's the tipping point to actually get a lease signed? They actually want to see the building and walk it?","James Connor","I think, in a lot of instances, having the 4 port and the walls going up or the steel kind of makes people a little bit more believers, I guess. I don't know. That's kind of when you generally start to see increased activity. And then anywhere between maybe 75% complete to shortly after completion is when you really see the bulk of the leasing activity. So again, at this point, in every one of those projects to have multiple proposals out, I'm not too worried.","James Feldman","Okay. And if I could just ask for a clarification on your comments before you said you did not change the same-store guidance, but I inferred from that. Maybe you could have. But can you just talk us your thoughts on same-store and the ins and outs?","Mark Denien","Yes, Jamie, this is Mark. Basically, what we're trying to infer is that the impact of assuming that we will not collect any rent from hhgregg is about 40 basis points - 40 to 45 basis points hit to same-property phase. So I guess one way of looking at it is, if it wouldn't have had happened to us, you probably could have expected a 40 to 45 basis point increase. But sitting here today, we think it's prudent to just go ahead and assume we won't get any rent, and we may do some refurbishment of one of those buildings, and it may take us a few quarters to get it leased. So we just didn't put any of that NOI into our numbers for our guidance.","James Feldman","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from John Guinee. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","So you didn't steal the property?","James Connor","We did steal the property, which one are you talking about?","John Guinee","The one you just said you weren't going to tell anyone you stole the property.","James Connor","Oh, the building. I thought you were referring to your favorite landside in Mid Counties that we stole.","John Guinee","Oh, my God. So you're down from $1 billion, with Atlanta $200 million?","James Connor","About just under $250 million. Yes, we monetized just under $100 million of land this quarter, $25 million of sales, which are - which were included in my remarks and about $75 million monetized through development. We actually acquired about $50 million of land through the quarter, but still we're able to bring our overall land inventory down. So I'm particularly pleased with how our local guys are performing. And you can never get it perfect. You can never project the right number, and you can never get the right amount in all the markets. But today, I would tell you, we're in pretty good shape across the country.","John Guinee","Okay, so 2 serious questions. First, talking to someone the other day, evidently, Amazon leases about 100 million square feet throughout the country and has RFPs or build-to-suit requests out there for another 36 million square feet. If you could - are aware or comment on those statistics. And then the second question would be, as we all know, land prices are going up and construction costs are going up fairly significantly. When you buy the $50 million worth of land you acquired this quarter, are you underwriting that land to a 6 yield on costs, 7 yield on costs, 8 yield on cost, what kind of - what do you have to put in your pro forma to win the bid?","James Connor","Okay, the first question, as it relates to Amazon, I believe the $100 million number you quoted is accurate based on numbers that we've historically seen as it relates to Amazon. I'm not aware that they have RFPs for that much space out. I guess it doesn't surprise me, given the rapid growth that they've had and their plans to continue that growth, not only in their traditional fulfillment centers, but sortation centers in the last mile, and probably the newest aspect of growth to their business is AmazonFresh and Amazon Pantry, which is the home delivery of groceries.","So I can't comment on the accuracy, but if that's the number that's out on the street, I guess I'm not surprised. They have very serious and aggressive plans to grow and they're a good partner of ours as we announced the deal in Houston this quarter. So we'll obviously, hopefully, continue to have opportunities to do more business with them. In terms of the yield on cost, 2 things that we look at is what are we buying? So if we're buying a single site that we are going to put into production right away, we can be a little bit more aggressive because we know that we'll be able to put that in production and deliverability inside of the year, and we're reasonably comfortable where our rents, stabilized yields and cap rates are, so we could be a little bit more aggressive.","When we're buying a site that might hold 2 or 3 buildings, and we're going to put 1 in production, we've got to be a little bit more conservative on buildings 2 and 3. It's more art than science at this point, but that's just kind of common sense. As you know, John, you've known us for an awfully long time, the biggest thing that we've done that has really helped the company's performance recently is change our operating culture. And in years gone by, we wanted to control 500-acre parks. And even in the best of markets, that's probably a 10-year supply, and it just doesn't make good fiscal sense to own a land for that long.","So today, we buy it in much smaller increments and we tend to put it in production much faster. So you eliminate the risk. You eliminate a lot of the carry on these larger sites.","John Guinee","So dirt plus debt wasn't a good idea?","James Connor","That would be correct. Thank you.","Operator","A question from Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","First, your re-leasing spread figure was quite high this quarter. Was there any particular deal that drove that or was this across-the-board? Market rents seem to be growing?","James Connor","Eric, it was really pretty much across the board.","Eric Frankel","And what was that number on a cash basis?","Mark Denien","Probably in the high single digits to maybe even pushing probably 10%.","Eric Frankel","Okay, great. And then related to Amazon, obviously, they've been a terrific customer of yours. They now represent roughly 5% of the portfolio rental revenue and it could be more if something happens to the medical office portfolio in the future, and then plus you have a couple of really large build-to-suits in the pipeline. So do you have any additional thoughts on what the upper cap is in terms of tenant concentration?","James Connor","Well, we don't have any hard and fast caps, Eric. We'd monitor all of our top 20 tenants across the portfolio. Clearly, our relationship with Amazon is very good. They have an A-rated balance sheet. They typically are doing very long-term leases on these facilities, so we're very comfortable. That having been said, we've done a pretty good job of being prudent asset managers, and you've seen us sell Amazon fulfillment centers over the years. And I think in the last few years, we've probably sold 4 of them, Delaware, a couple in Phoenix and one is Columbus, Ohio. So we managed that, but again, we're not managing to a hard fast 5% or anything like that.","Operator","We have a question from Rich Anderson. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","So I just did the back of the envelope. If you get to 3.8% same-store NOI growth, that takes into account the hhgregg impact of 40 basis points. And if you do, you did 5.2% this quarter. You need to average 3.3% the rest of the year to get to 3.8% same-store NOI growth? Is that really a possibility based on all the good things we're hearing about? Or if that happens, you might be - you might have a little issue with the stock price. I imagine it's going to be better than that. And I'm just curious if you want to let it play out or what you're really thinking about applying conservatism to the outlook.","James Connor","I think it's a combination of a little bit of conservatism because it is so early in the year. It was fairly easy for us to make the other adjustments, given how strong a start we had. There's still a handful of variables out there, and I think we'd like another quarter under our belt before we seriously readdress that.","Mark Denien","Yes. Last, I would add just one little thing to that, Rich, is we've averaged about 20 basis points of bad debt expense over the last 10 years. We've had virtually 0 in the last 18 to 24 months, and then hhgregg just said this. So we did of put a little bit of an additional bad debt expense in that guidance to get back up to that average that we've been running at over 10 years. So to the extent that doesn't happen, there could be some upside there.","Richard Anderson","And then a follow-up question, when you guys look at the implied value of your 2 portfolios, industrial and medical office, do you have a sense of - are the cap rates, the implied cap rate lower or higher in industrial versus medical office? Or is that just too difficult of a question to answer off the top of your head?","James Connor","Well, I think we can give you our humble opinion. I would tell you, based on consensus, we think both cap rates for industrial and MOB are probably above where they should be in today's market, now recognizing we're at a great point in the cycle for both product types. But I think on average, most people have our industrial between 5.25 and 5.5 and have our medical office north of a 5.5.","And I think based on things that we're seeing in the marketplace, cap rates are consistently below that. And I think you have to recognize the quality of our portfolio as it relates to other portfolios that have traded out there or in comparison to our peers. And if you look at the quality of the real estate, the average age, the size, the lease terms and everything else, we think we've got the best portfolio. So we ought to benefit from the lowest possible cap rate. But again, it's a theoretical analysis, so it's - we just look at it. It's not worth getting too worked up about.","Richard Anderson","Have you seen any deals, medical office deals with a 4 hand on it if they're big enough and high quality enough?","James Connor","We haven't seen a lot of portfolio deals just simply there hasn't been a lot that have traded, but there's been any number of one-off to maybe 2 and 3 building deals that have traded with 4 handles on them.","Operator","We have a question from Dick Schiller. Please go ahead.","Richard Schiller","How does the investment sales market look in terms of - are there big bulk portfolios that are on the market that are being marketed today?","James Connor","No, it's really pretty quiet. An opportunity for us to buy a 4-building package is probably the - one of the larger things we've seen out there that we thought was worth pursuing. And again, we've been fairly disciplined. We really only want to put or invest capital in those Tier 1 markets if we're going to stretch and pay the prices we have to pay for today. So yes, I think you can go back and look in probably the last couple of quarters. There just haven't been any of those bigger portfolios that would predominantly be in Tier 1 markets, where we really would be interested in stepping up.","Richard Schiller","Okay, makes sense. The lease buy out. Was that an MOB portfolio or the bulk distribution?","James Connor","It was one of the very last remaining office assets that we have. It was teed up to be sold. And it's a 3-building complex that's the headquarters for Interactive Intelligence that was recently bought by a company called Genesis. And they're going to continue to occupy 2 of the 3 buildings a long-term basis. So we did a lease buyout on the third which is the newest building here in Indianapolis, and we'll sell that as a user opportunity in the marketplace.","Richard Schiller","Got it. And the last for me, are there any other retailers that you're keeping your eye out that might go the same way as hhgregg that are in your portfolio today?","James Connor","I think the only real exposure that we've got concern for is Sears right now. We've got a large appliance distribution facility in the Lehigh Valley. So obviously, given Sears' recent statements, that's a concern to us. On the other side, we have a little bit of reason to be optimistic because the appliance business within Sears is really the only profitable business, and that ultimately could get sold to another user and we may have an opportunity to keep going, but that's really the only one from the headline companies that we've got exposure to. As I alluded to earlier, the Gander Mountain's and the Sports Authorities and those others, we don't have any leases with.","Operator","We have a question from Nick Yulico. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Yulico","As I look at your largest tenants list, it looks like Catholic health initiatives fell off. Were they the buyer of this MOB portfolio?","Mark Denien","No.","James Connor","No. Well, that's CHI. Yes. Mark's flipping pages. I may have to get it. We have to recheck that, but we'll get back to you on that one, Nick.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. And then going back to that sale, can you help me - help us understand why a hospital system would want to pay a 5 cap rate for buying properties back, unless there was - was there some sort of a writer-first refusal agreement in place here, a ground lease, where there was 0 maybe looking to sell the properties and so they had an option, but they had to pay the market price?","Mark Denien","No, really nothing like that. They did, like I think we said, a recapitalization. They went out and just got rated, and get a big bond deal, took out some debt that they had excess proceeds with their borrowing rate. Their borrowing rate is substantially lower than the cap rate they paid for the assets, and that's what they wanted to do. It's that simple.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. And can you just remind us as well for the medical office division, how much of the portfolio is subject to ground leases of hospitals, where they would be some sort of writer-first refusal agreement, how that process would work if you were looking to sell assets?","James Connor","I can't remember those numbers off the top of my head, but I would tell you that given the relationships with the health care systems, it would be a substantial number that would have all sorts of the ROFOs and ROFRs and options and things like that. Hospital systems tend to be very careful and cautious about laying leases on their campus. So they tend to protect themselves very well, but off the top of my head, we don't track that day in and day out.","Nicholas Yulico","You were saying that this specific sale did not have any sort of agreement like that in place?","James Connor","No. Well, it did, but it was an exercise. They came to us done, want to buy the buildings.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. And just, I guess, one other question on this is that is there also a typical sort of - is it like a 30-day type of agreement, where you're looking to sell properties and there's a ground lease in place, some sort of ROFO? Is that typically a 30-day type of agreement or if you're looking to sell an asset, there's like a 30-day window where the hospital system has the...","Mark Denien","Yes. Nick, we've got 85 buildings totaling, I don't know, 5 million square feet with a variety of different systems. They're all different. But the - none of these are governed by what I would call industry standards, so we've got them on some. We don't have them on others. Some have very quick triggers and some have longer triggers. It's just the course of a negotiation with the each individual hospital systems as we develop a relationship and we do development.","Operator","Our next question is from Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Jim, it's Michael Bilerman. As I think back over the history of Duke and from the large asset sales you've done when - I remember when you exited the flex business, when you exited the suburban office business, the proceeds were largely used to deliver, which was the main source. And somewhat, in some cases, for special dividends where you needed to - and fund from acquisition volume. You look at the company today, correct me if I'm wrong, but you're probably below your target leverage levels from a net to growth asset value and debt to EBITDA or at least towards that much lower end? So I guess, if you sold assets, what would you do with the money?","James Connor","Well, Michael, I'll give you the standard answer that we shared with a lot of people at conferences earlier this year when this was a very popular topic. If you think back in years gone by, particularly, in 2014 when we did the Starwood sale, which was $1 billion in and of itself, on top of that, we did another $1 billion of dispositions. And in that year, we basically pulled 5 different levels - levers, I should say. In no particular order, we fund development, we fund acquisitions, we deliver, we pay special dividends and we use seller financing. And I think what I've told everybody is, anytime we had a significant amount of dispositions in excess of what we could redeploy accretively into development and acquisitions, we pull those out of 3 levers, and that's, I think - we've demonstrated that in the past. I think you're absolutely right, we like where our leverage is. It's a little bit below our initial targets, but if we had to - if we were sitting on a bunch of cash, we could deliver that a little bit lower in the short term and save some dry powder and play offense in the future.","Michael Bilerman","But arguably, if you think about those 5 things, I assume seller financing in this type of environment, not there. Deleveraging is probably not the first choice. Acquisitions, you've said the biggest thing you're looking at, with a 4-property portfolio, so unless you're going to make a run at some public company, that doesn't seem that that's going to be there. Development has been ramping, but arguably, you're trying to tread lightly, if not, putting too much supply into the marketplace. And then at least the special dividend or returning capital to shareholders maybe through a stock buyback, but you may think your stock is at all the levels. So I'm still struggling if there was a large capital transaction, where does the money go other than sitting on the balance sheet?","James Connor","Well, I - you've answered your own question to a certain extent, Michael, because that's exactly what we've said. Why would we sell a big chunk of our business today? What would we do with the money? In theory, those are the 5 buckets that I can pull. You're absolutely right. None of them are particularly attractive. There are great acquisition opportunities out there to redeploy a significant amount of capital. We're pretty well funded on the development pipeline. I don't really need to or want to do deliver more. A special dividend money and returning money to the shareholders is always an option, and I think you're right. So if anything, it's not particularly attractive with the debt markets being where they are today. So all of that would lead you to the conclusion of you wouldn't want to do a major disposition.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Unless you were able to line something up almost immediately or you felt strategically, it would enhance your overall equity valuation.","James Connor","Agreed.","Operator","We'll move on to Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Related to the hhgregg move or bankruptcy, have you actually started marketing the space yet or you're just on a wait-and-hold period?","James Connor","No, no, no. We are actively marketing the space. They're still occupying it. And under the terms of the bankruptcy codes, if they continue to occupy the space into May, they are obligated to pay us rent, so we'll see how that plays out. As Mark mentioned earlier, we're not counting on any of that rent in our FFO and AFFO re-projections from the year, but yes - no, we're out - actively market all 3 spaces.","Eric Frankel","Okay. That's helpful. It was interesting, your pre-lease that you executed in Southern California with UPS, do you have a relationship with that company prior to the transaction? What is their - do you gather what their strategy is related to e-commerce?","James Connor","Well, yes, we have a relationship with UPS. They're a fantastic company, and obviously, they lease a lot of space across the country. They, along with some of their peers, who have benefited significantly from the e-commerce growth in this last 5 to 7 years, they are investing extensively in their distribution network and growing quite quickly. Earlier - earlier this year or late last year, we announced the sale of a very large vacant land track in Atlanta to Federal Express for a large facility as well. So yes, we do a lot of business with these guys and they're good quality people to deal with.","Eric Frankel","In terms of locations, is there a - how is their model different now than, say, pre-e-commerce, if you are to call it 10 years ago?","James Connor","Oh, I don't think it's substantially different. I think their needs follow the population. And so if you - if we all think back, we've driven by UPS and FedEx hubs that were closed in for that last mile because, historically, they have been the last mile, and I think you'll continue to see them do that business that doesn't garner nearly the headlines of facilities like this do. But they are investing and creating high-volume high throughput distribution centers to handle that need and this is just another example of one of those.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue.","Ronald Hubbard","Thanks, Paul.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to the VP Investor of Relations, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ronald Hubbard","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, President and CEO and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2015, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks, Ron and good afternoon everybody. Today I'll cover our key performance metrics for the quarter, then touch on highlights in leasing, development and dispositions, then I'll finish with an outlook on our business. Mark, will go over the first quarter financial performance, as well as the balance sheet activity.","We followed up a very strong 2015 with a great start to 2016. We increased our overall occupancy, including projects under development from 94.2% last quarter to 94.7% this quarter.","We ended the first quarter with in-service occupancy at 95.7, down 70% basis points from year end. This entire decrease was attributable to spec development projects that was placed in service this quarter, including 1.1 million square foot industrial facility in Lehigh Valley that was delivered on at zero percent leased.","We're very optimistic about the leasing prospects, given the strong demand outlook driven by ecommerce and consumer products companies that serve major Northeast markets.","When you exclude the impact of those spec developments, we actually increased our in-service occupancy by over 25 basis points. Nationally, the industrial market momentum continues to be very strong, demand outpaced supply for the 24 straight quarter, new supply in substantially all markets is in balance and demand for modern bulk space is still very high.","Preliminary net observation numbers for the first quarter are coming in around 60 million square feet. This is the second strongest first quarter since 2000. New supply in the first quarter was about 39 million square feet, resulting in another 10 basis point drop in vacancies nationwide to approximately 5.6%. Our outlook is for these fundamentals to continue to be favorable for the remainder of 2016.","We're seeing similar strength in our portfolio with the completion of 7.3 million square feet of leasing during the quarter. Notable activity this quarter includes 495,000 square foot lease signed for an entire speculative project in Northern New Jersey we started in the fourth quarter of 2015.","We also executed three renewal leases signed at the Port of Savannah totaling 646,000 square feet to a single 3PL customer. Our occupancy net market is up to 100%, that\u2019s up from the 86% range in early 2015.","The largest drivers for leasing in our portfolio continue to be ecommerce, consumer products, both directly with our corporate clients and indirectly with 3PLs, as well as the food and beverage industry.","With the strong leasing activity and our in-service portfolio of occupancy in the 96% range since the middle of 2014, we continue to be able to push rents as indicated by rent growth on our renewal industrial leases at over 15%.","In our medical office portfolio, we continue to have good momentum with our in-service occupancy emerging up slightly to 95.6% which is an all time record. We also have a strong pipeline for future development to go along with our existing development pipeline.","Our industrial development during the quarter, we started $161 million of industrial progress, totaling 2.6 million square feet about 87% pre-leased in the aggregate. These new projects include two builder suite deals totaling over 1.9 million square feet. The first deal is a 1.2 million square foot project with a 10 lease term in the Inland Empire East submarket to an ecommerce company that is a repeat customer.","The second builder suite is a 715,000 square facility in our St. Louis market for a 15 year lease term. This facility will be delivered to a new customer buyers, a large UK based public company that focuses on the health and personal care business.","Our development pipeline at quarter end had 27 projects under construction totaling 8.7 million square feet and a projected $694 million in stabilize cost at our share that are 79% pre-leased. We expect these projects to create 20% margins and generate about a 6.8% initial stabilized cash yield. We believe these margins are especially impressive due to the relatively low risk nature of the pipeline given that it\u2019s nearly 80% pre-leased.","Our development outlook is very solid with a pipeline of prospects that could - should continue to create value creation opportunities for the remainder of the year. Our land inventory now sits at $383 million, as a result of monetizing over $50 million of land in the quarter. This is our lowest inventory since 2004 and is another significant milestone for us. As I stated in 2014, our goal was to get and maintain our land bank of between $350 million and $400 million.","In capital recycling activity, we closed $90 million of building sales during the quarter across five transactions, four of which were suburban office deals that represents roughly 90% of this quarters disposition proceeds. I'll note we expect a large amount of disposition closings late in the second and early in the third quarter. This was anticipated and is consistent with our affirmation of guidance in the last nigh press release.","Now, let me turn it over to Mark, to discuss the financial results and capital transactions.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO was $0.28 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in core FFO was due to higher general and administrative expenses in the first quarter consistent with previous years and expectations, due to the accounting rules of acquired immediately expense a substantial portion of our annual stock compensation grant. This was partially offset by continued improvement in our overall real estate operations.","We generated $0.26 per share in AFFO for the quarter, which compares favorably to $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 and equates to a dividend payout ratio of 69%.","Same-property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended March 31, 2016 was 5.0 and 6.0% respectively. This growth is result of both increased occupancy and rental rates within our same property population.","I would point the decrease in same property operating expenses this quarter really had no impact on overall same property NOI since virtually all of these savings were passed on to the tenants through lower reimbursement revenue, particularly with such occupancy levels.","We do not modify our same property NOI growth guidance for the year because it obviously tougher to grow occupancy at the same rate we have been experiencing and there was still some overall economic uncertainty with still eight months left in the year.","Having said all those, if the leasing momentum continues it looks like we will be trending much closer to the top end of our guidance of 4.25% for the year. The proceeds of the building sold that Jim mentioned were used to fund the quarters development activity.","On April 1, we also received a $184 million partial repayment of the $200 million in seller financing that we provided for last year\u2019s suburban office disposition. We use these proceeds to repay the $148 million that was outstanding on our line of credit at March 31, 2016. And we used the remaining proceeds to fund for the development.","Our next significant debt maturity is a 5.9%, $390 million secured loan that matures in November and maybe repaid without penalty in May of this year. We will ultimately repay this maturity with proceeds from property dispositions, but due the fact that most of the 2016 dispositions are expected to close in the second half of the year we will temporarily utilize our line of credit to repay this loan in May.","We reported a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.1 time for the rolling 12 months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the 2.5 times we reported one year ago. We expect to see continued improvement throughout the year as we utilize disposition proceeds and further reduce leverage and as higher coupon maturing debt was replaced with overall lower borrowing cost.","Net debt to EBITDA for the rolling 12 months ended March 31, 2016 was 6.2 times compared to the 6.9 times that we reported for the rolling 12 months one year ago. Pro forma net debt to EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was 6.0 times when adjusted reflect the aforementioned $184 million sole financing repayment.","We were in a excellent liquidity position and expect to further improve our balance sheet and leverage metrics as the year progresses as outlined our guidance. I am very happy to report another excellent quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. Yesterday, we all of our guidance metrics laid out in late January, including our guidance for core FFO for 2016 of $1.15 to $1.21 per share and AFFO of a $1.02 to $1.08 per share.","In summary, we're very pleased with the results in the first quarter and optimistic about leading our goals laid out for 2016. We believe our development and operating platform can continue to outperform over the long-term.","With superior asset quality for today's customers including large, bulk assets that meet the unique demands of sophisticated ecommerce retailers, leveraging our 40 plus years development experience and our deep regional team to generate value creating industrial and MOB development projects, we'll utilize the proceeds from planned asset dispositions to self fund our development pipeline for this foreseeable future.","We'll continue to reduce leverage on top of what is already a best in class balance sheet and be in position to take advantage of future investments opportunities. We believe all of this sets the stage for consistent AFFO growth, which coupled with our sector low dividend payout ratio should provide for future dividend increases.","We'll now open up the lines for the audience. We ask participants to keep the dialog to one question or perhaps two very short questions and of course you're welcome to get back in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. It looks like Houston occupancy is holding up, almost 99%. Is that the same thing you're seeing on the ground? Or are you seeing anything changing on the ground there? If you can give us an update on Houston?","James Connor","Yes, Manny. I would tell you, I think activity level in Houston has been pretty consistent for the last three or four months, I mean we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019ve all seen the impact in the local economy from the energy sector. I\u2019m happy to report we don\u2019t have a great deal of exposure in Houston and our Houston portfolio is very stable.","We have modest activity on the vacancies that we do have and I'd like to believe we make a little bit of progress between now and the end of the year, but I don\u2019t think you'll see a great deal of development opportunity down there for the short term.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Maybe if we can talk about the transaction markets. You and Pierce have all said the industrial markets are certainly frothy and hard to buy anything. Is it the same in the MOB market or have you seen some opportunities? How much appetite do you have to acquire additional MOB properties?","James Connor","Well, I think we always have an appetite to acquire as long as we convince our sales and our investors that we're creating value. And I think what you're seeing with current pricing levels for good quality MOB product across the country is very consistent with what you're seeing at MLB. There is a great deal of demand, more demand and there is supply. It\u2019s very much a sector that is in favor.","So not a great many opportunities out there and certainly no really big good quality portfolios. But I expect if there were any they'd be at pricing point that we find very hard to stomach.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Ki Bin Kim [SunTrust Robinson Humphrey] Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Could you describe the amount of demand coming from e-commerce-related companies when it comes to leasing your development pipeline? Or for new space relative to just overall industry-wide expansion?","James Connor","Sure, Ki Bin. That\u2019s a topic we all chatted about and there is been a lot of research done. I've explained from our perspective it\u2019s really easy to get your arms around an Amazon.com or Walmart.com, a dedicated fulfillment facility, those are easy to track.","What's a little bit more difficult is our consumer products and retail customers that are continuing to expand and what portion of that expansion is directly attributable to ecommerce and what percentage is directly attributable to their more traditional bricks and mortar retail sales.","And then the other complicating factor is you know, there are number of very good high quality 3PL providers out there, that are doing ecommerce fulfillment for small and mid size companies and again, that\u2019s not easy to get your arms around.","There is been a lot of research lately that says ecommerce has probably provided some where in the range of 20% to 30% of the industrial demand that we've seen in this cycle and on the surface I think those are reasonable numbers. It has clearly been a large benefit factor to our growth, as evidence by the number of facilities that we've done and the types of facilities that we've done. So I hope that answers it?","Ki Bin Kim","And related to that, and if I look at your portfolio and where your assets are located for the industrial portion, I would say a lot more Chicago, Indianapolis, more of the regional markets, this seems like versus the major gateway cities like LA or New York.","How does that play into where the e-commerce companies want to develop their newer facilities closer to the customer? And does that have any impact on how you want to reposition the portfolio?","James Connor","I think there is two or three questions here. So first in terms of our portfolio, for many years we were viewed as a min-western company and sitting here today about 44% of our NOI comes from Tier 1 industrial markets around the country. So I think we've done a lot in the last few years to really change that perception.","Clearly, ecommerce fulfillment, the entire country has benefited from it, many years ago the locations were driven in a lot of instances by Internet and Internet related sales taxes an where they were today that\u2019s pretty an issue that\u2019s been taken away.","The large fulfillment centers are still all over the country and they are 800 to a 1 million square feet. We've seen a lot of headlines with the smaller infill last mile, and those facilities typically are probably in that 50,000 square foot range.","And I think you'll continue to see those, the reality though is you only need those in some of the top metro areas where you got population and logistical concerns, I've used this example a number of times in rules with investors and analysts, taking Amazon for example, they have four facility in Indianapolis and from anyone of those facilities you can get to anywhere in Indianapolis inside of an hour.","So that\u2019s just one example of a typical US second Tier city. That doesn\u2019t really need any infill last mile leasing opportunities. But I think you will continue to see those in the major metro areas, as they continue to fill out their logistics and supply chain.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria [Bank of America Merrill Lynch] Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the time. Just a question on the dispositions for the year in the suburban office market. What are you guys seeing in terms of pricing, cap rate expectations and the types of buyers and their use of financing?","James Connor","Well, I'll make a couple of comments. I think we're still seeing really strong activity for good core assets in the first Tier markets. I think we're seeing good activity in the second Tier markets as long as again, its good quality product.","I think we started to see in some of the second and third Tier markets for some one-off or maybe some B assets. I think we've seen the buyer pool thin a little bit. For everything that we have sold this year or that we have in the pipeline, we're continuing to be able to achieve the pricing expectations we have, so we have not seen an impact on pricing. But obviously that\u2019s subject is near to all of our hearts and we keep a very good eye on that.","Juan Sanabria","And any ranges you can give on cap rate expectations?","James Connor","I think Juan earlier in the year we said it would be probably somewhere around the mid-70s and I think we're still pretty comfortable with that guidance overall. I mean, you'll probably see a pretty wide range, but overall for what we have in our guidance I think min-70 is right in the ballpark.","Juan Sanabria","Great. Just a quick follow-up. Any sense of re-leasing expectations you can give us for what you're thinking for the balance of the year, both in the bulk and the MOB space that were very strong in the first quarter, particularly the MOBs? What's a sustainable number in your view?","James Connor","From an occupancy standpoint?","Juan Sanabria","Releasing spread, sorry.","James Connor","Oh, releasing spreads. So we reported 15% on a GAAP basis, I would tell you that, we think that rents are still holding up very strong out there and I think we can continue at about that pace based on what we have coming out for the foreseeable future.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Eric Frankel [Green Street Advisors] Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I was hoping you could touch upon the leasing activity for probably some of your larger vacancies in Indianapolis and Pennsylvania on the spec development side.","Mark Denien","Yes, sure Eric. I would tell you, we've got great activity on all of those, sitting here a month into the second quarter, I am anticipating a very good outlook for when we report numbers in the second quarter just based on the activity that we're seeing.","With the exception of just a couple of assets, we've got mid-size vacancy in Kansas City of about 400,000 feet and that market is been a little slow, couple of vacancies in Houston, which I touched on earlier. But other than that, we\u2019ve got really strong activity. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not anticipating any problems or extended lease ups on any of our new speculative projects.","Eric Frankel","Great. Touching upon the land bank, as you described in your introductory comments, do you see yourselves bulking up on land? Is it challenging to find good land parcels in the markets you want to be in, I guess what you would call your Tier 1 markets? I also noticed you reclassified some assets in your non-strategic bucket. That increase looks like $15 million to $105 million. What's exactly included in that now?","Mark Denien","I'll cover the last question Eric, the reclassification is our remaining land parcels that we have in Phoenix. We announced that we were exiting the Phoenix market, we made one of the little parcels, but it\u2019s mainly Phoenix land and we've already sold some of those assets or included in first quarter dispositions and the rest of its in various stages, it should close here in the second quarter.","So that\u2019s the increase in the land, reclassification should see and I'll let Jim cover the demand for land and other markets.","James Connor","Yes, Eric, let me be very clear, we will not, I repeat not, be bolting upon land. Its taken us a quite a while to get this land inventory down whoever want it, part of the challenge was selling off that non-strategic land, a lot of which was office land you know, we've benefited from the strength of this recovery.","So being able to sell that to users, other developers, sell it for other uses, multi family and retail and some instances. But we work really diligently to change the culture here and as I said originally we think we can run this company with a land bank quarter-to-quarter in that $350 million to $400 million range. So that\u2019s our goal going forward.","Eric Frankel","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. can you just talk a little bit more about the Pennsylvania industrial market and like some of the comments one of your peers made that was a tough market and over supplied and especially given the un-leased delivery you guys had in that market this quarter?","James Connor","Yes, Blaine I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m a little surprised at some of the questions regarding particularly the Lehigh Valley because that\u2019s a market today and although there is a handful of big bulk buildings, you are still talking about vacancy in that overall market is less than 4% and really strong demand particularly as I said earlier with the ecommerce and the consumer products companies, because that is the big regional bulk distribution markets that services that entire Northeast US population base.","So given the activity we\u2019re seeing on our single 1.1 million square foot building, I would tell you I\u2019m not concerned about that market either from a supply perspective or demand perspective.","And I think switching over to New Jersey the fact that we pre-leased roughly 500,000 foot spec building before it was even done, you know, speak to the strength of that marketplace. So I think some of that concerns are little misplaced.","Unidentified Analyst","Sure. Okay. , that\u2019s good news. And then kind of related to Eric\u2019s question, looks like you have a couple of developments that are projected in service in next quarter that are vacant especially 615,000 square foot in Atlanta, 403,000 in Chicago.","So I was hoping if you guys could just talk about how leasing was going on there and whether you think those could be a drag on occupancy next quarter similar to kind of the situation we saw this quarter?","James Connor","Well, Blaine I will tell you my expectation based on the activity that we have today and we have really good activity on all of those, particularly Atlanta and Chicago, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll get them all leased or get them half leased, but I\u2019m not anticipating that those are going to be a drag for an extended period of time.","We\u2019ve got really good activity as I highlighted with Eric, there is really only a couple of places that concern you right now and Atlanta and Chicago certainly aren\u2019t on that list.","Mark Denien","The last thing I would add to that Blaine is may be a drag on reported occupancy like we reported this quarter when Pennsylvania went in service, but won\u2019t be a drag relative to our guidance that we gave, because when we do the spec projects, it varies from market to market and project by project.","But on average we generally project about a six month lease up period and we\u2019ve been in most all cases exceeding that. So, there is some drag already in our FFO and AFFO numbers expected just to get those leased up.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from line of John Guinee [Stifel Nicolaus] Please go ahead.","Erin Aslakson","Hi. It\u2019s actually Erin Aslakson here. I wanted to ask actually about the reasons behind your exiting and classification and non-strategic of Phoenix?","James Connor","Sure, Eric. We've been operating in Phoenix for - I\u2019m going to say probably about six or seven years and from our perspective it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s primarily been a spec building, spec development or spec building market not a lot of build to suite activity and it tends to get over build fairly, quickly.","So as we looked at with our long-term growth plans and again we had four wholly owned buildings out there and one joint venture building, and one land site, it really just didn\u2019t play a key strategic role in our trying to grow on the West Coast. So we decided to take advantage of good pricing in the marketplace, sell those assets and really focus our energy on the West Coast.","Erin Aslakson","And those were all in a good year sub-market correct?","James Connor","That is correct.","Erin Aslakson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Sumit Sharma. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. I was wondering as you're taking a follow-up from Manny, the earlier question on buying MOB assets, I guess what I'm wondering is given the compression in cap rates on the MOB side, are there any thoughts on disposing some of them?","James Connor","Sumit, we proved that portfolio, the MOB portfolio that is in late 2013 and early 2014 of about $315 million of non-strategic assets. We did the same on the industrial portfolio in 2015, so both of those portfolios are in pretty good shape. Right now all of our disposition energy is really focusing on exiting the office portfolio.","It maybe \u2013 yes, it would surprise me if we looked at pruning some additional industrial maybe, some additional MOB in 2017 or 2018. But right now we\u2019re really focused on selling the office assets, so that we can at the end of the year be completely out of the office business.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, understood. Actually, another question around developments this time. So a lot has been said about the supply and demand equilibrium approaching in late 2016, 2017. I think a peer of yours has been pretty vocal over the last few quarters. To borrow a page from the multi-family guys, development yields are getting pressured. So are you seeing any signs similar to this on the warehouse front? Or the fact now or perhaps more interested in looking towards your outlook into 2017 and 2018?","James Connor","Well I would say, I think most people in this sector were very pleasantly surprised with 60 million square feet of net absorption. And I think if we continue to see that level of activity in the second quarter, I think that will push back everybody\u2019s expected equilibrium timing to probably sometime later into 2017, which I think is good for all of us.","In terms of competition and margins on our industrial development business, yes there is a lot of pressure out there and there is a lot of good effective competition. But one of the things I\u2019m proud of all of our guys is we've been able to, throughout this cycle maintain our development margins right in that kind of 19% to 21% or 22% for both the industrial and the MOB business.","So we've got really good teams on the ground. We've got really good lane to support that development. For the most part it\u2019s fully entitled and ready to go and we're proven developers. So our clients trust us when we can commit to development schedule. So we've been able to use that to our advantage.","Unidentified Analyst","Very good. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes thanks. Can you remind us your hurdles that you like to achieve before breaking on new projects are you still willing to start spec projects or you more focused on other right now?","James Connor","Well Mike, we\u2019re always focused on build to suits, as my counterpart over here likes to remind me, one thing he can be assured of is the yield on the build to suit is much more stable than that on the spec development. But we look at our overall development pipeline, which is just under $700 million right now.","And we've kind of set the floor at 50% and as you all will remember we did down below 50% briefly last year and when we do that, we like to be able to tell our investors in advance and tell them why and that was basically the timing of some spec projects. And we also are committed that we worked that backup and we had a lot of really good leasing on the spec side.","So we are evaluating spec development opportunities in the portfolio right now. And I think when the weather gets a little better in some of the Mid-Western and North Eastern markets its probably not unreasonable for us to start a few more projects because we are in really good shape on our development pipeline.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks. And Mark, can you remind us about the Starwood financing? Do you expect to get all of that repaid this year? I think you said in your comments that some of it was partially paid off.","Mark Denien","Yes, no we expected all, its all due by the end of the year. Its $200 million in total and we already got $184 of it, so there is only $16 million left and we will get that before the end of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Richard Schiller. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon, guys. We spoke about the re-leasing spreads earlier and those were positive. However, it seemed like the term on bulk distribution renewals was down from 2015. Is there anything to read into that there?","James Connor","No, I don\u2019t think so, I think that was just kind of an exception for one quarter. That\u2019s one of the first thing that caught Mark's my attention and most of the bulk steps we're seeing now is as a general rule, probably averaging closure to six years. So I think that is just a little nomination in the first quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thanks. And then finally, after you guys get through selling the rest of the suburban office portfolio, you'll probably be around 80%\/ 20% between office and MOB. Looking out to 2017, where do you see these percentages, if you have thought about that?","James Connor","Well, we thought lot about it, we haven\u2019t really set hard from targets, because primarily we\u2019re out chasing new development and both build to suits and some speculative on industrial. And as you know most of the MLB business really looks and functions like build to suits. So we\u2019re out chasing it much as that as we can get.","So you know, if that would go to 78:22 or if it was to go to 82:18, I don\u2019t think it would really bother us, we don\u2019t have any hard targets, we are not just chasing good value creation right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel [Green Street Advisors] Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. This might be a moot point the next quarter or two, but we did notice that your office occupancy declined roughly 300 basis points to 83%. Is that affecting the sale process in any shape or form?","James Connor","No, Eric I would comment that\u2019s solely due to asset mix, the assets we disposed, were much more highly leased in the assets that we still own, and we\u2019re still headed down the same path on the marketing and really have no impact. So it should from dispositions, it is not to losing organic occupancy if you will.","Eric Frankel","Okay. And I know we beat e-commerce -- we already talked about e-commerce a bunch this call, but I was hoping you could comment on smaller build-to-suits, maybe those that are a little bit closer to city centers. I know you guys have worked on really large fulfillment centers that are over 500,000 square feet or 1 million square feet or so. But I was hoping you could comment on maybe procuring those types of redevelopments in the future, maybe in the markets where you guys are most active.","James Connor","Yes sure Eric, I will make a couple of points. Actually most of those just go to traditional either first or second generation leasing, none of those given their size, that I\u2019m aware of has gone to build-suit, they are typically 50 to 75,000 feet and they take existing inventory they are looking for the right location.","We've been historically over the years, we've done a great deal of in fill redevelopment, so that\u2019s always an arrow in our quiver and as we have a redevelopment site and one of our ecommerce clients was interested in that, we'd be more than happy to pursue that.","But I think the truth is most of those are just done with existing leases, existing product that\u2019s in the marketplace.","Eric Frankel","Okay, thanks. Just a follow-up on that actually. Speaking of infill land sites, are there brownfield redevelopment opportunities that are available in the market today? I know you guys have taken that on in the last cycle in New Jersey and Baltimore. I wasn't sure if there was other large land sites that might be available this cycle, maybe the numbers penciled given where demand has been.","James Connor","We are, I would tell you that we probably have at any given time five or six of those in the hopper and there are all the Tier 1 industrial markets, New Jersey, South Florida, Chicago, Los Angeles.","And we\u2019re working on some right now, I think you could expect some development activities it is centered around some Brownfield redevelopment that will get announced this year.","Eric Frankel","Good to know. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman, please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey it\u2019s Michael Bilerman with Manny. Just getting curiosity in how much time did you spend\u2026","James Connor","Not a whole lot, given the size, location and the pricing, we just \u2013 it wasn\u2019t really our deal, it really didn\u2019t fit with us.","Unidentified Analyst","I mean out of those three variables what is the pricing that was the most limiting factor, look at the size of the transaction or was it just the assets side, I am just trying to understand sort of your approach to MOBs that you have been very successful developing but this businesses, this is a big piece of Duke, how you think strategically about either growing it more meaningfully outside of development or potentially selling or spending or merging it out if the pricing is quite rich for MOB. So I was trying to balance with those two variables.","James Connor","Well, I would tell you the size of the deal did bother us. We've done large deals before, never that large in the MOB sector, but we've done large deals like that in the industrial sector and as we continue to try and grow the business and create value that would not be in and of itself be a determent.","The pricing and the quality of the assets were really driver that kept us from pursuing the deal.","Unidentified Analyst","Now it is a pricing of that in terms of being very aggressive, give you any pause about strategically thinking about the MOB business as part of Duke or not?","James Connor","No it doesn\u2019t give me pause, it reassures me that we're creating a lot of value for the shareholders with the development that we\u2019re doing, just like we are on the industrial side.","So that said, we are very focused on exiting the office business and taking advantage of good pricing in that sector right now and we'll see what the future brings.","Unidentified Analyst","I'm curious in terms of the industrial landscape, over the last year you've had GLP consolidate a lot within US market, become the second largest owner of US product. You obviously had peeled the grow in buying KTR, and I'm curious whether you've noticed any change at all in the approach that the large owners, of which you are one of three, are doing in, at least on the public side, are having an impact at all in terms of whether it's pushing rents, whether it's development. You've had a lot of things happen.","James Connor","Well, I don\u2019t think the landscape has shifted because the big guys have gotten bigger, because I think the ownership and development population in the US is still very, very fragmented. I think we\u2019ve been able to push rents simply because of the strength of the marketplace. Not necessarily because we own more or PLV owns more, or GLP owns more, I think today the market fundamentals are very strong and that\u2019s what enabled us to drive the business.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Ki Bin Kim [SunTrust Robinson Humphrey] Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks, just a quick one. When is the last time you guys went through an appraisal process for your land bank?","James Connor","A formal appraisal process?","Ki Bin Kim","No, it doesn't have to be formal, but trying to get a sense. Some of this is historical book site has to be written down. Trying to get a sense of what that market value would be.","James Connor","Well, I'll start Ki Bin. Once at least once a year we take a look at all the land we\u2019ve identified for sale and write it down to lower phases of market. So I think we're very comfortable with all that land we've identified for sale, that it\u2019s worth every bit of what we have on the book for, I guess in aggregate, maybe not a lot more, but it\u2019s probably fairly close to fair value.","The development land that we got on our books of basis, somewhat we held for quite a few years and it\u2019s - we have identified to develop because we really like it. So we do believe that there is - certainly if you mark that to market, you would market up probably 15% to 25% of what we have it on our books for.","Ki Bin Kim","No, it doesn't have to be formal, but trying to get a sense. Some of this is historical book site has to be written down. Trying to get a sense of what that market value would be.","James Connor","Ki Bin, I would speculate that it\u2019s probably somewhere in the range of 50% and while on the surface that may seem a little low, I would remind you that all of our medical development is gone on land that is acquired specifically for that deal for the hospital or its hospital ground. So we have no inventory land for the medical business. So that piece of the development equation.","And again fundamentally we\u2019ve changed a lot about how we do the business. We are no longer really interested in owning land that we have to carry for 10 years. So we are much more economical about what we buy and how quickly we put it in to production.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time there is no further questions in queue.","Ronald Hubbard","Thank you, David. Thanks everyone for joining our call today. In addition we look forward to seeing many of you at our investor event at May 26 starting mid morning at the New York Stock Exchange, New York City. I will note that focus of the event is the unique opportunity to hear presentations from and to get to know our Executive Vice President leadership team that the engines out in the field that really continue to outperform and create value each and everyday for shareholders.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you Dach. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are, Denny Oklak, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mark Denien, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you our December 31, 2011, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon everyone. First, we would like to acknowledge all the people affected by Super-storm Sandy during the past week. We know that this storm inflicted unprecedented hardship and loss on many, particularly those of the East Coast where we have many friends on this call. So please note that you have been in our thoughts and prayers during this week and I would also just add as a sidebar that it appears that Duke Realty has been very fortunate and our properties have suffered minimal damage from the storm.","So moving on, today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments during the quarter in both our operational and asset strategies. Christie will then address our third quarter financial performance and progress on our capital strategy.","We followed up the positive momentum in the second quarter with a very solid third quarter across operations, asset repositioning and capital raising. We signed over 7.4 million square feet of leases in the third quarter and achieved extremely high tenant retention at 90%. We started $115 million of development projects, $44 million of bulk industrial and $48 million of medical office and a $23 million of suburban office project. Five of our seven new development starts are a 100% pre-leased while two projects are expected to start on our land in markets with excellent fundamentals. I\u2019ll touch on the developments in a little more detail shortly.","Our in-service occupancy increased 35 basis points from last quarter to 92.5% while our overall occupancy was relatively flat at quarter end at 91.9%. We made continued progress on our asset repositioning strategy during the quarter with a $92 million medical office portfolio acquisition and generated $34 million of proceeds from disposition of suburban office and non-core industrial and land assets.","On the capital front, we issued our second unsecured bond deal of the year of $300 million offering executed at Duke Realty record low effective yield of 3.93%, further lowering our cost to capital and further extending our debt maturities. Christie will speak more in depth on our capital activities in a moment.","As has been the case throughout 2012, economic indicators have been mixed and GDP growth slow. However, some key industrial demand drivers such as consumption, port traffic, the manufacturing index and trucking indices continue to trend up slightly. These demand indicators in the longer-term trends in ecommerce and supply chain modernization have put us in a great position given our high quality, modern growth portfolio. These factors are contributing to our strong industrial operations so far this year.","The medical office facility business remains active, particularly on the new development side and as you know, we recently acquired two larger medical office portfolios which help us expand that piece of our business. The suburban office sector continues to be sluggish in many markets given the lackluster employment growth, but some markets are beginning to show a comeback.","Looking at the remainder of the year, we expect continued steady results in our industrial and medical office businesses, yet are somewhat cautious on the overall economy going into 2013 until there is more clarity post election as to the U.S. fiscal situation.","Turning to operations; we had another strong quarter of leasing at 7.4 million square feet, bringing year-to-date total to nearly 21 million square feet, above last year, at this time by over 1.5 million square feet. As noted earlier, we renewed 90% of our leases during the quarter, a testament to our best-in-class operations teams and the high quality of our properties. Run rate growth continues to be positive in most markets at 1% overall growth across the portfolio.","With respect to same property performance, we achieved positive same property NOI growth for the 12 months, and three months ended September 30th, of 3.5% and 2% respectively. We expect the pace of same property growth to moderate over the next few quarters given the expected slower pace of our occupancy gains and only modest rental rate growth expected in the near-term.","Now let me touch on some key activity within each product type for the quarter. With respect to leasing in our in-service industrial portfolio, we\u2019re continuing to see fundamentals improve with the completion of nearly 1.1 million square foot of new industrial leases and about 4.9 million square feet of renewal and extension leases. Including new leases on development build-to-suites or industrial leases totaled over 6.6 million square feet.","Bulk industrial in-service occupancy for the quarter rose to nearly 94%, 40 basis points above the previous quarter and more than 150 basis points above a year ago. This reflects the overall relative strength of the bulk industrial market across the country. 11 of our 18 bulk markets are over 95% leased and only three are just slightly under 90%. We do know that there are some upcoming tenant move-outs, so we will need to back though, so we do not expect to see a significant increase in that occupancy over the next couple of quarters.","Some of our larger lease deals included a 598,000 square foot, five year renewal for a major internet retailer in our Cincinnati market and a 1.2 million square foot renewal for Hachette Book Group, a leading global publisher of books for their national fulfillment center in our Lebanon Business Park in Indianapolis.","In Columbus, we executed a major new expansion and renewal lease for Restoration Hardware. The new 418,000 square foot expansion was combined with an extension lease on the existing 805,000 square foot facility we developed back in 2008 all for our future 15 year term.","We also executed an expansion and renewal deal in Chicago at a bulk distribution facility we acquired in late 2011. The tenant Peacock Engineering signed an expansion totaling a 163,000 square feet and a lease extension at another near by facility totaling 360,000 square feet all for a blended term of 10 years.","The office leasing environment continues to be challenged across most markets as expected. We maintained our in-service portfolio occupancy at around 86% for the quarter and executed over 550,000 square feet of new and renewal leases. Some markets such as Raleigh, Nashville and Houston where we started speculative office project on our land are picking up with significant new demand. Most other markets are slow with limited job growth.","In the medical office sector, our team continues to take advantage of health system consolidation and the trends for greater outpatient services which continues to drive strong demand for our medical office business. Our medical office in-service occupancy increased 120 basis points from the previous quarter to 91.9%. There was also a substantial amount of medical office investment activity this quarter. We executed one acquisition, a portfolio of seven medical office assets totaling $92 million which comprises 334,000 square feet with a mix on and off campus facilities. The transaction was a sale leaseback for 15 years with the Harbin Clinic, the largest independent multi specialty physician practice in the State of Georgia. Harbin is the dominant healthcare provider in the rapidly growing region of Northwest Georgia. This was an excellent transaction on which we were directly with the tenant and their advisors over the last several months to complete. ","We also announced a significant MLB transaction that closed after quarter end during the month of October. We acquired a $342 million multi system portfolio that is comprised of 14 buildings totaling $1.2 million square feet. The acquisition included the assumption of $60 million of debt. The seller was [Casitas] Healthcare Properties, a private investment management firm. The acquisition is particularly significant for Duke Realty because it gives us a sizeable medical office presence in Florida, one of our targeted healthcare markets. ","The transaction also increases our holdings of high quality well leased properties that complement our existing healthcare portfolio in the south and southeast areas of the country, as well as expands our existing relationships with five different hospital systems including Adventist Health, Scott & White, Ascension Health and [Dinova] and with the Veterans Administration. ","The portfolio is currently 89% leased with over half of square footage leased to Anchor Health Systems or the VA. The portfolio has an average age of 7.5 years and average remaining lease term of 7.8 years and 13 of the 14 facilities are located on or adjacent to hospital campuses. This portfolio is one of the highest quality portfolios marketed in the last three to four years and fits strategically into our overall asset strategy. The combined Harbin and Seavest acquisitions totaled approximately $434 million and have a projected stabilized yield of about 7% with good annual rent increases. These are strong risk adjusted yields that are immediately accretive to our AFFO and provide long term rental rate growth. ","Including the (inaudible) deal which closed quarter end, our medical office portfolio now totals nearly $6.2 million square feet and we are now at our asset repositioning target of 15% of our total assets invested in medical office facilities. I want to congratulate our healthcare and acquisition teams for their excellent work in reaching this goal. ","Going forward you will see us focus less on acquisitions and more on building this MOB portfolio through new development with our many healthcare relationships. Disposition activity was relatively light in the third quarter with $34 million of proceeds, $9.4 million was from two non-core industrial assets, $8 million from two suburban office assets and $9.3 million from a medical office property held in a joint venture with the remaining proceeds on developed land parcels. ","Now turning to development, I'm pleased to report that our development starts year-to-date are the strongest in several years. After $259 million of starts during the first two quarters, we started another $115 million across seven projects during the third quarter, with a diversified mix of industrial, medical office, office, builder suit and speculator projects. All consistent with our asset strategy. ","In total we have 4.7 million square feet across 18 projects under construction that are 75% pre-leased in the aggregate. The development start this quarter, includes three industrial facilities, two projects are the expansion projects I previously mentioned. The first one is in Columbus, a 418,000 square foot expansion for restoration hardware. We acquired (inaudible) land purchase option at our West Jefferson Park and when complete the bulk industrial facility will total over 1.2 million square feet and serve as a retailer\u2019s primary distribution center for the eastern US. The second expansion was in Chicago, a 163,000 square foot add-on to an existing 243,000 square foot facility we acquired in late 2011. On both of the expansion projects, we're expecting stabilized yields in the 7.25% range.","We also started an industrial spec development, a project that briefly mentioned on the last call. It's a 600,000 square foot facility, expandable to 1 million square feet. Indianapolis fundamentals continue to improve with the current vacancy at 5.2% and rent growth averaging 2% this year. We're strategically placing this facility in the northwest Indianapolis sub-market in our AllPoints at Anson Business Park. Though some speculative industrial development is going on in the city, no other [bulk] warehouse buildings are planned in the northwest sub-market and we're 95.3% leased in our In-service industrial portfolio.","We started one other speculative deal this quarter, a 158,000 square foot, phase 2 office building in Houston, transaction that I also mentioned on the last call. The project is located on the remaining 8 acres of our 42 acres Sam Houston Crossing Park in the northwest submarket of Houston. As I am sure you are all aware that Houston economy and real estate market is very strong and we have high interest in the project. We project to achieve a stabilized return north of 9% on this building.","Lastly we began three 100% pre-leased on-campus medical developments totaling 181,000 square feet in Atlanta, Cincinnati and Indianapolis, with an average lease term of 15 years. Each transaction was sourced from existing tenant relationships, Northside Hospital, [Tryout] and community health. Including these three news MOB development starts, our medical office development pipeline at quarter end totals 210 million and is 97% pre leased. Moreover our medical office development pipeline remains robust as we head into 2013.","Our total development pipeline at September 30 stands at 4.7 million square feet totaling 475 million of stabilized costs. We are projecting a weighted average stabilized yield of 7.3% at an average yield over the initial term of 8.1%. As you can see our development platform is once again beginning to drive growth. We are a strategic land bank and key personnel in a number of markets that are experiencing very strong real estate fundamental and we expect to execute on additional build-to-suit and selective spec development opportunities. ","I will now turn the call over to Christie to discuss the financial results and capital plans.","","Christie Kelly","Thanks Denny and good afternoon everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide an update on our third quarter financial performance as well as the progress on our capital strategy. Our third quarter 2012, core FFO was $0.26 per share, which is consistent with core FFO per share for the second quarter of 2012. We generated $0.20 per share in AFFO in the third quarter of 2012, which is slightly down from $0.21 per share in the second quarter of 2012, but under the score improved from $0.18 per share in the third quarter of 2011.","This growth in AFFO over the prior year as a result of the continued successful execution of our asset repositioning and operating plan. At September 30, we now owned approximately 31% less in service office square footage than a year ago. For the nine month year-to-date measurement period ending September 30, our AFFO per share has grown 5.2% over the comparable period in 2011, which is inline with the result we predicted when we announced our asset repositioning three years ago.","With regard to payout ratio, AFFO for the quarter translates into a conservative 85%, while our year-to-date payout ratio is slightly below 84%. We are pleased with our operating results for the quarter and anticipate continued solid execution throughout the rest of the year.","Turning to the capital side of the business, we have successfully generated new capital through several transactions during the quarter in an effort to lower house capital and fund the continued execution of our asset strategy. In September, we took advantage of the favorable interest rate environment and successfully executed a $300 million offering of senior unsecured notes at a 3.93% effective yield. This offering represents our lowest coupon rate ever for us for a non-convertible issuance. ","We are very pleased with the timing and execution of this transaction and by the acceptance of our investors in the market. We utilize the capital generated during the quarter to repay $191 million of unsecured debts that matured to fund our continued development activity as well as to fund the $92 million Harbin Medical Office portfolio acquisitions. ","We ended the third quarter with a $113 million in cash which was utilized in October to repay $50 million of unsecured notes at [debt] maturity as well as to partially fund the Seavest Medical Office acquisitions that closed in October. ","During the third quarter of 2012, we issued approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock under our $200 million ATM program, generating net proceeds of approximately $85 million. Since the end of September, we have issued an additional $1.5 million of our common shares which generated net proceeds of approximately $22 million. ","We have been strategic in utilizing our current ATM program and issuances to-date have averaged $14.87 per share. Proceeds from this ATM program have been used to fund our acquisition and our development activity as we've communicated. ","We generated $34 million in proceeds from non-strategic asset dispositions as Denny previously mentioned. We also expect disposition proceeds to increase significantly during the fourth quarter. ","These proceeds will also be used to fund acquisitions and development expenditures including the Seavest MOB acquisition. Our liquidity is very solid. We had no borrowings outstanding on our $850 million line of credit at September 30 and after the previously mentioned $50 million of unsecured debt that was paid off in early October; we have no significant debt maturities until May of 2013. ","I will conclude by saying that I'm very pleased with our results for the third quarter and we believe we have continued to execute on all aspects of our strategy. ","And with that I will turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Christie. Yesterday, we narrowed our guidance for FFO per share to $1 to $1.04 for 2012. And we are confident about our opportunities for the fourth quarter. In closing, after a solid quarter we believe our value creation story is gaining momentum as our operations continue to improve with strong occupancy, modest rental rate growth, our capital raising continues to be highly efficient, our delevering plan is on target and our asset repositioning continues with a solid development pipeline and the demonstrated ability to execute strategic acquisitions and dispositions. ","Thanks again for your support of Duke Realty and now we will be happy to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Brendan Maiorana [Wells Fargo]. Please go ahead. ","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Christie, I had a question with the outlook on leverage. If we go back to the beginning of the year or if we just look at what you guys have done this year, acquisitions net of dispositions are $575 million. You have done $370 million of development starts not spending. And at the sometime, I think your ATM issuance today, if we layer in the amount that you have done, that\u2019s for October, I think it's probably somewhere around $250 million, $260 million. It seem like your leverage is moving up at a time at the beginning of the year when you expect the leverage to move down. What are you going to do to get leverage down?","Christie Kelly","Brendan, I just want to say, as it relates to leverage, we have basically held that plan with second quarter performance. We went out in the second quarter with a $300 million offering and we also went out this quarter with a $300 million offering and we've been balancing the compliments associated with our asset strategy, really effectively over the last couple of years as it relates to capital strategy execution. ","As we look forward, we're going to keep pulling the levers that we've put in place to manage our leverage which also include non-strategic dispositions that we've outlined and so, specifically what we are going to do get our leverage executed as it relates to our longer range target is continue to execute on non-strategic dispositions and as well to the extent that we are funding growth, we're going to fund growth with 60% associated with both equity issuance as well as dispositions. ","And we are just going to keep on, specifically as you look forward to 2013, we are committed to our goals and view that we are on track to execute those goals as I had communicated previously.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo ","So I guess just sort of thinking about that from a high level, if your goals are still that I think debt-to-EBITDA, debt plus preferred EBITDA of 7.75 times and debt plus preferred to over GAV of 50% and you are going to fund that kind of the growth with 60% equity, call it 40% debt at the margin and then delever via net dispositions, is it is that suggesting that to get to those leverage targets that there is a reduction in the asset base because it would seem like there would need to be more equity issue if you were going to meet those targets with growth in the asset base?","","Christie Kelly","Brendan what we said is that we are going to keep our business effectively the same and that\u2019s the way we have really driven forward and so specifically as it relates to equity what we have said is that we are looking to issue equity wrapped around our strategy acquisition and we are also issuing equity very prudently as I had mentioned we have that ATM program out for two years before we pull the trigger and specifically as it relates to the overall price performance on the second ATM program that\u2019s overall been at $14.87 and so while I would love to just snap my fingers and have our multiple specifically inline with our peers particularly if you look at AFFO and the fact that we have moved billions of dollars worth of product in terms of non-strategic dispositions and really grown AFFO. ","Hence, kept a very modest coverage ratio, I would love to have that all work, and so we are working at every single day to make sure that we are executing in the best interest of our shareholders and still bring our leverage in alignment with everybody on the phone and our investors would expect of top quality (inaudible) such as ourselves.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo ","Sure, and then the other question I had was just with respect to guidance, if I look at, it\u2019s sort of a same question what you have got, your acquisitions were more than expected dispositions thus far it had been a little bit than expected. And it seems like your core operating metrics are trending ahead of expectation, so you are still sort of towards the midpoint, you are couple of pennies ahead had but you are kind of near the midpoint, is there, was it just more issuance on the ATM or was it the September debt offering, what caused you from not having your underlying earnings guidance be a little bit higher?","Christie Kelly","Well, first Brendan, I just want to remind everybody and I know you this is that we bunked our guidance last quarter $0.02. We are also taking the range and the midpoints above consensus and you are right. We have been outperforming in terms of operations and as well we\u2019ve really been keeping pace with our peer set as well as outperforming in the market. And in terms of execution, the quality of the earnings is very strong. It\u2019s really just a matter of timing as well as the fact that we have really invested accretively as it relates to development, and that\u2019s going to take a little while to come on line, but over the long term those are really value accretion plays for our shareholders. So I think the message that I would leave everybody with is that we have solid performance, we are executing ahead of plan, we are specifically driving shareholder value and you can expect us to do that going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Josh Attie with Citigroup.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Can you tell us what the line of credit balance today after all the deals that you've announced in October?","Christie Kelly","After all the deals that we've announced in October Josh, we've got $150 million to $200 million.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","And how much, you know you've already brought the suburban office portion of the portfolio down to around 30%, how much more non-core is there to sell?","Christie Kelly","$500 million or there about.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay, and how do you think about I think there's also, you have almost $180 million of high coupon preferreds that mature or that are redeemable early next year, how do you think about funding that; do you have a pipeline of asset sales that a lot could get done between now and then, how should we think about those preferreds whether you plan to redeem them early and how you would potentially fund that?","Christie Kelly","We have a strong pipeline of disposition Josh and I'll turn it over to Denny to just to comment a bit on the market and what we are seeing out there.","Denny Oklak","Josh, I think the first thing I would point out is we can't redeem them early, they are not redeemable until February of next year. So otherwise we probably would have done that ","Christie Kelly","We've chipped away at everything that we possibly could Josh since the \u201909 time period as you know.","Denny Oklak","And so yeah as Christie said we still have some room to go to get us down to our 25% target overall on the suburban office piece. As you noted we are at about 30% to 31% right now. So we are still focused on selling some of those non-strategic assets which will get us there.","And as Christie mentioned in her prepared remarks and I guess going back and looking we really haven't had a balance on our line of credit for a year now. This is sort of the first balance of any that we've had since we did the Blackstone transaction. And that's really the way we are operating today. We are not running a balance on our line at all except for miscellaneous timing differences.","So our intent is to at year end with the closing of the dispositions we have in the pipeline here to have again, no balance on our line at the end of the year and then we will just have to see what our close is as to how we fund those preferred, potential preferred redemption in early next year or actually late February next year. So I don't know that we are in a position to exactly answer that yet until we see how the dispositions at close go in the fourth quarter.","Christie Kelly","And again, I would just like to reiterate that we are just going to keep doing what we've been doing and from the perspective of really managing our cash flow forecast together with the acquisition, development and disposition, we have a very good perspective on what it is that we need to do. We're involved in following the market every day so that we can pull the trigger at the right time to the extent that it makes sense to do something from an equity perspective and we're just going to keep, we're going to keep adding.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","If I could just follow up on the dispositions, you did a lot last year, you did about $115 million to-date and if you take the preferred redemption, the line of credit balance, that\u2019s about $300 million of asset sales or capital between now and February or March, can you just talk about what you have in the disposition pipeline? Is there a lot of good activity? Are there large and chunky deals and that\u2019s why the activity has been slower year-to-date?","Denny Oklak","So, I would say, yes to both of those. I guess, first of all, I would say, what I said was, I believe with our dispositions in the fourth quarter, we won't have a balance in our line of credit from like the Seavest and Harbin acquisitions. And actually we didn\u2019t have a line of credit after the Harbin, didn\u2019t have a balance on the line after the Harbin acquisition. So we actually have a $113 million of cash at the end of third quarter. We paid down some $50 million of the debt. The rest of that went basically towards to the Seavest acquisition and then I think with the disposition proceeds in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll basically took care of Seavest.","But what I also said, Josh, I think it's still even though it's only three months away, it's still little early for us to exactly tell you how we plan to redeem those preferred shares in February, because we\u2019ll just have to see how the disposition plan goes over the next three months.","And then going back to your disposition yeah, it has been relatively slow for the first basically nine months of this year on the disposition side because we have been working through some tougher assets, smaller portfolios, but we have also been marketing some larger portfolios and I think you will see that overall disposition activity pickup in the fourth quarter.","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","I guess just kind of bigger picture right in terms of leverage, do you guys feel may be that heading into what could be a recovery, may be it makes sense to have a little bit more leverage and take advantage of lower rates; I mean has something changed in your though process? And then along the same line, just looking at the supplemental, year-over-year your net debt to EBITDA metrics haven\u2019t moved all that much, but if you were bake in kind of where we stand today in terms of the acquisitions you have done and then may be and including the EIBTDA from those acquisitions; those were materially better?","","Christie Kelly","I\u2019ll start with the later part of your question first; I mean that\u2019s a matter of timing right. We ended up by executing the Blackstone transaction here on this a year ago and with that $1.80 billion acquisition that had some EBITDA that went with it and we have been reinvesting for EBITDA generation and as it relates to the outlook, yes it\u2019s very solid and stronger EBITDA profile than what our company had before, so positive.","As it relates to leverage, we are committed to delevering our balance sheet and specifically that's why you have seen us be very measured in terms of what we have executed from an unsecured debt perspective. We do not view that levering up in this environment is the right thing for our shareholders and we are able to run our business in a disciplined fashion such that we can appropriately manage the investments from the acquisition and development perspective and fund it accordingly without levering up.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","So in terms of numbers, what is the proforma net debt to EBITDA at today, and then what\u2019s your goal?","Christie Kelly","Today, we closed the quarter with debt plus preferred EBITDA at a little north of 8 and 8.4 and in terms of the target for 2013 is to bring under at 7.75 which we\u2019re committed to do.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Do you think, it has moved as a result of the post quarter transactions?","Christie Kelly","Jamie, in terms of post quarter transactions, I mean I can get back to you on specifically, what that is, as it relates to proforma; I am looking at it on a longer term basis given almost $500 million that we have got invested in development. The significant amount of acquisitions that we have executed over the past 2.5 years and further the income generation from the outstanding operating performance of our in place portfolio.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay, and then just turning to operations; I mean, how are you guys doing on the kind of continuation of the warehouse recovery; it had a very good year to say, even like this you don\u2019t have two years, do you feel like we can continue the momentum here; you feel like maybe its losing a little steam, how are you looking ahead and what are the key drivers.","Dennis Oklak","Jimmy I think its still pretty strong out there right now. I mean reasonably strong and steady. I don't really feel like there's anything that's pushing us back. I would also say that I still wouldn't call us in any kind of a boom in the industrial business, I mean we certainly picked up on occupancy really across the country, the occupancies are in pretty good shape. There's still I qualify this except for Southern California. There's still relatively little spec development going on around the country, so we are not in what I would call a high growth mode, but leasing activity is still pretty strong and I think when you look at an economy that's growing at between 1.5% and 2% I think we should all feel pretty good about the industrial fundamentals and how they have been. ","Again looking forward, pending of some kind of resolution to the whole fiscal cliff issue, I think we are looking at again in 2013 growth like we've seen this year in the 1.5% to 2.5%, and I think if that occurs we will see continued slow and steady improvement in the industrial business. You know if the fiscal cliff causes the economy to turnaround and go into a recession or negative growth next year than it\u2019s probably a different story. I think we will see some stagnation in the industrial business if that happens and probably most other businesses.","Christie Kelly","My only point there is, as it relates to Duke Realty we have very modest lease rollover and some of the longer lease terms in the industry. So as we look at what's in front of us and as it relates to the risk profile, whether that be asymmetric to the downside or not, I would say we have a very solid performance profile going forward. ","The only other thing I will add to that too, is as it relates to our progress to date, our beta has come in significantly and something that we track every month, every quarter, every year and we have improved our beta over 20% over the past year of execution on our asset strategy which has been better than office, industrial as well as the healthcare comps and over the five year average we\u2019ve brought that in 30%. So we are very focused on making sure that we have the right risk profile and further to that are prepared for any risk off sort of environment that we maybe heading into for 2013.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay and then I think on the call you had mentioned some known move-outs that you are now expecting warehouse occupancy to grow, can you talk us through some of those.","Dennis Oklak","Yeah, there's a couple of bigger ones that come up, I think mostly early next year. The one that I would mentioned specifically is Wal-Mart in Savannah is an 800,000 square feet. They have given us notice that they are not going to renew that lease. And then it\u2019s a combination of a few again also in that several hundred thousand square feet and I'm not talking about 50,000 square feet or so, I'm talking about a few bigger ones. So we just have some work to do on that (inaudible).","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Anything on the office side?","Christie Kelly","Not really.","Dennis Oklak","No, not really. I can\u2019t think of anything significant on the office side coming at us. What's hurt us more on the office side over the last 12 months is some unanticipated bankruptcies. So, hopefully we don\u2019t have anymore of those coming at us.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Okay, and then finally, just looking at the same store page, so medical office you got 8.1% NOI growth, you had 0.9% occupancy growth. Can you just talk us through some of those numbers? How do you get such big revenue growth and such big expense growth in that business and then also you had mentioned those bumps on the new acquisition? What's the magnitude of those bumps?","Dennis Oklak","Well, first of all, all are the same property in the medical [offer], I think you have to remember that\u2019s a relative small portfolio still today and it's a relatively new and growing portfolio. So a lot of that increase of NOI, I will call in excess of occupancy is really some (inaudible) free rent that has been out there but then, there is also again within that portfolio, there is good annual run rate increases, higher than we would see on the industrial side, pretty much throughout that portfolio and that\u2019s generally in the 2% to 3% range, sometimes even a little higher than that, and that would also be true of the medical office acquisitions that we recently completed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors","Denny, I know you referenced the fiscal cliff and just the wild card there and talked about reducing the risk profile from an operational perspective, but how do you think about levering up a bit here with some of the acquisitions that you\u2019ve made out of that uncertainty?","Dennis Oklak","Well again John what I would say is we don\u2019t view that we are levering up. We\u2019ve always said through this repositioning cycle that we have been going through here that things aren\u2019t going to always match up. Sometimes dispositions would occur before acquisitions and sometimes acquisitions would occur before dispositions. But I think if you look at our history over the three years or so in doing this, we were pretty fortunate and matched them up pretty well, and so what we are seeing is that we still think we have got that matching going on and by the end of this year everything should be matched up again and nobody will think that we have levered up to do this.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors","By the end of this year, okay. And then Christie you had mentioned that you would contemplate an equity issuance wrapped around a strategic acquisition do you see best one such?","Christie Kelly","John we thought about that, and given the strength of the disposition pipeline and what we saw coming for in front of us that we didn\u2019t really think that that was the appropriate response for our investors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors","Okay, so in other words we shouldn\u2019t expect to taking Denny\u2019s comments about having everything lined up by the end of this year. We shouldn\u2019t expect a marketed deal between now and year end if there is any equity issuance they would likely be on ATM?","Dennis Oklak","I would say that\u2019s probably right John, and again it just depends on how the disposition activity goes and where a lot credit balances because we basically said we are trying to keep that line of credit eventually zero and timing wise it will go and down little bit, but we want to keep it at zero.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors","Okay, and then last week Denny just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of whether you think you are being compensated or what you think as the appropriate margin to be compensated for the risk of development specially when you think about kind of stabilize yield on the pipeline of 73 and cap rates here at 7 stabilized, do you think you can buy that?","Dennis Oklak","Well, I think when you look at our development pipeline today, John it is really, I would say pretty nominal risk in it. That called $475 million pipeline is 75% freely since most almost all the vacancy is in those three spec holdings that we started in the second and third quarter this year. So I think we are taking very, very minimal risk almost, the rest of the pipeline is basically 100% lease build to suits. Most of it on the MOB side but I guess a little bit of the industrial like those two expansions that I mentioned that are also 100% lease. So I really think there is almost no risk in our development pipeline today.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors","This is a fair point, but also with those kinds of margins, you are not creating a lot of value either?","Dennis Oklak","I would tell you, we are when you look at those. Again a lot of this are MOB with buildings, with 15 leases (inaudible) 15 years with high credit tenants, then those are going to trade at fix cap today, I think even getting a 100 or 125 basis points or more yield we are creating some value there, a lot of value. ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) looks like we have a follow-up question from the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","","So Denny a follow-up, just wanted to ask you a little bit about the Houston spec office building. Houston is not a big market for you guys especially on the office side and I guess from your prepared comments this is an add-on into the existing parks that you guys have, but should we take this deal as indicative that you are likely to grow more in Houston and specifically on the office side?","Denny Oklak","No, I guess that's two different questions. One is yes, I think we are likely to grow more in Houston but two, not on the office side. Again, this is a site when we first moved into Houston five years or six years ago now I guess. We bought one site right on the eight (inaudible) on the northwest side sort of north northwest. We built a spec building just basically an identical building to what we are building now. ","We leased it up to a 100%, it\u2019s a 100% leased today and we have ones we\u2019ve sold some of the land and we had one site left to again just do a rear building right on the (inaudible). So that market is so strong right now, I mean the office vacancy in that submarket is under 5% and so and it was a lot of demand in the market. So we just made a decision now is the right time to start that building and we've got I would say, I think that building is a 158,000 square feet, I would say we've got 450,000 square feet of prospects for that building today and its not going to be done until mid next year. So we feel really good about that one and its just one of those isolated areas where we had a piece of ground that it was time of build on.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","And related to that and we've had this discussion about land periodically for the past several years, but I don't think you and I at least have talked about it. Over the past couple of quarters your land balance its over $2 a share and its remained relatively high and I know that the amount of development starts that are out there are somewhat sluggish and some of the development that you are doing is build-to-suit that's not on land that you have an inventory now, but do you see a pathway to getting that balance down to more reasonable levels over the next few years or do you think in this, and you call it a 2% economy that its just going to be a higher balance than you would like to carry for a while?","Denny Oklak","Well, a couple of things I would say relative to land and development combined here. First of all, it\u2019s been pretty difficult to really sell any land in this market. The last two years have been two of the slowest years we've ever had on just selling land in the more like $20 million to $30 million range. So we've had a little success there and but not a whole lot. Second, development has been pretty slow but I think as far as the industrial and the office development that we've started, we've employed some land there which is good and this for example some of the expansion work we had, we put on our land. We've done some build-to-suits on our land over the last couple of years in the industrial side and then on the office side, that Primerica deal, that office deal we got going in Atlanta was a 15 year lease with Primerica who is A rated company and that use some of our land for our legacy part and then I take a lot of, all of spec development that we started, the three projects were on our existing land. ","So now I think we're starting to see an acceleration of deploying that land in the development and then the final piece, I would say, our land is, the medical office business doesn\u2019t really, we don\u2019t own any land for that and really don\u2019t employ any of our land generally speaking and if we are employing our own land, we buy it right as we are starting the project. ","So a lot of that is on long-term ground leases. So yeah, if you could always target the exact amount of land that you wanted to own, certainly over the last three years or four years, we would have owned as much as we did but now we got some really key strategic land positions there and I think we are going to be able to take advantage of them as development picks up.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","If you are $613 million today? Where do you kind of see that balance trending over the next several years and where would you like to get eventually?","","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we probably want that somewhere down in $350 million to $400 million. We would probably be more of a target for us and there is couple of reasons for that but two other major ones are increase in our MOB business because we don\u2019t need land for that and now that\u2019s going to be 15% of our business and actually right now it\u2019s been a higher percentage than that on our development business. ","And then second, the suburban office piece of the business is more expensive land then the industrial piece, so that\u2019s now down from if you think about where we started this repositioning which was sort of in the middle of this downturn, we were at 55% suburban office and so now we are down to around 30% right now. ","So going forward, I think you are going to see a lot lower investment and may be even almost no investment in suburban office development land.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","And about how long do you think it will take to get down to those levels?","Denny Oklak","","Well can you tell me what the economy is going to be like for the next two years or three years then I can answer that question.","","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Let\u2019s say it\u2019s the same as it is?","Denny Oklak","","I think it will take us at least three or four years to get there.","","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Josh Attie with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Thanks. On the suburban office portfolio the same-store growth has been flat to up year-to-date and the occupancy has been kind of flattish, can you talk about what the driver that growth has been and also what the rent spreads are?","Denny Oklak","","Well, Josh I would say couple of things, the occupancy has been relatively flat because strategically to get to our target when we lease up a building we it\u2019s ready to sell, we sell it, if it\u2019s not in our one of our longer-term strategic market. So some of that occupancy stay in right there at 85% to 86% level it\u2019s been driven by our strategic plan. ","As far as the same-store growth goes, we have been, I would say that portfolio generally speaking has been pretty stable especially post Blackstone disposition, some markets have gone up a little bit and been good as I mentioned earlier. Our occupancy in Raleigh today is I think 94.5% on the suburban office site, so it\u2019s been very strong. ","We struggled a little bit in St. Louis. We have lost a little bit of our occupancy there, but if you look at in the aggregate it\u2019s been pretty stable. So we\u2019ve at least been able to hold our row and generate a little bit of same-store growth from that property even in this environment.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","What kind of role, what have been the rents spreads on new leases generally that portfolio?","Denny Oklak","Well, last year a little bit positive, but I think when you look back at that portfolio most of, a lot of that is in the markets where we had big fluctuations in rent. So we haven't had any big decreases in rental rates for the most part on that portfolio.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","It\u2019s flat up on a GAAP basis or a cash basis?","Denny Oklak","GAAP is how we count.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","So probably down a little bit on cash?","Denny Oklak","Potentially but not much, I wouldn\u2019t say because, I would say we would also say we don\u2019t get as bigger bumps in rent on suburban office side as we are getting on clearly medical office side and probably not even on industrial today.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay, and then one more question on the build-to-suite industrial project in Chino, that opens I think early next year, what's the activity and there's nothing leased yet, what's the activity been and do you expect that to be fully leased when it opens or will it take 12 months after it\u2019s finished to kind of lease up?","Denny Oklak","Yes, it won't be complete until I think towards the end of the first quarter next year. The activity has been pretty good. We've had some pretty good discussions with folks. We are probably going to want to since we are starting limited spec development out there, we are going to be more inclined to hold what we want our rental rates to be especially I would say that market, so I can't really say whether it will be leased, when it opens fully leased, but I think it will lease in what our proforma timeframe was for that development.","Operator","We also have another follow-up question from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","","Denny, similar to the question I asked on warehouse, can you talk a little bit more about suburban office in terms of I know you had mentioned some markets that are getting stronger, but in general there has been a lot of talk about less space per employee, tenants wanting more efficient space, wanting new construction, kind of what are you seeing across your entire portfolio outside the top markets that maybe further drag on the recovery rather than just job growth?","Denny Oklak","Well, Jamie, I think we've seen the trend of less space per employee and a few of those different things now for the last decade probably. So I think that trend is maybe continuing, but that was probably about out of steam, because you just can't go any further. And then the other thing that happens is our parking rate is parking, really because our parking ratio used to be 3% to 3.5% per thousand square feet. Today we are building them at maybe 4.5% to 5.5% per thousand square feet if we are building them or some tenants are demanding that. So it just gets harder to fit more people in there. And then if you try to do that then your cost goes up, you know new construction can't compete because the cost goes up, because of the office land, you need more land to put that parking or you need to build that. So your basis goes up. So again I think there are some competing factors there. ","I would say that I think the main driver of the suburban office business today is really demand and how companies, how confident companies are feeling. So when we see growth, we see companies whose business is doing really well and they need more space and they are expanding. In most other places we just see companies just holding the same or even slightly downsizing when they want to renew. And I think that's just been a consistent theme, and even though we are starting to see some job growth that appears maybe a little bit more than we were only in certain markets are we seeing that translate into the net significant net absorption in the suburban office business.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) At this time, there are no further questions on the call.","Denny Oklak","I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at NARIET Conference in San Diego in a few weeks. Or if not, we will reconvene during our fourth quarter and year end earnings call in late January.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, Mala. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2013 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you Ron, good afternoon everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments for the quarter and then Jim Connor will give you an update on our leasing and development activity. I\u2019ll review our asset recycling transactions and Mark will then address our third quarter financial performance and balance sheet.","I have to say that the third quarter of 2014 was one of Duke Realty\u2019s best quarters ever. Our operating fundamentals were at near record levels. We placed in service over 3.6 million square feet of new developments which were 98% leased and have an 8.6% GAAP yield. We continued our asset recycling by selling a $175 million of mostly suburban office assets at a 6.2% in place cap rate creating significant value for the company. I\u2019m very proud of the teams we have in place throughout organization and their ability to execute the real estate transactions and operations as well as or better than anyone in the business.","Specifically, we signed 5.9 million square feet of leases and finished the quarter at 95.4% in service occupancy rate, our highest level since 1995.","Rent on renewal leases for the quarter accelerated to 9%, up from the 7.5% to 8% level of the first two quarters. This performance reflects tightening fundamentals and the quality of our modern bulk industrial portfolio. We also started $100 million of new development projects at solid yields, bringing our total starts year-to-date to $419 million.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor to give a little more color on our operations.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everybody. From an operational standpoint, we had a strong quarter of leasing at 5.9 million square feet, as Denny noted. Our tenant retention was a little over 58% because in this tight industrial market we\u2019re able to opportunistically upgrade the quality of our tenants and the economic terms of the leases in place by bringing some new tenants that\u2019s indicated in the overall improvement in our occupancy during the quarter.","Now, let me touch on some of the key activity within each of our product types. With respect to our industrial portfolio, we continue to see fundamentals improve with completion of 5.1 million square feet of total leasing. In-service occupancy in the bulk industrial portfolio was 96.6%, 200 basis points higher than a year ago and an all time high for us.","In addition to the exceptional leasing execution by our team, we continue to capture rental rate growth, which is a key focus of company right now. With growth on industrial lease renewals of 9.2% for the quarter, the highest growth rate in 12 years. We are seeing broad strake in industrial leasing across all our markets. As an example, our Indianapolis portfolio best in class modern bulk industrial product continues to benefit from strong demand from regional and national companies that are modernizing supply chains, as well as the e-commerce players choosing Indi as a primary distribution location.","Our 19.4 million square foot Indianapolis portfolio is 99.7% occupied with only 60,000 square feet of available space in service buildings. The Indianapolis market wide industrial vacancy is just over 5%. Our Indianapolis portfolio has realized average net effective rent growth of 12% year-to-date, up from the mid single-digit level last year.","Some other notable new leases signed during the quarter that drove occupancy higher were in Savannah where we signed two new leases totaling 1.2 million square feet with Home Depot national distribution centers. We also executed a new lease for 446,000 square feet at Nashville with B&G Foods North America and a new lease for 216,000 square feet with UPS Supply Chain Logistics in central New Jersey. On the lease renewal side, we also executed a 414,000 square foot lease with General Motors in Cincinnati.","We are 95.5% leased or better in 18 of our primary 22 markets with six of our markets at 100% occupancy, which positions our portfolio in the sweet spot to continue to push rents and reduce concessions.","Now turning to the medical office, the portfolio continues to perform well with an in-service occupancy level of 93.9% and the same property NOI up nearly 6% on the trailing 12 month basis driven by a combination of occupancy increases, rent growth and operating efficiencies.","The suburban office market continues to improve with our in-service occupancy up 30 basis points over the prior quarter after excluding the effect of dispositions and a partially leased development project that was placed in service. Our team had an exceptional quarter leasing with nearly 700,000 square feet of leases with notable activity in St. Louis market where we signed 12 leases totaling 244,000 square feet which improved occupancy 80 basis points in that market. We have also signed an additional 60,000 square foot new lease in the St. Louis market in early October.","Turning to development, we had a $100 million of development starts in three projects in the third quarter, totaling 1.1 million square feet expected to generate a 6.8% weighted average initial stabilized yield. Two industrial developments commenced, the first was a 150,000 square foot build to suit industrial project on our land in the Gateway North Center in Minneapolis with Blue Dart Corporation. This is our third build to suit in the Gateway North Business Park in the last 10 months which is another testament to our development expertise and our strategic land holdings. I would also point out that as of today we\u2019re now 100% leased in Minneapolis.","The second industrial development is a 783,000 square feet speculative project we started in Southern California. The project is located in the Inland Empire, a market has absorbed over 25 million square feet of space year-to-date according CBRE, a pace that is slightly ahead of last year, while vacancy has dropped to mid 4% range down from the low 5% from the area a year ago. Finally, I\u2019ll note that our 5 million square foot industrial portfolio in California, we\u2019re currently 97% leased and believe it is the opportunity time to start speculative development in that market.","On the suburban office side, we started another project in Raleigh in our Perimeter Park development. Perimeter 4 is a six storey 192,000 square foot Class A office building. As many of you know, we owned prime land at in Raleigh adjacent to the Research Triangle Park and the Raleigh International Airport and are benefiting from an economic boom in the region with single-digit office vacancy rates and markets rents up 3% year-over-year. The current project is 71% pre-leased to ChannelAdvisor Corporation, with a promising list of prospects to fill the remaining space. Many of you will remember that in 2013, we started two similar projects in the same park in Raleigh. I\u2019m pleased to note that both those project were delivered on time and have been leasing ahead of budget currently at a combined 85% level. The two delivered projects are on target to achieve projected stabilized yields in the mid 9% range.","From an overall development pipeline perspective, at quarter end we have 24% projects under construction totaling 8.3 million square feet and a projected a 627 million in stabilized cost at our share, that are 59% preleased in the aggregate. This pre-leased percentage is down a bit from previous quarters due in fact as Denny said, this quarter we placed 3.6 million square feet of developments in service that were 98% leased in aggregate.","Our current pipeline has an initial cash stabilized yield of 7.1% and a GAAP yield of 7.7%, once again highlighting the tremendous value creation being executed by our team and the value of our strategic land holdings.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny to cover some of our asset recycling activities.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Jim. With respect to investment activity, we had a $175 million of primarily suburban office dispositions during the quarter across three transactions. As we alluded to in the last call, we\u2019ve been focused on selling suburban in the Midwest as well as taking advantage of good market pricing to sell a few select assets in the Southeast.","As many of may have seen in the news, we closed on the sale of the Royal Palm buildings in Broward County, Florida. These two buildings encompassed 466,000 square feet and were sold for $275 per square foot. We acquired this complex in 2010 and had a gross investment basis of about $245 per square foot, which represents excellent value creation for shareholders.","The second disposition transaction we closed in the Southeast was Millenia Lakes in Orlando. This was a three building complex held in joint venture and included a 12 acre parcel of land as well. The office complex was sold for about a $193 per square foot with total net proceeds to us of $40 million, which represented nearly 25% gain over the gross basis.","Finally, we sold an 11-building 2.1 million square foot non-strategic industrial portfolio in Indianapolis, also held in joint venture where we had a 10% ownership interest. Our share of the sale proceeds for this disposition was $7.4 million.","On the land side, we sold 9 million of non-strategic parcels during the quarter. In addition, I\u2019ll note that combining land sales with development projects and in land year-to-date we\u2019ve monetized 470 acres or about $84 million of land.","Now let me share and update about additional dispositions. We\u2019ve alluded to on previous calls and some that are in the news. First, we have about 10 other transactions, mainly suburban office properties and our two remaining retail centers that are in the market or under contract. We expect to close these in the fourth quarter. So a few may spillover into the first quarter. All of these transactions are part of our 2014 disposition guidance.","There are two other larger deals recently offered to the market that have been in the real estate news. The first is an industrial portfolio comprised of 56 non-strategic building, 5.9 million square feet for an average of about 100,000 square feet per building. The portfolio is currently 91.7% occupied and the buildings are on average 23 years old. This industrial portfolio is located in primarily Midwest cities.","With the recent compression in cap rates we\u2019ve seen for this type of industrial assets, we believe this is another great value creation opportunity. Timing wise, we expect bids on the portfolio in about a month and would expect to close early next year. This package is not part of our 2014 guidance.","The second large package recently put out on the market and in the news is a nine building 1 million square foot 90% occupied suburban office portfolio located in Saint Louise and two office parks known as [Medical] Center and Woods Mill. We expect the timing of this sale to be in late first quarter of next year and also these are not part of our 2014 disposition guidance.","To summarize our asset transactions, we continue to take advantage of a favorable window in the real estate and capital market cycles to maximize proceeds in suburban office and other non-strategic assets and allocate capital primarily into value creating development activities or further deleveraging actions.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and capital plans.","Mark Denien","","Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide an","update on our financial performance, as well as an overview of our capital transactions. Core FFO was $0.30 per share for the third quarter represented by strong operational performance, delivery of developments and offset a bit from dispositions. Same property NOI growth for the 12 and 3 months ended September 30th was 3.8% and 6.0% respectively. The quarterly number is higher than expected due to exceptionally strong leasing activity, rental rate growth across all product types and extremely low bad debt expense for the quarter.","As Denny noted, our growth in average net effective rental renewals was 9.0% for the third quarter and is 8.0% year-to-date. This growth in net effective rent was driven primarily by rent growth in our industrial portfolio where we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to continue to push rental rates.","We generated $0.26 per share in AFFO, which equates to a dividend payout ratio of 65% compared to $0.25 per share in the second quarter. We expect there will be an uptick in second generation CapEx during the fourth quarter related to our recent leasing activity, which is reflected our revised annual AFFO guidance of $0.95 to $0.97 per share. As we continue to improve our overall operations and have a higher percentage of our income come from high quality lower CapEx old properties, we\u2019re producing a consistent growth in AFFO and driving down our already conservative AFFO payout ratio.","As we previously mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we issued 3.1 million common shares through our ATM program in July raising total proceeds of $55 million. These were issued at an average price of $18.09 per share. Later in the third quarter we raised an additional $10 million of proceeds through the ATM program at an average price of $18.58 per share. Building and land sales generated a $185 million of proceeds during the quarter, a portion of these proceeds were used to redeem our $96 million and 6.625% Series J preferred shares, which will resulted in over a $6 million annualized reduction in preferred dividends.","All of these capital transactions coupled with our operational performance resulted in a continued trend of improvement in our key financial metrics. We reported a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.4 times for the rolling 12 months ended September 30th compared to 2.0 times we reported for the year prior. For just the third quarter, fixed charge coverage is now up to 2.5 times.","Net debt plus preferred to EBITDA for the rolling 12 months ended September30, 2014 was 7.2 times compared to the 7.4 times we reported last quarter and 8.3 times we reported for the rolling 12 months ended September 30, 2013. When looking at this metric for just the current quarter, it improved to 7.1 times.","Also during the quarter, we closed on a renewal of our unsecured revolving credit facility increasing the potential maximum facility size from $850 million to $1.2 billion at a 20 basis point reduction in rate and extended the term to January of 2019.","We are in an excellent liquidity position and our leverage metrics continue to improve. We are very well-positioned to continue bolstering the balance sheet, fund our development pipeline and address our next significant debt maturity in February 2015.","I will conclude by saying that I\u2019m very happy to report an another strong quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Mark. As a result of this outstanding performance, we are pleased that yesterday we were able to raise the low-end of our guidance for FFO per share by $0.02 narrowing our 2014 range to $1.17 to $1.19 per share and raising the midpoint by $0.01. Similarly, as Mark said, we raised our guidance for AFFO per share by $0.01, narrowing our 2014 range to $0.95 to $0.97 per share. We also range same-property guidance from a range of 2% to 4% up to a range of 3.75% to 4.5%.","In closing, we are pleased with our team\u2019s outstanding operational performance and allocation of capital year-to-date and expect the solid finish to the year. We believe dispositions currently in the market will continue our asset recycling into primarily high quality development projects, continue to increase overall quality and stability of year-over-year growth of cash flow per share.","With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions. And we ask to participants to keep the dialog to one question or perhaps two very short questions. You are of course welcome to get back in the queue. Thanks. Go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question we\u2019ll go to the line of Jaime Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Hey, thank you and good afternoon. Just I guess it\u2019s a quarter later, can you guys just give a sense of which markets this quarter you sense are still taking up that maybe weren\u2019t quite as strong last quarter? And then which you think you are starting to get more concerned about supply or maybe just slowing down on the demand side?","Denny Oklak","Sure Jamie. I think no matter who\u2019s numbers you use, across the country you\u2019re seeing great activity, great net absorption. I think, you started to see some numbers in -- I\u2019ll just kind of work my way around the country. Atlanta and Chicago and Pennsylvania all had good quarters of net absorption. Those markets are all in very good balance. Going down south, Houston had another good quarter. Their pipeline of spec development continues to be well leased. Dallas as we have talked about, increased the amount of spec space a little bit. So I think that\u2019s we\u2019ve got our eye on that market. Southern California just continues to perform at a huge level as I reiterated earlier. They had another I think approaching 6 million square feet of net absorption in the third quarter. I don\u2019t t think if missed any. It\u2019s some of the secondary markets. Cincinnati had a great quarter, some of the Florida market, South Florida had another great quarter of leasing there. So those are kind of really the highlights going around the system. Dallas is probably the only one that we\u2019re watching a little bit. Some people have referred to Indianapolis but as I alluded to in the call, our Indianapolis portfolio is performing so well. We chose to build some additional product down there just to have some expansions base for our existing tenant base. So we feel pretty good about that market. And I think that\u2019s really the highlight.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And just a follow-up. As you think about some of these secondary markets that are starting to pick up, is it the same types of demand, is it ecommerce, is it supply chain or is there something different happening in those markets?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think the big ecommerce is primarily the Tier 1 markets. You are seeing some of the infill leasing for some of the e-commerce guys and some of the secondary, tertiary markets, but the big notable million square feet deals that our favorite retail and ecommerce companies are primarily in the Tier 1 markets. You just, you\u2019re seeing good activity across all sectors in the industrial pipeline. So, I think e-commerce continues to be a big part of the performance but you cannot credit it solely to e-commerce like you probably would have maybe two or three years ago. I think you\u2019ve got just the macro economy that\u2019s pretty much hitting on all cylinders from the industrial perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to line of Vance Edelson. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Terrific, thanks. So, just on selling the 11 industrial buildings in Minneapolis, it\u2019s a market you described as very robust and it\u2019s benefiting from the e-commerce. Could you share a little more on what the JV\u2019s rational was for pulling out of those assets?","Denny Oklak","Sure Vance. That is the JV that we formed back before we went public back in 1992. So, as we said in prepared remarks, we only owned 10% of that and the rest of it is owned by institutional investor. And obviously a 22 year run which is tremendous run for them on those assets and they just decided to -- that they were ready to sell and move onto something else. So as since the [vector] was in place for 22 years, those assets were getting older in nature and so they wanted to sell. And again I think the results from that disposition were extremely favorable and we\u2019re seeing that in the markets really I would say across the board today. ","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Did you have an opportunity to buy them but they\u2019re older assets, so you didn\u2019t want them?","Denny Oklak","Yes, we could have bought them, but yes that\u2019s right. You know that our philosophy is that with the new larger modern bulk product and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on, on the development and has been on the acquisition side.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then\u2026","Mark Denien","You\u2019re less than 200,000 for the building and your average age is well over 25 years.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That make sense. And then with valuations on the office side continuing to move up, would you consider more non-core dispositions than you would have earlier in the year or perhaps even placing on the market what you want to consider to be more core if the price looks good?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we have sold some core what we would call core office product in the Southeast. Earlier this year we had the joint venture with 3630 in Atlanta then selling the Royal Palm buildings and Millenia buildings, those were all excellent core assets in I would call it core office market. So, yes, we were happy to do that when we think the timing is right. And then as we said, we\u2019ve got a big portfolio of suburban office assets in St. Louis that\u2019s now in the market plus some other miscellaneous office product in various markets. So, we think the pricing is good right now and that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing. So we\u2019ll continue to prune that portfolio.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Kevin Baron. Your line is open.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Hi. Good afternoon. Denny, you kind of talked about already to mark that portfolio that\u2019s available in St. Louis I guess for marketing. Could you just talk a little bit more about the strategy with the Midwest suburban office and the marketplace Cincinnati and St. Louis those assets are running in the low 80s for occupancy. And the sales that you\u2019ve completed in the past quarters have been more stabilized assets. So maybe just speak about how much lease up is needed just to generate that investor interest. And then maybe just talk about the pricing trends that you\u2019re kind of seeing within those particular markets?","Denny Oklak","Well, let me start with the St. Louis. As we\u2019ve said on the call, as Jim said that market is I would call it on fire for suburban office when you compare to what we\u2019ve seen for a long, long time. And so, one of the projects that I mentioned on the call was around in the script was Woods Mill. Woods Mill is a two office building portfolio we\u2019ve owned for probably 10 years and it\u2019s now 100% leased. And so there is some other product there that is also moving up and at a very high occupancy. So, we are looking at marketing those as we get those leased up. And that again somewhat why our remaining occupancy always looks a little bit low because we continue to have good leasing success and then we mark those assets for sale.","The similar story I would say over in Cincinnati, but probably not the level of leasing activity that we\u2019ve seen in St. Louis at this point in time. So, we continue again earlier this year, we sold about $150 million package in Cincinnati and we continue to look at other opportunities to sell some of those assets also.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Okay. And then just one follow-up. If you look at the development page in the supplemental, the developed margins declined from 21% last quarter to 18% if you kind of look at the midpoint of the projected value creation. So, another deliveries starts in the quarter impact your numbers. But can you just walk us through what is pressuring those margins; is it new land costs or construction costs and then maybe how we should think about that over the next 12 months or so?","Mark Denien","Kevin, this is Mark. I\u2019ll start with that and I\u2019ll let Denny or Jim chime in on what\u2019s left in that portfolio. But part of what\u2019s driving the decrease in the margin is the product mix. We\u2019ve placed in service this quarter a couple of our office projects down in [Riley] that Denny or Jim mentioned. We\u2019re in the mid 9.5% yield range with still obviously the margin on those projects on office site. We were getting better margins in the industrial that we\u2019re left with. So, the development pipeline that sits here today is much more heavily weighted towards the industrial product than it was the office a quarter ago. And then as it comes specifically to the margin on the industrial, Jim, I don\u2019t know if you had anything.","Jim Connor","Yes. And the only other comment, I think you\u2019ll continue to see that number fluctuate a little bit depending on how much of the volume is in our newer markets. So for example, the Southern California is a market we\u2019ve really just geared up to start the development in. We acquired that piece of property last quarter to be able to put it in service. So, the yields there are not going to be as good as our mature markets where we\u2019ve owned strategic land for a number of years on a really good basis. And I think 18% is still pretty good.","Kevin Baron - Citi","All right. Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","","And next we\u2019ll go to line of Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. Good afternoon. Looking at your leased rate, it\u2019s very high. I think it\u2019s about as high as it\u2019s been. But if I look at the occupancy rate as you disclosed it on page 16, there is a pretty healthy spread between leased and average commenced occupancy. And that\u2019s a stat that you guys have only offered more recently, but it\u2019s 350 basis points wide across the overall portfolio, it\u2019s 370 basis points just in the bulk side. How should we think about what a normalized spread leased versus occupied should be and what does that mean for occupancy trends as we think about it over the next few quarters?","Mark Denien","Yes, Brendan, I\u2019ll see if I can try to answer part of that. That 350 basis-point spread was certainly wider than we have historically run out. We\u2019ve been more in the 150 to 225 basis-point spread I would say, so the 350 is definitely wider. A couple of things I would point out. If that spread is not that wide in our same property pool, if you look at the same property page in the supplemental, it\u2019s the commencement occupancy is closer to the 95% range. So the spread on that pool is more like a 150 to 175 basis-point which is what we\u2019ve been traditionally running at. What we\u2019re dealing with is only about 75% of our NOI right now is in our same property pool, because as we\u2019re going through this dispositioning phase, we\u2019re selling older assets and we\u2019re replacing it with a new development pipeline that takes 24 months before it makes its way in same store. So about 25% of our total NOI is not in the same property pool yet and that\u2019s where we\u2019re really seeing significant NOI growth. And I think that that 350 basis-point spread will translate into additional NOI increases as we get through the next several quarters; it just may not all show up in the same property pool. ","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And Mark just related to that, your occupancy guidance I think suggests that a modest dip in the fourth quarter; is there anything specific or just that\u2019s just kind of natural expirations?","Mark Denien","Yes, Brandon our occupancy guidance is an average, not an endpoint. And if you look at it on average, what it really would suggest it will be right around a very top in the guidance. And because we were within that range, we just decided not to update the guidance.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay.","Mark Denien","So, if there was any dip at all I would say it would be very, very modest.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And just real quick one, you have $250 million of debt with February maturity and high rates, 738. So, I think can you pay that off three months early and if so, what would be likely rate if you were to go to the market today?","Mark Denien","Yes, we\u2019re probably looking at 4%, maybe just under 4% for 10 year money give or take right now. We could not pay it off early without a fairly substantial make whole premium. And we\u2019re looking -- as Denny mentioned, we have a lot of dispositions in the pipeline, we do like the debt rates we have right now, but we\u2019re just trying to right now Brendan balance out the disposition proceed with the maturities we have coming at us. There is a lot of different ways we can take care of that February maturity, but needless to say that all pretty attractive relative to the rate we have on that debt. ","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. ","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Thank you very much. Just hoping you can maybe just explain operating expenses; they seem to be at a pretty low rate this quarter, especially about that some of your peers have reported some higher operating expenses just I was, I want to get an explanation whether it\u2019s a one-time thing or you expect operating expenses to ramp up over the next year or so?","Denny Oklak","Yes Eric, I guess to be honest with you, it didn\u2019t really pop out to me or us that they were that extremely low. Operation, we have pretty good quarter overall, but just trying to think here, not been stuck. We obviously had very high operating expenses in the first quarter with weather related issues. I guess in a lot of our cities, the first quarter and the third quarter is really the highest quarter of operating expenses we have because of weather conditions either cold or hot. And we have a pretty mild summer, so that maybe a part of the driver. So I\u2019ll have to look into that and get back to you again.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Just my follow-up question regarding the leasing spread. So, Jim you commented you\u2019re able to -- a little bit higher quality rental. Could you comment on leasing spreads for those new tenants are in place?","Jim Connor","Well, we\u2019ve certainly -- that\u2019s been a lot of time talking about this in the last few quarters. We continue to monitor very closely the number and percentage of leases in the portfolio that we\u2019re done in the trough period that 2009 to 2011 period. And we\u2019re generally working out on the renewal side, the next two to three quarters. So, the next 18 months we still got about 50% of the portfolio rolling, 50% of the square footage that is rolling in the next 18 months is from that trough period. So, we were seeing very good opportunity to push rents there.","The other place we\u2019re pushing back is concessions are down and lease terms are up. Because our occupancies are so high, we\u2019ve got certain tenants that we want to renew for shorter periods of time that we\u2019ve got limited opportunity to push the rents and extend the terms out. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to take advantage of that. So that\u2019s the first piece of its is, the trough rents. And the other piece of it is just a result of the high occupancy. When most of our operating units are above 95.5%, they can dictate some pretty good terms. So we\u2019ve been pushing a lot on not only the rental rates, but also the annual increases. And we\u2019re pretty consistently getting 2.5% increases now on our industrial annual escalations, which has been a pretty healthy improvement over the years gone by.","Denny Oklak","And Eric, as you know we\u2019ve not historically tracked new leasing spreads and a lot of that we\u2019ve talked about has been because as we were more predominantly office, it was really hard to measure one lease to the other because the type of build out and space was actually different since lot heard on the office side than the industrial. But we\u2019re trying to track that data now on the industrial side. And I would tell you that the spread on our new leases on the industrial is maybe 100 basis points lower than the renewal spread, but they\u2019re very much in some ballpark on the industrial side.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to line of Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe Jim to start with you. On the development side, I think you need $80 million to $180 million of development starts in the fourth quarter to hit your guidance. I assume you have good visibility on that. And that\u2019s not going to be an issue. But I guess I\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re thinking in terms of kind of the runway for development kind of the total pipeline as you think without giving guidance for 2015. But how does that build the two pipeline look and any kind of timing issues where we\u2019d see a slowdown or could see a pick-up in the development activity overall?","Jim Connor","Well Dave, I\u2019m going to have to choose my words very carefully because I\u2019ve got three guys in the room looking at me now. I would tell you and I think everybody would have the same sense as you look at where we are in 2014 and what we need to achieve to hit hard, the midpoint of our guidance, I would tell you I think we all feel very good about that. As you look at the U.S. industrial market, you\u2019ll look at the improving office market; you\u2019ll look at the healthcare business all of which contribute to our new development pipeline. I would tell you we have the same sense of confidence for 2015 that we\u2019re currently enjoying. So, I think we\u2019re reasonably optimistic.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then maybe on the medical office side, are you still seeing opportunities to do development in medical? And on the flip side, given the strength in cap rates and valuations of assets I mean is it maybe to think about maybe putting more of those out to market as well as you move into 2015?","Jim Connor","Well, to answer the first question, yes, we\u2019re seeing a lot of additional opportunities. As the healthcare industry as a whole continues to go through an ambulation, we\u2019re seeing a lot of off campus opportunities. We\u2019re picking and choosing those on a very limited basis. We like those that are in line with major systems and long-term lease components. We like those that tie into our existing core markets. So, we\u2019re continuing to see those. On-campus opportunities probably not as strong as the off-campus opportunities in terms of just of the pure numbers. But I will tell you there are a lot of very big projects out there in the marketplace. So, we think the pipeline for the medical business is very strong for the fourth quarter and for going into 2015.","In terms of spreads, the medical business is enjoying great cap rate compression just like the industrial business is. And we could monetize large pieces of that at anytime if we so chose. I think as we\u2019ve demonstrated and consistently told you guys in the last quarter, we\u2019d much rather take advantage of the opportunity to reposition the portfolio through the sales of the suburban office properties because we\u2019re getting real good cap rates there that historically we haven\u2019t seen.","The only thing you see ourselves would be pruning the portfolio, we prune the MLV portfolio late in 2013 with a few assets trickling in it early 2014. We really don\u2019t anticipate we need to do that. You will see that portfolio that Denny talked about earlier on the industrial side, again that\u2019s just kind of pruning the portfolio some older and some non-strategic assets for us. So, I think that will be the extent of it in those two product types.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. I\u2019m not sure, if I missed this, but the two other larger deals that you said are out for sale and I realize you have closed yet. But did you talk about a dollar range for those assets on a cap rate range?","Denny Oklak","We didn\u2019t really talk about that. I guess I would -- and especially since we\u2019re in the market right now, I\u2019d rather not talk about that. So, what I can say Ki Bin is that those are included in the guidance as we said in the call that there -- actually two big ones are not included in our guidance. I mean there we don\u2019t anticipate either one of those to close till sometime probably in the first quarter of 2015.","So, those would be included in our 2015 guidance when we give that.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Let me ask this in a different way. Are those assets for sale on par with average asset quality in those respective markets?","Denny Oklak","Yes, I guess I would say so. I mean once an industrial portfolio of smaller buildings, older buildings, so I\u2019d say as that kind of portfolio goes, this is a pretty good one. And then the suburban office assets are in St. Louis and those would be typical good parts in suburban St. Louis, yes.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And just the last question from me and someone -- I know you alluded to it little bit Mark on your lease spread about -- regarding new lease spreads that which you historically haven\u2019t going in [your term out]. If I look at the rent, just the average net effective rent for what you find in both industrial and office in 2013 and three quarters in 2014, it seems like in every quarter, the net effective rent just broadly speaking is lower in new leases than they are for the new leases signed -- sorry, for renewal leases. So it just makes me wonder that is it just lower quality type of assets that are under a new lease bucket or what cause net effective of rent to be consistently lower?","Mark Denien","That\u2019s just purely a factor of the market Ki Bin. I mean you got our industrial leases range anywhere from call it high $2 to $6.5 a foot, depending on what market you\u2019re in and exactly what type of industrial building it is. So it\u2019s really just product mix even within the industrial portfolio and locations driving that? We look at the overall deal quality of all of our deals which we take the total CapEx and concessions to get a deal done by the total rent we\u2019re going to collect over the life and I would tell you that the overall deal quality on all those deals are better and better every quarter.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to Michael Salinsky. Your line is open.","","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Hi guys. Just given the significant disposition activity you had year-to-date. Any consequences there from a dividend standpoint that would fortunately kind of push some of that into \u201815, it will require special dividend or 1031?","Mark Denien","No Mike, we should be good to go there. The acquisitions that we have done this year, we pretty much did all 1031 deals with that already. So that mitigated whatever exposure we may have had. So we should have a bit of room before we bump up against any kind of special dividend issues.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just as my follow-up. As you think about the leverage for the company, I mean when you were walking to the plan and deleveraging over last few years, you had a very stated target. Can you give us a sense kind of what target leverage for Duke we should expect going forward with kind of the range now as you made significant progress year-to-date you seem to be on a course for next year?","Denny Oklak","Yes. Always really kind of laid out here right now, Mike is to get that fixed charge up about 2.5% to get that plus preferred to EBITDA down below 7.0% and keep that debt plus preferred to gross asset number in that 48% range through the year-end \u201814. And now what\u2019s really going to drive that are the dispositions that we\u2019ve talked about. And how quickly they come in and how we utilize the proceeds from that I guess is what I would say. So, as we give 2015 guidance at January, I think we\u2019ll have a better view on what our net disposition level will be and uses of those proceeds and at that time I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to get some more concrete guidance on where we\u2019re headed towards the leverage. But needless to say, it will be an improvement of where we are today.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","","Thank you very much.","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We do have a follow-up from Kevin Baron. Please go ahead.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Yes. Mark and Denny I appreciate you don\u2019t want to negotiate against yourself I mean back to sales, but maybe you can just share with us just the annualized NOI of each portfolios and then we can apply whatever cap rate we want in terms of determining value?","Denny Oklak","Well, I certainly would if I had any idea what they were sitting here today. So, on the industrial portfolio, Mark you said it\u2019s about 21 million?","Mark Denien","Yes, it\u2019s in the low 20.","Denny Oklak","And again I don\u2019t really know what the office side is. But let me I guess I mean I think basically if you put these two together, we\u2019re targeting let\u2019s say $425 million to $450 million range between those two portfolios something like that.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Okay. And then as we think about the same-store growth in the quarter, up 6, rents up 5, expenses up 3.3. Was there anything either in this quarter or in 3Q of \u201813 that would have changed that number relative to what you\u2019ve been doing year-to-date closer to 4?","Denny Oklak","Yes Michael, I would say that I think I commented briefly on bad debt expense that was probably about 1% of the 6% right there. Not to say that the prior year\u2019s quarter had high bad debt expense, but this quarter was virtually non-existed. So that change right there was probably about 1% of the 6%. The rest of it was the combination of occupancy and rental rate growth. I would tell you that as you look forward and I forget if there was Kevin or Brandon or who has brought up the spread between our leasing rate and our occupied rate, but most of that spread is not in a our same property portfolio. Our same property portfolio is now got a pretty high commencement level. So, as you look forward, it\u2019s probably not going to have quite the same occupancy growth going forward, but we did have very good occupancy growth this quarter over last year. So, some 1% of that was kind of bad debt anomaly.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Okay. And then just going back to the value creation in the development pipeline and I know 18% margins at all, which is still high. But as you think about the spread to what you\u2019re developing to and what you\u2019re evaluating the math. If you look at this quarter, you\u2019re about a 110 basis points spread, last quarter you were a 130. In this quarter you dropped your applied cap rate now. I think I heard Mark talk about mixed shift in terms of the stuff at KML, which would have dropped the pipeline expected deal from 7.4 and 7.1. How much of it was reevaluation on the value of those assets that you have in there to drop the applied cap rate for value creation from 6.1% down to 6%.","Denny Oklak","None of it Michael. The way we do that calculation we lock in our estimated cap rate the day we start the building. So, the way we look at it right, wrong aren\u2019t different is once you go forward than that from that point on it\u2019s a passage of time or it\u2019s leasing activity. So the day we believe we create the value, the day we start the building. So we lock in the estimated market cap rate on that day that we will adjust our yields as we lease up faster or slower than what we had, but the cap rates locked in. So, none of that was due to your question, it was due to like you haven\u2019t confirmed that. ","Kevin Baron - Citi","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Denny Oklak","And again Mike, I would say it\u2019s really, it is product mix generally and that can vary on the industrial side, for example market to market though. You kind of spread; you are going to get maybe more in one market versus another. So, it\u2019s just what\u2019s in that pipeline, it\u2019s a way that around.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Okay. And just last one I just want to ask one more just on the medical office and I know we\u2019ve had this discussion overtime just in terms of that piece and I know you provided a lot of good opportunities for development and you have a pretty good franchise that what you have been able to build up going back when you number of years ago.","As I think about how you have transformed the portfolio, you think about these other portfolios you\u2019re putting on the market going deeper into the company and pulling out some industrial office, pulling out more suburban office. I guess, do you step back strategically and sort of say hey, in a couple of years the first line of this press release not read Duke Realty Corporation a leading industrial suburban office and medical office property REIT, it will just be Duke Realty a leading industrially REIT. And do you think about a more strategic larger scale exit to get value for the platform you\u2019ve created in the medical office and you get paid for the value creation in future projects or you just become a more pure play industrial company?","Denny Oklak","Well Michael, I think, if you look back historically over the last four, five years, we\u2019ve certainly gone that direction. I mean we were 35% industrial five years ago, we\u2019re now pushing 65%. But I think what the way we look at it is, we\u2019re now in a position that we really like the overall portfolio, we know we still have some assets and again as we\u2019ve been saying primarily older Midwest suburban assets that we just don\u2019t really want own long-term. So we\u2019re looking at more what don\u2019t, we want to own long-term right now.","And the good news is we can take those proceeds from this dispositions and as we said we can put those into our development pipeline and really self fund our development and overall increasing the quality and the kind of assets that we own. And so we like doing that today, both with the bulk industrial and the medical office because we know we\u2019re creating a lot of value there.","And then just as far as -- and again if you look at the timing, I don\u2019t think there is, we haven\u2019t seen a better time in quite a long time to sell these suburban office assets. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And then as far as pruning the portfolio as Jim mentioned, we did prune that MOB portfolio to the tune of about $0.25 billion about a year ago. And we\u2019re doing the same thing now with this industrial package. So we\u2019re just really trying to take advantage of things going on in the market to continue overall improved quality of portfolio.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Great, thanks for the color Denny.","Operator","We do have a follow up from Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. ","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Just to clarify, Mark. I guess I was more specifically wondering about [pass-through] on your operating expense line item. Just maybe you could provide a little bit of color what taxing authorities thinking of various markets in terms of reappraisals and where that can go in the next year or two especially with appreciating property prices everywhere?","Mark Denien","Okay, yes. Because I do some math Eric, and I wasn\u2019t noticing an overall big lift in operating expenses overall. So, I still can\u2019t answer your question. So, I\u2019ll have to take a look at that but I will tell you that obviously we\u2019ve got an in-house property tax staff and they\u2019re pretty good at staying on top of what\u2019s going on out there and doing fields where they need to be. So I will follow up on that and get back to you.","Denny Oklak","","But also on the industrial side Eric, they\u2019re more like net leases. So those increase especially when you\u2019re at 96% leased on the industrial side, virtually all those increases pass-through. And I would say that\u2019s probably why our expenses are down a little bit because our occupancy is up. And so we\u2019re passing more of that stuff through. Mark, can you explain it, but I\u2019m taking credit for it. How is that?","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Fair enough, fair enough. And perhaps Jim, maybe to talk through leasing prospect for your spec developments and obviously that\u2019s been increasing a little bit over the last year, you\u2019ve also been super successful with all the hit, but obviously you take a little bit more risk in the development pipeline, maybe you can touch upon the leasing activity?","Jim Connor","Yes Eric, I would tell you that we\u2019re very optimistic that we\u2019ll have the opportunity to announce some new deals in our spec development when we report our fourth quarter numbers in mid January. I think the performance of our local teams is demonstrated. If you go back and just look at our historic track record, we\u2019ve done over the last few years, 15 spec projects with the total value of $285 million. When we started them they were 23% pre-leased and they\u2019re currently 95% pre-released.","So, we have not been as aggressive on the spec side as some of our peers as shown in the percentage of our development pipeline that was pre-leased. But we\u2019ve made really \u2013 we\u2019re covering all our debt. So I would tell you that everything we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace today we continue to believe we can execute on all those with the consistent kind of track record that we\u2019ve been able to do in the last few years.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","We do have a follow-up from Jamie Feldman. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","","Great thanks. Can you guys talk a little bit more about the depth of buyers for the assets you have in the market, leverage and private versus public. Just what are you seeing out there?","Denny Oklak","Well, we\u2019ve got I think we\u2019re all extremely pleased with the depth of buyers potentially that are out there. We have a single asset, just I'll give just a couple of examples that I think will give you some color. We have a single asset, office asset in St. Louis that we're finalizing the process on right now I'd say. And we had 12 offers on that building. Again a larger single asset in the [Clayton] sub market. And I would say 6 of the offers were very good and very competitive and very close.","On that industrial portfolio, we had 20 CA signed in the first hour that our folks began marketing that one. So, the activity is very good and very strong. It's kind of a wide range of buyers, but I would say most of these are more of the private equity kind of buyers, some little bit more on the institutional side. Not I would say generally speaking, what we're selling it isn't public REITs that are looking at this product.","So, seems to be deep pool of buyers. And quite honestly all these are being conducted without planning contingencies right now. But there is plenty of secured debt available for that even when number of buyers have unsecured lines that they can use for acquisitions today. So, the financing really isn\u2019t an issue right now.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","Do you share some kind of leverage, would you?","Denny Oklak","I don't know for sure and I think it quite varies from transaction to transaction, Jamie. But I think probably in the 60% give or take leverage range on most of these transactions today. And they are all pretty clear, Jamie, there is no doubt on any of these.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue.","Denny Oklak","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. I will look forward to see many of you at upcoming NAREIT meetings or at our Atlanta Property Tour on the late afternoon at NAREIT on November 6th. Also note that our fourth quarter and year-end call is tentatively scheduled on January 29th. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

And later there will be an opportunity for questions and answers with instructions given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ronald Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter and year end 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, President and CEO and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2014, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thank you, Ron and good afternoon everybody. Let me start off by saying that\u2019s why we are not in the telecommunications business and we are in the real estate business. But now we will get started. Let me start off by saying that 2015 was another excellent year for Duke Realty. We exceeded all of our beginning of the year goal and capped the year off with an excellent fourth quarter.","Let me recap our outstanding year. We signed nearly 22 million square foot of leases, which we believe is especially impressive given our all time high occupancy levels. We improved in-service occupancy to an all time record high of 96.1%, which is up from 95.4% at prior year end. And we grew same property NOI at 4.7% and grew rents on renewal leases by 12%.","We commenced $684 million in new development starts and completed $1.8 billion in property dispositions, substantially reducing our office exposure to 8% of our NOI. We sold $132 million of non-strategic land and monetized another $93 million through our development activities.","In total, we recycled the almost $1 billion of proceeds to fund our development needs for the year and payoff over $1 billion of debt to significantly delever the balance sheet. All are growing AFFO per share about 5.2%. Finally, we raised our regular quarterly common dividend by 5.9% in light of the stronger balance sheet and low payout ratio. We also paid a $0.20 per share special dividend in December.","I\u2019ll now touch a bit on our leasing development activity from the fourth quarter. We had a very good quarter in leasing with over 6.7 million square feet executed and also commenced $238 million of new development starts. One of our notable leases includes the 783,000 square foot lease executed on our speculative development in the Inland Empire that is just completed in the fourth quarter.","This leads with the new customer which happens to be one of the world\u2019s largest online only home furnishings retailers. This is another example of our expertise and commitment to be in the nations leading e-commerce real estate solutions provider. I would like note that in year-end all but four of our 22 industrial markets were 95% lease or higher on an in-service basis, with an overall in-service occupancy level for our industrial portfolio of 96.5%.","Our medical office portfolio continues to produce strong results ending the year with in-service occupancy at 95.5%, that\u2019s 120 basis point improvement over year-end 2014 and tenant retention rate for the full-year is 86%. As we stated before the low volatility and growing NOI nature of this portfolio should contribute to a better risk adjusted earning stream for the overall company.","Turning to development for the fourth quarter, we started $238 million of development projects across seven deals. We signed three 100% pre-leased industrial developments, totaling 1.4 million square feet with the largest being a 1 million square foot facility for Amazon in Columbus, Ohio. The Amazon deals for term of 15 years and is a joint venture in our Rickenbacker Intermodal Park.","We also begin two speculative industrial developments during the quarter, one for 403,000 square feet in Chicago and the other for 490,000 square feet in our Northern New Jersey. Both of these submarkets have vacancy rates in the 5% to 6% range with a strong demand outlook for the year and we already have the solid list of prospects.","On the medical side, we started two on-campus facilities, totaling 158,000 square feet in aggregate which were combined to 75% pre-leased. Including the solid fourth quarter activity, our development pipeline at year-end is over $665 million with a weighted average stabilized initial cash yield of 6.9% and it\u2019s expected to generate a GAAP yields of 7.5%. This will produce margins consistent with our historical 18% to 20% range. The aggregate pre-leasing level is 58% which is up a bit from previous quarters as expected.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and our capital plans.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to report the core FFO for the quarter was $0.29 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Core FFO for the quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 was impacted by 2015 disposition activity. Improved operational performance partially offset the impact of these dispositions.","We reported core FFO of $1.17 per share for the full-year 2015, compared to $1.18 per share for 2014. Core FFO was impacted by lower income from service operations in 2015 as a result of a decrease focus on third-party construction projects and lower income from joint venture management. The lost FFO from 2015 dispositions was substantially offset by the impact of deleveraging, improved operational performance, and incremental NOI from new development project deliveries.","I am very pleased to report AFFO of $1.01 per share for the full-year 2015 and $0.24 per share for the fourth quarter. 2015 AFFO represents a 5.2% growth rate over 2014, which is impressive given the level of dispositions and deleveraging for the year. AFFO for the full-year 2015 translates into a payout ratio of 68%. Looking forward we expect to be able to continue to grow AFFO per share and we\u2019ll evaluate our dividend to maintain a conservative AFFO payout ratio in the 65% to 75% range.","I would like to take a moment to address a joint venture related land impairment charge that is not included in our core FFO. During the fourth quarter we made a decision that we would actively seek to exit our retail joint venture in Linden, New Jersey. We have previously bought 57 acres of industrial land from this joint venture on which we have developed over 1.1 million square feet of modern bulk industrial product.","Retail development on remaining land in this joint venture has been held up for several years due to ongoing zoning and land used litigation. The decision to exit this joint venture triggered a $19.5 million impairment charge this is included in our GAAP losses from joint ventures and also in our core FFO adjustment of $35 million of land impairment charges recognized during the quarter.","The remaining land impairment charges relate to some office parcels, both on balance sheet and in joint ventures that were either sold in the fourth quarter or expected to be sold in early 2016. Overall, we had another solid quarter from an operational standpoint and now I will quickly recap capital activities for the quarter. We utilize the disposition proceeds generated during 2015 to fund our development pipeline as well as to reduce leverage.","As discussed last quarter we also used a portion of 2015 disposition proceeds to pay a special dividend of $0.20 per share in December. As previously announced in October we repaid a $150 million of 5.5% unsecured notes that had an original maturity date of March 2016. We believe that this transaction was an excellent use of available cash and help to further improve our key leverage metrics.","For the full-year 2015 we repaid $831 million of unsecured notes and $231 million of secured debt. Our expectation is for another strong year of net dispositions in 2016. The proceeds of which will be used to fund our development pipeline and for 2016 debt maturities, which will help us to deleverage further. The level of plan dispositions in 2016 may result in another relatively minor special dividend for 2016.","Combining the additional capital we anticipate generating in 2016 and with the significant improvements we\u2019ve already made to the balance sheet in 2015. We are well-positioned to continue to improve our leverage metrics this year. I am very pleased to announce some very good external news regarding this balance sheet progress.","Just last week both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor's raised our credit outlook to positive from stable and maintained our credit ratings at Baa2 and BBB respectively. We are optimistic that further improvement in operations and deleveraging will propel us to a high BBB credit rating in the not-too-distant future.","Now I will turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. Yesterday, we announced a range for 2016 core FFO per share of a $1.15 to $1.21 with a midpoint of a $1.18 and AFFO per share of $1.02 to $1.08 a share with a midpoint of $1.05. In addition we are also introducing a range for NAREIT-defined FFO per share of a $1.12 to $1.24 with a midpoint per share of a $1.18.","First from a macro outlook perspective we expect the economic environment in 2016 to continue at about its current pace, yet with a bit more volatility and possibly some downside if the recent turmoil continues with uncertainty about China and the impact of oil prices. We are however a bit more optimistic on continued favorable industrial supply demand fundamentals that can support rent growth and new development starts.","For 2015, U.S. industrial demand outpaced supply by over 90 million square feet. Nationwide availabilities continue to fall and are at all-time lows for the modern industrial era. Assuming the markets reached supply demand equilibrium in late 2016 or early 2017, we still see opportunity for rent growth, albeit at slower levels than the past few years.","This is particularly evident given e-commerce tailwinds, a positive outlook on consumer spending and our strong track record of executing strategic development projects across our nationwide platform. As we anticipate having virtually exited the suburban office business by the end of 2016, we are providing our guidance on operational metrics such as occupancy and same-store property growth on industrial and medical office assets only.","We believe this is the best way to think about and model the Company on a go forward basis. And this is how we plan to report actual results beginning in the first quarter. A few specifics on some of the anticipated key performance metrics outlined in the 2016 range of estimates page provided in the back of our supplemental package and on our website are as follows.","Our average in-service occupancy range for the industrial and MOB on a combined basis for 2016 is expected to be 95.4% to 96.4%. I would point out that we do expect the in-service occupancy in the first quarter to drop from current levels, due mainly to spec development projects coming online along with the typical first quarter decline due to seasonal industrial expirations and contractions.","Same-property NOI for industrial and MOB on a combined basis is projected to grow at a range of 2.75% to 4.25% which is based on steady occupancy and continued rental rate growth and embedded lease escalations.","On the capital recycling front, we expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $600 million to $900 million and proceeds from land dispositions of another $20 million to $60 million. These dispositions include nearly all of our remaining office portfolio, consistent with an exhibit we published in our November 2015 investor presentation.","The results should be that our office exposure will be in the very low single-digit percentage of our NOI by year end. I will also reiterate that while these dispositions will be diluted to FFO, we expect the capital recycling to generate positive AFFO growth. Acquisitions are projected in the range of zero to $50 million. We expect to continue to be very selective given today\u2019s pricing environment.","Development starts are projected in the range of $400 million to $600 million and above 50% preleased. We expect to fund our development pipeline with proceeds from our building and land dispositions. Service operations should be in the range of $8 million to $12 million below our 2015 run rate as we continue to emphasize on balance sheet development over third-party work and a continued decline in fees from joint ventures as we continue to reduce our investment in these joint ventures.","We would also like to introduce financial credit metric expectations for the first time, all measured on a year-end or fourth quarter run rate basis as follows. Effective leverage, measured on a book basis, is projected to continue to decrease and finish the year in a range of 38% to 42% highlighted by the expected repayment of roughly $330 million of secured debt in the May timeframe, sourced from disposition proceeds as noted above.","Fixed charge coverage is projected to increase to 3.3 to 3.6 times on a fourth quarter 2016 run rate basis. And net debt-to-EBITDA is projected to range between 5.6 and 6 times on a fourth quarter 2016 run rate basis.","Now, before we open up the line, I would like to acknowledge our entire Duke Realty team for their efforts producing another great year of execution on our real estate operations and capital recycling. Our collective actions are producing reliable steady cash flow growth for our shareholders.","I would also like to give special thanks to our outgoing CEO and now Executive Chairman, Denny Oklak for his 29 years of service and 12 years of leadership as the CEO at Duke Realty. Denny has not only left an indelible mark on what is a leading first class corporate culture here, he mentored and personally touched many of us here at Duke Realty in ways that words can\u2019t describe.","And what many of you listening in can appreciate, Denny also left his mark as one of the pioneers in industry group leaders since the dawn of the modern REIT industry from the mid-1990s. Going forward, all of us here at Duke Realty look forward to carrying on the culture and strategic direction that the leadership under Denny has practiced, a formula that we firmly believe will continue to drive shareholder outperformance.","And now, we will open up the lines for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me have some time. For the dispositions, what are you guys thinking in terms of cap rates? If you could give us a little more color on what markets, in the office market in particular, you're looking to exit and any bias you're thinking about in terms of when the sales will actually be executed?","James Connor","Well, Juan let me start off and then I\u2019ll let Mark to add a little bit of color. I would tell you as we\u2019ve looked in our projected budget in detail. I think you\u2019ll see the cap rates average in the mid-5s. Those will range from low in the 5s. What I said?","Juan Sanabria","You said mid-5 that would be pretty good.","James Connor","That would be pretty good, mid-7s, at the low end - sorry about that. On the low end we will have asset, the number of our high-end assets that will be sold in the mid-to-low-5s and some of our lesser quality assets with cap rate as high as in 9% or perhaps 10%. So on average we are looking in the mid-7s.","Mark Denien","Yes, as far as timing Juan, I think you will see \u2013 we\u2019ve already closed on some that kind of spilled over from 2015 and 2016, but on balance I think it will happen fairly evenly during the year. So that would suggest our $150 million to $200 million give or take for quarter on average.","Juan Sanabria","And just is your bias to be towards the high end of the disposition range? And what markets will be left in the office pool?","James Connor","Well, today as we detailed in most of our investor conferences in the fourth quarter, the largest single ownership is in Indianapolis. And we started disposing of Indianapolis office assets in the fourth quarter with a two-building package. And we\u2019re in the process of looking at and evaluating how is the market, the balance of the portfolio throughout the year.","So Indianapolis is the largest single concentration and then from there its really selling mostly one-off asset some of which are joint venture assets, some of which are wholly-owned that are around the country, some of which we have been working to stabilize, some of which we\u2019ve been waiting for debt to expire. So it\u2019s a combination of reasons, how they have ended up the bottom of list, that\u2019s kind of the overview.","Juan Sanabria","Okay, great. And then on the demand side for bulk, have you guys seen any softening across any of your key industries or tenants or geographies that is either on the developments or just regular course leasing that is an area of concern or something you are watching? Obviously, Mark is a bit skittish on whether we get a recession or not.","James Connor","Juan, I don\u2019t think any of our local operating teams have reported that or can point to any weakening sectors, most of our concern I would tell you is geographically based where we are following the supply and demand balance. We\u2019ve reported last quarter that and I think many of us share, a little bit concerned about Houston. We have less of that concern and probably our peers in the office and the apartment side, but yet we are watching that closely.","And I think several of us have alluded to the supply side in Dallas. There is a lot of product on the market in Dallas. They had a phenomenal year in terms of absorption and all-time high, but there is a lot of product available down there. Beyond that we see the markets in great balance and really good demand from our customer base.","Juan Sanabria","Great and just one last quick one. Have you guys seen any impact to MOB cap rates in the transaction market just given the cost of capital issues with some of the healthcare-focused REITs?","James Connor","No, we have not been the sellers of MOB since 2013 and 2014 when we clean up the portfolio. We are still seeing very strong and growing demand by the hospitals and healthcare systems and we\u2019ve seen no impact on yields and projected cap rates from any of the interest effect.","Juan Sanabria","Thanks guys.","Operator","And we will next go to the line of David Toti. Your line is open.","David Toti","Hey good afternoon, guys. Just quickly, a couple of high-level questions. First, with regard to some of the conversations you have had with your MOB tenants, is there any hesitation in front of the election, any expectation for structural change in healthcare that could impact the MOB development, the structural development as we've seen it the last couple of years? Anything from the conversations of note that might be shifting?","James Connor","No, David, I would tell you, in fact, it\u2019s exactly the opposite. Most of the major hospitals and healthcare systems particularly those that we do business with who are financially very strong, are continuing their very strong capital investment programs across the system. So our pipeline for MOB has probably never been healthier in terms of projects and opportunities with not only our existing client base, but new client base, and that is affording us opportunities for some geographic expansion, which has always been a goal of ours in the MOB portfolio.","David Toti","Okay, that's helpful. Then just one other question. One of your peers mentioned on the call earlier this week that they expected to see some value deterioration in industrial assets, potentially in secondary and tertiary markets, so where the fundamentals weren't as strong as the landscape or as fundamentals in the industrial space plateaued. Do you have the same expectation going into 2016, 2017? It sounds like from your opening remarks that you expect sort of a plateau as well. Would you also expect value shifts in a similar fashion?","James Connor","While I anticipate more of a plateau, I don\u2019t anticipate any yield or margin erosion in 2016. I think the earliest that we would be concerned about that might be 2017 when some of the supply and demand side markets reach equilibrium. We are not anticipating cap rates to move north dramatically.","The amount of capital that out there, the introduction to foreign capital and sovereign wealth funds making big acquisitions in the industrial side. We think its going to continue to keep cap rate pressure down where it is. So I would tell you, no I don\u2019t see erosion. I think they will stay flat for the year, we will see how 2017 shapes up.","Operator","We will next go to the line of Jeremy Metz. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hi, I was just wondering; in terms of the same-store guidance of 2.75% to 4.25%, can you just break that down for us? How it looks between the industrial and then for the MOBs and maybe what's baked into guidance for rent spreads in 2016?","Mark Denien","Yes, Jeremy its Mark. I think industrial MOB will be probably pretty close together so I would think each of them will be at the midpoint in close to the mid-3s. As far as rental rate guidance, we are still projecting double-digit rental growth on all of our industrial deals that we\u2019re doing; we\u2019re about 14% in the fourth quarter.","We\u2019ve mentioned this before, we track all leases that we have coming at us for the next 12 to 18 months and out of all those leases looking out over those next 18 months about a third of them were still - are still left that were signed in that 2009 to 2011 time period. So we really want to try to puts rents really hard on those up into the maybe the high-teens and then the other on balance, will get us down in the \u2013 still we think the low double digit for rent growth on industrial.","Jeremy Metz","Okay, appreciate that. Then a quick one on G&A. You're obviously calling for it to be relatively flat here, so just wondering later in the year, as you finish cycling out of the rest of the suburban office sales, is this something we should see trend lower from here and into 2017?","Mark Denien","No, I think you will see our G&A load still fairly flat I mean I think we done a good job of reducing expenses over the years as we moved out of that product type. But I am not sure that we can get anymore efficient than we already are. Obviously there will be overhead changes whether it be additions or deductions, but I think that will be driven all the way down to the property level. So those costs aren\u2019t really residing in G&A anyway.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Could you comment on potential buyer mindsets on expectations for industrial real estate? Have they changed at all?","James Connor","Ki Bin, I think it depends on the buyer profile and whether we are selling Class A long-term well leased industrial buildings or some of our high quality office versus some of our probably lesser quality or one-off assets, I think the range is clearly across the board, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting any significant changes in buyers underwriting expectations since the things that we\u2019ve since in the latter half of 2015.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And to follow-up on the previous question on G&A, I mean I am a little bit surprised that your G&A is kind of flat year-on-year after you've sold probably close to $2 billion this year and last year of assets. But I guess my question is, if you also include the service income or net service income, that's expected to come down a little bit.","I know in the past you said that's in a way your buffer that you can use that personnel to do more development or less. But given that your start guidance has come down a little bit, maybe you could comment on the longer-term trajectory of that part of the business, service income and people?","Mark Denien","Well, I think that will ebb and flow over time Ki Bin, but our start guidance is down, but I\u2019d tell you that our volume of actual work that we are going to be performing will be even or up in 2016 over 2015. You got to keep in mind we had $238 million of the starts here right at the end of the fourth quarter, so all the work will be done on those starts during 2016. So that\u2019s part of why our starts number is down in 2016 over 2015.","So if you think about overhead absorption, it\u2019s more related to the volume of work being done, not the amount of projects that were started. So because of that I think it will ebb and flow, but we\u2019ll still have service operating income come down because of all that volume that we are doing in 2016 for our own account rather than for third parties.","James Connor","Well, I think the other thing Ki Bin, I would add on just the G&A, particularly as it relates to your comment about the office sales. We have always tried to be out in front of that and not left to be holding the bag on overhead once the portfolio of sales have been completed. So we\u2019ve typically been out in front of that with either outsourcing projects or rightsizing the staff and the teams as those projects have been market. So we\u2019re carrying excess overhead for a period of time after the portfolios revolved.","Operator","And we will move on to the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you very much, a few questions. I can always jump back in the queue, but first, Mark, thanks for providing the leverage target for year end. Would there be any reason that would change over the year? And then maybe into next year depending on your cost of capital and how the public markets are shaping up?","Mark Denien","No, I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean no reason they would change based on change in strategy or anything like that, if that\u2019s what you mean, Eric. I mean obviously, they are going to be highly dependent on the timing and level of dispositions and things like that. So we try to provide a range and I think you could expect us to be at the more pessimistic into the range, dispositions coming at the pessimistic level. And the leverage levels will be at the more optimistic level if dispositions are closer to the high level.","So that\u2019s really the only thing that I could see changing, but we\u2019re very comfortable to ranges we put out there.","Eric Frankel","Would you be comfortable with exceeding your disposition target if you thought asset prices were being priced accordingly?","Mark Denien","Well, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s necessarily related to leverage, but I think that we would be very comfortable selling all the remaining office we have and then I think you will still see us take advantage like we did in the third and fourth quarter of 2015 buildings like the Amazon building in Delaware that we sold. I think we are going to sell some industrial in that number. So that\u2019s how you get to the top end of that range is with a little bit more industrial sales.","James Connor","Yes, I think if you just do the math, the bottom end of the range is about equal to us exiting the office business. So if there was some move in cap rates, we would be at the lower end of that range as we held on to protect some of those industrial assets. But we are focused on selling those office assets.","Eric Frankel","Very helpful. Just moving to supply, I know you mentioned Dallas as being of some concern with overwhelming demand kind of placating that issue always this year. Can you talk about Eastern Pennsylvania and the prospects for your development there and developments going forward?","James Connor","Yes. You are talking about our 1.1 million square foot spec building. We have a great deal of activity. That building is just coming in service here in the first quarter. And I\u2019m not worried all about that project. I think it\u2019s a great project. As you can imagine, it's garnered a great deal of interest from a lot of e-commerce clients just given the nature of the development and the features that we put in there. So that one doesn't concern me at all.","Eric Frankel","Terrific. I will just jump back in the queue and let others comment. Thank you.","James Connor","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","We have a question in the queue from the line Dave Rodgers. Your line is open.","David Rodgers","Yes, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask maybe just about are you seeing any issues at all with tenant credit out there, or any additional look for sublease space out in the industrial market at all, I guess as you see some cracks in energy and other places? Anything to start worrying about on those fronts?","Mark Denien","No. Not really Dave, not at all. Obviously, our ears perk up when some of the data you've been reading lately come across the wire, but we had record-low basically non-existent defaults or credit issues in 2015 and we are constantly in touch with the folks in the field and we read the same as you do, but as of now we are not worried of any issues.","James Connor","No, if you go down to Texas, our oil exposure is so absolutely minimal. I think if you look at our portfolio Dallas and Houston combined is less than 3%. Well, you have 3% outside of the Dallas and Houston portfolios, only 3% of their attendance renewal and gas industry. So it\u2019s incredibly small.","Mark Denien","Yes, so we don\u2019t have a lot of concerns there Dave.","David Rodgers","Okay, great. Your 2016 development starts \u2013 I didn't hear if you said this earlier because I got on late today, but how does that breakout between MOB, industrial, and anything else you might be doing? And kind of where the yields on each of the categories that you might be starting?","Mark Denien","I think you\u2019ll see the yields consistent with what we generated in 2015, the breakdown for us is typically somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters industrial and quarter and a third on the MOB side. The advantage we have is again most of the MOB projects really look and function like build-to-suit are very substantially pre-leased like the two that we signed in the fourth quarter.","We still got a lot of good build-to-suit activity, so we evaluate spec as we bring projects and service and they get leased up. So that kind of the uncertain portion of the equation is how much spec we're going to take out, but we are still very active of the MOB in the build-to-suit side of the equation.","David Rodgers","And I guess just following up on the disposition questions, you had mentioned in your comments I think at some point, Jim, that you expected more volatility. So kind of same backdrop, but with more volatility. In everything that you are reading, does that make you want to hit that $900 million disposition target or what are the odds that you could push past that? And how are you feeling about that sitting here today?","James Connor","Well, I think I can\u2019t address that, my first priority operationally is to exit the office business. So that what we are most focused on right now. Some of those projects are already actively being marketed as Mark said. We\u2019ve actually already closed two early in the first quarter then we can start at last year. I think if these continue as we anticipate I think as we told all you guys we will be at the high end of that range.","If the market to change and there is an unexpected softening. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to be very focused on the office and working diligently to get those projects sold and we will take the wait and see attitude on some of the other high value industrial once. Just like the Amazon building we sold, if we didn\u2019t get our pricing and very consent to keep that building, it\u2019s a great building.","David Rodgers","And I guess last question, Mark, in terms of the additional proceeds that you get from the asset sales, I heard your comment about potential smaller special dividend. But any other options that you could put that money into or are you happy sitting on it where it is?","Mark Denien","No, I think we\u2019ll just payoff debt with that Dave, we\u2019ve got $350 million of debt coming due and I think that all these - what I call excess disposition proceeds will go to pay that down. If we could do some 1031s that would be great, but we are not going to over pay for property just to do 1031. So that means there is a small special dividend so be it.","David Rodgers","Great, thanks.","Operator","We will next go to the line of John Guinee. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great, thank you. Jim, this is music to my ears and you know why. Looks like your land has gone down from $500 million a year ago to $382 million today. You're down to 4% of total enterprise value. What's the range that your Board expects you to be in when you look at undeveloped \u2013 when you look at both strategic and non-strategic land?","James Connor","Well, thanks John. We\u2019re particularly proud of what our guys did last year and clearly, that helped the capital recycling. As we sit here today, all-in, if you count wholly-owned for development and everything else we are just over $400 million. We still have some non-strategic office land for sale that we\u2019re going to try and move out. We do need to replenish some land in some of our markets where we\u2019ve got good development activity.","Our goal is to get down is to get below $400 million. We would love to stay consistently in that $350 million range and we think as long as we could keep developing and monetizing land that way. We are buying it in much smaller pieces going forward, so we think we\u2019ve made great strides and most of you can remember back at the start of the last recession when we had literally $970 million or $980 million of land. So we\u2019ve worked diligently to change the company culture here and a run rate of $350 million to $400 million, it is a very comfortable run rate for us going forward.","John Guinee","Great. And then Mark, just to clarify a little bit, you had basically said you wanted your dividend to be 60% to 75% of AFFO. I think it was AFFO, so correct me if I got that wrong. But essentially at $1.05 midpoint for AFFO and a 65% to 75% ratio, that would imply $0.68 to $0.78 and your current dividend is $0.72. So it would imply that you are not expecting to raise your dividend in December of this year like you did last year. Is that accurate?","Mark Denien","Well, I guess John it is AFFO and I said - what I said is 65% to 75% of AFFO. So obviously we are not going to do anything with our dividend we just raised in the fourth quarter 2015 that\u2019s at a level we want to run out right now. I am just doing the math because I\u2019m not as quick at the numbers as you are, but at the $1.05 midpoint that\u2019s $0.74, which is a little bit higher than we are running at now. If we hit those numbers and maybe even do a little bit better that would imply you could see a dividend increase later in this year, but we need a little bit more time under our belt to see what happens.","John Guinee","Okay. Does small special dividend or year-end 2016 imply along the same lines as 2015 or materially different?","Mark Denien","No, not materially different, John. In 2015 we paid out $0.20, which was essentially $70 million I think it could be anywhere from zero to around that number.","John Guinee","Great. All right, keep up the good work.","Mark Denien","Thanks.","James Connor","Thanks John.","Operator","We will go now to the line of Brendan Maiorana. Go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks. Good afternoon. So, Jim, on the office side, you guys really did a great job monetizing your office over the past couple of years. But for the remainder that you have, are you seeing a price impact from what has happened in the financing markets and it's probably buyers' expectation that the macroeconomic conditions are a little less certain now than they were maybe, say, a year ago?","James Connor","I would tell you we are not. And you got to remember most of the buyers that we are dealing with are not doing kind of the traditional bank financing. We have seen a lot of private equity come into the office portfolio acquisition a la Starwood and Blackstone, even some of the smaller deals that we\u2019ve done. So they are much less susceptible to interest fluctuations.","Most of them are looking to put capital to work. The office fundamentals have been good and improving in the last few years. So guys that want to invest in office, we\u2019ve had good buyer pools for all of our products even some of the Class B stuff that we\u2019ve sold in one-off smaller transactions. So I anticipate at least for the first half of the year being comparable to where we were in late 2015 in terms of our pricing expectations.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, great. And then just last one for Mark. You guys have done again this year really nice job getting that spread between FFO and AFFO narrowed again. But you've got a pretty new portfolio; there's been a lot of development deliveries over the past several years so those assets don't require a lot of ongoing leasing. Is it \u2013 do you feel like the spread is sort of abnormally low now, abnormally narrow, and maybe it's going to widen out as we get a little bit more lease turnover in a few years time? Or do you think that kind of where you are you can sustain that level over the longer term?","Mark Denien","You know, Brendan, we really think we can sustain it. We think it\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t say abnormally low, but I think you got to keep in mind as long as we can do a good job of always pruning the bottom whatever, x percent of the portfolio out and keeping the youngest portfolio in the industry, that we think we can keep our CapEx down to a lower run rate than the next guy. So we\u2019re really committed to having these bigger, nicer, newer boxes and that just translates into a lot less CapEx on a per square foot and per investor dollar basis. So we\u2019re pretty confident, we can keep this pace going.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, great. Glad to see it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we will now go to the line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, this is actually George on for Mike. You mentioned the lease you signed with the large e-commerce company. Are there any markets in particular that will benefit from a pickup and leasing from e-commerce firms?","Mark Denien","George, that's an interesting question. And I think in general we\u2019ve seen e-commerce touch virtually all of our markets and one of the phenomenon we\u2019ve started to see in late 2014 and 2015 is while we\u2019ve consistently seen these let\u2019s call it 500 to a 1 million square foot. We are now starting to see in secondary and tertiary and infill markets some of the smaller e-commerce lease is for just in time delivery.","So I\u2019d tell you we are seeing e-commerce all over the place. I think you\u2019ll continue to see them grow in the major tier-1 markets, because e-commerce is \u2013 the delivery expectations are not going to get any slower and it\u2019s about putting product in consumers hands as quickly as possible and that\u2019s your tier-1 industrial markets and your major population centers.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. And then are there any other opportunities to prepaid debt in 2016 outside of the $250 million coming due?","Mark Denien","The only thing George would be the 2017 unsecured maturities we have are coming at us early in 2017. So there maybe a chance to take that out a little bit early, but other than that there's really not.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","We will go now to the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. Jim, two questions. First just on supply. You talked about in your opening comments all, but four of your 22 industrial markets are north of 95% occupied. And I'm just kind of curious as you continue to develop \u2013 granted half of that is preleased. What are you seeing from a supply perspective given these record sort of occupancy levels and whether you see some of your peers or even a return of other merchant developers come into the marketplace, adding to supply?","James Connor","Well, I think our peers are just like us. I think they have been selectively developing spec, I think you\u2019ve seen the merchant builders be fairly active across all of the markets. As we mentioned Dallas in particular has a very strong and deep profile of developers down there. I think the expectation is you will continue to see active development all through the year, most of the sources that we use, the brokerage or the consulting companies or the research companies, are expecting that we\u2019ll hit some sort of the equilibrium late this year or early next year.","So that would anticipate we will have probably a couple 100 million square feet of absorption and approaching that in the supply side. I think we\u2019ll be all right for this year, I think the question is as we finish this year and we start to go into next year. What do those numbers really look like? And will people have the self-control to pullback a little bit at the end of this year and next year when we get to that equilibrium.","Michael Bilerman","Do you have a sense at all, in terms of your preleased projects, how much of that is growth square footage for the tenant versus just musical chairs?","James Connor","Well, for us we would net that out, if we were taking somebody out of an existing lease and putting them in a new building. So for us it\u2019s very little. I can\u2019t speak to the overall, the effect of the overall input, but I think net-net when you look at 91 million square feet of net absorption across the country the net debt is very, very positive.","Michael Bilerman","Right. And then, secondarily, you talked about your first priority being to exit office I guess from a strategic standpoint of just fully cleansing yourself of that product, which has been going on for a number of years and you've executed extraordinarily well. Post doing that the MOB portfolio will be about just over 20% of the Company and it's been a great source for you from a reinvestment of all the sales proceeds into developing new MOBs.","I guess now once you reach the end of this year and sort of use it as I guess house to invest some of that excess capital in addition to deleveraging, does medical office become a strategic pivot point for you in terms of what to do with that portfolio? Or does it - or do you start thinking about that earlier as you think about how the medical office building, healthcare companies have traded, which has been extraordinarily well, being able to monetize that for shareholders?","James Connor","Well Mike, I can\u2019t help but think about it everyday because I get asked about it everyday, so I\u2019ll tell you there is always been a lot of interest in our medical portfolio, we believe the highest quality portfolio across the board, we\u2019ve got a great team, even through the succession when Jim Bremner retired and our new team that is running the business, we\u2019re creating a lot of value.","So we evaluate that strategically and as I\u2019ve said before right now our focus is to exit the office building and we will always be thinking 12 to 18 months about the direction of the company and what we are going to do with all of our product both industrial and medical and all of the markets that we operate in. So today it\u2019s full speed a head, we are cleaning up the office portfolio, simplifying the business and we\u2019ll see what opportunities are created in the future.","Michael Bilerman","If you have a thought, do you think a spin-off of a $2 billion medical office company versus a sale of that portfolio, would you lean one way or the other?","James Connor","Well, at this point I wouldn\u2019t lean one way or the other because I\u2019m not really seriously looking at it. I think when we get to that point we will do what any prudent management team will and explore all of our options and what will create the greatest value for our shareholders.","Michael Bilerman","Great, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go now to line of Eric Frankel. Go ahead please.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I will try to make them two good ones. First, with your Chamber Street joint venture; obviously Chamber Street merged with Gramercy Property Trust and so they seem to be undergoing a new strategy. So I was wondering if there's any finality to that joint venture in the near future.","James Connor","Eric, that's a good question. We have been winding down that joint venture, and a lot of the activity in the Chamber Street joint venture was slowed by their acquisition by Gramercy. In terms of the overall number of assets I think we are down to under 10. I think probably eight if I am counting correctly. And I don\u2019t think any of those for us are long term holds. So I think I thought has been to let our friends at Gramercy get their arms around the Chamber Street and then we will continue to look to exit most of those assets.","Eric Frankel","Okay, thank you. The final question, I found your phrase for how you think about the e-commerce business as an e-commerce real estate solution provider. Without giving away any trade secrets, I was hoping you could expand on that concept a little bit further and how you'd like to grow that segment of your development business.","Mark Denien","Well, I think, Eric, like any level of expertise in this industry or anything else, it's really based on people and for us it\u2019s construction and development people who have a great deal of experience dealing with all of the e-commerce providers whether it\u2019s the Amazons of the world or the Walmart.coms, all the way down to the third-party logistics providers who have been a growing source of e-commerce solutions.","Looking at and dealing with omnichannel distribution, we\u2019ve just done a great deal of it across the country. We\u2019ve built a lot of it. We understand what our e-commerce providers needs and where those differ from traditional industrial buildings and we are very comfortable with the direction and markets going and making investments in that product and that\u2019s quite candidly what our clients want to hear.","40-foot buildings and heavy parking and losses truck parking. Those are the kind of assets that appeal to our e-commerce clients and we are very comfortable making those investment. So that\u2019s we will continue to do.","Eric Frankel","That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","End of Q&A","James Connor","I would like to thank you everyone for joining the call today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a questions-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ron Hubbard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are, Denny Oklak, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Denien, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2012 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments during the quarter in both our operational and asset strategies. Mark will then address our second quarter financial performance and progress on our capital strategy. Then I finish up with our prepared remarks with some comments about our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","By all accounts the second quarter was a great success for Duke Realty and I\u2019m very proud of our team for their accomplishments. We signed 6.2 million square feet of leased and finished the quarter at 93.1% overall occupancy rate which includes projects under development. This is the highest overall occupancy rate for the company since 1996. We had only 25 million square feet of properties. We also acquired 5.9 million square feet of modern bulk industrial product and key distribution markets including 405 million at an initial cash yield of 6.3% with nice future annual rent bumps resulting in a GAAP yield of 6.7%.","We essentially funded these acquisitions from cash on our balance sheet at the beginning of the quarter and from executing $202 million of dispositions during the quarter. These dispositions had an in place cap rate of 5% and thus the acquisitions are immediately accredited to FFO and AFFO in alignment with our asset repositioning strategy.","Also during the quarter we begin $82 million of new development projects with a weighted average stabilized cash yield of 8.2%. I\u2019ll talk more about these investment transaction shortly. On the capital front we repaid $425 million of maturing unsecured notes a portion of which was funded with the new $250 million floating rate term loan matures in 2018. We also issued $1.5million shares of common equity through our ATM program during the quarter raising proceeds of $27.4 million. Mark will speak more in depth on our capital activities in a moment.","From a macro perspective half way through the year the economy is limping along in a one plus percent growth rate lower than the beginning of the year expectations. The lack of subjective job growth continues to present challenges for the real estate industry. These factors are key contributors to our cautious outlook towards spec development. While the amount of spec stays relative to total inventories maybe low compared to historic levels other than in a couple of markets we\u2019re not seeing significant dimensions or that new space.","Looking at the rest of the year current forecast call for improvements in GDP near the 2.5% level for the second half of the year. This would obviously be a positive for real estate fundamentals. We\u2019ll also make a quick comment on interest rates given what has transpired with fed and in the capital markets recently while we believe there are rest and certainly volatility related to the fed tampering over the immediate term. We don\u2019t view the most recent range of long-term rates as being adverse to growth and demand for our space or in our ability to generate new development starts.","Despite this sluggish economic growth our leasing operations performed very well across our entire portfolio this quarter. While we did expect an increase in occupancy over our prior quarter levels the 130 basis point increase was a bit better than expected. The positive absorption was fairly broad based across all product types end markets that give full credited to our talented and D teams in each of our markets for the success on their performance.","Now let me touch on some of the key activity within each product type. On industrial the preliminary indications from costar for the second quarter is at national net absorption maintained its strong pace in the first quarter with projections of about 35 million square feet driving vacancy rates down to the low to mid 8% range.","We are seeing solid leasing demand as well as new build-to-suit development opportunities across our industrial markets. We continue to see activity on the build-to-suit for us and slower economic growth for its tenants time to carefully plan ahead for space modernization or expansion needs.","With respect to leasing in our industrial portfolio the fundamentals remain solid with the completion of nearly 1.9 million square feet of new and about 2.7 million square of renewal leases. Bulk industrial in service occupancy at the end of the quarter rose to 94.4%, 80 basis points above the previous quarter and also 80 basis points higher than a year ago.","Nine of our 18 major markets are now at least 95% leased on the industrial side and only three are under 90%. Three in the medical office portfolio beyond campus medical office business remains robust, which bodes well for our portfolio, we had a solid quarter with new lease of 260,000 square feet of new and renewal leases signed, growing our in-service occupancy by 180 basis points to 92.7%. Development opportunities are also strong, which I will touch on a little later.","Now I\u2019ll talk a little bit about our suburban office business, generally speaking this product type has been challenging and probably will be until we see more meaningful job growth. Having said that, we\u2019ve actually seen some markets with quite a bit of activity more significant Houston, Raleigh, South Florida and our Midwest markets.","Overall we had a nice quarter on the suburban office leasing side as well executing nearly 1.3 million square feet of new and renewal leases. In the Midwest, we signed five leases that were each 3,000 square feet or large that\u2019s the best quarter of activity for office leases of this size in the Midwest in several years.","We also had significant new leasing totaling a 186,000 square feet in Raleigh related to pre-leasing of a recently announced speculative development project that I\u2019ll speak about in a moment. Overall, we increased our in-service suburban office occupancy by 200 basis points to 86.5%.","We also made excellent progress on our asset strategy during the quarter, as we announced on last quarter\u2019s call and as disclosed at a recent investor presentations in late May we closed on the acquisition of 4.9 million square foot USA and eight industrial portfolio for $315 million. The portfolio includes eight 100% leased amount of bulk industrial facilities in key distribution markets including California, Eastern Pennsylvania and Houston.","We\u2019re extremely pleased with the strategic split and extremely high quality of this portfolio. We also acquired two bulk industrial facilities totaling 950,000 square feet in central New Jersey, these two facilities were developed in the last 10 years and located just off I-95, equal distance between Philadelphia and New York, both facilities are 100% leased to Crate and Barrel until 2020.","Last year you only acquired a 123,000 square foot industrial building in Southern California in the Mid-County submarket, facility is currently 100% leased with the entire space rolling later this year, we now expect rental facility to be above our original pro forma when the tenant rolls.","Let me also point out a couple of other things on our industrial acquisition strategy. I know that some of you have questioned our acquisition of 100% leased facilities in the value creation opportunities. Since we began our asset repositioning strategy back in 2009, our acquisitions and dispositions have been roughly equal at just under $3 billion each.","Other than our South Florida acquisition we\u2019ve been mostly focused on larger distribution buildings, 500,000 square feet plus in major distribution markets. We focused on larger bulk buildings, because we feel that as a future of the bulk distribution business in major market. When these larger bulk buildings trade, they are almost all leased 100% leased, you just don\u2019t see 500,000 square foot plus buildings trade at 50% or 75% lease. We would gladly consider buying those if available, so if you see any let us know.","These assets also had nice annual rental rate increases which contributes the solid store and AFFO growth in future years. Our value creation has also come from over $1 billion of new development starts over that same period and we continue to find more great value creation opportunities through development.","As for dispositions we had an excellent quarter generating $202 million of proceed that were used as a source of capital to fund the aforementioned acquisitions, a $188 million of the proceeds came from the closing of our previously announced disposition of Pembroke Pines retail center in South Florida, which was 90% leased and sold at a 5% in place cap rate.","These repositioning transactions put us just a few percentage points away from our bulk industrial investment target of 60%. Furthermore the acquisition transactions were essentially funded from year-to-date dispositions and\/or accretive to our cash flow both short and long-term.","We also have a number of other assets are being marketed for sale including a 2.3 million square foot suburban office portfolio located in Cincinnati, Cleveland and St. Louis. We\u2019re in the final stages of evaluating offers we\u2019ve received on this portfolio and believe we\u2019re likely to close on multiple transactions totaling over $250 million in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year.","Now I would like to touch this a little bit on our land bank, if you remember a few years ago we went through a thorough process to differentiate each land parcel between parcels of the one at development and parcels that were non-strategic to be sold. These parcels that were identified for disposition started at a basis of about $230 million after impairment charges.","Today we still have about $145 million of this non-strategic land, our books that\u2019s impaired basis, a few of these disposition parcels were reclassified to our to be developed land, but mostly reduction is from sales over the last 3.5 years. I would like to point out that in the aggregate these sales transactions produce a positive margin from the book basis.","I would also like to report that in July we sold a 30 acre parcel of office land in Northern Virginia for $22.2 million. This parcel was actually in our to be developed plan, but we received an unsolicited offer and we liked the pricing and believe it would be sometime before we would develop this parcel given the suburban office conditions in this market.","This sale and increased interest in land from purchasers let us to increase our guidance from landers position yesterday to a range of $40 million to $50 million. In addition of this parcel momentum on land sales we also have utilized about $40 million of land bank over the last year or so for our development projects.","Overall, we feel confident on our ability to monetize our current land bank through development and dispositions add values in excess of our current book basis. Now turning to development, I\u2019m pleased to report that our development starts year-to-date are off to another strong start, a testament to what we believe as a strategically located land bank investing class development team.","In total, we began $82 million in new projects during the second quarter bringing our year-to-date total starts to $221 million. We started a 206,000 square suburban office project in Raleigh located in our land and parameter, in our parameter part development. The project was approved at a 52% pre-lease level and I\u2019m pleased to announce the just after quarter and our Raleigh team signed another lease in the building totaling about 78,000 square feet which increases the pre-leasing level to 91%.","We also started three new medical office projects during the quarter; we started two new projects with Baylor Health Care totaling 54,000 square feet in the Dallas area, both the 100% pre-lease for 15 years. These are the 11th and 12th projects we\u2019ve done with Baylor in the last seven years and demonstration of our outstanding execution track record in exceptional relationships will talk to your health systems.","The third medical project is a 60,000 square feet and located in Missouri also 100% pre-leased for 15 years to a joint venture between Centerre Health and Mercy Health. Our second quarter development starts are 93% pre-lease when you include July leasing and are projected to have a stabilized cash yields of 8.2% and a GAAP yield of 9.3%.","As of the second quarter, we have 3.3 million square feet across 18 projects under construction that are 90% pre-leased in the aggregate with the total budgeted cost of 513 million at a projected GAAP yield of 8.4%. Overall, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the new development business generated year-to-date and based on the pipeline of prospects a very optimistic about future development starts for the remainder of the year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and capital plan.","Mark Denien","Thanks Denny. Good afternoon everyone. As Denny mentioned I would like to provide an update on our second quarter financial performance as well as the progress on the capital strategy.","Our second quarter 2013 core FFO was $0.27 per share. The $0.01 improvement in the core FFO per share from the first quarter was mainly driven by an increase and an in service non occupancy of 107 basis points an improved operating performance throughout our entire portfolio.","I would like to highlight that we\u2019ve recorded income from lease buyouts of approximately $3.8 million this quarter which is just slightly higher than our normal run rate. This increase was due to a couple of opportunistic office transactions where we had tenants looking to downsize an immediate landfills were available for their space allowing us to collect some fees and retain our occupancy levels.","Our growths in average net effective rent on renewals was about 2% for the quarter. We are starting if we able to push rents a little in those markets especially on the industrial side. I would also point out that we did experienced positive rental rate growth on our suburban office renewals this quarter as well as that market is improving somewhat as indicated by the leasing activity Denny mentioned.","With respect to same property performance we achieved positive NOI growth through the 12 months and 3 months ended June 30, of 2.7% and 3.4% respectively due to increased occupancy and increases in the rental rates. At the beginning of the year we provided guidance on same property NOI growth on a 12 months \u2013 over 12 month basis of 1% to 4%.","With our success thus far and expectations for further improvements we now believe that our same property NOI growth for the year will be towards the upper end of our guidance. We generated $0.24 per share in AFFO which equates to a conservative dividend payout ratio of slightly below 71%, compared to $0.23 per share of AFFO for the first quarter of 2013. The improvement in AFFO was driven by the same factors as core FFO, as second generation capital expenditures were consistent between the periods.","We continued to be pleased with our growth in the AFFO on a consistent basis which validates our asset repositioning strategy. We\u2019re pleased with our operating results for the quarter and anticipate continued solid execution throughout the rest of the year.","Turning to the capital side of our business we executed transactions during the quarter that reduced our borrowing cost and diversified our resources of capital. In May we executed a $250 million variable rate term loan with our credit facility lending group that bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.35% and matures in May 2018. This term loan may be prepaid at any time with no penalty which allows us flexibility in managing our debt maturities over the next five years.","We used the proceeds from this term loan to partially fund the mandatory of unsecured notes totaling $425 million which had a weighted average effective interest rate of 6.4%. In May we also executed a new ATM program that allows for the issuance of up to $300 million of common stock. During the quarter when considering issuances under the new program as well as the completion of our previous $200 million ATM program we issued approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock generating over $27 million of net proceeds at an average price of $18.33 per share.","As we have said we will continue to look to the ATM program as a source of capital that partially fund future development activity. As Denny mentioned, we\u2019ve generated $202 million of proceeds from non-strategic assets dispositions during the quarter, driven mainly by the $188 million on proceeds from the disposition of the Pembroke Gardens Retail Center.","Although acquisition activity outpaced dispositions during the quarter when looking at the entire first six months of 2013 proceeds from dispositions have essential funded acquisitions. Our liquidity is very solid, when considering we completed the quarter with only $88 million in borrowings outstanding on our $850 million line of credit and our debt maturities for the remainder of the year totaled only about $82 million.","In fact, we don\u2019t really have any debt maturities of significance in for august of 2014 when we have $215 million of unsecured notes maturing. As indicated in our guidance, we anticipate being a net disclosure of properties for the remainder of the year which will allows us to repay our current line balance and partially fund development costs.","We also achieved improvements on our leverage metrics during the second quarter, with a fixed charge coverage ratio of $1.92 for the rolling 12 months ended June 30, compared to $1.86 for the rolling 12 months ended March 31, looking at just the second quarter which gives the full effect of our deleveraging efforts so far this year our fixed charge coverage ratio is 2.1 net debt to EBITDA and net debt plus preferred to EBITDA for the rolling 12 months ended June 30, 2013 was 7.57% and 8.35% which is a slight increase in the prior quarter. This increase was due to the timing of acquisitions and dispositions.","We\u2019re looking at just the second quarter adjustments for the timing of these dispositions and acquisitions, net debt to EBITDA is 6.64% and net debt plus preferred to EBITDA is 7.32% which were accurately depicts our improving leverage profile.","I would also like to point out that these leverage coverage metrics will continue to improve simply by completing our projects that are currently under construction because that pipeline is 90% leased and the balance sheet already a reflex most of the costs without the benefit of the earnings. I will conclude by saying that I\u2019m very pleased with the operating results for the second quarter and the condition of our balance sheet which allows us flexibility to execute on other aspects of our strategy.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks mark. Yesterday we tightened our guidance for core FFO to $1.07 to a $1.11 per share which raised the midpoint by $0.02 to $1.09 per share. This change is the recognition of the effective execution of our asset in capital strategy, our positive leasing activity so far this year and our overall operational performance year-to-date and a positive outlook for the remainder of the year.","We also have a strong backlog of new development projects that we believe we can execute during the second half of the year. Even with the moderate economic growth we are successfully executing our 2013 plan and are confident Duke Realty is in a solid position to capture market share, continued steady rent growth and execute on accretive development opportunities across all of our markets.","Thank you again for your support of Duke Realty. And now we\u2019ll open it up for questions","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question today is from the line of (Paul) (indiscernible). Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much. Denny, I was wondering if you could fill us in on plans with respect to the medical office portfolio, specifically are there certain assets that you might look to dispose off in the near future.","Denny Oklak","Yes Paul but I think we are taking a look at that I think there is small relatively speaking small portfolio of assets that we will look to print. We\u2019ve been in that business now when you go back to including when we start at the joint venture with (Tim Brenner) and his company for almost nine years now. And so we\u2019ve got some assets that are little bit older in that portfolio and also I would say we\u2019ve got some assets that are less strategic to us today than may be they were when we developed most of these back in that 8 to 9 years ago. And by less strategic there with hospital systems that may be we\u2019re not we don\u2019t see a lot of future business with. So we\u2019re taking a look at that and I think you could see us market a portfolio here sometime and start marketing here sometime in the third quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And could you give us the range of cap rates that you see in the market both for top quality and lower quality medical office assets?","Denny Oklak","Yeah we really haven\u2019t been buying much since \u2013 when build I think it\u2019s all since last fall when we tend to see that transaction I would say so we haven\u2019t I may not be as close because we haven\u2019t follow that quite as close because we\u2019re really focused on the development side in that business. But I would say you\u2019re probably seeing cap rates in low-to-mid 6s on the very high quality portfolio may even lower than that I suppose depending on the situation and that will be the length of term remain term under lease, the rental, the percentage rental increases in the lease and those types of things but it\u2019s probably in the sort of in the low 6s and the good quality portfolios today.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","We have a question from Josh Attie. Please go ahead.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. Denny on the guidance increase I know that there are a lot of things that contributed to it. Can you just kind of give some sense for how much of it was same-store performance versus your expectation as oppose to asset sale timing, termination fees and also the term loan which I don\u2019t know if that was in your original outlook or not?","Denny Oklak","Yeah Josh almost all of it really is from just higher occupancy for the year. We always factor into our guidance some base level of lease termination fees and while it might have appeared to be a little bit higher this quarter. It was just for the year its right in line with where we thought it would be and again on our refinancing that we were assuming this year I think the interest rates are right about where we thought they would be overall. So I think again most of it is really coming just from increased occupancy and probably a little bit better rent growth on some of the renewals that we thought that we might have this year.","Mark Denien","Yeah Josh I would add that keep in mind that the occupancy number if we reported on our lease signing basis. So the substantive increase in occupancy that we had this quarter some of that won\u2019t really materialized in the rent growth until the third quarter. So we still in a positive in the third and fourth quarter from some of the leasing that you\u2019ve seen the starts right now.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thanks that makes sense more of a leased percentage than an occupancy number.","Mark Denien","Correct, correct.","Denny Oklak","Yeah.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Okay and secondly on the acquisitions in the quarter if we strip out USAA it seems like you bought Southern California and New Jersey with around of 5.5 cap blended and $85 million of first blended I guess two questions. One, there is numbers right and then also can you tell us what each of those were individually are on a cap rate basis?","Denny Oklak","Well Josh we\u2019ve historically not given cap rates by individual transaction just for various competitive reasons and I think it just sort of sets at all when you look at what we acquired which was primarily I guess really entirely this quarter 100% leased industrial property and the average cap rate was what we disclosed was six in a quarter. So I really don\u2019t have much to say about it other than that I think we did very well on those acquisitions. I\u2019m very pleased with the where we came out I no way think that we paid anything above market on those acquisition. So I think we\u2019re just very pleased.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And then just lastly and I\u2019m not sure if you can comment on this or not because I know you are closed to transaction but on the Midwest office portfolio is there any sense you can give us on pricing?","Denny Oklak","Well Josh I\u2019d rather not be there today because as you said we are serving negotiations here. So obviously we\u2019ll see what happens over in the next 90 to 120 days and then we\u2019ll disclose everything when we finally close this.","Josh Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thank you.","Operator","Question from (Jamie) (indiscernible). Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. You had mentioned you are seeing some rent growth in your bulk industrial markets. Can you talk a little bit about the pace of market rents like where do you think your year-over-year and maybe what you\u2019re expecting going forward?","Denny Oklak","Yeah Jamie again I think we seen I would look back more over sort of a 12 to 24 month period and over the last 12, 24 months as market occupancies have increased I certainly think and almost all markets we seen greater we see rent growth in the industrial side kind of depends where but we are probably 15% up are at the bottom of where rents work and today again I think we are still, we are still seeing some positive pressure I call it on rent. So I think we\u2019re going to see some more increases but I think our increases going forward are going to be more in the 2% to 4% kind of annual range and again some of that\u2019s going to depend on a little bit what happens with interest rates and obviously on the industrial side what happens with spec development.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And the acquisition as you mentioned where is the annual rent bumps I think you said a six, seven GAAP yield and six in a quarter cash?","Denny Oklak","Yeah I think those the annual rents in most of those are anywhere between 1.5% and 2.5% and almost of all these industrial leases today and almost all markets we have, we had the bumps like that and that was acquisitions are the same.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then I don\u2019t know if I heard you clearly before but I think you have made a comment about concerns about new development in your market and rest absorption but you may have heard that wrong?","Denny Oklak","What I said was what we are seeing now is their spec development certainly has come back in the last 12 months. There is more spec development in almost all markets then there has had them for three or four years. I say it still probably fairly significantly below on a historic run rate and still a relatively small percentage of the existing stock but I\u2019ll also what I also said was we are not seeing that space get absorbed very quickly right now. So I think we\u2019ll see over the next few months how the demand is and whether it kicks up and whether that space starts getting absorbed because other than a couple of markets that space is a kind of sitting there right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Very helpful so which market would you say and is it maybe the space is too modern for the market once like how why would you, why you think that\u2019s happening?","Denny Oklak","No, I think this is just what we been saying really for the last year Jamie as we just haven\u2019t, we haven\u2019t seen, we seen the demand it take existing space but we have been comfortable with the demand was there to absorb a lot of newly developed space. And other than a couple of markets which I would say Houston in particular I would say and maybe a little bit in South Florida we haven\u2019t seen a lot of demand to just absorb all that space it\u2019s been build right now. So hopefully I would also say that typically early part of third quarter late second quarter and early part of third quarter would summer vacations and things is typically a little bit slower time for industrial. So I think post labor day this quarter to see how things pick up. We\u2019ll be interesting to see if more that space starts getting absorbed.","Unidentified Analyst","What would you say the worst markets for that the ones that cause you the most concerned?","Denny Oklak","Well I would say clearly Southern California has a lot of speculative space out there. I would say Chicago has quite a bit of speculative space and we've seen some in the kind of the Pennsylvania markets there has been a fair amount of speculative space out there and even maybe Dallas a little bit a number of spec buildings going out there that haven\u2019t been absorbed yet.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. And then my final question is for the term loans that floating very long correct?","Denny Oklak","Correct.","Unidentified Analyst","So is that you have any plans to fix it or how are you thinking about the risk of raising rates here?","Denny Oklak","No plans right now Jamie if you think about it back when we did this in early May. We probably could have got a two low two on a five year fix maybe two in a quarter 2.3 right now that\u2019s five year rates risen called 50, 60 basis points but the fact is was the floating we have, we haven\u2019t lost anything I mean we are still at the same labor plus 135 and labor hasn\u2019t moved and the short-term rates were still in our favor right now. That\u2019s really the only floating rate that we have out there which is less than 5% of our total debt. So we are pretty comfortable with that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then I guess just finally the Denny you talked about potential growth in the development pipeline as we roll into 2014 how big is your kind of list the conversations of what you could do because it starts to equal to \u201813 maybe even higher?","Denny Oklak","Yeah I think Jamie we did about five a little more 500 million of new development starts last year. We are at sort of that $212 million level for the first half of this year. Right now I would say that I think we can continue to maintain that space we really think there is a good, there is a good backlog. So today I would tell you sort of the net $450 million to $500 million on an annual basis is a good run rate for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","You have a question from Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Yeah, Denny maybe just follow-up on that question. In terms of the development pipeline in that $450 million or $500 million at start of the year. How is that breaking down between property taxes at least as you see it today kind of what\u2019s in the pipeline, you done a little more office but I think some people expected that you\u2019ve had good success there. So maybe just a recap on where you\u2019re going.","Denny Oklak","Yeah, I think that\u2019s right Dave. I think generally speaking I would tell you that, that would be roughly 50% MOB and 50% industrial but it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s been very interesting because we\u2019ve had some opportunities to do some office development. So I think and it\u2019s really been driven by our existing land positions obviously as well as demand in the market. And one thing I didn\u2019t mention in the prepared remarks that building we started about a year ago in Houston opened up and it\u2019s now 100% leased mentioned in the one in Raleigh that\u2019s 30% leased. So again looking forward, I would say maybe 40% to 45% MOB, 40% to 45% industrial and 10% to 15% office as far as the starts go.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Great, thanks. Then you talked also which I think very early in your comments that you didn\u2019t think that the rising rates would impact really the tenant demand for space they get, let met talk about how you handicapped the risk associated with underwriting those assets is that really a spot decision and you just kind of move forward in that point of time?","Denny Oklak","Yeah, I think that\u2019s more of a spot decision, we obviously look at transactions individually when they come through and look at what\u2019s going on in the market, our cost of capital and those type of things when we make those decisions.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","I don\u2019t know if you said that where you in the running for the portfolio that I guess received recently from your big competitors, did you get bit on that?","Denny Oklak","No, if I could it\u2019s \u2013 what I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re talking about, no.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Okay, okay. So any particular reasons for you not to be involved in that?","Denny Oklak","Well, let\u2019s just make sure we\u2019re talking about\u2026","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","I\u2019m sorry in the capital transaction.","Denny Oklak","Yeah, that\u2019s just really not our process to product type that we\u2019re looking for.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","","Okay.","Denny Oklak","If you look at that that\u2019s I think those the average size of the building international transactions in the 125,000 130,000 square foot range. And as I mentioned in our remarks we\u2019d really been focused mostly on those about 500,000 square foot buildings.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","And you think better rent growth in the bigger spaces versus a smaller spaces as a result of kind of your activity there?","Denny Oklak","I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I think the demand is going to be better in the larger spaces over the long term, I really think that\u2019s the way the business is evolving. And I don\u2019t see a big difference in rent growth between larger spaces and smaller spaces going forward.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","","Okay. And then lastly maybe just for Mark. I know previously the company had wanted to leave those preferreds that are out there just over 6.5 I think $500 million or so. Have you had any change in thinking about what you might want to do with the outstanding preferreds that are callable?","Mark Denien","Yeah, not at this time Dave. I think we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with where we are there.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird Great. Thank you.","Operator","Question from Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks. Couple of quick follow-up questions. The Midwest portfolio that you\u2019re looking to slow, I understand I guess too much because I have given that suppose here but mainly you can put some quality parameters around that. What the rent per square foot look like on that group of assets?","Denny Oklak","I\u2019m thinking about your keeping because I don\u2019t have that number in front of me but I don\u2019t know for sure but I\u2019m going to make a guess that it\u2019s probably in the 13 to 15 bucks net range on that portfolio, it\u2019s kind of very quiet a bit because little different sub markets and things like that and different cities. So the stuff in St. Louis is going to have a higher net rental rates than the stuff in Cincinnati and Cleveland, so it varies a little bit but on average that would be my guess.","Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And on the Cabot transaction, just want to see your take on. Did you look at that portfolio couple of years ago?","Denny Oklak","Yeah, there was \u2013 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s what to be honest with you but there was a Cabot marketed a portfolio couple of years ago that wasn\u2019t as big as what Liberty bought but it was \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say I don\u2019t know 12 million 14 million square feet. We didn\u2019t really look at it we did build on it because once again it just wasn\u2019t the type of product that we\u2019re really looking for.","Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And just last question, I guess thanks for \u2013 maybe bring some more color on your acquisition strategy. And given that they are 100% leased assets this quarter for 400 million of acquisitions. Whatever you \u2013 I think it\u2019s changed here underwriting strategy at all for the rising rates it\u2019s actually because if they\u2019re 100% leased assets with ten year leased terms go after it\u2019s very bond like and with half year cost of fund this company going off that side I would think where you have a somewhat material impact on your exit values and I was wondering if you got and totally have changed your hurdle rats at all especially for 40 day side acquisitions.","Denny Oklak","Yeah, my answer that would be yeah I\u2019d say they can probably have most of those acquisitions that we closed this quarter closed before we saw the spike in interest rate. So what \u2013 you just really I think you have to look at the \u2013 well is it at the kind of asset is it the quality of asset, is it the location of asset, you have the kind of tendency that you want and cap rates can be a little bit fluid because as we see interest rates just if you look at the tenure probably moved a 100 basis points and in 60 days now. So you can\u2019t just base your acquisition on where interest rates are at a particular time, we\u2019re looking on most of it almost all the acquisitions we\u2019ve done it been really funded this disposition process. So, we sort of time that unfortunate to be able to time that very well and we feel like we\u2019re getting good cap rates on the dispositions and we\u2019re getting what we believe are good long-term assets on the acquisitions.","Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","We have a question from Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good afternoon. Denny I don\u2019t want to cast this in a negative light but if I take your comments your occupancy which is I think is the highest it\u2019s ever been or at sort of peak levels. And you\u2019ve got development that is increasing in your markets but it\u2019s difficult for developers to find out for those properties. Does that make you concerned at all that there it could be downward pressure on occupancy as you look at over the next 6 12 months or so?","Denny Oklak","No, not really I don\u2019t think there is going to be necessarily downward pressure on our occupancy, one of the things that we pay a lot of attention to Brendan is our lease expiration schedule and try to keep that balance. So we never have in any one year more than 10% 11% rolling. And you\u2019re going to hit some ups and downs in the markets as those things roll. Again I\u2019m just saying Brendan this is really I believe what we\u2019ve been saying for the last year or so we\u2019ve been very cautious and expect development because we\u2019re just waiting to see the demand that\u2019s really going to absorb that space. As we said in our prepared remarks almost all of our markets today our portfolios on the industrial side are over 95% so that\u2019s excellent. And we see enough demand that that\u2019s going to hold up, I\u2019m just \u2013 I won\u2019t say I\u2019m terribly nervous I\u2019m just this is why we\u2019re pointing out over the last year or so we got to see the demand is going to take that new space off the market.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yeah, no I can appreciate that I mean it seems like you\u2019re doing a very good job leasing up \u2013 very good leasing quarter and your overall occupancy it seems like it\u2019s pretty high it seems like that\u2019s moving in the right direction, but then you\u2019re saying that you didn\u2019t see sort of as much demand at the core levels so. The \u2013 this is probably for Mark, what was the impairment on in the quarter?","Mark Denien","The impairment related to the landfill transaction Denny mentioned that are actually closed in July Brendan it was a parcel land like Denny mentioned it we had actually planned on developing. We got an unsolicited offer and sold this. So it had not been previously impaired it was at its original book basis and it was related to that.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yeah so I guess the land impairment is call it 15% it\u2019s a $3.7 million and $23 million but how you kind of reconcile that Mark on the land with the earlier comments that as you kind of look at the land that you are holding for development. Do you think you are going to be able to put that into motion at values that are above what the current basis is give like you just sold a property at land that you felt like you had a good price on for 15% below book?","Denny Oklak","Well I think Brendan you got to you really got to look at it parcel by parcel. Two things that we said one was we impaired a fairly significant portfolio gone four years ago now and what we said is we\u2019ve sold anything we\u2019ve sold a lot of that portfolio we\u2019ve sold at a profit from that impaired basis. And as I recall we impaired that basis above of 30%, 35% roughly back then and we\u2019ve sold a little bit above that. So probably a 5% margin on that impaired basis on average. And then we\u2019ve not impaired any of the development land and all the development yields come out when we put that land into use include that original basis in that lands. So you see the development yields that we are getting today and we think those are definitely very market development yields.","On this particular land this was land we bought as part of the weaker acquisition way back when and I would tell you that we have done very, very, very, very well on that land. We sold a big chunk of that land to the Department of Defense when we get the BRAC project and did very well in that sale. We sold another big chunk of land out into by Dallas to a company and by the name of aerospace where we are doing some third-party development on and we did very well on that land and really this was this land sale was basically all the rest of the land there is a little piece of industrial and one other little office piece. So we\u2019ve sold all of that land from the weaker transaction now and this was the only land where we have slight impairment on.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yeah. Okay I know it\u2019s helpful did it looks like did you guys buy land in the quarter as well because it looks like your balance went up by I don\u2019t know $13 million, $14 million something like that?","Denny Oklak","Yeah we bought an industrial parcel in Houston up in the Northwest is we are basically out of land in the Northwest side of Houston. So we can do about 800,000, 900,000 square feet.","Mark Denien","One thing I\u2019d like to point out to Brendan there are a couple of things on the land is I think you\u2019ll see for the rest of the year. We\u2019ll end up the year like for at this level. We hit our guidance our revised guidance at $40 million to $50 million in land proceeds. We\u2019ll actually end up with the total pretty nice profit margin on that land this call it 20% give or take and that includes this right down we just got and then the other thing I would just like to point out in case of any confusion. We do not count any land so I have to take that call it 20% margin or whatever ends up being that will not be part of our core FFO and that had nothing to do with our core FFO guidance change.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","I think you answered my last question before I could ask it. Alright thanks Mark.","Mark Denien","Okay.","Operator","We have a question from John Stewart. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. This is Eric Franklin here for John. Sorry to hop on the land bank question for a second but for another minute but I just want to ask what do you think your ideal size that your land bank. You are at 600 million now and so how long will it take it to get to that, how long will it take it to get to that ideal size?","Denny Oklak","Well I think the ideal size always depends on the level of activity on the development side. Again what we\u2019ve been saying here for the most recent past was obviously the land bank was larger than we won it when we headed into this down term economy when development slowed down. We are now back to somewhat of a normal development cycle I wouldn\u2019t say we are ahead a normal development cycle yet but we moved a lot of that land into the held for sale when we made the decision to get out of the merchant building business.","So that was part of the reason that land bank was higher and now we\u2019ll as we move through that, that won\u2019t be part of the land bank any more than second thing is we are doing, we are moving more and more out of the suburban office business and more and more into the bulk industrial and MOB business at a bulk industrial land is significantly cheaper in most markets then office land. So I think overall the investment in land will be less when we have, when we go to more industrial business and then we are not really buying any office land we are developing through the land that we have on the office side and we still got some great positions that\u2019s indicated by the success we\u2019ve had there just recently. So again Eric I think if you are really looking at where if we are in the $500 million of new development and it\u2019s half industrial and half MOB I think we could have a land bank lot in the $300 million to $400 million range and be fine.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thanks that\u2019s helpful. Final question obviously we you know you all recognized that you need to further or gradually improving could you possibly comment on what cash releases for the entire portfolio new annual leases?","Denny Oklak","Well we don\u2019t we never really track that just because basis are different and all that and we never had. So but I guess I would say anecdotally I think clearly cash rents generally speaking from, if again, you are assuming leases in place had annual rental rate growth I think we are seeing probably maybe slightly negative to slightly positive in most markets on cash rents today to go from an old to a new fees. And so what I\u2019m saying I guess and that is probably anywhere from 1% to 1.5% negative. So 1% to 2% positive.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Great and final question I guess I\u2019m not sure if anyone would simply asked us but is there are there any properties that you\u2019re bidding on currently we actually noticed that change in pricing as a result of the interest rate increase?","Denny Oklak","I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t quite understand any properties.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","On the properties you might be bidding on at this point in time, have you noticed that change in pricing or change in the pricing environment as a result of the recent interest rate increases.","Denny Oklak","Well not really to be honest with it. Although I just I think activities been a little bit slower here in the last 45, 60 days but no quite honestly Eric I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen cap rates moved much but we\u2019ll have to see this these transactions take while it get completed and we are seeing some of these not get closed that were probably under negotiation and getting pretty close before this spiked interest rates. So I think if you see over the next 30 to 60 days of the interest that you see what trend we see in some of the cap rates.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Alright, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks.","Operator","Question from Michael Salinsky. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning afternoon guys. Denny you talked a lot about dispositions could you give us as a sense we\u2019ve seen a lot of portfolio transactions I believe could you characterize the overall acquisition market at this point and what you are seeing in?","Denny Oklak","Well I think on the acquisition market as I just said it\u2019s been a little bit slow over the last 60, 45, 60 days I mean we closed most of our transactions more in the early in the second quarter and got some things out there today but I would say nothing that we are looking to close here in the like eminently I would say. So I think they are little bit slow they are done a couple other portfolio transactions that we weren\u2019t success bidders on for whatever reason I mean that we bid there on that we weren\u2019t successful mostly pricing obviously and obviously the large transaction that was announced no matter where that was last night or today was it looks to me like mostly an off market transaction.","So I think you just never know you kind of abs and flows Mike so we could my sense is sellers probably are waiting a little bit to see what cap rates are going to move on since the moving interest rates and if they if interest rates are settled down here a little bit which other than maybe the day look like they settle down pretty well. I think we\u2019ll see some more activity later into third quarter.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So the overall, the amount of \u2013 the overall pipeline at this point is it down significantly from the first half of the year out significantly, is that how you characterize that?","Denny Oklak","I would say it\u2019s down a little bit, down a little bit.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay.","Denny Oklak","There were some big transactions in the first half of the year so yeah its down a little bit right now.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay fair enough. I want to go back to one of your, in your prepared comments you talked about blocks of 500,000 square feet bulk industrial seeing better growth opportunities and in realized you\u2019re growing that but as you look at renewal spreads cash per growth, can you break out kind of what the growth you\u2019re seeing on the bulk industrial versus some of the smaller foot prints?","Denny Oklak","Again we just average it all together because the truth is almost all of our portfolio is true bulk. Today less than 10% of our portfolio is in buildings under 100,000 square feet and I think it\u2019s now up to about 40% of our portfolio is in buildings over 500, 000 square feet. So most of what you\u2019ll see in our statistic is going to be true bulk types statistics. And we just don\u2019t have that much small space anymore around that I can give you as strong sense of what\u2019s going on in the smaller spaces.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough and final question just you guys are marked really it sounds like there is the Cleveland, Cincinnati portfolio what\u2019s the buyer, potential buyer profile on that are you seeing institutional investors or is that mostly families one-off buyers?","Denny Oklak","I would say its one-off buyers and private equity kind of buyers not institutional which we never expected so private equity both smaller and maybe some larger private equity money out there.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Mostly value added yield focused?","Denny Oklak","Value add I would say today.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Welcome.","Operator","Mr. Salinsky do you have any additional question?","Denny Oklak","No I think he is done.","Operator","We have a follow up from Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Thanks. Could you give a little more detail around your service operation income more specifically are there any lumpy redevelopment projects you\u2019re working on for third-parties that are conducing for that $50 million revenue run rate currently?","Mark Denien","No, Ki Bin there is really nothing too lumpy I mean I think it set a pretty good run rate now I think as we go forward to may be 2014 what we try to do with that business is we size it according to the development projects we have for our own account so to the extent our development pipeline pitched up even more than it is today. We\u2019ll probably turn away some third party what we can focus more on doing a development for ourselves. So I think as you get out in the 14 you may expect a smaller run rate but as of today there is not too much lumpiness in there.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","And overall that if you take the opportunity, if you concept that maybe I\u2019ll ran on and let\u2019s say there is less development that you have to do for internally on your balance sheet and what if the depth of that market that they probably develop more \u2013 is it I guess in a way very easy to hit that $50 million run rate?","Mark Denien","A $50 million run rate Ki Bin?","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","$50 million per quarter I guess is that easy to maintain that if things did turn the other way where for some reason you decided not to develop as much on balance sheet and you had \u2013 G&A flowing there is that $50 million is easy to ramp it up a little bit is that how deep that market is?","Denny Oklak","Are you talking about revenue for instance.","Mark Denien","Revenue basis yeah. Yeah I think Ki Bin a couple of things I\u2019d point out. Part of that service business is our asset management property management business it\u2019s not all just a development. But from a development\/construction standpoint we currently business all the time now the \u2013 the honest answer it\u2019s not usually a real high margin business and we would rather resources fully for account. In times where development pipelines had dried out take 2009, 2010 we have been able to take on more work there, there seems all to be work out there it\u2019s just lower margin and it\u2019s not a preferable work.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Okay and can you break out the 450 million this quarter you\u2019ve had this five different piece to that.","Denny Oklak","I don\u2019t have that in front of me Ki Bin.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ron Hubbard of VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, Linda. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we will refer you to our December 31, 2014, 10-K that we have in file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement I will turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments for the quarter and then Jim Conner will give you an update on our leasing and development activity. I will review our asset recycling transactions and Mark will then address our second quarter financial performance and balance sheet.","We signed 4 million square feet of leases and finished the quarter at 95.8% in service occupancy rate, the fourth consecutive quarter, we have been above 95%. Rent growth on renewal leases was very strong at 15% driven by our industrial assets which grew by 19%. Same property growth was near to mid 6% level. We started $257 million of new developments across 13 projects at solid yields and closed $1.4 million in dispositions in the second quarter both exceeding our expectations for mid-year. We also completed the previously announced $500 million bond tender offer that significantly bolstered our balance sheet. By all accounts, this represents a very strong quarter.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim to give a little more color on our leasing activity and development pipeline.","Jim Connor","Thanks Denny and good afternoon everyone. From an operational standpoint, we had a solid quarter leasing at 4 million square feet as Denny noted, while this is down from quarterly historic norms, it\u2019s a reflection of continued record high occupancies in our portfolio with little space left to lease.","Total in-service occupancy ended at 95.8%, this is down just a bit from previous quarter as we expected due to development projects delivered during the quarter that were already 56% leased. Excluding these development projects that were placed in service, we actually increased the occupancy of our stabilized portfolio by 50 basis points. Rental rate growth rate on renewals continues to improve across the portfolio for the growth of 14.9% which reflects our continued pricing power.","Now I\u2019ll touch on some of the key activity within each of our product types. Nationally, the industrial markets strength continues with quarterly absorption of 40 million square feet. And we were pleased to learn that the year-to-date absorption pace is similar to the average of the previous two years, a good indication that the markets continue to absorb new supply. Nation-wide vacancies for logistics base dropped 20 basis points from the previous quarter to in the low 8% range.","In our own industrial portfolio, we completed 3.6 million square feet of total leasing ending the second quarter at 96.3%. Occupancy dipped slightly from the previous quarter primarily due to a 937,000 square foot speculative facility that delivered during the quarter. Project in which we have good activity for all of the space.","Rental rate continues to remain - rental rate growth remains extremely strong with growth in net effective rent on industrial lease renewals of 19% for the quarter. In medical office, the portfolio continues its positive trajectory with in-service occupancy at 94.9% that is 80 basis points above a year ago and at historic high for that portfolio.","Same property NOI was up 5.7% on a trailing 12 month basis. The pipeline for prospects for new facilities in the medical office space is also seeing an uptick as healthcare systems continue to come into new expansions. In development, we had a tremendous quarter with $257 million of starts totalling 3.6 million square feet.","Two of the larger projects commenced were speculative bulk industrial developments in the Lehigh Valley and in Atlanta totalling 1.1 million and 615,000 square feet respectively. These the sub markets in which both these projects are located are characterized by strong industrial demand fundamentals. In addition, we started eight other industrial projects across six markets comprising 1.7 million square feet which was 59% preleased in the aggregate.","In medical office development, we had a strong quarter with $73 million in starts, we started two medical office facilities in Denver totalling 92,000 square feet both 100% preleased for 15 years to a venture between Emerus SCL Health. the third project was a 76,000 square foot on campus facility in McKinney, Texas that is 50% preleased to Baylor Scott & White Health, one of the leading healthcare systems in Texas, this represents our 17th development here we have executed with Baylor over the last six years a testament to our excellent relationship with Baylor.","Our overall development pipeline at quarter end has 27 projects under construction totalling 6.5 million square feet and a projected 547 million in stabilized cost at our share and a 45% preleased in the aggregate. I will note that previous percentage has dipped a little below our recent average which is a bit impacted by the mix of projects coming in and out of the pool this quarter at a broader context, our development risk management goal is to be around 50% or greater of the overall pipeline to be preleased.","These 27 projects have an initial cash stabilized yield of 7.1% and a GAAP yield of 7.8% which highlights the strong value creation being made for our shareholders. We also had a deep pipeline of development prospects including many industrial builder suit and substantially preleased MOB projects which will likely bring our leasing pipeline back above 50% in the third quarter even without considering new additional leasing in the pipeline.","We also continued our strong progress in selling non-strategic land during the quarter, we sold another $35.7 million of non-strategic parcels at a booking of $16.2 million bringing our total land sales year-to-date to $71 million already exceeding our initial full year expectations. And now I will turn it back over to Denny to cover our asset recycling activities.","Denny Oklak","With respect to investment activity, we closed 1.7 billion of building dispositions during the quarter at an overall average in-place cap rate of 7.0%, these proceeds were primarily the result of the previously announced Starwood suburban office in Midwest industrial portfolio transactions. We have a number of other assets in various stages of the disposition process significant portion of our remaining suburban office assets in Cincinnati are under contract and expected to close in the third quarter.","We are also marketing some office assets in other markets and a few additional non-core industrial properties. The current investment sales market remains strong and we believe that continuing to improving the portfolio is a prudent way to fund our development pipeline. With this activity, our disposition expectations for the year have increased which I\u2019ll be touching in just a moment. One acquisition during the quarter was the newly constructed 233,000 square foot modern bulk industrial facility located West Hills Business Park in the Lehigh Valley, region of pennsylvania, which further expands our presence in that growing market for Duke Realty.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss the financial results and capital plans.","Mark Denien","Thank you, Denny. Good afternoon, everyone. As Denny mentioned, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our financial performance and review our capital transactions. Core FFO was $0.20 per share for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $0.31 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The increase in core FFO was primarily due to recurring a smaller based properties for the quarter that resulted in a significant dispositions Denny just mentioned. Lower interest expense from our significant debt reductions in improved operating fundamentals in our remaining base of properties partially offset this impact.","I would also like to point out that core FFO excludes approximately $7 million of overhead restructuring charges which are primarily comprised of severance charges from staffing changes resulting from the significant reduction in the size of the office portfolio.","Our annual guidance for general administrative expenses does not include these restructuring charges. We generated $0.25 per share and AFFO for the second quarter of 2015, which equates to an AFFO pay ratio of 68% compared to $0.28 per share in the first quarter of 2015. As we have said, we are more focused on AFFO growth than FFO growth. And even with the significant depositions and significant deleveraging our AFFO growth was for the full six months as 8% and we expect solid AFFO growth for the reminder of the year.","Same property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended June 30, 2015, was 6.3% from 6.2%, respectively. The same property results were driven by both increased commencement occupancy and growth in rent rates. Occupancy growth will slow in the latter half of the year, and we still expect strong rent growth, which led to our increase since property and like growth guidance of 75 basis points at the mid-point.","Utilizing our disposition proceeds, we repaid over $1 billion of debt in the second quarter. this includes $431 million of unsecured notes that had a weighted average interest rate of 6.8% and severance secured loans totaling $137 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. We also repaid $453 million on a rent secured line of credit finishing in the quarter would no outstanding borrowings on the line and almost a $120 million of cash. All of these capital transactions coupled with our strong operational performance resulted in continued improvements in our key financial metrics.","Fixed charge coverage for the second quarter improved to 2.9 times. Net debt to EBITDA for the 3 months ended June 30, 2015, was 6.3 times. We expect to see continued improvement throughout the year in these metrics as new development replacement services and speculative development leased up.","To summarize the transactions results for the quarter, I would say that we believe we are in a very strong liquidity position and are well positioned to further development pipeline and next opportunity which is in March 2016 without any external capital needs.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Mark. In review the first half of the year with an outlook for the second half and given the strong execution on development sides starts by our team and our ability to take advantage of a continued strong investment sales environment, yesterday we raised our development starts guidance to $550 million to $700 million, that\u2019s up $175 million from the original mid-point. We also raised disposition guidance to $1.8 billion to $2 billion, up $250 million from the previous mid-point. Land sale guidance was increased to $80 million to $120 million, that\u2019s up $35 million from the previous mid-point. And due to continued strong overall operating fundamentals we raised our same property NOI growth guidance to a range of 4.0% to 5.5%, up 75 basis points from the previous mid-point.","As noted in yesterday\u2019s earnings release additional detail on revisions to certain guidance factors can we found in the Investor Relations section of our website. So in closing I would like to point out that the second quarter of 2015 was another transformational quarter for Duke Realty. The closing at the Starwood office sale as well as our strong level of development start significantly advanced our goal are being a primarily a bulk industrial company with an excellent value creation medical office development business.","By year end 2015 those two product types will comprised well over 90% of our business with excellent growth prospectus. We also have an excellent value achieved that we intend to maintain into the future. Thanks is always to our great team and our loyal shareholders.","We\u2019ll now open up the lines for questions and we ask the participants keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions. You are of course, welcome to get back in the queue.","And with that we\u2019ll take questions. Okay, Linda.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and we\u2019ll go directly to the line of Juan Sanabria. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi , good afternoon. I was just hoping you could speak a little bit about further dispositions you may have planned beyond 2015, what other assets may be considered non-core and if you could try to help us frame dollar value around that and if you have any sort of update on the possibility of having an pay a special dividend and kind of some other gains were deferred whether the transactions were structured.","Denny Oklak","Well, first of all I think when you look at dispositions we\u2019re not compared to give 2016 guidance yet because its still quite always way but you can see us I think continued to sell the remaining office product that we have and as we said we\u2019re really downsizing that business not will be a tremendous left after the end of 2015 but there will still be some and some of those will be are in joint ventures which will just going to roll out over time and not necessarily in 2016 and also I think you\u2019ll see us perhaps strategically take advantage if the markets stays where it is today to harvest some value from the existing industrial portfolio in a few cases. So and that\u2019s a general trend again I think we have to way to we get closure to 2016 to give you real guidance. And the as far as special dividend goes I\u2019ll turn that over to Mark to answer that once.","Mark Denien","Yes, its as we early said for the last two to four months its going to be difficult to really pin a number down so we get really out in the September which is when the 1031 period expires on some of the proceeds but I would say as that\u2019s not a material portion of it. I think you comment about deferred in the substantial portion of the gain on the Starwood transactions through the solid financing is the point that lot of people loose side of that does differ significant portion of the gain in the 16 it really helps our position.","The other point that I think people don\u2019t clearly understand, here is the tax strategies we have available to us to accelerate some depreciation and take advantage of something\u2019s like that so long storage sort we don\u2019t have a number yet but I would tell you that if there is a special dividend I don\u2019t think it will be significant at all.","Juan Sanabria","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Hi, guys good afternoon. Just looking at your development schedule in your supplemental and you often - the projected value creation with the blended 594 cap rate I was wondering if you could share with us assumptions by property type but what you think that cap rates from value creation perspectives.","Denny Oklak","Well, I\u2019ll start and then I let Jim as well Manny, I mean I guess I would tell that from, you look at from a margin perspective and I would tell you that probably the highest margin right now in that value creations on the office side but it\u2019s obviously a very low number, it\u2019s really one or two projects and suspect project we have down in Florida but when you look at both the medical office and the industrial, they\u2019re really pretty consistent, they\u2019re in the high teens to low 20% range.","Jim Connor","Yes I would add to that, it\u2019s not only driven by the product type but it\u2019s driven by the specific market, so clearly exit cap rates in Southern California are going to be different then perhaps Indianapolis, the on-campus 100% leased medical office are going to be different than those that have a reset component to it, but we go through a building by building breakdown to come up with that and the point is we\u2019ve shared with you guys consistently in all of our investor meetings is we have got a great track record of basically producing about 20% margins on all of our development year-over-year and we continue to see that trend.","Manny Korchman","Okay. And then if you could switch to your land position based on the geographic perspective do you think you\u2019re appropriately positioned or should we see buying more lands over the next quarters or months?","Jim Connor","Well I think you\u2019ll see our long-term trend is to continue to try and reduce our overall land holdings. We\u2019ve got approval of land that we\u2019ve determined to be non-strategic that we\u2019re holding for sale that is not being actively marketed, that is a lot of what you saw sell this quarter and we hope to continue to report significant sales like that in the second and third quarter and then we\u2019re also monetizing additional land through our new development. We have been buying land but the good news is we\u2019re selling and developing a lot more land that we\u2019re buying. So net-net we are reducing our overall land holdings that we hope to continue to be able to do that.","Manny Korchman","Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to the line of Vance Edelson. Your line is open.","Vance Edelson","Great, thanks for taking the questions. So your own occupancy already very solid on the industrial side as you mentioned, would you say that competitor occupancies are starting to catch up especially among some of the more mom and pop or local type players in your markets and is that part of what is driving the strong rental rate growth on renewals, is that helping at all?","Jim Connor","Yes Vance I think so, I think w could say a rising tide rises all ships as everybody\u2019s occupancy continues to grow up, demand continues to outpace supply nationally we saw overall industrial vacancies declined another 20 basis points. So everybody is taking advantage of that opportunity, it\u2019s just a function of how aggressively you want to push on a rental rate side, we just come off a great quarter where our teams have been - have really been able to push particularly on the renewal side, you saw with those numbers we posted.","Vance Edelson","Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up, the retention rate was a little lower at 67% versus recent quarters, when you do lose tenants, can you give us a feel for the mix of reasons is this increasingly you nudging them out or they telling you, they are moving to cheaper space or they struggling in this economy, what are some of the more typical reasons?","Jim Connor","Probably the number one reason for us which is again a function of the high occupancy is not having available space to be able to accommodate just the organic growth or consolidations of existing tenants. That is why you see in some of the markets where we have extremely high occupancy, we have to build spec space just to be able to handle organic growth within the portfolio.","We do have some tenants that are - that are not comfortable with the rental rates that we\u2019re able to push and those are seeking less expensive space alternatives but we are able to backfill that space at today\u2019s market rents. So we\u2019re comfortable taking that risk which is but we\u2019re - our guys are out there doing every day.","Denny Oklak","Vance I would point out to the 67% as a raw as a percentage is a bit lower than we were running up but the amount of space we had rolling was also very low, so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that number, the gross square feet - is not a big number.","Vance Edelson","Okay and that is good color. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Brendan Maiorana, please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks good afternoon. I don\u2019t know if this is for Mark or Denny but so you guys have more assets that sounds like you would like to sell and then maybe you are going to be opportunistic and sell into strong pricing market. Your debt to EBITDA is in the low six now, which is what I think you guys have targeted a few years ago when you had thought improve the balance sheet. As you think about balance sheet going forward leverage outlook, do you think leverage maybe moved even lower over the next year or two and you kind of head into whenever the downturn in this cycle hits with the even lower leverage or do you think you kind of hold platform where you are now.","Denny Oklak","Well, Brendan, I\u2019ll start and Mark, join me and I would say a lot of it probably depends on the level of our development pipeline. Because we still think today that it\u2019s a really good use of those disposition proceeds to put it back into the development pipeline so as long as that pipeline holds up, I think our sales are kind of going to be in line with that going forward for at least the near term future here. And then just as far as the overall balance sheet, I\u2019ll let Mark comment.","Mark Denien","Yes. I agree with Denny. I think I have to agree with Denny, but I do...","Brendan Maiorana","He\u2019ll have you fired.","Mark Denien","So I said I think I have to agree, yes. I think you could, Brendan, see it getting a little bit better from all this right now over the next 12 months or so like Denny said and ultimately depands how quickly or how much that moves based on the development pipeline is probably the biggest factor right now. I don\u2019t think you will see it going north of where it is but you could see it going, getting even better from where it is now and then we\u2019ll be positioned when the next downturn comes whenever that is to take advantage of other opportunities.","Brendan Maiorana","So if I hear you guys right, it sounds like you are disposition outlook is driven may be a bit more by the opportunities that are on the development pipeline not about maybe selling assets that you think or have value that\u2019s maximized, if you don\u2019t really have a great use of those proceeds.","Denny Oklak","No. it\u2019s not what I meant to say, if you understood that way, Brendan. I think we know kind of the assets we want to sell but whether we use that, those proceeds to pay down debt or fund development is the real questions. So again it really depends on how big our development pipeline is. So it could go either way.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. All right. Thanks for the clarification. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll not go to the line of John Guinee. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Hi. I was just looking at your joint venture page and you sold one of the Texas Dugan JV I guess. Where are you on chambers street, I think they are about to be merged in with Gramercy and you\u2019ve got up 80\/20 JV with them.","Denny Oklak","Yes, John. I mean, we paired that joint venture down pretty significantly too over the last couple of years. They bought a cloud of some of the assets. So now own them a 100% and the joint venture sold some assets so for the most part it\u2019s just some industrial build - tenant industrial buildings left in there. I have to say that at this point in time we really havent hand any detailed discussions with whoever is going to be running the new combined company as to what\u2019s there and again so almost everything in there with I think you are still maybe a couple office buildings left about most of it is, built to suite industrials so our sense today is joint ventures is going to keep going.","John Guinee","Is there a buy\/sell take certain.","Denny Oklak","No. There isn\u2019t. not an overall buy-sell there is some provisions that at one part, once we sell there is provisions that\u2019s how it works but that is not really a buy\/sell.","John Guinee","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up from the line of Juan Sanabria. Please go ahead.","Juan Sanabria","Hi, thanks again for taking the question. Just with regards to your current landback, how much development opportunities does that allowed you to do overtime. And at the current land prices, if you had to grow on the market and sort of replenish keeping in mind you are trying to sell some land. What type of returns would you be able to generate at the current market rates?","Denny Oklak","The Mark is flipping pages to pull up the development capacity notes.","Mark Denien","So, yeah from the development perspective we could develop about $37.5 million square feet. On the land that we have and I guess I\u2019ll start with the value perspective and Jim - I don\u2019t really have a yield number or anything like that because as Jim said earlier on another question that really various market-by-market but I will tell you from the value perspective we believe that\u2019s our book based in that land is probably, under market value by 15%, 20% or so give or take.","Denny Oklak","Well, I wanted to answer differently I would tell you that if you look at the gains this quarter based on the sales, we\u2019ve have got a great basis in all our existing land. Your question about opportunities to buy land in the future for future development. I would tell you again, if you look at our development track record on the overall margins we\u2019re not interested in buying a land going forward and reduce in those margins, so any land that we buy, the development models and the rents that are supporting those that we are putting together have to be consistent with those margins which is, we\u2019ve been able to show you guys have been 18% to 20% over the last few years and we don\u2019t anticipate buying a land it\u2019s going to reduce that.","Mark Denien","One thing I would add is that virtually all that land those that develop per square feet that Mark mentioned is industrial, 35 square feet","Juan Sanabria","And just a quick question on the MOP leasing spread anything unusual that drove that pretty high number this quarter, anything or is that just a small sample size that we shouldn\u2019t necessarily read too much into it.","Denny Oklak","I think it\u2019s, that such a stable portfolio it\u2019s a fairly small sample size, so I would read much into it beyond that.","Juan Sanabria","Thanks.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks, could you just comment on your projected lease spreads throughout this year or maybe I think more importantly next year, does advantage of leases become more favorable in next year versus this year just trying to get a grasp of, how things might trend going forward.","Denny Oklak","Yeah ki, I will take that - that, the deals that we did in the second quarter about 55% of the deals that we signed in the second quarter or rollovers that we originally signed between 2009 and 2011, so little over half. As we look forward to the next 18 months which is, how we look at and I think we\u2019ve said pretty consistently. The advantage of leases from 2009, 2011 for the next 18 months represent 38% of the leases rolling.","So you can see that the, what I call the [indiscernible] leases are starting to get smaller as a sample size that what we are going to be doing. So, I think it\u2019s fair to the thing from debt 19% industrial renewal rate that we had this quarter, it will be hard to sustain probably 19% but I would also point out that even the deals that we did that we are not signed 12 we still getting good record from all the deals. But 19% is probably going to be hard to be for the next 12 to 18 months.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And second question can you comment on the IT portfolio that GLP\u2019s and talks to take down I mean obviously that\u2019s a big portfolio for your company to have observed but just curious if you had a chance to look at on any thoughts on regarding that will be helpful.","Denny Oklak","Yes Ki Bin, we did take a look at that, they been working I would say IIT has been working on and trying to get something done but I would say at least 18 months maybe a little longer than that, so back early on in that process we were either ask or invited or how we want to put to look at it and we did look at it, but at the time and we, the pricing wasn\u2019t that they were expecting really wasn\u2019t in the ballpark what we, we well into pace, so we are familiar with portfolio I would say it\u2019s a good portfolio and generally speaking so, good transaction I guess what I would say.","Ki Bin Kim","Yes.","Denny Oklak","I think it\u2019s sort of again sort of sets the pricing what is going on in the industrial space today, there has been a lot of significant and smaller transactions out there and certainly shows I think that these cap rates are definitely holding in the industrial space today.","Ki Bin Kim","And just hypothetically if you did end up buying a portfolio that similar size, would it be in theory just on fully on balance sheet or would you typically seek a capital partner for such a size to that kind of value?","Denny Oklak","Well I think that\u2019s pretty hypothetical Ki Bin. So I\u2019m not sure how to answer that but I guess I would say it depends, it would depend on the portfolio, it would depend on the pricing, it would depend on the timing where our share prices were trading and what our net asset value was and a lot of different things as to what we try to do with the portfolio out there or like that?","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Operator","All right. And next we will go to line of Brendan Maiorana, please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana","Thanks, Jim. So on the developed - you mentioned development pipeline, you like to keep it around 50% preleased and you\u2019re little bit below that now. Is that - does that 50% threshold or target or whatever vary by property type because it feels like your MOB stuff is largely build-to-suit and looks like you\u2019ve done a little bit more on the spec side with industrial just over the past couple of quarters?","Jim Connor","So that goal is a goal in aggregate and it is made up of those two components, the medical side is historically much higher, we haven\u2019t seen, I don\u2019t think we have seen any development opportunities in medical where the preleasing component was less than 50%. Most of those are really averaging probably 75% preleased by the hospital system, anything that we would contemplate off-campus but aligned would still have to be 100% lease, so that is the trend that we\u2019re seeing going forward in our healthcare portfolio.","So I think you\u2019ll continue to see that at those same kind of levels and in the industrial we\u2019ve gotten comfortable with where our portfolios are in some of these different markets, we continue to see demand outpace supply, so the timing was such that we had a couple of more spec project this quarter and a couple of large ones. So we saw that that was going to dip down, I think we alerted most of our analyst, investment committee to that in NAREIT that that was probably going to dip down this quarter but looking at the pipeline, I think we expect that to comeback in the third and fourth quarter to levels that we\u2019re comfortable with.","Mark Denien","The other thing I would point out on that preleasing. We quote those numbers on a square foot basis. So and because we have a high dollar per foot investment in the MOB, and if you looked at it on a dollar invested basis, it\u2019s actually higher than the way we reported as far as our preleasing percentages. So that\u2019s another thing we kind of keep in mind to.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. That\u2019s a good point. Thanks Mark. And then Jim, maybe just a follow-up on that. From a market perspective, are there any markets where you feel like you would be uncomfortable doing spec either from a market or submarket perspective, just given where the supply and demand dynamics maybe.","Jim Connor","Yes. There is a few of them out there. A lot of it is first and foremost it\u2019s driven by the performance of our overall portfolio, where we are as an entire company, where we are in that particular city and where we are in that particular submarket. But we\u2019ve been asked that question from time-to-time. We would be a little uncomfortable right now doing a big spec project in Dallas for example. We are watching Houston and the [indiscernible] fairly closely, yes, with most of those - in all three of those markets, they posted very good net positive absorption numbers for the second quarter. So the trend line continues to be good but there is a lot of specs based out there in those markets. So we\u2019re watching them.","Brendan Maiorana","Sure. Okay. Thanks, guys.","End of Q&A","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Denny Oklak","I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode, and later there'll be an opportunity for your question. [Operator Instructions] Just a brief reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","And I'd now like to turn the conference to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Hubbard.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, CFO; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2016, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks, Ron and good afternoon, everybody. I'll start out with a few comments on the national industrial markets and then cover our third quarter results.","Demand continues to be very strong across the US industrial markets, for the 29 out of the last 30 quarters, we've had demand out pace supply. Nationally we saw 61.5 million square feet of net absorption. Third quarter completions totaled 50.8 square feet, resulting in vacancy dropping another 10 basis points to 4.5%.","Year-to-date net absorptions are 160 million square feet with completions totaling 144 million square feet. We expect net absorption to finish well ahead of supply by 10 million to 22 million square feet for 2017. This continued strong demand will push expected equilibrium to mid 2018 at the earliest.","Each sellers' market fundamentals coupled with the strength of our regional operating teams contributed to a robust 5.9 million square feet of leasing for the quarter. Some of the more notable lease transactions were with customers such as XPO Logistics, Ford Motor Company, Valvoline, GELS Logistics, International Paper and Siemens.","Of particular note is our continued success and leasing recently completed speculated projects, most notable is the 628,000 square foot lease with XPO Logistics in the Lehigh Valley, taking 100% of the new project placed in service.","With the strong leasing activity and our stabilized industrial portfolio occupancy at 98%, we continue to be able to push rent as indicated by our rent growth on new and renewed leases of roughly 16%. We reported 2.2% growth in same property net operating income for the quarter. Same property analog for the nine months ended September 30 was 3.9%.","Occupancy in the same property fuller properties actually declined 30 basis points from the previous period quarter of 97.7%. The previously disclosed hhgregg bankruptcy had a roughly 80 basis point drag on same store net operating income for the quarter. We have one lease signed of the three hhgregg spaces, totaling 738,000 feet and the second and third lease executions are eminent. I'm happy to report that we were able to grow rents and extend lease terms in all three spaces.","On the development side of our business, momentum continues to be very strong. During the third quarter we generated $230 million of starch across five projects totaling 3.8 million square feet, that are 54% pre-leased in the aggregate. The new development starts including a build-to-suit project in Dallas with Wacker.com [ph], a 65% pre-leased project in Indianapolis with a major 3PL that is subsequent to the end of the quarter signed an additional lease bringing the building to 100% and two speculated projects in eastern Pennsylvania and Columbus Ohio.","One additional notable development start was a 737,000 expansion tied to a recently acquired 794,000 square foot facility in the Inland Empire market. Our client D\u00e9cor Outdoor Corporation executed the lease for 100% of the space. We continue to see strong activity in the development pipeline and are confident to close our 2017 in strong fashion and optimistic about 2018.","Our overall development pipeline at quarter end has 21 projects under construction, totaling 11.1 million square feet and has a projected 696 million in stabilized cost at our share. These projects are 63% pre-leased in the aggregate and our margins on this development pipeline continue to be in the 20% to 25% range.","Now, let me turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisition and disposition activity for the quarter.","Nick Anthony","Thanks, Jim. We had a very active quarter on both acquisitions and dispositions. I'll start with dispositions. Building dispositions totaled 301 million in the third quarter, including seven medical office buildings and three suburban office properties in Indianapolis, which completed our exit of the Indianapolis office market. After these transactions there are two remaining medical office properties, one of which should close this year.","Turning to acquisitions, we closed 390 million during the quarter, including 156,000 square foot facility in the middle and sub market of New Jersey, two facilities in southern California totaling 1 million square feet in the mid count in Inland Empire west markets and one facility totaling 300,000 square feet in Chicago.","In addition to these properties, we also closed the first tranche and agreement to ultimately acquire a 10 building two land parcel portfolio in some of the nation's best sell markets from Bridge Development Partners, a transaction that was in the media three weeks ago. The first tranche closed at the end of September and consisted of five leased up facilities, with two in southern California, two in south Florida and one in northern New Jersey, all of which totaled 290 million and 1.7 million square feet and are 71% pre-leased in aggregate.","The remaining five buildings to be acquired in the Bridge portfolio comprised 1.8 square feet with the total at just under $300 million. All are located in northern New Jersey and are expected to close later this quarter. These remaining five products are showing just under 70% leased. The portfolio also includes two land parcels of undeveloped land in northern New Jersey, Midland and New York sub markets, for a total purchase price of 62 million upon which construction of two additional properties will commence later this year or early next year.","The entire portfolio, when construction on the two land parcels is completed, will ultimately total 4.3 million rentable square feet with a total investment of slightly under $700 million. We agreed to the terms of the acquisition in April, at which point the properties were 58% leased in total. After assuming leasing responsibilities in July this year, we executed additional leases to increase the portfolio to 69% leased.","In addition, we believe that rental rates have continued to increase while cap rates have also further compressed. Finally, I should note the definitive and future leasing prospects involve in the lease escalators at 3% and couple of long term market [indiscernible] produced favorable long term total returns.","I'll now turn it over to Mark Denien to cover our earnings results and balance sheet activity.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO was $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2017, compared to $0.32 for the second quarter of 2017. The expected and temporarily dilutive impact of selling our medical office properties was fully reflected in the third quarter. We continue to use disposition pros fees to reduce indebtedness, paying off $149 million of debt in the third quarter, which included the previously announced repayment of $129 million, 6.7% unsecured notes that were originally scheduled to mature in 2020.","We have significant built in capacity to fund our growth over the near and immediate term. In the near term, we have $513 million of proceeds from our medical office dispositions holding us grow, which should be used in the next couple of months to fund the acquisitions Nick just mentioned along with development activities, while completing tax deferred 1031 exchange transactions.","Over the longer term, we have $426 million of notes receivable from these property sales, due to mature over the next three years to provide a source of funding for future development or acquisitions. They are currently at leverage levels that are much better than our credit ratings would indicate and have the capacity and intention to fund our growth with incremental debt.","Our debt ratio is slowly rising back to pre-MOB sell levels and high triple-B levels by the end of 2018. I am also pleased to announce that a few weeks ago, we renewed our $1.2 billion unsecured credit facility and a 5 basis point reduction in our borrowing rate and a term extension to January of 2022, which provides further financing flexibility.","Given our optimistic outlook, for long term AFFO growth and given our excellent balance sheet position, yesterday, we were pleased to announce $0.01 per share of 5.3% increase in our regular quarterly dividend. Even with this increase, our AFFO quarter ratio remains at a very considerable level of approximate 70%.","Lastly, we plan to finalize and announce our special dividend by late November or early December and expect it to be within the range of previously communicated estimates.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. Let me re-emphasize once again how pleased we are having monetized the MOB portfolio and redeploying the capital into very high quality strategically well located industrial business, including the Bridge portfolio. As we stated a few times before, the blended stabilized yield we are achieving on the acquisitions, approximates the MOB dispositions cap rate.","When combined with the proceeds being used to fund our development pipeline at significantly higher yield, our total redeployment will be highly accretive to FFO with better risk adjusted growth prospects. We expect to have the majority MOB proceeds reinvested by year end with an under levered balance sheet to fund the substantial portion of our growth in 2018.","Lastly, I am pleased that our overall strong performance has allowed us to raise our quarterly dividend by 5.3%. This is the third consecutive year we are increasing our dividend in excess of 5%.","We'll now open up the lines to the audience, we would ask that you keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two short questions and of course you are always welcome to get back in the queue. With that we'll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Michael Carroll. Your line is open.","Michael Carroll","Yes thanks, can you guys talk a little bit about the company's acquisitions strategy going forward. After the completion of the Bridge portfolio and as we move into 2018 and beyond, will you remain aggressive acquiring assets or do you just want to redeploy the MOB disposition proceeds?","James Connor","Well, Mike, we're always looking for value added acquisitions offered at acquisition opportunities. I think, given the cap rates have continued to compress, you'll likely see a slowdown in 2018. We are not giving guidance just yet, but I think logically as long as our development pipeline continues to be as large it is, and we can create substantially higher margins. I think you'll see us scale back a little on the acquisitions side, continue to look for vale add place, but try and fund most of the funnel, most of the proceeds into development opportunities.","Michael Carroll","Okay, then what's the lease up expectations on completing these acquisitions of the development projects, does that going to - how many - how long is it going to take?","James Connor","Yeah Mike, we generally underwrite around a year on average to lease up our spec element and\/or spec acquisitions, I would tell you over the past 12 months or so, just given market conditions, we've been doing a lot better than that, but when we do or disclose underwriting yields, we're generally averaging about a year forl lease up.","Michael Carroll","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Yeah Jim, just looking at the sort of lease roll, how much harder do you think you can push lease roll over's, even at the expanse of retention?","James Connor","Manny, that's a very good topic around here, I think we like many of our peers had said, we are going to continue to try and push even more at the expense of some our retention. We were at about 70% this quarter, 70.1 I think, which is down a little bit for us. But I think in reality when you got basically 4.5% vacancy across the country, there aren't a lot of alternatives like everybody is - I think the opportunity to put up some pretty good rent growth numbers, so we keep pushing.","Manny Korchman","That was all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Ki Bin Kim. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks, good morning everyone or good afternoon. I had a couple of quick questions on your capital deployment. So, what are the things that's driving you to buy the key closer markets and I know, that's not a specific to Duke and other guys are doing it. But, what about buying in LA or New Jersey at mid to high four cap raisers, that's much more appealing versus buying something like in Chicago or Atlanta or Indianapolis at higher cap rate.","James Connor","Well, Ki Bin, there's a couple of reasons, let me answer I think your second point first which is Chicago or Dallas or Atlanta, we've been in those markets for a substantial period of time and we have a very large possession approximately 15 million square feet in each of those markets. We much rather redeploy our capital there into development, where we are making substantially better margins, we've got land and development teams on the ground there. One of the things that we identified as our need to grow in these Tier 1 high barrier markets and that's really the region you'll see us focusing our investment dollars in those markets. And those are the markets that will consistently give you, the highest rent growth and the lowest occupancy just simply because of the barriers to entry. And we found that opportunity in the Bridge portfolio and a couple of the other assets that we've acquired this year, to do just that, to redeploy capital into really good, brand new, high quality state of the art industrial in three high barrier locations. And it's very unusual to buy a portfolio of that size and not have to get some second, third tier markets. So, when the opportunity presented itself, the timing lined up really well with our MOB sale and we decided to step up aggressively. And as Nick alluded to in his comments, from the time we've shaken hands in April of this year, we continue to see cap rates compress and we continue to see rents grow. So, my expectation is at the end of the day we'll beat our projected underwriting when we get these buildings, all these buildings in service and all these buildings built and fully leased up.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, and if I look at your lease expiration schedule, compared to peers obviously a little bit lower, and some where it does create a little more challenge in terms of keeping up the things for NOI grow phase right because you just have less expiry. As part of the reason you have less expiration, just because lots of assets that you own today are development related assets, were the lease term is originally just much longer or have you guys still signing a longer leases, so that you might be able to change more proactively.","James Connor","Your observation is absolutely correct, in a rising market like this, we would love to have a little bit more space available to be able to push rents, as some of our peers do. But you are absolutely right, when you look at the makeup of our portfolio which is primarily larger bulk buildings, many which would run as a result of our development activity, ten year leases in the case of our million square foot facilities 15 year leases. We are happy to lock in that income with goods annual rent escalations built in, but the downside of that is, it times like this, you don't have as much roll. That's unfortunate. We've talked about that at meetings and conversations with our investors in the past. We are working diligently to engage anybody we can and early renew people and continue to push rents. And I think our guys have done a nice job at that. But I think, on the defensive, this portfolio, will outperform our peers over the long haul because we've got a lot less downside risk, given the quality of the buildings, given the length of the lease term and the annual escalations we've got built in. So, little tough today in the short term, but long term will be fine.","Nick Anthony","Yeah Ki Bin, I would just add one more thing to that. The tenants that we have in these newer bigger buildings, generally want the longer lease terms as well, so they will simply follow these terms and most certainly not to outturn our people to those [indiscernible] right now, thinking of the cycle.","Ki Bin Kim","Yeah, I get that. You can win on both sides. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Jeremy Metz. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey guys, Jim I just want to go back quickly in acquisition, you mentioned obviously, you signed the Bridge portfolio during April, and since that time you've seen a lot, better rent growth, Nick mentioned it earlier, so just managing to put an offside buyers on those expected yield. So, I guess is that the right way, to think about this, in current expectations or maybe just in-conservative at this point, may be settling how much rank guards were you underwriting to get to those yields that's so they are actually higher now, given what we've seen on rent side.","James Connor","Well, so let me clarify couple of points, when we agreed with DEO and we underwrite the DEO, the terms of the DEO and our underwriting is frozen at that time. So, as we said, we agreed to terms on the Bridge portfolio in April, and those are the reported numbers that we put out. We know that the rents have continued to grow, and our internal expectations. All set, we will sign those leases at higher rates. We are not re-publicizing or re-evaluating the underwriting., we're going with the original underwriting that we have, which is why sitting here today we are fairly comfortable we're going to beat those expectations by leasing it up sooner or leasing it up at higher rents.","Nick Anthony","Yeah, in the 300,000 square feet that we have is so far has done about that performer, so that is optimistic.","James Connor","And that consistent journey you probably underwrite in respective element as well. And we do our course effective element; we also come to space with base run, we don't think future anticipate rental growth in those yield and we hope we get it and in often cases, we do the best we have in underwriting.","Nick Anthony","Which is still the case on the two land parcels.","Jeremy Metz","Very good, appreciate the clarity guys. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we have the line of John Guinee. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great, I am looking at your balance sheet, Jim and Mark and there must be a typo, because you are down to a $140 million of undeveloped land, and another 27 non-strategic land. Are those accurate numbers?","James Connor","Yes, they are John, I think in total, we are under 200 million - for the first time anybody around here can remember and you might think that inventory is getting too low. We've actually acquired a 120 million of land this year; we've just put more of it into production than we originally anticipated, so, in most markets, we are out looking to take down additional land.","John Guinee","And when this all set and done, how is land - land is plug figure on any development budget? What are people underwriting their development pro forma in order to arrive at a land value, these days?","James Connor","Well, John I guess it depends, who's doing the underwriting and what their alternate goal is. You know, we are trying to create as much value for the shareholders over the long term as possible. If you are a small local developer, that's looking to sell the building either on substantial completion or lease it, you can probably live on much than a margin, so, it's all driven by the expected margin you want to receive at the end of the day, which you can prepare to pay for the land. And, we've commented before, land is more challenging today and it's more expensive and the entitlement and approval processes is more costly and time killing. So, we have to look at a lot of land sites and do a lot of homework for everyone that we do require and ultimately put into production, because there's a lot of challenging sites out there, that you can't opt out.","John Guinee","Yeah, the reason I asked the question and then on wealth, is that your development yield for '17 are still 68, 66 cash and 7 GAAP, which seems extraordinarily high, given what we are hearing is going on in the land evaluation world. Is this employing legacy land or is this all new land recently purchased at market?","James Connor","Well, John thank you for the compliment, we start to think that was a compliment. Well, it's a combination of both, there is some legacy land in there, we probably had on the books, could be as long as 10 years I suppose, but a lot of the land is land is that we had just bought, that virtually never hits the box, because its acquired, it's put into production, inside of the same quarter. And, you know, we've talked about, points about this in years gone by, but, you know part of our goals is stand around with not to mass of $ 1 billion land portion, but to take land down in much smaller pieces and put it into production. And, if somebody wants to buy a piece of land and they can't commit to putting a building a production inside the first year, then our attitude is you don't really need the land. So, it's combination of having change to the culture and some development activities by our local teams that I may have forgotten.","John Guinee","Great, thank you, talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you, Jim you had commented on the equilibrium getting pushed out to sometime in '18, do you have high visibility on that number or is it just because it's next year not this year. And how do you talk about the risks, could it even be '19 at this point?","James Connor","It certainly could be, but our visibility is the same as yours. We get market data from the, all the service companies CBRE, JLL & Cushman plus the market reconnaissance we get from our own development and leasing teams around the country. I'm looking at you know, demand exceeding supply by 10 to 25 billion square feet this year, looking at what the quarter by quarter numbers had been. I think, while we see the gap narrow from three years ago, that's why I'm saying, I think that will be the earliest it will be in mid 18. But, you know if we can actually do something right, and we as the collective we in this country and we can actually maybe stimulate GDP growth and keeping the subtle going on a little longer. You're absolutely right; it could easily be '19 or '20. And another point that I've made about equilibrium, equilibrium isn't necessarily a bad thing particularly when you reach equilibrium at 4.5% vacancy.","Jamie Feldman","Okay and then maybe your question we get a lot is just where are the restrictions on new development? Can you just, I know that your conversation changes now, to talk about the challenges of getting land, but, maybe just a frame how hardly it really is, to find new land sites, and get development in the process or maybe that's eased up more recently, if you could talk about that?","James Connor","No, I said we wouldn't tell you it's eased up, I think everybody is encouraged by the strong numbers that everybody continues to report quarter after quarter, and the market dynamics that we are seeing out there, continued absorption. You know from many of our customers that, there are real shortages of available stays around the country. So, people are continuing to build which is why you'll see the supplies of equation probably in the year and the 190 may be ups up to 200 millions of forfeit of new supply this year. But the demands are it's just significantly up pacing it, and our guys do a pretty good job of diligently being outsourcing land and being able to put that into production pretty quickly. We also, internally we do, we also get a jumpstart, we got infrastructure and pads and things like that, so that we show it at the relevant time, up on some projects. And that's, those are some of the things that keep us more competitive on the building the suite as opposed to some of our working building competitors that have to go out to acquire site. You know, we've got site that's ready to go, designed pad built and we can deliver building inside of a 120 days.","Jamie Feldman","Okay thank you.","Operator","And next we have the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you, I was hoping to get a dig into the Bridge profile more detail, I know, you talked of the stabilized yields the portfolio, replicating the cap rate on the medical office portfolio sale? Is that the cap rate that your team quoted when that tells the price, worth the buyer quoted?","James Connor","No, we have our own sale numbers Eric. So, each one is a fourth sense, we have a watch at great news Eric.","Eric Frankel","Understood, understood thank you, I appreciate that. And then the 70% previous what I didn't appreciate when the sales, acquisitions was announced was that include the two land purchases, the ones that the ones that will get without, I can understand why they are in pretty tight market. Is that included in the pre-leasing number though, the two building to be built?","Nick Anthony","No, Eric. The land parcels are not included in that previous numbers.","Eric Frankel","It's not, okay but effectively more at 40% to 50% call it pre-lease or maybe more than 50% pre-lease if you include that.","Nick Anthony","Perhaps this land parcel is not placed in service until the fourth quarter of next year.","Eric Frankel","Okay, okay so, and is there the yield numbers for those are not included in the medical office comparable year?","James Connor","They are not included. We are just - they are just like any other portfolio land, that we would go out and which we are doing overtime now and then starting development right away. So, that'll be in our development numbers, once they get started.","Eric Frankel","Okay, I think the only other resource to confusion is related to the development land as we use the map, and how much we are allocating to both tranches. I'm getting to an estimated value of roughly a $185 million for those two developed parcels and you're paying $62 million of land that looks like a $140 per square foot for the construction cost. So, I'm just trying to understand about the value number and not the construction cost number, that 185 that I'm computing, and if my numbers are just completely screwing?","Mark Denien","It's a value on the land and construction cost on the construction cost.","Eric Frankel","Construction cost seems expensive, a $140 to an affordable square foot, is there like a lot of inside work we have to do, or it's just a \u2013.","Nick Anthony","Yes, there's a lot of side work and these are in very tight markets, one of them in the New York suburb and the other one is Midland on a very short note.","Eric Frankel","Right a bit construction causes, and that's different generally between those areas in any developed country, I'd like also some extraordinary light mannerism or something. But is there something there that I'm missing?","Nick Anthony","But there's also side work involved.","Eric Frankel","Okay, okay. I will jump back in the queue, I'm sure you'll have a lot more questions, thank you.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Rich Anderson. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","Thanks, good afternoon, on the hhgregg you mentioned you got one of the three one of the 748, and you mentioned also there's been 80 basis point head to the same store number. Jim, you mentioned also, that you relieved at higher rates, can you give some color on how much higher and how long those lines? Does that mean in 80 that will have a full reversal of the same store impact, such that it won't be an 8 basis point head but maybe a 100 basis point opportunity or upside?","James Connor","Well, let me try to cover part of that, which I think we'll have a full reversal for the second half of '18 because essentially we are looking at the last half of '18 will cover no rent from those buildings. And we got leases either signed or out signature right now, such that rents will come in from all the spaces like early '18. So, when you get into the last half of '18, you will recover all of that 80 basis points decline, then you should have a little bit of decline. But on a full year basis, you are going to be pretty close so to even. So, we did have five months with the rent from the hhgregg buildings in the first half of this year. I would say the wrinkles on those three deals, we haven't got a couple of them signed yet, they're out for signature, but it's going to be pretty close to the average rent falls closing on everything else in our portfolio, we haven't run so close.","Rich Anderson","Okay, alright got you. Second short question is on the special dividend, you said in the range of what you said, could you say if you are tethering towards the $0.70 or the $1.15 based on what's going on within the company?","Mark Denien","If you have an hour and a half to listen to our catch skies [ph] -","Rich Anderson","I do, go ahead, I am ready, good.","Mark Denien","I am joking; I think it's going to be probably pretty close to the middle over range. I would call it middle range, or may be lower half, but at least, we still got some moving pieces out there from these 1031 exchanges, which is you know, pretty high capital that what we have lined up, that's going to happen, but we just need some passage of time, to get a couple of things knocked off the list. And then hopefully, later in November we'll be able to disclose something, but I think it will be not too far from the middle point range.","Rich Anderson","Okay, great thanks, very much.","Operator","Next, we'll go on to Michael Mueller. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Yeah hi, just a quick question on Bridge. The 70% pre-lease number when does most of that become rent paying and\/or start to impact the financials?","Nick Anthony","A lot of it is - now, there will be a couple of months of burn outs, but by the end of the year, most of them will paying rent on 70%.","Michael Mueller","Got it, and then what's the anticipation for Tranch 2, when that comes on?","Nick Anthony","We're actually closed on two developments yesterday and we expect to close the rest in the fourth quarter.","James Connor","Yeah towards I would say, Michael, towards the end of the fourth quarter.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay, that was it. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Richard Schaller [ph]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good afternoon guys, just looking at the assets that you've completed on the development pipeline, high quality big box assets, what are your thoughts about taking some of these to market with cap rates compressing, are you guys still going to focus on similar non-core industrial asset sales.","James Connor","Hello Richard, I'll start and then Nick can chime in, so historically we've got a bit of that, we've taken some chips of the table so to speak, we've sold you know couple of the big Amazon deals and some others, with all this possessions we've done this year and having to pay special dividend. You know we are really looking to minimize that, we are in the final stages of putting together the disposition target list for next year. And again, you know managing that against, redeployment of capital and the special dividends. So, for a miracle we can give you any local call around the other markets or things like that.","Nick Anthony","Yeah, they put a lot of value creation on the development pipeline, but for the most part, we are just looking at it, in improved in non-strategic asset account forward in the market place and frankly se are seeing great pricing invests for non-strategic markets as a well.","Unidentified Analyst","That's helpful, thanks guys and on last quick question for me, I noted ion the real estate alert this week that CABED [ph] is bringing 21 million square foot, warehouse portfolio, this prices may be 1.8 billion or larger? Is it something that you guys are taking a look at or is that just too big, on the acquisitions focus on the development pipeline from here?","James Connor","Well, we look at everything obviously, just to stay abreast of what's going on in the marketplace and I would tell you given our size, I don't personally I don't think it's too big. I think when you look at the makeup of the markets and what percentage of the access are in the high barrier tier 1 market and the tier 1 markets, it' about maybe 25%, I know the high barrier tier 1was 17%, it's probably not the best fit for us. By coincidence there are some assets in there that that we sold them in the last five years, I don't generally like to buy stuff back at premiums. So, it's probably not a real good idea.","Unidentified Analyst","Sure, sounds good, thanks guys.","Operator","[Operator instructions] we'll now go back to line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman, here. So, Jim, I don't know, maybe a theoretical I guess it's a theoretical question, but if you impact April, you weren't going to plan on sudden medical office and Bridge portfolio came to you, would you've done it at that pricing and issued equity to fund it?","James Connor","I think so Michael, absolutely. I mean, if you look at what we're strategically trying to do, grow in the high barrier tier 1 markets and quality of this portfolio and what's happened since then absolutely we buy it.","Michael Bilerman","And then would you say the same thing going forward, and using your equity currency and issuing equity to buy assets or continue that as a, I recon as a catalog portfolio that does not mean, but given the cap rate environment, there's probably a lot more stuff that's going to come out of the good work given the pricing levels especially your office [indiscernible]. Would you entertain using your cost of equity? You sold the medical office at unbelievable price and exited out of that, and used that as your proceeds to rotate, de-lever, give money back to shareholders and invest in these Bridge assets. I'm just curious how do you think - what your cadence will be in using your common equity to further this expansion?","James Connor","Michael, we will certainly look at it, we are trading at a premium to NAV, we like generally where the price is. I liked it little better two weeks ago then this morning, but generally if the quality assets and the markets that they are in, fit our profile and we are comfortable that we're not overpaying and that we could lease for a long term and continue to grow rents with annual escalations, we would certainly think about it.","Michael Bilerman","And then did Stockert actually attend the board meeting yesterday or you put-on, as he physically gone through a process?","James Connor","Is this one of those highly theoretical questions?","Michael Bilerman","No, no I'm just, I'm just curious - I mean, I'm curious what his mind set is? Having lost the company seventeen years ago, right, coming back in, his perception is what it was versus what it is, is just a really interesting thing to have? And I'm sure if Ray Weeks came back, he would have a pretty interesting view of where this combined company is, sitting by the office assets, but.","James Connor","Yes, David did attend the meeting; our crack is when we are bringing a new director on, is we do invite them to that first meeting even though they are not officially on the board, they don't have the opportunity to vote, but we do get them inducted in, so Dave in fact was here yesterday and it's great to welcome him back. He's been gone for 17 years.","Michael Bilerman","And is there anything, any sort of insight that he was able to bring to the table, having the perspective - having been in the business a long time ago and sort of seeing where the company in the industry is today?","James Connor","We brought Dave on not because of his history with the company 17 to 20 years ago, but for his more recent experience running post, his M&A experience, his perspective on corporate governance, so that's really what we look at in terms of Dave's skills to round at our board. Is to give us a little more public company real state CEO perspective and we think he's going to be a great addition.","Michael Bilerman","Last question, any purchase options, how many sort of exists within the portfolio? Was that some name should be mindful of at all?","James Connor","Very, very few, I would tell you that we probably had about one a year exercise for the last three years. So, we are generally not good at giving purchase options.","Michael Bilerman","Yeah, I didn't know if any of these merchant developers may have given that right - and from the leases, [indiscernible] you've inherited more?","James Connor","No, that really impedes the value for a buyer, ourselves included, if somebody's built that into the deal, so we and most of our competitors find that pretty difficult, find that pretty hard.","Operator","And next we have the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you, just a follow-up here. So, you're looking at your guidance for 700 million to 9000 million of starts in '17. When you look around your markets, do you think that's the number you can hit again next year?","James Connor","I think if market fundamentals are consistent next year with what they did this year, and what our outlook is, yeah, I think that's realistic. If you look a little higher, then our last few years we've been running probably closer to 700, the last few years. But we've been able to rent a few more build-to-suits and our leasing has been a little bit better than we expected. So, I think that's why we were able to increase our guidance at the July meeting. That helps.","Jamie Feldman","Yeah, definitely and what do you - of the starts you have this year, what percentage is the build-to-suit and do you think that goes up or down next year.","James Connor","I don't have that handy Jamie, we just track the per-lease percentage of build-to-suits partially pre-lease buildings and then leasing is done while the buildings are under construction is included in that 63%. My guess of it is probably 40% to 45%.","Jamie Feldman","Anything that's sustainable?","James Connor","What's that?","Jamie Feldman","Anything that's sustainable into next year?","James Connor","Yeah, we are, you go back and look at the last three or four years, the reason our preleasing percentage has been as high as it has and higher than most of our peers is because of our build-to-suit activity. That's good land and the quality of the people that we've got on the ground, as opposed to spec development. We've consistently told our investors, we are going to keep that pre-leasing percentage about 50% and being able to do build-to-suits and substantially pre-lease buildings certainly helps that.","Jamie Feldman","Okay and then thinking about the building blocks for next year, the color on hhgregg was helpful, but did you say 3% advance for the Bridge portfolio or across the entire portfolio, on a cash basis.","James Connor","Jamie, that's consistent with both today, that's what we are getting on Bridge, that's what we're getting really everywhere today. Our existing portfolio is close to the 22 in the quarter, the legacy leases within our portfolio, we average about two quarter, obviously that average is trending up a little every day as we keep building leases at three.","Jamie Feldman","And what would you say is the blend for the entire portfolio, closer to like 275?","James Connor","No, no right now, it's a two and a quarter today, so it all depends on leasing activity from here until whenever you're looking at it, but on a 130 million square feet, it will take a while to move at 75 basis points.","Jamie Feldman","Got it okay and then what do you think your mark-to-market is for your '18 expiration?","James Connor","For '18, it's probably going to be somewhere to what we are at today, in fact in the high teens.","Jamie Feldman","Oaky and then Ray, you feel like you are pretty fully occupied at this point, right?","Unidentified Company Representative","I think so, it's hard. As Jim said, our same property occupancy went down to 97.5% or whatever it is, it went down 30 basis points. So, I think on what I would call that stabilized portfolio, 124, but we do have a lot of upsides in the newer development and acquisition properties. That's just putting our overall occupancy down. So, I think we are a little bit different than a lot of peers, only about 80% to 83% of our NOIs in that same property pool. We had a lot bigger pool of these newer properties to have a lot of NOI outside. So, I wouldn't say we are full up on occupancy overall, we're probably full up on occupancy on our current same property. That makes sense.","Jamie Feldman","Yeah that makes a lot of sense. Okay great thank you.","Operator","[Operator instructions] we'll next go to the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you, I'll try to keep this brief. Just in the same store portfolio, I know the expense growth was pretty meaningful. Can you just comment on that trend and obviously I assume that the rapid new lease and net lease, I can understand that mechanically, how that works with high expanse growth and how it refines to revenue growth in this quarter. Is there a mismatch in terms of timing?","James Connor","I didn't hear your first query, so, you're asking about the entries in seeing property expenses?","Eric Frankel","Yes, I apologize if they would say it didn't come through.","James Connor","No, I just didn't hear. So, it's really mainly around real estate taxes. A little bit of an increase this quarter from assessments as you would expect probably, but on top of that even more of it because of some refunds we got in the prior period. And I would suggest what's driving a pretty big, whatever it is, 4.5% give or take increase in expenses. It's really real estate tax related. The refund over the prior year and upward assessments in the current year has very little impact on overall NOI because all of that is 98% occupancy level give or take, whether it's a refund or pass back to the tenant, it's an increase in expense, we generally get it back from the tenant, so it has very normal impact on NOI. You'll see a revenue number that went up a lot lower than the expense number and that's just a shear factor of the denominator and the expenses being a lot more together, call a million dollar change in expenses divided by the expense number as a lot higher percent in that same million dollar change on a higher revenue number. So, that was the little bit of a disconnect on the percentages, but I would tell you, it was very negligible on overall NOI.","Eric Frankel","Okay, I'll keep to one here. Nick, just related to hhgregg, any other tenant credit concerns just in terms of bankruptcy, has anyone - it's essentially lengthy watch list or any other proxy for measuring credit quality that we should know about?","James Connor","Well, we have a very expensive for rating the credit and tracking, anybody that will be concerned about. We always wanted, we've talked about this before, is we have a Sirius lease in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania and we are all watching Sirius. The good news for us it's the appliance division, which is probably the only division inside the Sirius that makes money. So, we've had them on the watch list, but beyond that we are in really good shape.","Eric Frankel","Is it Barnton [ph] in your portfolio though too?","James Connor","Barnton is in our portfolio.","Eric Frankel","Okay. That's it from me, thanks guys.","Operator","At this point, we actually have no further questions here in queue for us.","James Connor","I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to re-convening during our fourth quarter and full year call generally scheduled the same time on Thursday February 1, 2018. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for this afternoon. We thank you very much for your participation and for using our Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect."],"7852":["Duke Realty Corporation (NYSE:DRE) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 25, 2013  2:30 PM ET","Executives","","Ron Hubbard \u2013 President","Denny Oklak \u2013 Chairman and CEO","Christie Kelly \u2013 EVP and CFO","Analysts","","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Scott O\u2019Donnell","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Duke Realty First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions and answers with instructions given at that time.","(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, Allan. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are, Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Denien, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2012 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments during the first quarter in both our operational and asset strategies. Christie will then address our first quarter financial performance and the progress on our capital strategy.","We followed up the positive momentum from 2012 and are off to a great start for 2013 on all fronts. We signed 6.3 million square feet of leases in the first quarter and finished the first quarter at a 91.8% overall occupancy rate which includes projects under development.","We started $139 million of new development projects comprised of $40 million of bulk industrial, $59 million of medical office and $40 million suburban office project. Six of our seven new development starts are 100% a pre-leased while one project is a speculative start on our land in Houston which has strong fundamentals.","I\u2019ll touch on the developments in a little more detail shortly. We continue to make progress on our asset repositioning strategy during the quarter with $223 million of proceeds generated from dispositions of primarily suburban office property as well as $30 million of acquisitions.","On the capital front, we\u2019ve raised over $820 million of equity and debt that was used for deleveraging and prefunding our May debt maturities. The redemption of the $170 million, 8.375% preferred O shares together with the $250 million unsecured debt offering issued in an effective interest rate of 3.72% will save the company nearly $22 million in annual interest and dividend cost on an ongoing basis. Christie will speak more in depth on our capital activities in a moment.","From a macroeconomic perspective, the economy appears on track for another slow year of economic growth with current GDP expectations between 2% and 3% range. Even with modest growth, the demand drivers in the industrial sector remains solid with first quarter net absorption of 32 million square feet on a national basis following up on the fourth quarter of 2012 at 55 million square feet which was the highest quarter in five years.","This positive activity continues across most major distribution markets with nearly 80% of the top markets recording vacancy drops the most widespread improvement in a decade. The Class A national vacancy is now in the 9% range. The tightening of key industrial market fundamentals together with trends in e-commerce and supply chain modernization should go very well for value creation opportunities from our strategic land bank, and best in class development platform.","The healthcare industry trends that are driving strong demand for new modern design outpatient space remained very strong. Our team continues to be selected as one of the premier new facility providers to leading health systems across the country with a steady pipeline of deals.","The suburban office sector continues to be sluggish in most markets though there are pockets where absorption is improving. The office market fundamental still favored the tenant in TIs and concession remains above the long term averages. Even so, the availability of debt at historically low rates has increased investor appetite for suburban office transaction which gives us optimism in executing our office disposition plans for this year.","Turning to operations, we had a solid quarter of leasing at 6.3 million square feet. We ended the quarter with overall occupancy at 91.8%. Occupancy dropped approximately 60 basis points from the end of the year, and a couple of factors led to this decrease. First, the sale of Captrust Tower and Chambers Street portfolio which we discussed in January and disclosed in the presentation we posted on our website in March were approximately 98% occupied on combined basis.","Second, we had a few larger industrial leases expire right at the end of the quarter as anticipated in our annual average in service occupancy guidance. Activity remains strong and we anticipate occupancy to head back up in the second quarter. These larger explorations also abnormally push down our tenant retention for the quarter to 49%. However, I\u2019m pleased to note that few of these vacancies created by the expiring leases were immediately backfilled and pipeline of prospects for the remaining vacant spaces is strong.","Specifically two large explorations total 1.2 million square feet yet two new leases were signed with different tenants who immediately backfill approximately 901,000 square feet of that space. Rental rate growth and renewals continue to be positive in most markets at a little under 2% overall across the portfolio with the trend line from last year continuing to move upward.","With respect to same property performance, we achieved positive same property NOI growth for the 12 months and three months ended March 31 of 2.4% and 2.6% respectively. We expect the pace of same property growth moderate over the next few quarters given the expected slower pace of occupancy gains and modest rental rate growth that\u2019s anticipated.","Now let me touch on some of the key activity with any of these product types for the quarter. With respect to leasing in our industrial portfolio we do continue to see fundamentals improved with the completion of nearly 3.1 million square feet of new industrial leases and about 2 million square feet of renewal leases. Both industrial in-service occupancy at the end of the quarter dipped to 93.6% roughly 90 basis points below the previous quarter and at a steady level compare to a year ago.","As noted we have some larger anticipated lease expirations in our industrial portfolio, but strong leasing backfill the number of those. Some of our larger lease deals include a 7,400 square foot expansion in renewal lease across two facilities for Netrada in Cincinnati; a 437,000 square foot lease with a major retailer in Groveport Commerce Center in Columbus and a 500,000 square foot lease with Home Depot in Savannah.","In the medical office portfolio, we had a solid quarter with nearly 250,000 square feet of new and renewal leases signed. The office leasing environment continues to be challenging across most markets but we did have a solid quarter of leasing with nearly 1.1 million square feet of new and renewal leases signed.","In our Sam Houston Crossing speculative office project in Houston we have now signed two leases, which bring the lease percentage to 91% for this project that will open later this year. We had $223 million of dispositions during the quarter. Most of the proceeds came from the sale of our interest in two suburban office joint ventures which we mentioned in January. We also sold a couple of non-strategic medical facilities in a small flex portfolio.","Our only acquisitions during the quarter were medical office building in Tampa which we bought from an existing customer and our partner\u2019s 50% interest in a fully leased industrial building in Indianapolis.","Yesterday, we announced two significant and strategically important transactions that are now under contract for. First, we\u2019re selling our Pembroke Gardens Retail Center in South Florida in accordance with our strategy to dispose of our remaining retail assets. This project is in a great location, on Interstate 75 in West Broward County and has performed extremely well.","Interest in this center was high and the sales price will be $188 million or $480 per square foot.","This sale will result in a significant gain that we reported in the second quarter and we expect the sale to close next week. The second transaction we announced is the acquisition of the bulk industrial portfolio from affiliates of USA Real Estate which has recently been reported by others outside of Duke Realty. This $311 million acquisition include eight modern bulk industrial facilities over 4.8 million square feet in key distribution markets including California, Eastern Pennsylvania and Houston.","The portfolio is 100% leased to major retail tenants such as Home Depot, Kimberly-Clark and Jo-Ann stores. We expect this transaction to close in May. These two transactions will put us even closer to our asset allocation goal of 60% bulk industrial, 25% suburban office and 15% medical office. We will report cap rate ranges on these transactions in our second quarter numbers but let me say that in-place cap rate on our retail sale is over 100 basis points lower than the yield we\u2019ll receive on our industrial acquisition so this is a great trade for us.","We also had an excellent quarter on new development starts, the starts include seven projects again with an estimated total project of about $140 million. We started a 680,000 square foot build-to-suit bulk industrial facility in Nashville on our Park 100 plan or Park 840 land \u2013 excuse me. The facility will be 100% leased to Starbucks for seven-and-half years.","We also started a 240,000 square foot spec industrial development in Houston on our Point North land which is located in the airport submarket where vacancy is in the 5% range. We also began a 200,000 square foot office built-to-suit in Dallas, also in our land at Duke Bridges Corporate Park. The project is 100% preleased to a healthcare services firm for a term of 16 years.","Finally, we started to develop four build-to-suit, 100% preleased medical facilities during the quarter. Three of the facilities are with affiliates of Baylor Health Care, totaling 113,000 square feet with lease terms of 15 years. I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019ve now engaged in 10 development deals with Baylor Health Care since 2009. The final healthcare development was a 35,000 square foot project in Waco Texas with Scott & White Healthcare. This is our fourth development project with Scott & White.","Overall, our first quarter development starts with 81% preleased and are projected to have a stabilized yield of 8.0%. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the new development business generated year-to-date, again our best-in-class development platform.","Our total development pipeline as of March 31 now stands at 5.1 million square feet, totaling $621 million of stabilized cost. We are projecting a weighted average yield over the initial lease term of 8.2% on these projects. The development pipeline and strategic land bank are key growth driver for Duke Realty and we\u2019re optimistic about being able to execute on additional build-to-suit and select respective development opportunities.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Christie, to discuss our financial results and capital plans.","Christie Kelly","Thanks Denny. And good afternoon everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide an update on our first quarter financial performance as well as the progress on our capital strategy. Our first quarter Core FFO was $0.26 per share compared to $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2012. The slightly lower Core FFO was a result of temporary dilution due to not being immediately able to utilize the proceeds from our previously discussed 41.4 million share equity offering executed in early January.","Core FFO for the first quarter of 2013 in comparison to 2012 of $0.24 represents an 8.3% positive year-over-year growth rate that was primarily attributable to improved occupancy and same-property performance, as well as due to lower preferred dividends.","We generated $0.23 per share in AFFO in the first quarter of 2013, which translates to a payout ratio of less than 74% compared to $0.21 per share in AFFO for the fourth quarter of 2012.","Taking a look at AFFO for the first quarter of 2013 in comparison to $0.20 from the first quarter of 2012 represents a 15% positive year-over-year growth rate. Again, that was primarily attributable to improved occupancy and same-property performance, as well as due to lower preferred dividends.","As Denny mentioned, our leasing volume for the quarter was strong. And in summary, our operating results for the quarter were outstanding and we look forward to continued solid results throughout the rest of the year.","Turning to the capital side of our business, we executed significant transactions during the quarter, to build our track record of generating low cost capital from multiple sources.","As we discussed last January, we generated $572 million in proceeds from our $41.4 million share following equity offering. We used a portion of these proceeds to redeem our 8.375% Series M preferred shares, which we would use our dividend commitments by nearly $15 million annually, on an ongoing basis.","We enjoyed a successful quarter, in terms of generating capital from asset dispositions, receiving $223 million in proceeds from asset sales. In order to pre fund our May unsecured debt maturity, we opportunistically capped the unsecured market in mid March. We issued $250 million of tenured bond and an effective interest rate of 3.72%, a record low rate for Duke Realty.","After being used to refinance a portion of our May maturities, this lower rate offering will save us nearly $7 million annually on an ongoing basis. As a result of our capital raising activities, we ended the first quarter with $307 million in cash which when coupled with an unsecured term loan, we will close at the beginning of May, will leave us with more than sufficient liquidity for the repayment of our $425 million of unsecured debt due this mid May.","Additionally, the post quarter activity that Denny mentioned represented by the expected USAA acquisition and Pembroke disposition, is an excellent example of us funding acquisitions with dispositions accretive.","I will conclude by saying that I\u2019m extremely pleased with the results for the quarter and we will continue to execute on all aspects of our strategy.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over Dennis.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Christie. Yesterday, we also reaffirmed our guidance of FFO for 2013 of $1.03 to $1.11 per share. In closing, after a solid quarter, we believe our value creation story is gaining momentum as our operations continue to show strong occupancy and modest rent growth. Our capital raising continues to be highly efficient and consistent with our delever leveraging plans. Our asset repositioning is in the process of taking another big leap with the first quarter close dispositions and the pending Pembroke in U.S.A. transactions, which we believe are very accretive to our net asset value.","Finally, the development platform engine and strategic land bank are also very well positioned to take advantage of solid growth opportunities for 2013 and beyond. Thank you again for your support of Duke Realty and now we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll first go to the line of Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good afternoon. Dennis, you guys on the development pipeline, the yields seem like they\u2019re getting better, at the same time you sort of look at the overall environment and cap rates are coming down. It seems like they\u2019re would be more likely to be pressure on development yields as opposed to development yields moving up. So, are there something specific that\u2019s going on with the development or are there any improvement dollars that are getting amortized that are driving yields up? Or you\u2019re just getting better economics?","Denny Oklak","Generally, I think we are getting better economics right now and it\u2019s really it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the amortization when you look at those projects that we talked about this quarter for sure and I would say it\u2019s a couple of things going on. One, obviously about 50% roughly, 45%, 50% of our starts this quarter were in the healthcare area. Again a very significantly driven business, driven on relationships and so we have great relationships as I mentioned with Baylor and Scott & White.","So clearly I think that our development yields are pretty competitive but it\u2019s also relationship driven and I think that was part of it. When you look at the build-to-suit opportunities we have on the office side yields are little higher because we\u2019re deploying our land and I would say the same with the industrial build-to-suits that we\u2019re accomplishing today.","So I think that\u2019s another key driver as the very good basis that we have in a lot of our lands. So suffice to say I agree with your comments Brendan and I think we\u2019re creating a lot of value through that development pipeline right now.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then the occupancy drop in the quarter I guess just listening to your comments it sounds like that happened at the end of the quarter. So I guess there probably wasn\u2019t an impact if I\u2019m taking about that correctly there probably wasn\u2019t an impact on NOI in the quarter.","But as we look out over the next few quarters for the year, how do you think occupancy trends? Because I guess as it stands now you\u2019re at sort of the low end of your average occupancy target for 2013.","Denny Oklak","Yes. I would say there\u2019s two things. Yes, there were a couple things that happened during the quarter. We had some expirations during the quarter, mid-quarter let\u2019s say, that we\u2019re pretty much immediately backfilled with tenants. But then we had a couple leases near the end of the quarter that expired but it didn\u2019t have a significant impact on first quarter NOI.","Unfortunately, we have to report on four specific days of the year. It\u2019s the way we report. So our occupancies always gone up and down a little bit, but we are sort of at the low point at the end of the first quarter, which is kind of where we thought we\u2019d be. So, we do have, as I\u2019ve said, there\u2019s a lot of good activity out there I think particularly on the industrial side, business is still strong. So I think you\u2019ll see \u2013 again see that occupancy continue to tick up throughout the rest of the year. And we\u2019ve looked at it pretty closely and we\u2019re still very comfortable with that occupancy range guidance that we gave for an average occupancy for the year, which was in the 92% to 94% range.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just the last I have is for Christie. I was looking at your same-store in the disclosure on page 21 in the supplemental. Am I reading it correctly that there\u2019s 180 basis point improvement in occupancy in the portfolio in the Q1 2013 versus Q1 2012?","Christie Kelly","Yes, you are, Brendon.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","So I guess was just trying to reconcile that with last year\u2019s occupancy numbers because I thought that they were \u2013 I didn\u2019t think the occupancy moved around that much and even with the adjustment in the pool that that would have happened. It didn\u2019t seem like there is a whole lot of movement. Is there something else going on there that maybe we don\u2019t see as we\u2019re thinking about the same-store pool last year versus this year?","Christie Kelly","No, nothing. We\u2019re just chatting quickly here amongst ourselves, Brendan, and there\u2019s nothing really of note.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. I mean \u2013 okay, maybe we can take that offline because, yes, I\u2019m just having trouble looking at last year\u2019s numbers and see whether there would be that much adjustment.","Christie Kelly","Sure. We can talk offline again.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, all right. Thanks.","Christie Kelly","No worries.","Operator","So next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Yes, good afternoon. I guess with regard to the development pipeline, Denny, you talked $620 million under construction today, a pretty good yield. Where do you see that going throughout the year and I guess as you\u2019re tie in to that, we\u2019ve seen especially on the industrial side more and more spec construction I guess which you under took a little bit this quarter. So I guess talk about where you see the overall pipeline going this year and how spec will play into that.","Denny Oklak","Sure, Dave. I think you\u2019re going to see that pipeline likely stay at a pretty stable level, that $500 million to $700 million range. We monitor that pretty closely and actually don\u2019t want to get that up too high as a percent of our overall asset base. However, I think the other thing strategically that you\u2019ve seen from us is almost \u2013 I mean a very significant portion of our development now is 100% pre-lease project. So we\u2019re so going to obviously try to finance many of those kind of accretive transactions as we can do.","We\u2019ve really been fairly limited on spec of the development far in this point in the cycle we\u2019ve really started four projects in the last, I would say, I guess it\u2019s been about 9 months, 9 to 12 months.","We started the one office building I mentioned in Houston which is now 91% leased and will open up in July. We started now three spec industrial buildings, one in Indianapolis, one in California and now just started one in Houston, and those total about 1.25 million square feet. We have no leases signed in those yet. We\u2019ve got a couple of proposals out on the California project. We\u2019ve on and off have some activity on the Indianapolis project, and then actually have some pretty good activity on the Houston project even though we\u2019re just really getting started and breaking ground on that one.","So I think you\u2019re going to see us still be fairly conservative on the spec development side. You might have seen other project or two before the end of the year but some of that is really going to depend too on how we do on leasing up some of those projects we\u2019ve already started. So that\u2019s really, I think, where we are, what we\u2019re looking at through the development side.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Thanks. And then maybe for Christie just in terms of it seems like the appetite for office asset is up in terms of your ability to sell, maybe talk about where some of the funding will come from throughout the course of the year if you can relate it to the asset sales program?","Christie Kelly","Sure, Dave. As it relates to the guidance in terms of office dispositions, we\u2019re a net disposer. this year as you look at the midpoint of the guidance. And we\u2019re on track to deliver as it relates those dispositions and our focus for this year is on as you stated Midwest office as well as retail as demonstrated by the Pembroke disposition.","Denny Oklak","Yes, just to add to that, if you look at our office disposition so far, it\u2019s the two bigger projects in Raleigh and then the Chambers Street portfolio, those were obviously really funded with mostly with institutional equity I would say. Some debt potentially, but most of it was equity and looking at some of the dispositions that we plan on the office side this year, I\u2019d think what we\u2019re likely to see again is secured debt, funding mortgage debt, my guess is you\u2019re not \u2013 it won\u2019t be consist of CMBS much, because they\u2019re going to probably smaller portfolios but I think we\u2019ve seen both the banks and the insurance companies fairly active in that market right now.","Christie Kelly","Yes, to the point that Denny\u2019s making, I mean that really is a change that we\u2019ve seen, over the past year and 18 months.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","And so I guess, should I take from those comments that if LTBs are generally higher than they had been and rates are lower, that the 7.75, wherever you were in this quarter for the office asset sales if fairly achievable for the remainder of the year?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think it\u2019s just depends on what the mix ends up being. Those were, I would say, probably on the lower end of the cap rates scale but I think you\u2019ll probably again see most of our office dispositions in that low to mid 8 kind of cap rate range on, again on in-place income.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Okay, great. Thanks.","Christie Kelly","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","We have a question in queue from the line Josh Attie. Please go ahead.","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. Good afternoon. Dennis, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that industrial fundamentals seem to be getting better, but for your portfolio same-store growth is going to moderate over the next two quarters. And I understand that some of your industrial properties are probably approaching high occupancy levels, but why would rent growth slow? And I guess what are some of the items do you expect to weigh on the same-store?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think when you look at the overall portfolio, I\u2019m just talking industrial, we\u2019ve been running at a pretty high occupancy level when you look at that. We\u2019ve grew almost to 95%. We dropped down a little bit under 94% at the end of this quarter because of the couple of lease expirations.","So, I think at this point in the economy and with the type of GDP growth we\u2019re looking at this year, that portfolio is probably the best we\u2019re going to get as probably 95%, 96% right now. I think when you look at it I think we will see modest rent growth across most of our industrial markets. But remember, a couple things I would say, one is, we\u2019ve only got I think 7% lease expirations of our overall portfolio for the rest of the year. So, we\u2019re not going to see tremendous growth out of that portfolio from rental increases on leases rolling.","And then second, we have solid growth in the industrial business because most of our leases today now and most of our markets have annual rent bumps. So those rent bumps were anywhere from probably 1.75% to 3% annual rent bumps.","So those will be helping to drive our continued same-property performance as long as we hold up where our occupancy points are anticipated.","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. That makes sense. And could you just tie that back to guidance? II know the guidance are based on a same-store growth range of 1% to 4% and you did 2.5% in the first quarter. So, it\u2019s going to moderate from there. Should we assume that both the same-store and the FFO guidance trend toward the lower end of the range?","Denny Oklak","No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean I think we\u2019re going to be sort of in the middle of that range. I would tell you what drives that number unfortunately more than others is just harder to predict is the dispositions. That\u2019s why we always have to give a wider range then maybe we would like because we just don\u2019t know which of our same properties were going to sell during the year. So, that can have an affect depending on which properties you should sell.","But sitting here today looking at what we sold so far and what we anticipate selling and then what we anticipate happening in the remaining portfolio, I think towards the middle of that range is a good number for this year.","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thanks very much.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Josh.","Christie Kelly","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","We\u2019ll next go to the line of Vincent Chao. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, everyone. Just a quick question. Dennis, you\u2019d alluded to the Chino project earlier in terms of some people kicking the tires. I was just wondering if you expand upon what kind of activity you\u2019re seeing there, types of users and maybe what\u2019s causing them or preventing them from pulling trigger on taking some space there.","Denny Oklak","Well, I think first a guy pointed out is we just really finished that up early this year probably in February sometimes. So, it\u2019s relatively still fresh on the market. Again, there\u2019s been good activity in the Southern California market. We\u2019ve seen a fair amount of leasing. I think if you look at the leasing statistics out there for the first quarter, some very good activity is what you\u2019ll see. It just depends in that situation. We\u2019re likely going to lease that building to a single user, in my opinion. That\u2019s a 420,000 square foot building which is kind of a sweet spot for a distributor, so it\u2019s just finding that right tenant.","We\u2019ve talked to a couple of retailers about it. We\u2019ve actually talked to a governmental agency about leasing the whole thing also. So I think it\u2019s fairly broad user base out there and we\u2019re very focused on getting that one leased up.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And at this point, is it relative you\u2019re underwriting for that project? Are you still on track or is it may be slipping a little bit in terms of timing?","Denny Oklak","No, it\u2019s not slipping.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Not slipping, okay. And then maybe if I could just ask a similar question just in terms of Atlanta overall, I mean obviously that\u2019s a tougher market but can you provide some color on what you\u2019re seeing there? It looks like one of the late quarter move-outs might have been from that market on the industrial side.","Denny Oklak","It was. We had about a 300,000 square foot tenant leave right near the end of the quarter in one of the buildings which was really most of the decrease in occupancy in Atlanta this quarter. I guess overall, my comment on Atlanta would be that market has been relatively slow and I think slower than some of the other industrial markets so far.","When you think back on it, just about a year ago, we signed million square foot lease up at our Braselton project with Carter\u2019s for their e-commerce distribution and that was a big deal obviously for us there. Since then, it\u2019s been a little bit slow, but in talking to our folks in Atlanta, they\u2019re starting to feel like things could pick up here pretty shortly and things could get better in the second and third quarter.","A lot more people come out in the market beginning to talk about leasing some space here soon. So, I think we anticipate that occupancy improving in the second half of this year. But clearly, it has been slower than some of the other markets.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to the line of Eric Frankel for his question.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. I would like to discuss given the repositioning plan here, long-term thoughts for some of office to suit. You guys are working where do you think the eventual home where those properties are?","Denny Oklak","I think it depends. When you think about a couple, I mean the two, the bigger ones that we worked are is Primerica build to suit in Atlanta which we just completed on time and they\u2019ve now moved in and are extremely happy with the facility. And on that one I would say, that\u2019s on land that we own in our legacy park up in Gwinnett County. We\u2019ve got room for a couple more buildings there. We\u2019ve actually had other \u2013 some other discussions there on possible build to suit.","So I think it\u2019s probably likely we might hold that one for a little while as we build, potentially build out the rest of that park. As you may recall that was a 15-year lease with them, so we\u2019ve got obviously plenty of time on the lease. I think there\u2019s nice annual rent bumps in that one also.","And then the other one we signed our Duke Bridges Park up in Frisco in Dallas 200,000 square foot project on a 16-year lease. We\u2019ve got two more sites available in that park and then this tenant actually has an expansion option on to a site next door for I think its 18 or 24 months out. And so I think once we complete that I think you\u2019ll likely see us pull that one at least through the time that they have the expansion option.","So I think it\u2019s going to be a case-by-case basis, Eric. They are all they\u2019re really good projects but as you know we\u2019re downsizing the office business and the truth is in Atlanta and Dallas for example both of those were a part of our Blackstone transaction so we sold substantially all of our other assets in those market other some other ones a couple we had in other joint ventures.","But these build-to-suit office buildings don\u2019t require they\u2019re not really that hard to manage because it\u2019s a single tenant. So I just think it\u2019s not probably not answering your question but I think it\u2019s just going to be a case-by-case basis.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. I do appreciate the color. Also I\u2019m just curious about the medical office portfolio and what do you think the occupancy trajectory can be in the next couple of years? It just seem to be stay kind of flat over the last few quarters?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think yes, it has and some of that was because we were some of our development we were developing with some vacancy in it. And so most of what we signed here recently has been a 100% lease so that\u2019s not contributing to that vacancy obviously. But I think the leasing activity is pretty good. We bought a little bit of vacancy, when we bought the Seavest portfolio last year and we\u2019re actually I think, it looks like we\u2019re going to be ahead of schedule on leasing up some of that space, so my thoughts today would be, you\u2019re going to see that occupancy probably start moving closer to the 94% 95% and likely stay in that area for a while.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Great, thank you. And then one final question, just given your thoughts on market rent and growth trajectory, just want to get a feel for what you think the mark-to-market rent is for your portfolio?","Denny Oklak","Well, people asked us that quite a bit. It\u2019s, again a little bit hard to say because we\u2019ve got so many different markets and submarkets and kind of buildings. But, in general today, where we are in the cycle and when you look at when we sign leases that are beginning to roll now, I would say, our rents in place were probably a little bit below market. And I\u2019m saying, maybe 5% to 7% below market today and what\u2019s in place. But again, it\u2019s going to vary market and sub \u2013 by market and sub market a little bit.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Great, thank you. Appreciate it.","Christie Kelly","Bye Eric.","Operator","Pardon me, we have a question in the queue from the line of Scott O\u2019Donnell, go ahead.","Scott O\u2019Donnell","Yes hi, good afternoon. A question for Christie, the last two debt offerings you did were 3.875 and 3.625, I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why you\u2019d be turning to the bank term loan market right now with the markets very efficient from a funding perspective?","Christie Kelly","Yes, Scott. Thanks for that question. I mean I think when we take a look at the term loan there, a couple of things. First, we\u2019re looking at a five-year term loan. We\u2019re looking at doing floating rate paper and it\u2019s very accretive based on our yield curve right now and we really don\u2019t have any floating rate debt to speak of whatsoever in our capital strikes. So when you take a look at A, yes, what we\u2019ve been able to execute and B, threading in a nice little five-year for 2018 maturity, they go up 15 really nicely with our maturity ladder at very attractive rates it makes sense for us to do.","Scott O\u2019Donnell","So there will be no swapping of that deal and no capping of the deal?","Christie Kelly","No. There won\u2019t be any swapping of the deals at the get go, I mean, to the extent that we need to fix it. We\u2019ll take care of that as we see rates move.","Scott O\u2019Donnell","Thank you.","Christie Kelly","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have a question in queue from the line of Michael Salinsky. Go ahead please.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon, guys. Just to go back to the following question. You talked about spreads, I think, you said up 2%. What occupancy level do you get a bit more comfortable pushing that a little more?","Denny Oklak","I think again, it always comes back to me to what the demand is. Even when our occupancy is here at 95%, 98% which when you look at a number of our industrial markets today, we\u2019re there. Still not necessarily a big pressure to raise rates until that demand really starts picking up. So I think we\u2019re going to have to see some more of that demand picking up. And occupancy is good but it\u2019s not like we have a huge backlog of tenants wanting new space that\u2019s why you\u2019re still seeing relatively limited spec development in most markets. So, I think we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019ll start seeing at as we start seeing a little bit more demand pickup.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just going back to your original capital plans for the year. I mean do the shares about 25% year-to-date and also...","Denny Oklak","I\u2019m sorry. I think we...","Christie Kelly","Hello?","Denny Oklak","Did we lose you?","Operator","Mr. Salinsky\u2019s line is still connected. Mr. Salinsky could you check your phone for mute feature.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Can you hear me?","Denny Oklak","Yes, sorry.","Christie Kelly","Now we can.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Sorry about that. Just going back to with the share price of 25% year-to-date and also just given the success you guys have had on disposition front relative to the development yield, the 8% that you quoted there, is there any thoughts maybe accelerating the development starts for the year and maybe recycling a bit more or going out in maybe being a bit more aggressive on the leverage \u2013 on reducing leverage?","Denny Oklak","Well, I guess let me start in the development side. I mean I think we\u2019re doing all the prudent development today that we think is out there. In other words, we focus on the build-to-suit market. Going back to my comments on spec and so as I said I think we\u2019re not really afraid to do really good build-to-suit yields on both the MOB and the industrial side and an occasional office one to the extend there may be on our land.","So, we\u2019ll keep pushing those as much as we can. And then on the disposition side, I think we\u2019ve got a fairly significant disposition plan for the year and we\u2019ve executed \u2013 we had a great first quarter and now with the Pembroke sale looking to close here in \u2013 before the end of the month. That\u2019s a pretty good four-month start at almost $400 million.","So, one of the things I you will see as do is sort of look through the portfolio a little more carefully as we\u2019re going and take advantage of some \u2013 potentially take advantage some opportunities where we think we\u2019ve created a fair amount of value and then move some of those properties if the timing is right, especially timing for reinvestment. We think we can have use of the proceeds either to reinvest in new development or to de-lever as we have debt maturities coming up. I think we\u2019ll probably look at that but I wouldn\u2019t say we have anything specific in mind right now.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So no changes with the investment plan obviously early in the year?","Denny Oklak","No, I don\u2019t think so.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from the line of Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. So, Denny, just to sort of follow-up a little bit on the disposition outlook and we\u2019ve talked about this a bit in the past, but you\u2019ve got a nice MOB franchise as we sort of think about it but it doesn\u2019t fit that neatly into your portfolio mix. At the same time, pricing for MOB assets seems in an all time high. There\u2019s seems to a lot of interest in the space.","Is there a way to sort of harvest some of that value via a JV or some form like that where you don\u2019t have to give up the upside that you seem to be creating a lot on the development pipeline but you can maybe harvest some of the value that\u2019s been created on the developments that have been done thus far and it would be a way to sort of accelerate the deleveraging that you\u2019d expect to do over the next few years?","Denny Oklak","Well, I would first respond to that by saying I think it does fit in fairly nicely and neatly within our portfolio because again it\u2019s a very stable product type very really good same property growth as you can see from the performance of that portfolio over the last year and the last few quarters it\u2019s really doing well.","So when a property type is performing that well, I think it fits in to my strategy so and obviously we have the platform in place to do the development and continue to grow that business. But having said that, I think there is an opportunity there we\u2019ve been building portfolio on the development side now for about six to seven years and as we look back through that portfolio there is probably a couple of properties that are in there that we developed early in that cycle that might make less sense for us strategically than they did back then.","So I think you\u2019ll see us really look \u2013 keep a close eye on that portfolio, you might see a few assets move here or there. But again, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see us grow that portfolio. Just in the light of that we sold two buildings out of our MOB portfolio this quarter. And those were actually two buildings that we got in the Seavest transaction that we knew when we bought them weren\u2019t really strategic for us.","They were located in truly non-core market, they have good tenancy and long term leases and they were probably 25 to 30 year old buildings. So we move I would say fairly rapidly to go ahead and relist those properties and sold them at a little bit over what we had allocated to that. So it was a good deal for us and again, they didn\u2019t fit strategically. So I think you\u2019ll see us continue to look at that.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. So if I hear your comments correctly on the MOB portfolio, does that suggest that this is \u2013 as you think about the business long term several years out, this is the part of the portfolio that stays within the business as you sort of see it into the future?","Denny Oklak","Yes. I think we\u2019ve stated that I think our asset strategy that we\u2019ve been talking about here, our original target for that was about 15%. We\u2019re kind of right there maybe even a little bit higher than that because of some of the bigger transactions we did but I think you\u2019re going to see that portfolio stay in that range and I think overall as we look for opportunities to grow the company overall then I think you will continue to see that MOB portfolio grow but stay in that kind of a range of percentage of the overall company, 15% to 20%.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Sure, okay. And then the flip side of that is sort of looking at acquisitions or the flip side of my question I guess would be looking at acquisitions. Do you think \u2013 as we look at this USAA deal, a large portfolio deal stabilized. So you think when you look at growth of the company from here given that you\u2019re pretty darn close to the 60, 50 and 25 portfolio breakdown allocation that large portfolio deals are still likely to happen for Duke or do you think you\u2019re largely done with that and most of the growth comes via development and kind of one-off deals?","Denny Oklak","I think it depends. First of all, I would say that I think growth definitely will come through new development. Build-to-suit industrial deals, some speculative industrial building and pretty much on land that we owned because we can do \u2013 I don\u2019t know I think it\u2019s $40 million square feet of industrial roughly on our \u2013 the land that we own today. So, you\u2019re going to see us continuing to grow there.","I think you probably will see us do some one-off acquisitions in key target markets which we\u2019ve been doing. Again just kind of depends, we\u2019ve looked at a whole lot more and seen a whole lot more transactions than we\u2019ve actually executed on when we look at it over the last two or three years.","As far as the portfolio of yields go, again I think it depends. There is where we have a great presence in most of the major distribution markets in the country now, but there is a couple where we\u2019d still like continuing to grow and if we saw a portfolio transaction that we thought would really help us grow in a certain area of the country or a certain of those markets that we don\u2019t \u2013 we feel like we\u2019re underweighted, then I think we would certainly consider that.","And again just looking at the USAA portfolio very I mean strategically for us a very good transaction because a significant piece of it in California, Northeast, Houston where those are locations that we\u2019re trying to build our portfolio so that worked very well for us.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Sure and then last one. The cap rate spread differentially. If you talked about between the USA deal and Pembroke deal, is that \u2013 was that both cash and GAAP 100 basis point spread or was it just one or the other?","Denny Oklak","Cash","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Brendan.","Christie Kelly","Thanks Brendan.","Operator","We have a follow up question from the line of Josh Attie, please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Yes, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman, good afternoon.","Denny Oklak","Hey Michael.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Just a question on the USAA portfolio, I guess the brokerage community is sort of painting it as a portfolio premium, very rich pricing, I guess how do you respond to that and maybe you can talk about how you sort of look at pricing for that portfolio?","Denny Oklak","Sure, I would say that was a competitively bid process there, so I would say there was a number of other competitors on that portfolio so, I think it was truly market pricing. I don\u2019t know that I would agree that there\u2019s a portfolio premium to it. I mean it\u2019s sort of is, what it is and they\u2019re all really good projects. When you look at it, I think our basis, if you look at that is going to be just around $65 a foot overall for that portfolio.","We do a lot of looking at replacement cost and I think we really believe we bought that portfolio, right in the range of replacement cost and again, all very good markets, very, very good buildings. So I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t a market deal, I think it was a market deal, but I think it was a good fair deal for us. We\u2019re very comfortable with the pricing on it and our basis and so that\u2019s about all I can say, great property.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","And where does that work out, I guess on a initial, it\u2019s 100% lease so where \u2013 I guess where are rents sort of relative to market and what is that initial yield that you\u2019re buying at?","Denny Oklak","Well, I would say rents are really right about market and most of those buildings what we think market is today. I think the average remaining term on those leases is probably six or seven years and again all of them have annual rental rate bumps. I would say the rental bumps are in the neighborhood of 1.5% to 2% \u2013 2% or 3% I guess.","Christie Kelly","That\u2019s right.","Denny Oklak","And I\u2019d said we typically don\u2019t disclose yields on specific transactions, Michael, just because of competitive nature. So, it will be disclosed in our second quarter numbers along with our other acquisitions. But I also would like to say I think it\u2019s pretty \u2013 the numbers I\u2019ve seen our there are probably in the range.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And then just \u2013 I just wanted to come back to sort of the guidance just to really understand the moving pieces because it sounds like the acquisition or our shift position activity, I guess when you look at the retail sale and some of the office buildings to Chamber Street that could be maybe even accretive or neutral relative to the acquisition volumes that you\u2019re doing and it sounds like going floating rate debt would be accretive. And so are we \u2013 to take it that operations a little bit behind for the guidance not to move?","Denny Oklak","No. I don\u2019t think so. I think our operations are really pretty much in line so far this year with where we anticipate them to be. You know, Mike, because you know I\u2019m not going to move our guidance in the first quarter. I mean we said a fairly broad range and usually we\u2019ve tightened it up the last couple of years a little bit.","But we\u2019ve got a lot of moving pieces and parts as we go through this disposition and essential acquisition and development. So there\u2019s just a lot of moving pieces and parts in the numbers so I\u2019m just never inclined to really try to change this early in the year unless something major would happen that we knew had a significant effect.","So we\u2019ll obviously look again at the end of the next quarter and think about where we are and see how the year is progressing and every quarter we reconsider that annual guidance. And if we think it\u2019s appropriate to change it we\u2019ll do that but right now I think operations are actually probably just a little bit ahead of where we thought they\u2019d be.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.","Christie Kelly","And through that point Michael, we highlighted not only the year-over-year growth the FFO and AFFO but we\u2019ve done that on the back. So moving significant dispositions as well as delivering so when you take a look at the fundamental operation and the leasing momentum it\u2019s been very strong. So I would absolutely agree with Denny that we\u2019re actually a little bit ahead of where we thought we were going to be.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","We also have a follow up question from the line of Michael Salinsky. Go ahead please.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Just to go back to dispositions since you sold both portfolio and one-offs. Any noticeable difference between portfolio pricing versus one-off sale?","Denny Oklak","No. I don\u2019t think so, each disposition, each transaction has its own story so it\u2019s a little hard to say. But I think for that specific question Mike, the difference between single assets or portfolios, not really.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Then the question, taking I think the bulk on this report a little bit, looking at some of the smaller block space, have you seen any change in demand as we see in the single family house in the market pick up over the last couple of quarters and how much opportunity do you see there in terms of driving towards your occupancy targets for 2013?","Denny Oklak","Yes. I think clearly, you\u2019re starting to hear a lot of chatter about that in various conferences. We\u2019ve seen it in some of the other industrial folks as public discussions or releases. I think it\u2019s true. We\u2019re seeing some of that and again, it varies a little bit from market-to-market.","I would say clearly in South Florida which that whole economy there is driven by a lot of development and construction is a fairly big part about that \u2013 of that economy down there and that market is coming back particularly I would say on the multi-family or the condominium market in South Florida is really coming back. So we\u2019re starting to see some of those types of tenants come back into the market and I think we\u2019ll continue to see that, my sense is throughout the rest of this year, as the economy improves and housing markets continues to pick up.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Denny Oklak","Thanks.","Operator","Speakers, we have no further questions in queue at this time.","Ron Hubbard","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2013 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our thoughts on the overall real estate operating environment and how this is affecting us. Jim Connor will give you an update on our leasing activity and development status. I\u2019ll review our asset recycling activity and Mark will then address our first quarter financial performance and balance sheet activity.","We followed up our very strong 2013 with a solid start to 2014 on all fronts. We signed 6.1 million square feet of leases in the first quarter and ended with overall occupancy at 93.6% overall, which includes projects under development. Rents on renewal leases for the quarter grew by nearly 7.9% reflective of strong supply demand fundamentals and improved pricing power. We started a $108 million of new bulk industrial development projects. Three of our five development starts this quarter, are 100% pre-leased, while two industrial projects we started on a speculative basis in Houston.","We made progress on our 2014 disposition expectations during the quarter by closing on $79 million of transactions along with several other transactions being in various stages of marketing and negotiations.","Now I\u2019ll touch on market conditions. Demand drivers remained solid and supply is still relatively in chat for the industrial sector. We firmly believe the secular e-commerce story and the supply chain reconfiguration trends have a long runway and we are in an enviable operational and development platform position to take advantage of growth opportunities. The health care demand drivers for modern outpatient space also has a very bright long-term outlook. We expect the solid year of MOB development starts and further lease up of the existing portfolio. The suburban office sectors continues to improved across most of our markets and we're optimistic about further lease up in the portfolio, our three month occupancy is up over 300 basis points compared to the prior year on a same property basis, which adjust for our sizable office disposition activity. As noted on the last call, we still expect some great opportunities developed office at very strong yields on the office portion of our remaining land bank.","Now I'll turn it over to Jim Connor to give a little more color on our leasing activity and development pipeline.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Denny and good afternoon, everybody. From an operational standpoint, we had very solid quarter leasing at 6.1 million square feet as Denny noted. Overall occupancy ended at 93.6% dropping slightly from year-end which was expected. Most of the impact was from seasonality in our both industrial products into a lesser few lease by out. Our theory remains very strong and we anticipate occupancy heading backup in the second quarter.","We did have a few lease expirations that were expected that push down our tenant retention from the quarter to 65%. However, please to note that two leases totaling roughly 500,000 square feet were immediately back filled with different tenants pushing our effective retention into the high 70% range. Rental rate growth on renewals continues to improve across the portfolio with growth of 7.9%. We continue to be very focused on pushing rents throughout the portfolio of the investment side.","Now I'll touch on some key activity within each product type for the first quarter. The industrial sector for the quarter, PPR54 index reported over 30 million square feet of net absorption continuing the solid trend from 2013 and a roughly 10 basis points drop in vacancy from the fourth quarter to the mid 7% level.","Most research firms are projecting for the year that demand will outpaced supply at two to one margin and we are seeing the majority of the demand in the larger modern bulk space. I am proud to see our team has continue to win many of this build is evidence by the three new projects we announce this quarter.","The execution on external growth is a testament to our 40 year of reputation in the business having our own construction company and our strategic land bank. With respect to leasing in our industrial portfolio, we continue to see fundamentals improve with the completion of 5.5 million square feet of total leasing a level slightly above the comparable period from one year ago.","In service occupancy in the bulk industrial portfolio at the end of the first quarter was 95%, 140 basis points higher than a year ago as noted a majority of lease explorations were short term seasonal deal and we expect to be able to improve on our current occupancy throughout the year.","Many of our larger industrial deals this quarter were in Atlanta and Savannah markets which are reflective to strong fundamentals in the south eastern part of country. We signed six new leases and one renewal on these markets all between 200,000 and 520,000 square feet including a 10 year lease with [Mizuno] and 15 year lease with Brighton Best.","We also signed 240,000 square foot new lease for the major food service company in Indianapolis and a 250,000 square foot lease with (inaudible) Cincinnati. Turning to the medical office this portfolio is in great shape with our in service occupancy at 93.7%, that\u2019s nearly 300 basis points above what it was one year ago and we have a weighted average remaining lease term of over 10 years.","The suburban office market continues to improve slowly with national absorption, maintaining a positive trend for 16 consecutive quarters, vacancy levels are down 40 to 50 basis points compared to a year ago and concessions continue a downward trend.","Our in-service office portfolio ended the quarter at 88.1% leased up 30 basis points from a year ago. As Denny alluded in the opening remarks, when adjusted for our active office disposition program, the average same property occupancy for this quarter is up some 330 basis points over the prior year, reflecting a strong performance in this asset class.","With regard to leasing, we had a nice quarter of signing about 0.5 million square foot of deals including a 70,000 square foot new lease with (inaudible) in our St. Louis market.","Turning to development, for the quarter our pipeline is still very strong, we started a $108 million of industrial build to suits and speculated projects totaled 1.8 million square feet, with a weighted average GAAP yield of 8.2%. And I know we had a solid pipeline of prospects for the remainder of the year.","Last quarter, we announced a start up of 1 million square foot build to suit for Amazon in Baltimore, this year we're pleased to announce the second build to suit with Amazon in the same park, this time of 346,000 square foot facility that\u2019s leased for 15 years.","We also started a 744,000 square foot project in our West Jefferson Park in Columbus, Ohio. This facility is a 100% leased to Bon-Ton Stores, a major retailer for a term of 10 years.","In the Atlanta market, we started a 257,000 square foot expansion of an existing facility for Dick's Sporting Goods at our Camp Creek Park, near Hartsfield Airport with a lease term of 11 years.","We also started two speculative industrial buildings totaling 480,000 square feet in Houston in our Gateway Northwest Businesses Park. The vacancy in Houston is currently only 5%. Last year, Houston had 1 million square feet of spec net absorption and over 7 million square feet of total net absorption in the marketplace.","A quick note on the new supply outlook for the industrial sector. Spec projects in our markets for the first quarter of 2014, totaled 95 million square feet. This is approximately 15.5 million square foot increase over the fourth quarter of 2013.","During that same period, leasing in those spec projects increased by about 6 million square feet. The first quarter of 2014 solid percentage, leased of the spec inventory increased by 11% to 24% overall. In this context and as we\u2019ve alluded to in past earnings calls, supply is relatively disciplined in essentially all of our markets at this point in the cycle compared to historical levels. But we continue to monitor this activity closely.","From an overall development pipeline perspective, at the quarter end we have 25 projects under construction, totaling 7.5 million square feet and a projected $608 million in stabilized cost that our share that are 86% preleased.","These projects have an initial cash yield of 7.6% and a GAAP yield of 8.3%, an evidence of our ability to create significant value through our development platform. As they are being developed at an estimated 20% plus margin, I\u2019d also like to point out that at 86% preleased we\u2019ve minimized most of the risk, most of the risk has been eliminated on these projects.","Given that we have entitled land positions and we can support roughly 45 million square feet of bulk industrial development and given our relationships and track record at winning major build to suits with top customers, our development platform is in a dominant position to continue to drive incremental cash flow growth over the long haul.","And now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Denny and he can touch on our asset recycling activities.","Denny Oklak","","Thanks Jim. With respect to investment activity, we had $79 million of dispositions during the quarter, majority of the proceeds were from two medical office assets that closed in January that were part of a larger portfolio sale discussed last quarter. The remaining disposition proceeds were from a flex portfolio in Indianapolis. We continue to strategically reduce our portfolio, our flex portfolio and are now down only 37 buildings totaling 2.3 million square feet across the system. We will continue to be opportunistic in disposing of more of our suburban office assets particularly in light of the aggressive equity capital and cheap debt pricing.","We\u2019re actively marketing several significant projects or portfolios and still expect to be within our annual disposition guidance with significant closings late in the second quarter and into the third quarter. On the acquisition side this quarter we recycled a small portion of our disposition proceeds into a 407,000 square foot modern bulk solely located in Atlanta and leased to UPS supply chain solutions.","The facility is located just east of Hartsfield Airport inside the 285 Beltway. This facility is a 100% leased with 3 years remaining on the term with rents are currently a little below market and pricing provided an excellent basis of $43 per square foot.","In general the acquisition market continues to be intensive competitive and given our strong development pipeline and opportunities we expect our acquisition activity to be highly selective and strategic in nature.","So, now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and capital plans.","Mark Denien","Thanks Denny. Good afternoon everyone. As Denny mentioned, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our financial performance as well as an overview of the capital transactions for the quarter. Core FFO for the first quarter of 2014 was $0.28 per share compared to $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2013.","Core FFO was down $0.01 per share from the fourth quarter of 2013, due to increased general and administrative expenses which were mainly driven by the accounting rules, which require us to immediately expense the substantial portion of our annual stock compensation brand. Along with lower absorption of overhead costs due to the decrease in leasing volume from our record fourth quarter of 2013.","The first quarter is always by far our highest quarter of G&A expenses for these reasons. We are still comfortable with our full year guidance of G&A expense of $40 million to $44 million. The improvement in core FFO per share over the first quarter of 2013 was due to improved operational performance and development deliveries as well as decreased interest expense.","Same property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended March 31st was 3.0% and 2.2% respectively due to increased occupancy and growth in rental rates. Same property NOI growth for the three months ended March 31st was constrained by increased snow removal and utility costs driven by the extreme weather conditions in many parts for the country.","In spite of these increased operating expenses in the first quarter, we are still comfortable with our full year same property NOI guidance of 2% to 4%. Also regarding NOI, this quarter we introduced a new exhibit to our supplemental package which includes a breakout of NOI and square footage by market and by property type. This additional disclosure should better assist everyone in valuing our company.","As Jim noted, our growth and average not affective rent on renewals was 7.9% for the quarter with positive rental growth across all three product types. We are optimistic about our ability to continue to push these rental rates. We generated $0.25 per share in the AFFO, which equates to a conservative dividend payout ratio of 68% compared to $0.21 per share of AFFO for the fourth quarter of 2013. We incurred a significant amount of building improvements in second generation leasing cost during the fourth quarter of 2013 whereas our capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2014 were more in line from our ongoing run rate.","We are pleased with maintaining our continued strong operating results and now I will quickly recap our capital position. We finished the quarter with $180 million outstanding on our $850 million line of credit as compared to $88 million outstanding on the line of credit at the end of 2013.","As Denny noted, we anticipate increased disposition activity during the next two quarters which will allow us to repay our current line balance and fund continued development costs. We are in a very good liquidity position and have no significant debt maturities until February of 2015.","In addition I am pleased to report during the quarter our credit rating for senior unsecured debt was reaffirm by Moody\u2019s at BAA2 with a stable outlook and upgraded by Standard & Poor\u2019s to mid BBB + or mid BBB with a stable outlook. These actions by the rating agencies are a testament to our improved overall leverage profile, high quality assets very stable cash flow profile and continued focus on further improving our balance sheet.","I will conclude by saying that I am very happy to report another strong quarter and with that I will turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Mark. Yesterday we narrowed our guidance for FFO per share for 2014 to $1.12 to $1.18 with solid results in the first quarter, we set the stage for our strong 2014. So in closing I will reiterate that we believe our team and our portfolio is in a unique position to take advantage of strong fundamentals in all businesses. The value creation potential for shareholders is very high. We thank you again for your interest and support of Duke Realty, we'll now open the lines up to the audience and we ask participants to keep a dialog to one question or perhaps two very short questions. You are of course welcome to get back in the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And first from the line of Michael Bilerman. Please go ahead.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Hi, this is Kevin Baron with Michael. Last quarter you mentioned that sales would be more weighted through the first four months. Now that has been pushed back a little bit. Can you walk us through what's causing the delay, and then in regards to guidance, can you comment on how that impacts FFO for the remainder of the year? Because it would imply a near-term boost in FFO just given the delay on asset sale dilution. And then secondly, has the shift in timing of assets impacted the timing of capital deployment laid out in guidance?","Jim Connor","I think we're pretty much right on, we might be pushed back slightly from what we said in the first quarter, but there is no significant reason for it, just timing of marketing, but I think everything is on track. Obviously, our FFO guidance considers all that, considers the timing.","And again, we're on track with funding the development pipeline and I think again a lot of that\u2019s going to be funded with the disposition proceeds as we go throughout the year.","Kevin Baron - Citi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll got Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities","Hey guys just a follow-up on that, can you give maybe a little more color on any packages you have for sale at this point, where they are and what are their set type?","Jim Connor","Well again I think as far as asset type goes we\u2019ve said, we're mainly selling the office products in certain target markets. I think the one asset I would specifically mention that I think has been out in the press is the 3630, [Pete] Street building and bucket in Atlanta. We are now at the point where we're getting pretty close to selecting of fire for that property and we\u2019ll be moving quickly towards the contract on that. So that\u2019s one of the projects we anticipate closing probably late second quarter.","Other than that it\u2019s just a few different projects that are out there and I only want to comment on any specifically, but we're currently far down the road with several of the planned dispositions.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Fair enough. And then Mark can you give us a sense of what the impact of the higher than usual snow removal and utilities expense was on same-store?","Mark Denien","","Yes, Blaine. It was approximately about 60 to 70 basis points impact on the quarterly number, obviously less than that on the rolling 12 month number more like 20 basis points and then all IN from a dollar now perspective on bottom line FFO, it was just over the million dollars. So nothing too significant that we can\u2019t recover from for the rest of the year, but it did have an impact on the percentage growth for the current quarter.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities","","All right great thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Vance Edelson. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","","Great thanks. So, you mentioned pushing rents on the industrial side. Sounds like you have a real opportunity here given the pricing power that's kicked in. How much do you take advantage of that by raising rents even more, perhaps, at the expense of further occupancy gains? In other words, how do you balance the pricing versus the ultimate occupancy that you'd like to see?","Denny Oklak","Well I think that\u2019s more art than science, we do a pretty good job of tracking the deals and when they originally signed as we\u2019ve talked before we\u2019re now very focused on the leases that were signed between 2009 and 2011, when we think we were really at the trough in the overall market. And we have about 45% of the leases that roll in the next 18 months fall into that category.","So we\u2019re targeting pushing rents there extremely hard. Most of our industrial portfolio is across the country are 95% or better so they have all of the leverage that they need to go out and push rents and they are not the lease that uncomfortable we\u2019re taking on a little bit of vacancy given the strength of the market. So, that\u2019s the process and I think we\u2019re pretty proud of results in the first quarter that our guys have achieved.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned that the strong capital liquidity out there might encourage you to sell more on the office side. Does it make you any more likely to monetize some of the medical office buildings, or are you pretty happy with everything you have there?","Denny Oklak","We\u2019re pretty happy with everything we have there. There is still one building from the portfolio that we closed on at the end of the -- mostly at the end of the fourth quarter of last year that\u2019s still hanging in limbo that should will likely I think close this quarter, but other than that\u2019s it, so just one other property out there.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jaime Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","","Great, thanks everyone. This earnings season has been an increasing amount of concern over warehouse supply. Can you guys talk about where you think we are in the cycle, when you start to see some downward pressure on rents and which markets you think at this point are closest to being a concern versus those that really have a long way to go before we should even start this discussion?","Denny Oklak","","Yeah, thanks Jaime. I think if you look at the macro numbers have been drilled down into all of these specific markets that we operate in. Demand still outpacing supply, we focused a lot and I share with the group some of the speculative delve with numbers, those are the one that obviously concern us most. I would tell you that we still believe that the vast majority of the markets and the country in general are in balance. There is a couple of that makes and pretty significant moves, the Inland Empire in Houston continue to lead the country with the amount of the spec space, but quite candidly those two markets have done a great job over the last six quarters of keeping those thus the amount of spec space that is under construction North of 30% pre lease. So a lot of good activity in those markets, a lot of good net absorption.","The one that jumped that pretty big this quarter, that's got someone watch this Dallas. Dallas added about 6.5 million square feet of spec space, there percentage of lease is down just under 10%. So that's probably one that we've got a watch, but in addition to that there is probably still five major markets around the country that haven\u2019t started any spec development a lot of them that are 40% and 50%. So on far, we're still in pretty good shape, we'll continue to monitor throughout 14 and 15 and see what the effect is.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","","And then along those lines, how fast do you think the warehouse cycle can turn? And is it a six-month, is it nine months, is it several years? And what's different this cycle versus prior cycles that maybe won't happen as fast or maybe happens even faster?","Denny Oklak","","Well first and foremost I think we all remember how tough the five years, four or five years of recession were, so lot of it is going to depend on self control, clearly there is a great deal of capital and they are chasing industrial development today and that has worked its way into the speculated development pipeline, but most of the market are in check, it doesn\u2019t take very long for aspec project is still on the show for those 8% under written yields to deteriorate, so most people are still very cautious that\u2019s why we are very please with the 86.5% lease of our underdevelopment portfolio, we\u2019ve got a few spec projects out there but build to see pipeline strong as it is that\u2019s where the majority of our focus is and we see a lot of value creation there.","Mark Denien","","And I would add a couple things to that, as I think, I said this before it was things we are seeing and industrial space is, with GDP growth and the 2% to 2.5% range a lot of our customers can take the time and do build suite in six to nine months. We see requesting us to accelerate the construction with they are so doing build to suits which that sort of changes if GDP growth jump up into the 4.5% and 5% range and we just haven\u2019t seen that yet.","And I think the second thing on the industrial side that we are seeing is a real and everybody is aware this it\u2019s just the growth in the ecommerce space. So I think that as Jim said in his remarks, I think we've still, we've got, I think a lot going forward there in our portfolio, but also just and a industry as a whole, because that, I think no matter what happens with the overall economy, that's going to continue to grow.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","","But do you think the capital is different now, like are we still, I know early this cycle the discussion was that, you needed equity to build and very few merchant builders to get out there, it seems like that's change.","Jim Connor","","I think there is always capital.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Operator","","And next we'll go to Eric Frankel. Please go ahead ","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","","Thank you. Mark did you guys purchased preferred this quarter?","Mark Denien","","Yes, Eric we had basically reverse inquiry and took down about $19 million space of preferreds for about $18 million. So saved about a $1 million, had about a $1 million gain before writing off the original cost. So the all in effective yield on that was about 7%. So, thought that was an attractive transaction.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. And then Jim maybe this is for you. Can you comment about the positioning of land bank and where it's is located, where the spec development is taking place and if it isn't located in markets where there is a lot spec development, how can you price build-to-suits relative to where spec wants to lease today?","Jim Connor","","Let me see if I can follow the question.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","I can clarify, if you'd like.","Jim Connor","","You want to know where are better land holdings are is that the first part?","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","","The majority of land holdings, yes. On a book value basis.","Jim Connor","","I would tell you with the exception of Southern California and the Northeast, we've got strategic land in most all of our office and quite candidly we sold those inventories down selling off non-strategic and as we started to ramp-up development in as you know for the last few quarters, we\u2019ve acquired very little land, in the last few years, so as we continue to work that inventory down.","We\u2019ve got great land and remember we didn\u2019t impair that land, the land that\u2019s held for development, the last go round so those are really true yields on the build-to-suits that you see indicative of our original investment in the land.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","And your pricing build-to-suits, I mean, are the rate that you are charging comparable to spec development are they lower or they higher, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense?","Denny Oklak","","No, I think we believe the rental rates that we are charging and the yields that we are achieving are appropriate risk adjusted returns, or for build-to-suits versus spec. And given our success in the market place in the yields, as we said we\u2019ve got a stabilized yield of 7.6% on that under development pipeline, which we all know, where cap rates are today that\u2019s a tremendous amount of value creation and those projects we're seeing, those are all over the country.","All different product type so, that\u2019s combination of again we're pretty good to build-to-suit business we\u2019ve got our own construction, company so we are still getting great pricing and we\u2019ve got the right land sites.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you.","Denny Oklak","","Thanks Eric.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll go to Paul Adornato. Please go ahead.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","","Thanks very much. With respect to capital recycling over the last couple of years, there has been some questions or suggestions that maybe the medical office might be right for disposition in some form or another. And so my question is, have you given any thought to a potential spin-off of these assets since the spin-off of other entities has kind of gained some traction within the REIT space and that would of course solve the capital redeployment problem?","Denny Oklak","Well Paul, we really haven\u2019t giving it a lot of thought. I guess what I would say is we as you all know, you know and everybody knows from what we\u2019ve been saying is we really like the business, we think it\u2019s a good growth business for us. Today it\u2019s a significant piece of our business, particularly on the development side but overall, it\u2019s still only about 14% or 15% of our business today. One thing we did do is look at that portfolio from a strategic point of view last year and as you know, we sold including the couple of that closed here in the first quarter in January, we sold about $250 million of that portfolio. So in our mind, we\u2019ve really recycled some and generated some very nice gains out of that portfolio. And we\u2019re going to continue to move forward on the development side in that business.","For us as we continue to really sell some of the suburban office, it\u2019s again another great place for us to redeploy that capital back into the development pipeline in MOBs.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to (inaudible). Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Can you hear me?","Denny Oklak","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. You made a comment earlier on your opening remarks about it\u2019s a healthy supply of maybe built-to-suit or spec deals you\u2019re looking at to replenish your pipeline as you continue to complete your development. I was wondering if you could give a little color around, is there a change in future yields based on the kind of projects that are in the pipeline and is 600 million roughly the number, we should expect to be at on a longer term basis?","Denny Oklak","","Well, I'll address the first question from yield perspective. There is always competitive pressures in the marketplace. But as with the deals we've reported and everything in our price -- everything that's in our pipeline. we feel very comfortable with where are pricing is today. One of the things and ties back into the speculative development that one of the reasons we're monitoring it so closely, it's for just back to monitor markets where they potentially could get overbuilt and you'll see pricing pressures, downward pricing pressure on build-to-suits, as there are more opportunities in the marketplace. So we don't see that today, but that\u2019s obviously concern out there in the future that we're all monitoring pretty closely.","Jim Connor","And as far as the level of the pipeline, I\u2019d just had a couple of things. [Kevin] We started about 660 million of projects last year, our guidance was sort of 350 to 450 this year. So I think you're going to see that the pipeline under development be roughly in that $600 million range give or take. The only thing that might affect that, I would say on the upper side would be some of the projects that we're doing today on both the industrial and the MOB side and then occasional office build-to-suits tend to be larger projects. So if you land a couple of the bigger 1 million plus square foot warehouses or 150,000 square foot, medical office building that pipeline might go up a little bit with those kind of projects there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and on very quick kind of accounting question, I just want to double check, your same-store NOI is purely based -- is on a commencement basis right, it\u2019s not on a sign basis, is that correct?","Mark Denien","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Unidentified Analyst","So, if I look at your, like page 18, some upside in leasing like in medical office up 200 basis points or so that\u2019s not in your same-store NOI that was reported this quarter, correct?","Mark Denien","No, our same-store NOI is on a cash basis, so basically it\u2019s tenant paying rent and the occupancy figures on previous pages were on a lease sale basis.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Mark Denien","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W Baird","Yes. Mark, could you give us a little bit of color on where you think current liquidity is and funding sources for the year, do you comfortable funding off the balance sheet? And then maybe give us a little run down on kind of the trend in coverage and leverage metrics as you move throughout the year?","Mark Denien","Yes, sure Dave. We are basically projecting that we can cover all of our cash needs for the year with our disposition pipeline that Denny mentioned. From a acquisition perspective, I think our guidance\u2019s top end was about $200 million and development pipeline at 450 even at those levels, we should be able fund all that with the dispositions that we have coming out late second and early third and a few striking late in the year. So really no needs for capital. And then as far as cost like I guess, I would say from a debt perspective, since we really don\u2019t have anything to do this year, we\u2019re really out till early next year with the next big debt maturity. And I think that\u2019s about a 7.5% coupon rate.","And today our 10 year borrowing rates sit probably closer to 4.25 give or take. So, I think that you won\u2019t see us needing to issue any kind of new debt or equity to cover our events. Our leverage profile should continue to improve. It's always a little lower in the first quarter on a coverage basis, partially because it\u2019s some of those higher G&A costs and things like that that I mentioned.","As we get into the year and the development pipeline comes on line and our G&A costs normalized, you will continue to see those leverage metrics get better every quarter as we go through the rest of the year, just based on placing everything in service and just kind of normal blocking and tackling without any big capital transaction.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W Baird","Great. And one follow or maybe two follow ups, I'll put them together. The first is speculative construction projects relative to the overall pipeline. Do you have a comfort level, I didn't hear if you address that, if you did, I apologize. And in the second, can you address kind of development costs to maybe ex-land or what you're seeing on that side Jim?","Jim Connor","Yes, we're comfortable where we're running now. One of the challenges we have with as many of our markets that are above 95% occupancy as we have, we have a lot of people in the field that would like to do to spec developments. But with as many good build-to-suit opportunities, we're focused on keeping that percentage lease of the development pipeline in the range that we kept it.","So, you will not, I don't think you'll see us, ramp up spec development, in order to beat our development goals. I don't think we'll have to do that. So, we'll keep it at the modest end of the spectrum.","And from a cost perspective, there has been a lot of numbers been around that construction costs are moving up into the 3%, 4% 5% range. I will tell you here at the very low end of that range. I would tell you that across the country our numbers are in that 1% to 3% range. But I think that's the direct result of having our own construction company. So, we're not having to flight competitive pricing with the GCs out there who are seeing the increase in demand enable to push their margins, we\u2019ve got our own guys, so we're getting good pricing and be able to hold the line on material cost pretty well.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W Baird","","Great thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Michael Salinsky. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","","Good afternoon. On the industrial side, the moving pieces during the quarter, ended the quarter pretty well occupied; any vacate during that we should know about over the balance of the year that would create some choppiness in occupancy?","Denny Oklak","","I would tell you, we don\u2019t have any big surprises around certainties out there for the balance of the year on the industrial portfolio and big, I mean 300,000 to 500,000 square feet, we\u2019ve got all those addressed and baked into the numbers. And quite candidly, we were very pleased in the first quarter to backfill a couple of those that we knew were leaving down in Atlanta and Savanna as quickly as we did.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","","Okay. And then this is my follow-up question, given the opportunities on the preferred retirement during the quarter, as well as a strong bid you are seeing for the office MOB and industrial assets, any thoughts on maybe advancing that selling a little bit and retiring some of those preferred just given the coupon on that?","Denny Oklak","","Yes, Mike, we would certainly entertain that. I think if -- a lot of its timing, right, I mean if we have the disposition pipeline accelerate a little quicker than we think right now and we\u2019ve got the money suiting around, we would potentially look at the redemption. The one thing that was great about the transaction, we did do like I mentioned, it was a reverse enquiry. So we are able to take that down at very favorable pricing at 7% effective rate rather than give or take 6.6%, so it is something, we look at, but right now we do have a little bit outstanding on our line, we want to get that taken care of first to make sure we have all of our best covered on the development funding. Once we get that done if we had excess proceeds we would look at something like that.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. So, there are some very sizeable industrial portfolios that are on the market or going to be coming to market. Is that anything you guys would be interested in pursuing at this point and if so how would you think about funding something like that?","Denny Oklak","Well I alluded to it, I mentioned it in the remarks that things are pretty pricy right now and there are some I would say some portfolios out there that are float around some are good and some maybe not quite so good, but I think it\u2019s going to be tough for us to decide to do any large portfolio transaction here in the near future which is we are pricing as right now. So I wouldn\u2019t speculate I guess then Blaine how we would finance it, but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to happen.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo","Sure, fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll go to Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Just I guess add on to Blaine\u2019s question if industrial pricing is getting so aggressive is there a thought of you may be selling some of your industrial portfolio, is there something to fund higher yielding or better more value creation in your development pipeline?","Denny Oklak","Well, you noticed in the first quarter we sold some of our flex properties in Indianapolis. I think we\u2019ll continue to monitor in the industrial portfolio some sale of some of our smaller product type in all of our markets or in any of our markets I guess. And I would say, what's fueling that right now is we are starting to see more people interested in that product type. So generally pricing is a little better right now than it makes may have been.","So if you continue to see that, but as you know we're very pleased with the quality of our overall portfolio and some of statistics that we show in our regular presentations reflect that. So we really have no desire today to sale any of that newer model involved, because again we think we've got opportunities to keep driving or estimate for portfolio.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Well, I'm just wondering if there is price for you are a taker?","Denny Oklak","","Well, (inaudible) an offer, Eric.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Fair enough. I guess final question is on suburban office. Are there any movement you guys recognize obviously pretreated special example, I'm just kind of curious on some of the other suburban offices you probably than (inaudible) next year or two more activity is there?","Jim Connor","","Well, I would say that we're pretty pleased with pricing we are seeing. We were pleased with pricing we saw on some of that portfolio we moved later last year and still again have a couple of portfolios out there allow some individual assets. So we're pretty pleased the (inaudible) we are picking up in the suburban office assets. And I would also say the financing markets remained very favorable so that's also helping support the pricing.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to Jaime Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. So can you guys talk about whether you\u2019ve seen any incremental shift in improving conditions in any of your office markets this quarter specifically? So I guess what I am asking is we know the recovery has been kind of slow and steady moving from market to market. What other markets this quarter that have improved that maybe caught you guys off guard or give you hope for the future?","Denny Oklak","I don\u2019t know that I can point to specific markets, one of the things, one of the trends we are seeing that\u2019s really started in the last quarter which we take as a positive sign, is you\u2019re starting to see buyers a little more comfortable and a little bit more interested in a little more vacancy. I wouldn\u2019t say a lot of vacancy in but 2012 and 13 we were pushing to get occupancies in buildings that we are going to sell above 90% really focus on the roll in the next 36 months. And now we are seeing buyers that are interested in buildings that have occupancies in 80% to 85% range because they believe in the improving economics of the cycle and they are willing to underwrite that a little bit more aggressively. So for us that is opened up some opportunities to sell from additional building that haven\u2019t quite gotten leasing up to 90% and not have to incur the cost of doing so.","So that\u2019s probably the most positive trend that I think we have seen.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","And then what about just on the tenant demand side for space?","Denny Oklak","It continues to be kind of consistent with the last couple of quarters, we still are seeing the financial services companies, the insurance companies healthcare companies, healthcare related and servicing companies have all been good, good consumers of space. A lot of the deals that we have rolling in our own portfolio, it\u2019s not uncommon to, we're renewing those users and expanding them at the same time. So, that's been a pleasant trend that we've been seeing for the last 6 months to 9 months.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","And then there is no market this quarter that picked up from that trend like versus the last quarter or it's just going to consistent?","Jim Connor","I can't point to any one that comes to mind, I don't if Denny\u2026","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we've seen some good activity in St. Louis, Jim mentioned in the remarks, we signed a big lease over there. I think generally activity is picked up there, a little bit in Cincinnati too I mean the rest of the markets they all very solid. We're in the low to mid 90s in all those markets, all those other markets right now.","So, those markets are doing fine and we're starting to see a little pickup in a couple of these other markets.","Jamie Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay, alright.

Mr. Hubbard, please go ahead.","","Ron Hubbard","","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you our December 31, 2011 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now, for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","","Dennis D. Oklak","","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will highlight some of our key accomplishments during the quarter in both our operational and asset strategies. Christie will then address our second quarter financial performance and progress on our capital strategy. Then, I'll finish up our prepared remarks with some comments about our outlook for the remainder of 2012.","By all accounts, the second quarter was a great success for Duke Realty and I'm very proud of our team for their accomplishments. We signed over 4.9 million square feet of leases in the second quarter and started development of $63 million of industrial projects and $65 million of medical office projects. All of our new development starts are 100% preleased with the exception of 431,000 square foot spec industrial start on our land in Chino, California. Our in-service occupancy percent increased slightly to 92.2%, while our overall portfolio occupancy was relatively flat at quarter end at 92.0%, really due to the speculative development start.","We made continued progress on our asset repositioning strategy with $103 million of acquisitions, comprised substantially of bulk industrial properties and disposed of $27 million of flex industrial, retail and land assets.","On the capital front, we issued $300 million of new unsecured debt at a company record low effective rate of 4.47%, lowering our cost of capital and reflecting an endorsement from the market on Duke Realty's improving credit strength. Christie will speak more in depth on our capital activities in just a moment.","From a macro perspective, halfway through the year, the economy is moving along at a relatively tepid 2% growth rate. Recent economic indicators have been mixed, with some of the manufacturing and freight data points slightly moving to the downside. Despite that, our overall leasing activity has held up well in both industrial and medical office.","On industrial, the trends in e-commerce and supply chain modernization are also continuing to drive steady demand for our newer, larger box modern industrial portfolio. The on-campus medical office facility business also remains robust, particularly on the new developments on. The suburban office sector continues to be sluggish in most markets with a few pockets showing good absorption and moderate rent growth.","Looking to the rest of the year, we expect continued slow, but upward growth, yet we remain mindful of rising uncertainty and event risk from government fiscal issues across the globe in the upcoming U.S. election.","As I said, we had another solid quarter of leasing activity with 4.9 million square feet of signings. We reduced 66% of our leases during the quarter. On the renewal leases, we attained over 2.7% and 5.3% increased rental rate growth in our industrial and medical office businesses, indicative of our ability to push rents in a high occupancy portfolio. Office continued to be a challenge with slightly negative growth as we expected.","With respect to same property performance, we achieved positive same property NOI growth for the 12 months and three months ended June 30 of 3.7% and 3.4% respectively.","Now let me touch on some of the key activity within each of our product types for the quarter. The national industrial market continues to improve with demand drivers positive on most fronts. Early indication show second quarter vacancy levels for higher quality product declined another 25 to 40 basis points to just under 9.5%.","With respect to select Duke markets, Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas, all reported 50 to 80 basis point reduction in overall vacancy levels, with new supply levels on a national basis still relatively muted at roughly a quarter of a percent of inventory. We continue to have strong fundamental outlook in the industrial sector.","With respect to leasing in our in-service portfolio, we completed over a 1.5 million square feet of new industrial leases and over 1.8 million square feet of renewal leases. Including new leases on development build-to-suits, our industrial leases totaled over 3.7 million square feet.","For the second quarter, we generated positive net absorption in our industrial portfolio with in-service occupancy rising to 93.6%. Some of our larger lease deals included 222,000 square foot seven-year expansion in renewal with Sonoco Plastics in St. Louis, a 164,000 square foot expansion in renewal in Houston with Bray International. In our Chicago market, we executed 257,000 square foot lease with Brighton Best International in connection with a new acquisition. Finally, we signed two other leases totaling almost 441,000 square feet on build-to-suit development project, which I'll discuss in more depth.","The office leasing environment continues to be challenging as expected. Our nationwide vacancy levels dropped 10 basis points to 20 basis points during the quarter, yet remained in the 13% to 14% range, reflective of the tepid job and GDP growth. However, total leasing in our portfolio for the quarter was 900,000 square feet with in-service occupancy levels increasing 43 basis points to 85.9%.","Raleigh was a particularly strong market with 77,000 square foot, 11-year lease with Novella Clinical and 70,000 square foot expansion with Lenovo for eight years both signed in this quarter and both of these tenants are in our Perimeter Park development. We also signed over 37,000 square feet of leases at our CAPTRUST Tower project in Raleigh and that project is now 93% leased.","On the medical office front, healthcare providers are moving ahead with strategic plans to navigate provider and practitioner consolidation trends and looming healthcare reform of which a key component is providing modern, lower cost outpatient settings for their customers.","Consistent with this trend, our leasing activity and development opportunities continued to gain traction. We also started two new development projects, which I\u2019ll also cover in just a minute. Looking out \u2013 we have a good solid backlog of leasing and development prospects for the remainder of 2012 reflective of our deep relationships in the healthcare industry and an excellent development track record by our team.","We also made good progress at our asset strategy during the quarter. We acquired $103 million of very high quality properties. These acquisitions included a 498,000 square foot bulk industrial facility in La Mirada, California, which is in northern Orange County. That is 100% lease to Staples and Cotton On. We also acquired a 570,000 square foot building in the Atlanta I-20 West submarket, 100% leased to a global leader in the display and exhibit services business, with the remaining lease term of 11.5 years.","In a more creative deal, we acquired a vacant 257,000 square foot industrial facility in Chicago and leased the entire building to Brighton Best. This Chicago transaction was located in the IAEA corridor and allowed us to meet an existing customer's expansion needs. This deal exemplifies the value-add creativity, relationships and overall depth of the Duke Realty platform.","Disposition activity was relatively light this quarter, with $27 million of property sold, of which $15 million was from three non-core flex industrial assets that were 86% occupied and $11 million from one retail asset that was 81% occupied, and the remaining from vacant land.","Now turning to development, I'm pleased to report that our development start year-to-date are off to the strongest start in several years, a testament to what we believe is a best-in-class development platform. After 136 million of starts in the first quarter, we started another 128 million during the second quarter with the diversified mix of industrial and medical office build-to-suit and speculative projects, all consistent with our asset strategy. In total, we have 3.4 million square feet across 13 projects under construction that are over 86% preleased in the aggregate.","These new developments for the quarter included two new industrial build-to-suits, the first was in Atlanta project totaling 211,000 square feet which is 100% preleased to Kuehne and Nagel for a term of 10 years. The project will be delivered within our 400 acre Camp Creek Business Center strategically located just east of Hartsfield International Airport.","The second industrial build-to-suit development start is in the Chicago O'Hare submarket, a 230,000 square feet state-of-the-art warehouse leased to [Houston] logistics. The deal is another example of our strategic development capabilities as we acquired a 26 acre brownfield redevelopment site near O'Hare and we are able to sign a long term 12 year lease with the Blue Chip global (inaudible) tenant.","The other build-to-suit projects were medical office, which were briefly mentioned on the last call. The projects are both on hospital campuses and leased to Scott & White Healthcare, an A rated health system with 120,000 square foot facility located in College Station, Texas and the other 67,000 square foot facility outside of Austin, Texas and both projects are 100% leased for 15 years.","On the last call, we announced our first spec development project located in Southern California. As we discussed for the last few quarters, we've been closely watching select markets where fundamentals and growth prospects are robust, matched with our strategic land positions to potentially began spec development.","We broke ground on the Southern California project in June. The project will total 431,000 square feet in the Inland Empire West submarket. Interest in Southern California high quality distribution space remains strong with the Inland Empire second quarter vacancy dropping to 6.5%, which is reportedly the lowest ever, with the net absorption more than doubling from the first quarter, and rents are up roughly 3% since the first quarter as well.","With this backdrop, we are optimistic about the leasing prospects for this facility and expect roughly 100 to 125 basis point return premium over acquisition yields on this development. So, if you look at the quarter's development starts and exclude the Chino spec project, total project costs were $102 million and these buildings are 100% leased for an average of 14 years the high credit tenants with our average return over the terms at 7.9%.","I'd also like to announce two additional speculative projects that recently started. The first, a 600,000 square foot industrial facility in Indianapolis, which we designed to be expandable to 1 million square feet. As most of you are aware, Indianapolis has one of lowest overall vacancy rates in the U.S. at around 5.5% with Class A vacancy at about 4%. Moreover, the availability of large blocks of space in the overall market are virtually non-existent, complemented with (inaudible) reporting over a 4% growth in rents from the first quarter to the second quarter. We\u2019re strategically placing this facility in the northwest Indianapolis submarkets and our all points at Hanson Park. Though there are some \u2013 other speculative industrial development it's going on in the city, there is no other bulk warehouse building their plant in the northwest submarkets.","And finally, we also like to announce a new 158,000 square foot spec office building in Houston. The project is located on the final remaining eight acres of over 42 acres (inaudible) Keystone Crossing Park, in the northwest submarkets of Houston right on the 8.0 way. Given the proximity of the location to the energy corridor and Exxon campus and the booming energy industry, the submarket is strong demand by energy services providers and engineering firms, which is held drive, we just help drive the vacancy of our competitive set and submarkets less than 5%.","With these fundamentals, we believe it's the appropriate time to pursue a speculative office development in this market. This project will be developed in our joint venture with CBRE Realty Trust, which includes the adjacent building which is 100% leased.","As you\u2019ve heard from us for a number of quarters now these speculative projects have been strategically gone out and representative of the operational discipline at Duke Realty. Once again the strong Duke Realty development platform is showing great value creation opportunities as a real estate markets began to grow again.","I'll now turn the call over to Christie to discuss our financial results for the quarter.","Christie Kelly","Thanks, Denny. And good afternoon everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide an update on our second quarter financial performance as well under the progress on our capital strategy.","Our second quarter 2012 core FFO was $0.26 per share.","The improvement in Core FFO per share from $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2012 was mainly driven by an increase in average occupancy, higher lease termination fee income, as well as the full quarter savings on dividends related to the first quarter repayment of our Series M preferred shares.","First, as you can imagine, the timing of the lease buyouts is very hard to predict that we are generally recognized total termination fee income of $7.5 million to $15 million per year for the last couple of years. Our original guidance for the year was $5 million to $10 million, consistent with our normal run rate, and we still expect to be in that range.","Second, G&A expense in this quarter was a little higher than we would expect for a go forward run rate due to less overhead costs being absorbed into leasing and development for the second quarter. As the development starts that we have announced for the first half of the year, pickup in volumes, we expect more overhead to be absorbed and accordingly G&A expense to decrease slightly. We\u2019re comfortable with our G&A guidance that we have given of $38 million to $43 million for the year.","For the quarter, we generated $0.21 per share in AFFO, which translates into a conservative dividend payout ratio slightly below 81%. Our year-to-date payout ratio is below 83%. We are pleased with our operating results for the quarter and anticipate continued solid execution throughout the rest of the year.","Turning to the capital side of our business; we successfully generated new proceeds through several transitions during the quarter in an effort to lower our cost of capital and optimize on long-term debt maturities as well as fund the continued execution of our asset strategy.","In June, we took advantage of a favorable interest rate environment and successfully executed a $300 million offering of 10-year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.375% and an effective yield of 4.47%. The transaction reduced our weighted average cost of debt and further balanced the laddering of our maturity profile.","We're very pleased with the timing and execution of this transaction and appreciate the support of our fixed income investors. We utilized the proceeds from this offering to repay an $88 million secured loan and fund a portion of our acquisition activity for the quarter. We ended the quarter with $107 million of cash that we will be primarily utilized towards funding $171 million of third quarter debt maturities along with our development funding obligations.","In May 2012, we executed new ATM programs that allow for the issuance of up to $200 million worth of our common stock. During the second quarter of 2012, we issued approximately 311,000 shares of common stock under that program, generating net proceeds of approximately $4.4 million.","Thus far in July, we have issued an additional $2 million of our common shares, which generated net proceeds of approximately $29 million. We have been selective in utilizing our new ATM program and total issuance since the beginning of the second quarter including early July has been at an average stock price of $14.69.","We also generated 27 million of proceeds from non-strategic asset dispositions. We utilized the capital generated during the quarter to fund development activities as well as fund $100 million of property acquisitions, of which nearly all were high-quality bulk industrial properties. Our liquidity remains very solid when considering the fact that we have no borrowings outstanding on our $850 million line of credit and have very manageable debt maturities for the remainder of the year totaling $254 million.","I will conclude by saying that I am very happy with our progress in the second quarter as we continue to execute across all aspects of our strategies.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Denny.","Dennis D. Oklak","Thanks, Christie. Yesterday, we tightened our guidance for FFO per share to $0.98 to $1.06 for 2012 in recognition of our positive leasing activity and operational performance year-to-date. We continue to remain comfortable with the range of estimates for the key operating metrics we've provided to you in January. As alluded to you on the last call, we still expect to be near the high end of average occupancy because of the strong year-to-date start and the fact that we have only 3% of our leases expiring during the remainder of the year.","We are proceeding as expected with acquisitions and dispositions though the timing is a little weighted towards the end of the year. We also have a strong backlog of new development projects that we believe we can execute during the second half of the year. Most importantly, we are focused on executing our operating asset and capital strategies in undoubtedly more volatile economic climate these days. We firmly believe executing on our plan will strengthen the Duke Realty platform and provide for steady long-term earnings and dividend growth for the market cycles.","Thank you again for your support of Duke Realty and now we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We go to the line of Joshua Attie with Citi. Please go ahead.","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good afternoon. Can you tell us, give us more information on the termination fee, what it was related to, was it one tenant or several tenants?","Dennis D. Oklak","It was several tenants, I'd say it was a couple larger ones of \u2013 and one was in Raleigh were we terminated a tenant and immediately backfilled it with an other tenant, so that's really why we did \u2013 did it because we have the opportunity to \u2013 basically relocate an existing tenant into a larger space.","And then the second one was the project I mentioned up in Chicago where we had existing tenant that we relocated and expanded and as part of that they actually provided us a buyout on some of their space that they were leaving. So, it was \u2013 both the transactions were really good deals for us.","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you, and one more question, can you talk about the acquisitions that you made in the quarter? I know the initial yield is around 6.4% to those, do you have the opportunity to move that up over time, did some of those leases have escalations in them, and I guess how did you underwrite what the return would be on those assets over a period of time beyond just the initial yield?","Dennis D. Oklak","Yeah Josh, all of those assets have rental rate increases, it pretty much annual. Rental rate increase is built into them. I just \u2013 I\u2019d make a couple of comments on that because, again we are still finishing up our asset repositioning strategy when you look at it. so we\u2019ve got roughly $500 million to $600 million more of industrial growth to occur, we\u2019ve got about $500 million of additional suburban office to dispose off and then about $300 give or take million of retail to dispose off.","So we're still focused on getting to those targets by next year, which we\u2019ve been saying for a long time now. but we\u2019re being a little bit more selective as we go through and the volumes are lower, because we've done some very large transactions as you know over the last few years. And again, when we\u2019re trying to do that, I think we run into some timing issues. so a couple of things, we may be buying some things before we actually get our dispositions closed, but we really know where we\u2019re headed. So again, it's all part of that process.","So you may see us acquiring again a couple of stabilized assets that fit into our strategy before we've had a chance to sell some of our unstabilized assets. so it just looks a little different. I mean the truth is, we\u2019re really using the proceeds from our ATM to fund the new development starts, which is as I mentioned we\u2019re getting really good yields on those. If you look at our pipeline today, our average yield on those development projects is 8.25%. So we think that\u2019s really good accretive use of those funds. So I think that answers your question, but I also just really wanted to give some color on our thought process.","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","I guess also what I was driving at a little bit is what\u2019s the value creation story behind some of these acquisitions? It seems like they\u2019re fully leased and there are some embedded rent bumps, but the cap rate seems \u2013 it seems on surface to me to be a little bit full. Do you think the value creation comes from NOI growth or cap rate compression? I\u2019m just trying to understand how the value of these assets goes up two, three, four years from now and where that increasing value comes from?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Yeah. So going back, there are two things. Yes, clearly NOI growth in these, and again they\u2019re all in real strong markets. so we think we\u2019ll get very good NOI growth there. but then my other point is we\u2019re still selling some assets that even though they might not match up on a quarter-by-quarter basis, they\u2019re going to match up. and as we've been saying and as we've proven, we're not diluting our AFFO as we reposition the portfolio. so sometimes you will see us buy a stabilized asset that we think it\u2019s a great long-term asset, and it's just not matched up, let's say, a suburban office disposition, but again we're still looking at it that way that it's part of the non-dilutive repositioning that we're still going through.","Joshua Attie \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go to the line of Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good afternoon. Looking at the medical office development pipeline both existing and perspective, how much of that would say is repeat business?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, a fair amount of that Paul, is repeat business, but we're really pleased that we started a new relationship with Scott & White Healthcare in Central Texas this year. And they had not been really a customer before and we\u2019ve got in relationship and we've started two projects with them as I mentioned, and we've got a couple more coming. So that's an example of repeat business. But then again I think a lot of the other starts, we continue to start various projects for Baylor or Baylor-affiliated companies. So it\u2019s really been sort of a nice mix of repeat customers and now we're also adding some new ones there.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Okay. And could you also just talk about just the overall environment for medical office development? Is it very fragmented like the industrial development landscape might be?","Dennis D. Oklak","","I would say, it's not anywhere near as fragmented as industrial, but industrial, as you know, is very fragmented when you look from market-to-market. But there is a number of developers out there, and I'll just say a number of high quality developers out there, but it's certainly a lesser number when you look around the country than you find on the industrial side.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","And has there been a shakeout among those developers over the last cycle like there has been elsewhere in real estate?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Yeah, I would say a little bit so. I think the number is down. There has been some consolidation and again a few of those private developers like in the other product types or at least that we\u2019ve seen I'd say on the industrial and suburban office side really aren\u2019t around anymore. So I think the number of folks out there is less.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Okay. And finally, just looking at the spec industrial development, maybe you could generalize and just tell us what your kind of qualitative and quantitative criteria for pulling the trigger on a spec industrial might be?","Dennis D. Oklak","","On a spec industrial?","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Yeah.","Dennis D. Oklak","","Again, I would say we\u2019re obviously not doing a lot of it. We\u2019ve only started one and now have just a couple of others in the pipeline, so we're being very selective. and again, I think that market rates and some of these markets have begun to move up market rental rates. So I think we're seeing some ability to start these developments. but just on a bottom line basis, I would tell you, our yield requirements on spec developments probably, it's somewhere between 100 basis points and 150 basis points above what we think the market cap rates are today. So we're still getting that spread. It's just that today cap rates are pretty low and especially on the industrial side, I would say in most of these markets, so our developed yields are a little bit lower than they would have historically been, but I\u2019d tell you we\u2019ll be getting above the same spread somewhere in that 100 basis points to 150 basis points range.","Paul Adornato \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Dennis D. Oklak","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","","And our next question comes from James Feldman with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch","Hey, thank you. A couple of questions, I guess the first sticking with development. If you look at your balance sheet and see how CIP has grown over the last couple of quarters, how do you think about the level of where you\u2019d be comfortable growing the development pipeline too? It seems like I mean we\u2019ve doubled since last quarter, actually doubled each in the last three quarters starting from a pretty low base, but how should we think about that?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, I think two things about that, Jamie. One is, I\u2019m really pleased with that development pipeline because as we said it\u2019s 86% leased basically when we started. So the risk profile of that development pipeline is really very low right now, because we are being very conscious on spec, but we\u2019re also watching the overall level of our development pipeline. And we\u2019re really very focused on keeping that no more than about 7%, 8% of our overall balance sheet. And I don't think you're going to see it get any bigger than that.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And then can you talk about the depth of interest in both the MOB \u2013 build-to-suit pipeline and warehouse?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Yeah. I would say it's good, very reasonably good right now. It\u2019s probably down a little bit from what we saw six months ago just because we\u2019ve signed several deals. So our pipeline was bigger, but the good news is we actually got those deals signed. Today there is a lot of talk going on build-to-suit warehouse business and we\u2019ll see how real some of these are, sometimes it's a little hard to tell when you are making proposals whether they're really real. But I think it's pretty strong, and I would say it's very strong on the medical office side of the business. There is a lot of activity going on. And I think our sense is, now that we're a couple of years into this Affordable Care Act and now that it\u2019s been upheld by the Supreme Court. The healthcare systems are prepared and starting to look at the things that they need to do in their business and how these changes will affect them. And they\u2019re starting to make some commitments for growth, the new facilities to take that into account.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch","","So when you say very strongly, what\u2019s like the total magnitude, what's out? I know you\u2019ve said in the past, the different institutions will only pick one developer to kind of limit how much you can really do, so like what do you think is your potential pipeline?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, I think our backlog of prospects, we\u2019ve been starting \u2013 we started about $200 million last year, $175 million, $200 million of medical office, which was down from where we were pre-downturn, but that was still our highest year in a couple of years. This year, we\u2019re already well over $100 million of new development starts. I would tell you, our backlog today is probably $200 million to $300 million of prospects that are out there that we\u2019re working on, which I would consider very strong.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Do you think that it grows a lot more after \u2013 let me think, kind of after the election and things seem a little more settled than on the legislative environment or that\u2019s about a good run rate?","Dennis D. Oklak","","I think that\u2019s about a good run rate. I don\u2019t see any of those factors really causing it to change one way or the other very significantly. But again, I think that $200 million to $300 million of kind of backlog at any one time, projects we\u2019re working on there is really a good run rate.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And then finally for Christie, you had mentioned I think an 80%, 81% dividend payout ratio on AFFO. How should we think about the prospects for dividend growth and where you\u2019re comfortable with that ratio?","Christie Kelly","","I think Jamie, as we sit today we\u2019re very comfortable with the conservative nature of our business and keeping that dividend payout ratio in accordance with our guidance. And then as we move forward, in 2013 and beyond, I think you can expect us to re-look at the dividend.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch","","And the growth rate kind of in line with AFFO?","Christie Kelly","","Yes.","James Feldman \u2013 Bank of America\/ Merrill Lynch","Growth, okay, all right. Great, thank you.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go to the line of Brendan Maiorana with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks, good afternoon. Question for you guys and I apologize, because I jumped on a little bit late. So I\u2019m not sure if you addressed this. But it looked like the leasing volumes on the bulk side were a little bit light, and I think we\u2019re in; expirations were a little light as well. But I\u2019m just wondering, are you guys seeing any sluggishness, any slowdown because of some of the macro concerns that are out there specific on the bulk side?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Brendan, I would say that I think this was kind of a relatively normal quarter for us at overall 5 million square feet of leasing just under 4 million on the bulk. We just came off such a high quarter in the first quarter it looks down, but that 8.6 million square feet of leasing we did in the first quarter was pretty much a record quarter for us. So that $5 million to $5.5 million range is pretty standard for us. So and then the other thing, I\u2019d point out is that leasing activity probably is going to slow some as our occupancy gets up, just the level of leasing activity because we\u2019re now 93.6% leased in the bulk industrial. So you\u2019re just not going to have as much, which is a good thing.","So and then back just to the overall comments, I would say we haven\u2019t felt any real slowdown. I mean you never know everything is a little bit cyclical. It seems like anymore we always get a little bit of summer doldrums when we head into it. My guess is July, I haven\u2019t seen our July numbers, but my guess is a little bit slower and August would be slower. But I think that\u2019s just cyclicality right now.","So today, I would say we have no indication that third or fourth quarter overall are going to be pretty much on line. But we\u2019ll probably have a better idea that after Labor Day, because things just do tend to slowdown anymore in the summer. But really, activity has been pretty good. But again, as we\u2019ve gotten more leased up and we have less vacant inventory out there, the deals just aren\u2019t as frequent, which is fine.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Is the balance of the space that you have to lease up, as you kind of lease up your space, I imagine you lease up the stuff as easiest quickest, is what\u2019s remaining because you don\u2019t have that much left a little over 6% on the bulk side. Is it just a more challenged space to lease up and so it\u2019s going to be a tougher goal a bit from here?","Dennis D. Oklak","","No, not necessarily, but I would say there\u2019s not many big spaces left. I\u2019ll tell you we got \u2013 I\u2019m not even sure we have any over a 0.5 million square feet. I think maybe around 300,000 square feet is probably our biggest vacancy. And some of that vacancy is still in the new products, so getting the last 250,000 square foot space filled. So I would say, no, it\u2019s not of lower quality, if you want to call it space. It\u2019s just smaller spaces, which the activity has been pretty solid on, but not as good as the larger bulk spaces.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay. And then it looked like the bankruptcies were high this quarter as well at least on a square footage basis, is there anything anomalous that happened in the quarter that caused that number to spike up?","Dennis D. Oklak","","We have one in Dallas, a home furniture in about, I think it was 378,000 square feet in a warehouse that did file bankruptcy and terminated this quarter. So it was a little bit of larger one. And I would say it\u2019s been a little bit surprising to me. We\u2019ve had a couple of surprised bankruptcies this year that we weren\u2019t expecting and it really had stabilized through latter half of 2010 and 2011. But the first six months of this year, it picked backup a little bit. And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a sign of anything, it could be \u2013 it\u2019s only in a couple of places. But we did see that and that\u2019s the one that occurred in the second quarter. But the good news is we\u2019ve got really good activity on that space. So I think we\u2019ll get a backflow pretty quickly, because I guess that probably is our biggest space we\u2019ve got out there now.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay, it\u2019s helpful. And then just as we think about the balance of the year, and I know you were talking with Jamie about the development pipeline. As we look forward, do you think this proportion of limited spec, and mostly built-to-suit is likely to persist for the balance of this year and into next year or if the market and the economic kind of chunks along at this sort of slow recovery space, or do you think that if conditions hold us, there are in a new supply and risk is low that you guys will continue to expand the spec development in the market to where it make sense?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, I think for the rest of this year and on into the first part of next year anyway it\u2019s going to stay pretty much as it is. Pretty limited spec development and more on the built-to-suit side, I think we\u2019ll get some more built-to-suit. Again, as I mentioned on the medical office, pipeline is pretty big. So I think we\u2019ll get some more of those signed. And it\u2019s hard to paint a picture that we\u2019ll do in the next six months or so, any more than one or two more spec projects if that many.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Sure. and then just last one, any difference, what\u2019s the premium, I know you talked about the premium on spec versus market cap rates, the 100 to 150. What\u2019s the differential when you\u2019re looking at the built-to-suit return versus spec?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s probably 50 to 75 basis points today, because in this environment the build-to-suit industrial development is going on out there. With the competition today, there isn\u2019t a huge spread over what acquisition yields are going for. If you\u2019ve got a long-term lease with a high-credit tenant, you\u2019re only looking at maybe 50 plus or minus basis points spread over what the market acquisition cap rates are. So again, if you got to say acquisition cap rates then go up 50 for a build-to-suit and up another 75 to 100 for spec.","Brendan Maiorana \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go to the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research","Thank you. Turning to your development side, how would you gauge the value creation on, maybe if you had to split up between industrial and medical office. I mean I do see that your expected total yield is about low 7s. But if you had to split up between the two different segments, what do you think those are worth in the open market, once stabilized?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, I would say again, I think you\u2019ve got that 125 basis point and 150 basis points spread over today\u2019s values, what cap rates would be. And maybe a little bit less than that on the build-to-suits today, but I think pretty much on the medical office stuff. It\u2019s probably that in the 150 basis point range. Maybe a little bit less than that, maybe more than 100 basis points range on these industrial build-to-suits today.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research","","And can you remind us on your land beings, how much of that has been written down, and based on impaired values does it? How far are we from making that land being more viable for development?","Christie Kelly","","Ki Bin, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. We started back in 2009. If you remember, we took a significant impairment on our bills or held-for-sales property. And to that point, as we\u2019re holding our land today, we\u2019ve took probably a 33% write-down, and overall we\u2019re looking at holding our land at $0.77 on the $1. And where we are right now, we\u2019ve got $0.5 billion that we\u2019re holding for development going forward split 70% towards industrial and 30% towards office in alignment with our strategy.","Dennis D. Oklak","","That land is really where we\u2019re starting those spec industrial projects and the spec office project that we started down in Houston, and then also a lot of our build-to-suit activities occurring on that land too.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research","","Okay.","Christie Kelly","That\u2019s right.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research","So, on the remaining portion on land, I know it\u2019s kind of a tough question. But on average, within industrial piece first because I guess is most of it from a market rent standpoint, how far are we from hitting that hurdle rate?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, I would say, again, there is two pieces of land. What Christie mentioned was the stuff that we just decided we weren\u2019t going to develop and we\u2019re not holding for sale and we did impair that. And I would say, almost three years now since we did that we probably sold about 20% to 25% of that land at basically right at or a little above the impaired value.","Then the rest of that land, which is in the neighborhood of $0.5 billion, I would tell you that for the most part today\u2019s rental rates could probably support development on there. The real issue is demand. There is still just not enough demand in most of these markets for us to feel comfortable starting a spec development, because it\u2019s just going to take too long to fill it. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far off on the land as far as rental rates. Again, I think it\u2019s just what\u2019s really going on in the markets.","Christie Kelly","Yeah.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 Macquarie Research","All right. Thank you.","Christie Kelly","Thank you, Ki Bin.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Denny, what stabilize cap rate do you think you could achieve on the both distribution building and Chino if you were to sell that today?","Dennis D. Oklak","Probably, somewhere around 5, 5.25.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And Christie, sorry to belabor the point, I wasn\u2019t quite sure, I wanted to make sure that I understood exactly what you were saying about the land, and I guess for starters on the $500 million that you do intend to build on, did you say that you are carrying that at \u2013 so you\u2019ve taken at 30% impairment on that land or the write-down was only on the non-core land?","Christie Kelly","Non-core land, John.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. And I thought, I heard you say that the 70\/30 split was 70% industrial and 30% office did you \u2013 I presume in medical office?","Christie Kelly","No, it\u2019s office, not medical John.","Dennis D. Oklak","Yeah, John we really don\u2019t have any land to speak of on medical office. That\u2019s almost always built on the hospital campuses with the long-term land lease. Again, the office land that we still own, I would say a couple of things on that. We still have land in the markets where we have office, places like South Florida and Raleigh, and some parcels in some of our Midwest offices like Indianapolis.","We also have some land that we talked about last year left in those markets where we sold basically all of the assets to Blackstone. And so, at this point in time, our plan is to develop that when it makes sense, but it\u2019s pretty much all build-to-suit activity. And just again as an example, we had a parcel land, we sold all the Atlanta assets to Blackstone, but we had a parcel land up in North Atlanta, up in Gwinnett County and we are doing the Primerica build-to-suit on that.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Got it, okay. And then how much \u2013 what\u2019s the annualized NOI from the retail holdings?","Dennis D. Oklak","Mark has got\u2026","Christie Kelly","Yeah, I think we\u2019ve got that in\u2026","Dennis D. Oklak","It\u2019s not a huge piece right now. If you look at year-to-date, our total was about $5.5 million for the first six months.","Mark A. Denien","For the quarter, it\u2019s about $5.5 million.","Dennis D. Oklak","I\u2019m sorry, for the quarter. So, about $5.5 million for the quarter, so it\u2019s about $20 million to $25 million, John.","Christie Kelly","That\u2019s perfect.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, yeah that makes sense. And then lastly, just a housekeeping question, Christie, was the lease termination fee in the same store results for the quarter?","Christie Kelly","No, it wasn\u2019t, John.","John Stewart \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, thank you.","Christie Kelly","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","And we have a follow-up from the line Joshua Attie with Citi. Please go ahead.","Christie Kelly","Hey, Josh.","","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Can you hear me?","Christie Kelly","Yeah, go ahead.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Perfect. That\u2019s Michael Bilerman. I had my phone on mute.","Christie Kelly","Hi, Mike.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","On Page 28, just the development pipeline, so out of that $460 million of projected costs, how much capitalized G&A and capitalized interest is embedded into that cost?","Dennis D. Oklak","It\u2019s a little hard to say, because it\u2019s all over the board project-by-project. But I would tell you capitalized G&A, it\u2019s roughly in line with fees that we pay to outside providers. So, typically if you were to assume in there 3% development fee and 2% or 3% construction, management fee, so 5% or 6%. That\u2019s roughly the kind of overhead, maybe a little bit less than that. And then interest, that just depends on the length of the project. So, I don\u2019t think there is any rule of thumb on the interest capitalization, but I would say as far as the operating overhead, probably 5%.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","And that\u2019s 5% of development cost, not of revenues, correct?","Dennis D. Oklak","That\u2019s right, 5% of project cost.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","So that\u2019s probably between the two, this yield is being depressed upwards to probably 50 basis points, 60 basis points from the capitalization of those costs.","Dennis D. Oklak","Yeah, I suppose. I don\u2019t think we ever look at it that way, because those are true part of the project costs, but you\u2019re right, yeah.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","And then, Christie, I think you said the G&A, you\u2019re going to start capitalizing more. Can you just give us a sense of how much G&A has been capitalized year-to-date? And then how much you expect for the full-year, just as we start to \u2013 obviously this is affecting FFO and obviously affects the yield on the development pipeline?","Christie Kelly","Yeah, I think the way I look at that, Michael, is if you look at our guidance of G&A, and there were just some comments as it relates to the quarter being a little bit higher. What I was just trying to articulate is the fact that it\u2019s really gets down to timing, and timing of the development starts that we announced together with looking at the lease up.","And when you look at the overall range that we gave for the year being between $43 million and $38 million, we\u2019re really comfortable with that G&A. And we\u2019ll be right at the mid-point to maybe even a little bit better, depending on how the developments unwind here throughout the second half of the year, which has got some nice momentum on it.","Dennis D. Oklak","I don\u2019t have in front of me exactly what the dollar amount of what we\u2019ve capitalized so far this year. But again, I would say for mostly on the construction development side, it\u2019s roughly 5% of our volume that we have during the year...","Christie Kelly","That\u2019s good, when you look at it.","Dennis D. Oklak","Just to put it in perspective, we\u2019ll probably have 500, maybe a little bit more of construction volume this year. And then there is some related to the leasing fees that we have. That number is a little harder to pinpoint, but it\u2019s just based on leasing volume and again sort of probably kind of a 50% of what market leasing commissions would be is what we capitalized there. So, hopefully that helps.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","And then just on the Chino project. What\u2019s the development cost on that?","Dennis D. Oklak","","I think it\u2019s about $25 million or something like that of the total project cost on that project, yeah $25 million.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","Okay. And so you were saying that the development the 7.4% goes to 7.9% excluding it. How does that work or did I not hear you\u2019re right?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Say that again.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","I thought we had heard that you said the development pipeline, excluding Chino would move up 7.9% relative to the 7.4%, but that just seems way too big of a spread for us?","Dennis D. Oklak","","No. I said the 7.9% was sort of our average yield over the leased term.","Christie Kelly","Yeah.","Dennis D. Oklak","And they were basically 100% leased high credit tenants and on a long-term leases. So that excludes Chino altogether.","Christie Kelly","","Yeah, and I want to circle back on that comment really quickly, which might help with some of this in perspective. I just want to \u2013 just roll back the clock to \u201809 when we really started to articulate the asset strategy. Since then we\u2019ve invested over $2.5 billion in our business. And in terms of those investment dollars, about 30% of those investment dollars have gone towards over 90% leased product, quality product with high credit tenants, and 70% of those dollars have been allocated towards developments both build-to-suit and spec, as well as opportunities where we\u2019ve got lease up in the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done like Premier.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","The 7.9% reference is what the $416 million of developments on Page 28, excluding Chino?","Dennis D. Oklak","","No, no, the $102 million that we started this quarter excluding Chino on a GAAP basis.","Mark A. Denien","","So the 7.4% on Page 28, is a cash basis for a whole pipeline. The 7.9% is the GAAP basis on the second quarter start excluding Chino.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","So, even though that has protected stabilized yield, that\u2019s projected stabilized yield \u2013 cash yield?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Cash on year one, year-end.","Mark A. Denien","","Other 19.25 is the GAAP yield over the turnover lease.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","Got it, got it. Just last question just on the $261 million of acquisitions year-to-date that a 5.6 \u2013 at a 6.6 cap rate. The rents are about $5, they\u2019re obviously 96% leased. What are market rents? What is the average lease duration for those assets?","Dennis D. Oklak","","For the acquisitions?","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","Yeah, just looking at this on Page 30, right you did $261 million in terms of the total dollars you\u2019ve to put into them and them 6.6 yield that works out to about $5 gross rent and that rent or net rent 96% occupied. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what the lease duration is of that and where market rents are for that space?","Dennis D. Oklak","","Well, I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me, but I\u2019ll tell you that I think roughly that\u2019s probably a \u2013 it\u2019s a longer term average lease term based on the kind of assets we\u2019re buying so it\u2019s probably six or seven years.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","","You think that net rent is at or below or above market?","Dennis D. Oklak","","I would say pretty much at, but again, they all have annual ramp ups.","Michael Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll go to the line of Jason Jones with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Jason Jones \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hey, guys. I was just looking for a quick update on where you stand on your \u2013 just thoughts on your current balance sheet metrics and where you see those kind of trending over time?","Christie Kelly","","Sure Jason, this is Christie. Just to talk a little bit about the balance sheet metrics. As it relates to overall leverage, we ended June at about 48% effective leverage, and we\u2019re driving over the long-term portion of our strategy to move that to 45%. It was up a little bit here in the first quarter just because we took advantage of the market on the $300 million unsecured offering that we did.","And specifically as it relates to coverage, we ended the quarter at 1.81 times fixed charge coverage, and over the long-term, we\u2019re driving that coverage ratio above 2, and then we\u2019ll be driving that further as we drive into the end of 2013. And then looking at debt plus preferred to EBITDA, we ended June at a little over 8, tick over 8. And we\u2019ve been really looking to take down our more expensive preferred and we\u2019ll be doing so in February on the [odes] that are out there and we\u2019ll be looking to drive our debt plus preferred to EBITDA to below 7.75, here in the long-term over our capital strategy, so nice progress, strengthening balance sheet, and we remain focused on it.","Jason Jones \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Great, thanks.","Christie Kelly","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","","And we have no further questions.","Dennis D.

Welcome to the Duke Realty Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a questions-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2012 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our thoughts on the overall real estate operating environment and how it is affecting us, Jim Connor will give you an update on our leasing activity and development status, I will review our recycling activity and Mark will then address our third quarter financial performance and progress on our capital strategy. ","We followed up with the positive momentum in the first two quarters with continued strength across all areas of our business. We signed over 6.2 million square feet of leases in the third quarter and we achieved a 54% tenant retention rate with more of the square footage expiring already back filled as we indicated by our overall increase in occupancy.","We started $76 million of development projects across industrial, medical office and suburban office projects with a weighted average stabilized yield of 8.3%. Three of our four new development starts are 100% pre-leased build-to-suites with the four a multi tenant project that is already 64% pre-leased. I will touch on the development in a little more detail shortly. ","Our in-service increased 35 basis points from last quarter to 93.5% while our overall portfolio occupancy increased 30 basis points at quarter end to 93.4%. I am happy to report that all product types contributed to this overall increase in occupancy. ","We made continued progress on our asset repositioning strategy during the quarter, generating $73 million of proceeds from non-strategic property and land dispositions with the portion of proceeds being recycled into two high quality industrial facilities, we acquired for $39 million. Mark will speak more in depth on our capital activities in a moment. ","I\u2019ll now touch a little bit on the overall market conditions we\u2019re experiencing and how this is affecting our business. In spite of GDP mumbling along between 1.5% to 2% in continued uncertainty coming from Washington DC, we saw improved fundamentals across all of our product types and in most markets during the quarter. Starting on the industrial side, leasing has remain strong as reflected by another 10 to 20 basis point drop in national vacancy rates during the third quarter to the 8% range, with improving rent growth prospects. This decrease in overall vacancy has certainly been aided by the still relatively low level of new supply.","But nonetheless leading indicators such as trucking rail and the ISM have shown increasing strength which bodes well for a continuation of solid industrial demand. We also continue to see more relative strength in the big box industrial product. In particular, the trends in e-commerce are firmly intact with direct business to consumer retail sales expected to grow 20% per year, which is driving steady incremental demand for larger, modern fulfilment distribution centers primarily between about 300,000 and 1 million square feet.","And obviously Duke Realty is clearly a national leader in the ability to facilitate tenant expansion and the ongoing ability to efficiently operate modern bulk industrial facilities. 40% of our existing portfolio, our buildings over 500,000 square feet which has a current occupancy level of about 97%. The remaining 60% of our industrial portfolio represents buildings less than 500,000 square feet and are just under 93%. So, obviously we have some additional upside in our overall industrial occupancy of about another 100 basis points or so. In addition, we have entitled land positions in major distribution markets on which we can develop another 50 million square feet of bulk industrial product. ","With respect to leasing in our in-service portfolio, we continue to see fundamentals improve that the completion of nearly 4.1 million square feet of leases for the quarter. Bulk industrial in-service occupancy rose to 94.6%, 23 basis points above the previous quarter and nearly 70 basis points above a year ago. 13 of our 22 book markets are now over 95% leased with 5 under 90%.","As we stated last year, the lack of available large block space in key distribution markets is generating growth opportunities in our development business and improves our position to push rents. ","Moving to medical office and starting from a macro level, we consistently stated that the commencement of The Affordable Care Act will only help the demand for new outpatient facilities as these types of facilities will help health systems lower cost of care and handle the increase and short individuals coming into the system. This is proving to be true as we see high demand from major customers, through our facilities to handle these new patients. ","Finally, the suburban office sector has continue to show more positive trends, although national vacancies are in the mid to high teens, net absorption stayed positive for the 14th consecutive quarter and rental rates per square foot are up a few percentage points since the end of last year after nearly five years of stagnant rent. Similar to last quarter we've had increasing momentum in suburban office leasing and place in the context of our active disposition program. Our quarterly average same property occupancy is up 150 basis points over the prior year. Overall in-service portfolio occupancy at quarter end now stands at 87.2 which is up 72 basis points from the prior quarter. ","Now I'll turn it over to Jim Connor to give a little more color on our leasing activity and development pipeline.","Jim Connor ","Well thank you. Good afternoon everybody. We\u2019ll start off on the industrial side, several notable deals that we executed this quarter include two new leases in our distribution parks down in Dallas. The first one was a 378,000 square foot new lease with Continental Tire that backfilled the space where we had a prior tenant bankruptcy. Then in the second space was a 263,000 square foot new lease with Anna\u2019s Linens that brings our Dallas industrial portfolio to over 98% leased. We also had a lot of strong activity in the Indianapolis market. We signed a new lease with Genco for 309,000 square feet in airport submarket. We also executed two large renewal leases in Indianapolis one was an auto supplier for 520,000 square feet and the other was a third part of logistics company for 383,000 feet. ","Across our entire portfolio we signed 70 industrial leases this quarter, a level that exceeds even our expectations to lead in the second half of the year. And I would tell you that the industrial leasing prospects look bright for the remainder of the year.","With improved lease fundamentals we've signed nearly 1.4 million square foot of leases in our suburban office portfolio. Some of the most notable deals include 58,000 square foot lease with Farmers Insurance in our South Florida market. Similar to last quarter, we had strong leasing activity in the Midwest suburban office portfolios.","Most notably in St. Louis, we signed an 87,000 square foot lease renewal with [Etna]. In Indianapolis, we signed a 75,000 square foot lease renewal with the major accounting firm. And in Cincinnati we signed a 64,000 square foot lease renewal with UBS Financial.","On the medical office side, our in-service portfolio was up 85 basis points reflected by strong leasing activity across the quarter, portfolio.","I\u2019m pleased to report that our development starts are continuing at a steady pace after $222 million of starts in the first two quarters. We started over $76 million in developments across four projects during the third quarter. The starts are diversified mix of industrial, medical office and suburban office and both ground up development and expansion projects.","On the industrial side, we started a 534,000 square foot build-to-suit in our West Jefferson Park in Columbus, Ohio. That facility is leased to 10 years to Ace Hardware and will service their supply distribution center for the Midwest retail outlets. The second industrial start was a 52,000 square foot expansion of our grand warehouse project in the O'Hare submarket of Chicago. For both of those projects the stabilized yields are projected to be in the high 7% range.","On the suburban office side, we started another speculative project in our Raleigh Perimeter Park development. Perimeter 3 which is 204,000 square feet is 64% pre-leased. Many of you remember that earlier this year we started Perimeter 2 in Raleigh. Perimeter 2 is now 91% pre-leased and scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2014. Our Raleigh team has a strong list of top quality prospects for the remainder of the spacing of these two projects and our existing portfolio of Raleigh is also 97%, so demand is strong. We expect to earn stabilized yields on both of these projects in excess of 9%.","Finally our fourth start was a 49,000 square foot on-campus medical office development in Cincinnati. The facility is 100% pre-leased for 15 years to the healthcare system backed by Good Samaritan Hospital, which is a AA rated credit.","Our total development pipeline as of September 30th stands at 2.3 million square feet totaling $391 million of stabilized cost and 85% pre-leased. We are projecting a weighted average stabilized yield of 7.9% and average yield over the initial lease term of 8.9%. We\u2019re also pleased to announce we signed another build-to-suit project with Amazon on our industrial ground in the Port of Baltimore. This represents our third building in excess of 1 million square feet that we signed with Amazon in the past 24 months. Construction has already started on that project.","Let me conclude on the development side by saying that our development platform is a key growth driver for Duke Realty. We have strategic land bank, exceptional relationships and a reputation in the market that will allow us to continue to create value to our development platform over the long-term.","And now I will turn it back over to Denny to cover our recycling activities.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Jim. During the quarter we recycled our disposition proceeds into two very high quality industrial facilities totaling $38.8 million. The first was a 343,000 square foot modern bulk facility in the I-81 Corridor in Central Pennsylvania. Facility is 100% leased to Kimberley Clark with the remaining lease term of six years and annual rental escalations of 2.5%. The building is five years and designed for today\u2019s modern logistic needs including cross-docking and extra trailer storage.","The second acquisition during the quarter was a 110,000 square foot newly build industrial facility in the South Bay submarket of Southern California. The project is strategically located in the New Douglas Park Brownfield redevelopment adjacent to the [Vero] Beach Airport. This submarket has maintained our occupancy levels of over 96% over the last 10 years and currently stands at 98.5% leased. The acquired facility is under a 10 year lease with solid 2% rent bumps. We believe both of these very high quality one-off acquisitions during the quarter represents strong risk-adjusted investments as we continue our asset recycling.","Moving to dispositions, during the quarter we sold two non-core properties totaling about $45 million, the largest of which was a 205,000 square foot medical office building located in Northern Indiana which we referenced last quarter. The other property was a small non-strategic vacant industrial facility located in Chicago. The remaining $27 million of disposition proceeds were from land sales. As reference on last quarter's call, we closed on the sale of a 32 acre office land parcel in Washington DC and also sold 33 acres of office land located in Minneapolis, Indianapolis and Atlanta markets. As noted on the last call, we feel very good about executing additional land sales in the fourth quarter for our revised land sales guidance at prices well in excess of book value. ","I\u2019d like to point out that for the year we sold $465 million of non-strategic properties at an in place cap rate of 6.23% and redeployed those proceeds in strategic acquisitions of $472 million at an in place cap rate of 6.24%. So we have effectively matched up our capital and in place NOI dollar-for-dollar loss substantially increasing the quality of our portfolio and reallocating proceeds to bulk industrial assets.","Also on the cash or AFFO basis, these transactions are accretive as the CapEx requirements for the acquired properties are less than the sold properties. We continue to progress on our Midwest suburban office sale. To-date we have $84 million of sales in St. Louis under firm contracts which we expect to close in November. We also have signed letters of intent and buyers are underway on due diligence on about $110 million of properties in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Chicago, which we expect to finalize and close in December. And finally, we\u2019re in advanced negotiations on another portfolio in Cincinnati totaling about a $150 million, which we believe will proceed and likely close in early 2014.","These transactions represent the entire portfolio that we marketed. We've also marketed our portfolio of medical office assets specifically assets that were older or less strategic due to limited future development opportunities with the health systems leasing the properties. The portfolio consists of 17 medical office assets totaling about 938,000 square feet located primarily in the Midwest. Portfolio marketed has an average age of 9.4 years compared with our overall medial office portfolio age of 6.8 years. After receiving several strong offers we've recently accepted an offer on the entire portfolio. We're in early stages of due diligence but expect this portfolio sale to close before year-end and expect proceed to be above $250 million.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and capital plans.","Mark Denien"," ","Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everyone. As Denny mentioned, I would like to provide an update on our third quarter financial performance, as well as the progress on our capital strategy. Core FFO for the third quarter of 2013 was $0.28 per share compared with $0.27 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Core FFO this quarter reflected the continued improvement in portfolio operations, the highlight of which was positive same property NOI growth for the 12 and 3 months ended September 30th of 4.3% and 4.4% respectively.","This positive performance due to the strong leasing the last few quarters driving an increase in occupancy across all product types along with growth and rental rates and rent escalations built into our leases. Our growth in overall average net effective rent on renewals was about 2.6% for the quarter. We had very strong growth of 8% on industrial renewals. Our strong current occupancy levels in high asset quality is allowing to push rents in almost all markets on the industrial side. This is the ninth quarter in a row that we had positive rent growth on industrial renewals and we expect this trend to continue as over 50% of our industrial lease expirations over the next 15 months were signed between 2008 and 2011. So we expect significant growth as those leases roll. ","Not surprisingly, we did experience a slight roll down in the rents on suburban office renewals. We generated $0.22 per share in AFFO, compared to $0.24 per share of AFFO for the second quarter of 2013. Due to the anticipated timing of our lease related CapEx towards the second half of the year related to the occupancy [entrees] just mentioned, AFFO per share this quarter was in line with our expectations. ","In summary, we are pleased with another strong quarter of operating results and anticipate continued solid execution during the fourth quarter.","Now I will quickly recap the capital transactions for the quarter. We repaid six secured loans totaling $77 million, which had an average effective interest rate of 5.6%. In the process, we unencumbered about a $162 million of properties to enhance our financial flexibility and credit profile.","As Denny mentioned, we generated $73 million of proceeds from non-strategic asset dispositions during the quarter. Disposition activity outpaced acquisitions for the quarters we purchased two industrial properties for $39 million. We finished the quarter with about $210 million outstanding on our $850 million line of credit, compared to $88 million outstanding on the revolver at June 30.","Given our strong expected fourth quarter disposition activity Denny alluded to, we expect to use the proceeds from these dispositions to repay our outstanding line balance and fund fourth quarter development activity. This will put us in a solid liquidity position heading into 2014, not to mention that we don\u2019t have any debt maturities of significance until August of 2014.","We achieved improvements in our key leverage metrics during the third quarter as well with the fixed charge coverage ratio now over 2.0 for the rolling 12 months ended September 30, compared to 1.9 for the rolling 12 months ended June 30. Fixed charge coverage for just the third quarter exceeded 2.1 times, which is more reflected of our current leverage profile.","I would also like to point out that these metrics will continue to improve over the coming quarters simply by completing our development projects that are currently under construction given that they are 85% leased in the aggregate and the balance sheet already reflects the substantial portion of the cost having been incurred without the benefit of the earnings. ","I will conclude by saying that I am very pleased that we've continued the strong trend in operating results for the third quarter, we've continued to execute our asset plan and we've completed a few capital transactions to further improve our credit ratios. We're confident we will meet our year-end capital strategy goals that we originally set.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Mark. Yesterday we reaffirmed our guidance of FFO for 2013 at $1.07 to $1.11 per share based on our solid operating performance thus far. In closing, after a solid quarter we believe our value creation story is firing on all cylinders with excellent leasing result, improving rent growth prospects, all the asset repositioning and development activities in an improving credit profile. Thank you again for your support of Duke Realty. And with that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question, we will go to line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess the first question is you guys like you are on pretty good tract here fundamentally, why not take the guidance up given that you just kind of kept your range?","Denny Oklak","","Well, I would say Jamie, our range is fairly tight with $0.04 you know. You never know when a transaction is going to take you up to higher level in the mid-point. So I think we are very comfortable with just a $0.04 guidance and we only got three more months to figure out what it actually will be.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I don\u2019t how much (inaudible) you can give around Amazon, but can you talk a little bit about the economics in the size and I guess even more importantly what are they doing with that space? And what is the safer kind of future demand and especially demand from that kind of tenant?","Denny Oklak","Let me start by saying, we really can\u2019t talk much about obviously with confidentiality agreements with Amazon as far as many details of the overall transaction. When we report our fourth quarter activity what we can disclose would be included in that. And Jim why don\u2019t you talk about a little bit about the nature of the facility and what we\u2019re really seeing in the e-commerce area to that.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","I am not sure, Denny,","Jim Connor","","Well, I am sure most of you are aware of e-commerce continues to grow dramatically. We\u2019ve all seen the projections, currently comprises 9% of retail sales and is projected to go north of 20 in the coming years. That is obviously fueling a great deal of warehouse demand. Amazon continues to lead the charge with the large million square foot facilities. By and large they are all generally build to suits. They are all fulfillment centers of some sort. They are also engaging in some smaller facilities. We are starting to see come around the marketplace. We have not completed any of those, but I think you will see in addition to Amazon you are starting to see a lot of other major retailers move into dedicated e-commerce distribution facilities. The other buzzword that we are seeing around the industry is on the channel distribution centers where major retailers are distributing to their stores and supporting online, although the same warehouse. So that\u2019s a growing trend that we are seeing as well.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then I guess how do we think about, you said maybe also have some smaller ones you are looking at, I have seen that for the same and next day delivery. What are you guys seeing in terms of that pipeline and are you positioned for it with your land bank or is that actually more of an infill story?","Jim Connor","","No, I think we believe we are pretty well positioned for that. I don\u2019t -- we are not aware that any of them are what we would call true infills in major metropolitan areas. I think they are looking at more traditional distribution locations, just small or more typical traditional distribution centers for this large million square footage.","Denny Oklak","And Jamie, I think that these -- we are never quite sure as close to these customers of ours are fairly tight lift about exactly what they are doing out (inaudible) facility, but I think we would suspect that lot of those facilities are for the smaller facilities by smaller 250,000 to 500,000 square feet are for local same day delivery.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then finally, I know you mentioned in general you don't think supplies are really as you get, but are there any markets for you are starting to get concerned. I know when we see the data on Indianapolis, that's one we're certainly expecting to be, we expect pipeline tend to be growing pretty quickly. ","Denny Oklak","Jamie, I would have told you that it was a concern in the second quarter, because we had half a dozen buildings out there and the activity was below what we would traditionally expect in Indianapolis, which has historically been a very strong distribution market. Activity in the late third quarter and fourth quarter has been very, very good. I think everybody will be very positively surprised. We do not expect space to comes off the market the next time we're having this conference call.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Are there any other markets that you're watching as riskier?","Jim Connor","No Jamie, I don't think so. We just updated our third quarter analysis and I would tell you while we watch all of our markets very closely with a number of projects the square footage and the percentage leased, we look at historical levels and all of the spec it's under construction in the U.S. and still only about a third of what we ran at for levels in 2005, 2006 and 2007. No market is exceeding 2% of its overall industrial base. So we still think the market are pretty good balanced, most of them are actually less than 1% of the total industrial base. So that\u2019s a very manageable number for most of these markets given our annual absorption. So will continue to be moderate, but since year-to-date we don\u2019t think the spec development is impeding the safety in any of our markets.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","","Yeah. Denny, obviously you talked about kind of swapping better NOI for what you\u2019ve been selling and you\u2019ve done a good job matching that up to this point you\u2019ve got $400 million kind of plus coming into the fourth quarter. Do you have a agreed view to proceeds as you sit today and kind of being able to match that up, is that going to development, is that going to the balance sheet? Can you kind of talk about some of that uses that add any potential dilution in the timing of getting that back out to work?","Denny Oklak","Yeah. I\u2019ll let Mark have it.","Mark Denien ","Yeah. I\u2019ll start on that Dave and then Denny can chime in. If you think about give or take $400 million, $450 million proceeds Denny just talked about coming in, in the fourth quarter we have got about two tenant outstanding on our line which is really used to fund third quarter development for the most part. So we\u2019ll take half of those proceeds give or take and pay that line balance off. And we\u2019ll be able to fund our fourth quarter pipeline across which is probably close to another $150 million. So that we\u2019ll use most of it up there. And then we may end up the year which is the little bit of cash that\u2019s basically prefunded our early 2014 development.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","And then I guess maybe moving over to the office renewals, Jim I think you\u2019ve mentioned in your comments and maybe to Denny, but better Jim, with regard to the renewals that you did Indianapolis I know you talked about Cincinnati as well. Was that the benefit from consolidation at all? Was there any downsizing in leases or are these kind of as these leases and just kind of rolling the market?","Jim Connor ","No. I would say actually it\u2019s all really positive news. Most of these companies more in the financial services, insurance healthcare services business and we didn\u2019t lose ground with any of these tenants. All of these tenants remained as is or several of them were actually cooperating some slight bit of expansion in there. So it\u2019s just the continuation of the good performance of our office portfolio this year. I think we are all very pleasantly surprised to see our office occupancies continuing to grow, given where we are with the overall economy. But the news is good we\u2019re all fairly optimistic about that continuing to get better as we move, rolled in the fourth quarter and then into 2014.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Last question on the maybe call it secondary office market sales, you talked about or what\u2019s under contract, what\u2019s I mean better demand today for some of those assets? Are you seeing a broader buyer of pools including institutions kind of maybe dipping into the market a little bit more or is it a function of financing, just a little bit more color on that would be helpful? Thanks.","Denny Oklak ","Dave, we began marketing that portfolio early summer, late spring, early summer I would say, probably towards the end of May. And we\u2019ve had good activity all along, what has just taken probably a little longer than a normal transaction on this is really splitting the portfolio up in the multiple buyers and just takes longer. And we\u2019ve done that, so really try to maximize proceeds and I think that\u2019s really what will happen as we complete these transactions.","The demand has been good all along, I would say. In this particular portfolio I wouldn\u2019t classify the buyers as institutional investors. More private equity type buyers getting financing. Financing is readily available for these projects since, through the last few months the interest rates really have stabilized on the borrowing that folks were looking at. So again I just think there is sufficient demand out there for all types of real estate and a pretty varying buyer pool. But the buyer pool on these properties on the Midwest suburban office side has really been private equity firms. Then on the MOB side, we have very strong demand for that portfolio and it is obviously more institutional investors and we had a lot of offers on that portfolio and what I would say a pretty tight range. So we are very pleased with the results on that portfolio. ","And again on the MOB side, this is a few of our older assets in there. So I think overall with this disposition we are improving the overall quality of the MOB portfolio that we will hold going forward.","Dave Rodgers \u2013 Robert W Baird","Thank you.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you Dave.","Operator","","We will go to line of Josh Attie. Please go ahead.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","","Thanks. Can you give us a sense for the average cap rates on the $350 million of office sales and $250 million of MOB sales?","Jim Connor ","","Well I since our closing in all these different transactions I would rather wait and give you those at the end of fourth quarter, Josh, when we get them closed. So, but I will say they are in-line with what we have been talking about on the Midwest office portfolio and really as well I think long they are in-line with the cap rates that we have been talking about on the MOB portfolio. ","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay. And then on use of proceeds, it sounds like the $450 million that\u2019s coming in the door fourth quarter is to the bid online the credit and fund development. What\u2019s the reinvestment plan for the remaining 150, just to help us understand what the earnings impact will be on 2014?","Denny Oklak ","I will say most of that, will be redeployed back into the ongoing development pipeline. We have got a pretty strong development pipeline, which just got bigger with the signing of the Amazon project in Baltimore. So, we\u2019ve got plenty of use of those proceeds they will really redeploy pretty quickly. ","Josh Attie - Citigroup","","So, you think, I mean just to think about the your entire $600 million that you\u2019ve talked about selling all of that will go to either pay down on line of credit and fund development, none of that we should expect to go to acquisitions? ","Denny Oklak ","Well, I think we still got an active acquisition program going on, it\u2019s been relative, I would say compared to what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years has been relatively slow here more recently with the fewer large portfolios out there. But we\u2019re still in discussions on some one-off type projects, basically on the industrial side. And so I think you\u2019ll see as continue to have a few of those each quarter. ","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay. And then on the acquisitions that you made at Central Pennsylvania and Southern California it looks like you paid a 5.5 comp and the assets are fully leased. Can just talk about what kind of returns you\u2019re projecting on these deals and sort of how you get there, is it a planned rent growth or do you think that cap rates for these assets compress further?"," ","Denny Oklak ","Well I would say it\u2019s a combination of few things. And first of all I would say what we\u2019re continuing to do here is take our disposition proceeds and generally redploying back into acquisitions which is same strategy we\u2019ve had for the last two to three years. And so with us it\u2019s a matching of dispositions and acquisitions. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks when you look at this year-to-date it\u2019s almost incredible that we\u2019ve ended up with almost the same amount of dispositions and acquisitions that almost exactly the same cap rate. And what we\u2019ve been able to do as we\u2019ve done that is put proceeds back into what we believe are really I think a good cap rates, probably better than market cap rates on very solid industrial properties that are in key distribution markets long-term growth markets for us. And I would say the acquisitions have two characteristics.","One is nice rent growth and the existing leases that are in place as well as being located in markets where we think we\u2019re going to have good longer-term rent growth there and ultimately have good rent growth when the leases expire. ","And one other thing I want to keep pointing out that I\u2019ve said on the calls before and in our discussions with you all is, in most of these block buildings that we\u2019re buying, not all of them, but a lot of them are single tenant buildings, which is really the bulk business and you either buy these things a 100% leased or you buy them zero percent leased. We typically have tried to buy zero percent leased buildings because we want to zero percent lease building will build a spec building on some of the great industrial ground that we have.","So you just don\u2019t find that many portfolios out there that are 80% or 85% or even 90% leased, they are either zero or 100. And so that\u2019s why you we see us buying a out of those 100% leased buildings, but again focusing on a key distribution markets with good long-term rent growth profile.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","","Hey Denny it\u2019s Michael Bilerman good afternoon. Just two quick questions, one was just as you think about selling 250 million of medical office, of course it\u2019s 20% of the medical office portfolio before you bring on forth any new development. Was there sort of a strategic relook at potentially hiding it off completely and really holding in on being a much pure industrial player as you continue to sell off suburban office and how much time just given the cap rates ever being paid for medical office and some of your peer also going through some of that refocus, did that take off your attention?","Denny Oklak ","","Well, I would tell you, this portfolio Michael that the whole strategic reason for selling this portfolio was, it was just some relatively older assets, a couple that we bought from some major customers of ours over the years as well as some of the development we did early on in process of building this business including some that occurred back and like development that started back in \u201804 \u201805, \u201806 before we even brought Jim Bremner and his team fully into our company. ","And the other piece of it was these were generally with hospital systems where we don\u2019t see a big future expanded relationship. And like you noticed we haven\u2019t sold anything with Baylor and some of the major customers that we have around the country. So it was just a strategic look at the portfolio, it\u2019s a some money off the table and what we believe, I am not disagreeing, but it\u2019s a good time to sell these properties and there is fairly high demand, as I mentioned we have very strong interest in this portfolio. So that was really the goal and right now we have got pipeline roughly equal to what we are selling and we think that pipeline is going to continue to be stable on MOB development business. So we are just looking to take those proceeds and redeploy them back into the MOB business going forward.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","And then the Amazon stuff I remember one was in the [CBRE] venture. I don\u2019t know if that got redistributed do you wholly own the other one that you have and then I guess this will be wholly owned Amazon facility as well that you are building in Baltimore?","Denny Oklak ","","We have three. One in Delaware just south of Philadelphia that we\u2019ve finished late last year. We have got one in Seattle that we finished just couple of months ago during this last past quarter. And now we\u2019ve got this one that we\u2019re starting in Baltimore. But we\u2019ve also got an Amazon and a lot of other facilities. And the answer is yes, they are in a couple of facilities in our Chamber Street joint venture, one in Indianapolis and one in Phoenix. ","And then again, we have, I mean a number of other the spaces around the system. So, I think you\u2019ll see Amazon in the next quarter, actually tick up to be our largest tenant in our overall portfolio. ","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","Got it. Okay. Thank you. ","Denny Oklak ","Thanks Michael. ","Operator","And we have a question from Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. ","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo","Thanks. Denny, I just wanted to see if we could get some commentary on how we should think about occupancy gains going forward? You guys have done a good leasing up the portfolio. But looks like the majority of additional leasing will need to be done in the suburban office portfolio. So, is there anything you can point to that gives you confidence in your ability to continue to show occupancy growth in the fourth quarter and into \u201814? And maybe where do you think you can ultimately get that lease rate up to?","Denny Oklak ","Well, let me start on that and then I\u2019ll let Jim chime in also. Because, I would say, first of all on the suburban office, yeah, you are right. I think we got a good chance to see our occupancies continue to grow there and I think with any lock in the economy, the growth in the occupancy in that portfolio could accelerate. And some of that, there is a little volatility in suburban office occupancy rate for us, because of our disposition programs. So, some of it depends on what we sell. Like for example, the portfolio that we're marketing that I talked about in all these pieces and parts is overall about 93% leased, so little bit higher than our average occupancy.","And then on the medical office business, there is I think there is still room to grow. Today a lot of the development that we're starting is 100% preleased by the hospital systems. But we still got a little bit of vacancy and some of that is some vacancy we built or bought in the portfolio, but really I would say that that\u2019s, the medical office portfolio run above 95%. So I think we've got another 150 to 200 basis points worth of growth in that portfolio.","And then I mentioned, we mentioned here that the large bulk distribution piece of our portfolio was that our 40% of it is fairly highly leased at about 97%, but I think there is some room for growth than the other piece of that portfolio. And Jim maybe you\u2019d comment on that and what we're seeing in that piece of the portfolio.","Jim Connor","Yes, sure. The comment I would make and we've been asked this question a couple times before how much upside that we really have. I think if you go back and look at historically, we brought our industrial portfolio as high as 95.5. So I would tell you that we've got a little bit more upside in the industrial portfolio, not a lot of it is in the big boxes because over 500,000 square foot buildings in our portfolio are about 98% leased today. So most of that improvement is going to come in, in the midsize to 100 to 500 under 100,000 square footers, but [versus] was good operators we've ever been and I would like to believe we can continue to get back to where we draw that historic levels. And I think at the same time that will take us a little bit longer. I think the same could be said in the office. We\u2019d historically run that office portfolio in better times in the low 90s. So while the office market is not, the overall office market is not as good as it was a few years ago, I\u2019d like believe we\u2019ve got lots of upside there as well.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo","Great. That's helpful. And then on same-store NOI you guys are at 3.5% year-to-date given that you are going to be starting to compare against some pretty occupancy level. Is it fair to expect that that specific is going to moderate a bit in the coming quarters?","Denny Oklak","Yeah, Blaine we\u2019re at 4.3% year-to-date all in on a 12 month versus 12 month. And our original guidance for the year is in the 1% to 4% range, we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with that. So I think that we still expect some growth as we move forward, but it should moderate probably a little bit as we close out the year given the higher occupancy base we are working those. So it will probably be in that in the 3% or maybe north of that range a little bit, but still in that 1% to 4% for the year.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then last one from me, your development pipeline, it looks like you are expecting some relatively high yields from the projects you started during the quarter. Is there anything that\u2019s driving your ability to target the higher yields and do you think that's going to be sustainable in the near to mid-term?","Denny Oklak","Well, two things I would say is, one, our overall yields are higher because overall we\u2019ve started some office development during the year and particularly during the quarter. And just typically our office yields are higher than industrial yields and we all pretty much know why that is. And again the other piece is a lot of it\u2019s, obviously a lot of this development is going on ground that we own and ground that we may have owned for a while and have good bases in for example the Columbus ground that we have for the industrial build-to-suit.","So typically if we have got a good ground with good bases, we\u2019re going to get higher overall yields. And that I guess I would also say that it\u2019s hard to predict because of that because you don\u2019t know exactly what kind of development you are going to see going forward whether it will be some more office on some of the office ground we have left or whether it\u2019s a build-to-suit in one of the major markets where the cap rates are lower and there is more competition. So I think it\u2019s just really, the overall cap rates on the development just depends on the mix and the geography.","Blaine Heck - Wells Fargo","Great, thanks.","Operator","We have a question from Rob Stevenson. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Can you guys talk about what the impact is going to wind up being on the occupancy in the suburban and medical office portfolio on the sales, the assets you are selling higher or lower occupancy or roughly similar to what the overall portfolios are?","Denny Oklak","Well, I mentioned on the Midwest office sales, it\u2019s about 93% leased so it\u2019s a little bit higher than our overall occupancy at 87% plus. So that would have a tendency to pull that occupancy down a little bit, I'm not sure it's going to go down, but just if you look at that sale it would. On the [MOB] that portfolio has got 97% leased. And I think our overall portfolio is around 94%. But it's, again it's only about 10%, 12% I guess of the overall portfolio. So I don't think it will have much of an impact. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then you guys have been averaging about $100 million of draw in starts thus far in \u201813. What's your sort of tolerance at this point, what you're seeing in your individual markets to ramp that up materially, as well as what's your tolerance these days to start additional spec developments?","Denny Oklak","I think I'll comment overall and then I'll let Jim come on what we're seeing on the spec side. But I think right now we sort of target a range ongoing development in I\u2019ll call it [bias] at $700 million range, we don't really want to get much above that, just turns into rating agency issues and others. And the truth is I don't think we feel like we have a lot of opportunity that we\u2019d exceed that here right now. One of the things we focused on is the build-to-suit activity because we're sort of in that sweet spot especially on the industrial side of build-to-suit activity where our customers have time to grow their business by doing build-to-suit activity and we\u2019d just assume to do that. And so we\u2019re focused on that. And of course as I mentioned, the MOBs have been virtually all 100% leased projects too. So we've kept that portfolio up in the 85% to plus percent range leased because it\u2019s under development. And Jim why don\u2019t you comment on the spec side of the business and what you\u2019re seeing?","Jim Connor","Yeah. I would add to Denny\u2019s comments, while we've got a few spec developments underway and we're starting to see some leasing some of those projects so they\u2019re coming along nicely, I will tell you our build-to-suit pipeline is so strong that we really rather than continue to focus on that so that when those buildings come into service they\u2019re having an immediate positive impact.","As I said earlier, we monitor all of our markets, look at all spec development. Nationwide our markets we're looking about 20% preleasing, we're leasing on all of spec at least that we're seeing across. So we're not seeing great leasing demand for spec space so that combined with the amount of build-to-suit opportunities has really led us to kind of stay the course of being a little bit cautious about spec and continue to focus on the build-to-suits.","I think as Denny said we're very comfortable that we want to meet our budget goals and our guidance this year. And if we can do that and continue to focus on build-to-suits where we've got 85% of the portfolio preleased, I think we're creating a value that way.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks guys.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Then we\u2019ll go to Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Maybe touching on Michael Bilerman\u2019s question, it seems you have a very good relationship with Amazon. Just curious given your recent projects in Washington and Delaware and that was one incorporates, it seems like your facilities are getting increasing specialized especially the revolving infrastructure, would it mean tearing the bottom sales. There are two questions, what your thoughts on the tenant concentration issue, as you mentioned, they\u2019re going to be the largest tenant? And then two just specialized nature of a building and if that is not so commodity like, like a typical big box? Thanks.","Denny Oklak","Yeah. So first of all as far as Amazon goes, it will be our largest tenant, but it\u2019s only going to be like somewhere between 3% to 4% of our overall revenue, so we\u2019re not too concerned about just looking at Amazon. The second thing is, as you guys, if you follow the industry, I am sure you\u2019ve seen it, Amazon is really built facilities, virtually all over the country. And what we try to do is concentrate our business with them and as much as we can in the major distribution markets and as well as on our land when we can do that.","And I think we\u2019re very comfortable with the projects that we\u2019re building from a long-term perspective. First of all we\u2019re signing generally 15 year leases on this with Amazon, but we\u2019re also very comfortable with these projects on a long-term basis because of their location and because of the kind of building they are.","Jim Connor ","Eric you\u2019re correct that generally speaking we\u2019re seeing Amazon do some specialize investment in these projects, but under the terms of the lease that just it just really isn\u2019t an issue to us. So we\u2019re looking at these buildings as being a, Amazon were to leave at their lease term, these are buildings that generically buildings that generically we can turn back into a just a normal distribution center and they are located in good distribution markets.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thanks for the proper response. The other question I have on the suburban office sales, it seems like they are selling little bit more than you initially projected a quarter ago. Can you just comment on a square footage that you are likely going to be selling in each market?","Denny Oklak","I don\u2019t have each market in front of me, it\u2019s a total of about 2.3 million square feet and I think there might be another couple of hundred , thousand square feet that we are selling out at the Chambers Street joint venture. So I think it\u2019s right in line with exactly where we thought we were going to be when we start is six months ago.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, thanks. And then my final is just regarding your land type plan even you feel like you have pretty good activity in that perhaps you can monetize that with additional build-to-suits maybe if you could just provide a timeframe of your land monetization outlook?","Denny Oklak ","Well, I could say the couple of things that\u2019s happened with the overall land pipeline. First of all, the development business has accelerated over the last 18 to 24 months pretty significantly. So we\u2019re able to put more land into service through the development pipeline. And I think this year we are going to be probably somewhere in the, I don\u2019t have again the exact number in front of me, but $35 million to $50 million of land put into development.","And then the other piece is we\u2019ve really seen an increase in our ability to sell some land this year. And most of the land we are selling is land that was, two things, one originally designated for sale back a few years ago, we went through the whole portfolio. Or second land is that was originally entitled for us for office property, haven't sold much of any on the industrial land side. And a lot of that office land sales is gone to other usage really to residential or even some retail that we see and will see. So I think overall the pace of us moving through our land inventory has accelerated quite a bit over the last 24 months. And so, generally speaking, we feel very good about the land inventory that we have today and where we stand. And as I mentioned on the call, we've got industrial land that we can do over 50 million square feet of new development on. So hopefully, we'll continue to get a lot of the build-to-suits and in the case when spectrum moves through that. ","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Just one final question, regarding the Medical Office portfolio, could you quantify that either on-campus or off-campus?","Denny Oklak","This portfolio that we're selling is above, I think it's about 85% plus on campus.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, great. Thank you ","Denny Oklak","Just kind of nears or rest of our MOB portfolio.","Eric Frankel \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay. Thank you ","Operator","We go to line of Michael Salinsky. Please go ahead ","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. As you think about the build-out in for other land pipelines for \u201814 and \u201915 and have you started to looking at taking out additional land at this point?","Denny Oklak","Generally not, we bought one parcel in Houston earlier this year up in the Northwest side because we didn\u2019t have any land. We developed all our land on the industrial side there. Jim, I don\u2019t think we've really bought any other land this year, have we?","Jim Connor"," ","No, Denny. We've got more than a few inventory in most of our markets, so we've got additional capacity. We\u2019ll continue to look at things, but I think we've got little ways to go before we back actively in the land market.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Second question you gave a lot of color on pricing growth in the Medical Office and in suburban office. So, can you just talk a little bit of the bulk industrial, whether you've seen any change with the movement in industry over the last call it 90 to 180 days?","Denny Oklak","I got to tell you, we really have it. I am little surprised, but I think when you look at, at least the market where we're playing in, in industrial we're looking at the major distribution markets and a Class A modern both properties. Most of the buyers are not leveraged buyers, they\u2019re institutional investors in that a product type. So we quite honestly have not seen much movement at all in the cap rate in the bulk industrial side.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","And then just final question on the asset sales that, how much leverage is in place on those currently?","Denny Oklak","Virtually none, I think there is a couple small ones on the Midwest office portfolio and then not much at all though.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you much ","Operator","We\u2019ll go to line of (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","Just a quick one for me. You sounds working on plan, I mean too much in acquisitions over the next couple of quarters. Is that reflected of what you are seeing in the market, is it tight supply of prices above what you would like to pay, can you provide me a little color there?","Denny Oklak","","Yeah. I would say the two primary drivers of that, one would be just what\u2019s out there and available at the market. Generally speaking we haven\u2019t -- it\u2019s been I would say a little bit slower on the disposition market over the last probably six months and I think some of that has to do with sellers looking at what the interest rate increases were going to do to cap rates. So that the people held back a little bit on selling.","Second, again go back to our plan is to on the recycling side is to match up dispositions with acquisitions and we've got some dispositions going, but as we talked earlier in a couple of questions that were asked, we've redeployed most of those proceeds in either into acquisitions that we've completed or into the strong development pipeline that we have.","So some of it is just really also what's out there in the market and we\u2019ll see what happens over the next couple of months. I would anticipate much coming out between now and year-end, but would take may be at the beginning of next year things hold stable. We would see a larger supply, then we\u2019ll just see if there is something that\u2019s with us strategically.","Unidentified Analyst ","But overall you would be open just currently there is nothing there target that?","Denny Oklak","","Yeah, that\u2019s what I would say [Brandon].","Unidentified Analyst ","And then on the recent spreads on the industrial portfolio going forward, I think you mentioned that about 50% of the leases that are rolling in the next 15 months were signed 2008 to 2011, what can we kind of expect from recent spreads on that part of the portfolio?","Denny Oklak","","Well, I think if you were to look at that 50%, I will let Jim tick me on this one, but I would say probably you are looking at 15% to 25% say in rental rate increases on average on just those leases. So I am not saying overall we\u2019re going to have 20%, 25% rent growth, but I think if you look at those leases that are rolling as we go, something was signed in 2008 or 2009 we\u2019re probably looking at 15% plus rent growth on those at today\u2019s rate again in most of the markets. Jim, do you think that\u2019s about right?","Jim Connor","","Just set floor for me. No, guys, I think that is right. I think when you look at the leases that are rolling in and when they were signed in some of the softer times combined with where our occupancies is, our mission has been and will continue to be to push rents.","Unidentified Analyst ","Well that\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). And at this time, there are no questions in queue.

[Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead, sir.","Ronald Hubbard","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, CFO; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks today, let me remind you that statements we make are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.","For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2017 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everybody. I'll start out with a few comments on the national industrial markets and then cover our third quarter results. Vacancy across the U.S. declined slightly during the third quarter to 4.3%, creating a solid backdrop for pricing power, evidenced by year-to-date market rent growth approaching 6% nationally. Preliminary data shows third quarter absorption exceeded deliveries by about 12 million square feet, and the trend for the full year appears highly likely to support continued net positive absorption.","Overall, new supply remains relatively in check, except for a few pockets, consistent with what we've noted throughout the year. In general, there continues to be a need for modern facilities in major markets for both e-commerce and traditional distribution across the entire logistics supply chain. Let me also touch on some of the recent macroeconomic and geopolitical headlines of late. Regarding tariffs, we are not seeing any material slowdown in decision-making from our customer base. From a practical standpoint, a 10% tariff on $200 billion of imports equates to $20 billion against a U.S. GDP of over $20.4 trillion. It's just not enough to slow our economy in any meaningful way. The tariff impact on some construction materials is consistent with what we've said the last few quarters. Steel costs are up about 15% year-over-year. Coupled with rising labor costs, overall construction costs are up 5% to 6%, similar to our previous statements. More importantly, we've been passing these marginal costs through the customers without a problem and maintaining our development margins.","Specific to our portfolio, this relatively strong backdrop in market fundamentals continued with - coupled with continued expansion or execution by our regional operating teams contributed to the solid 5.2 million square feet of leasing for the quarter. Some of the more notable leases were with customers such as Home Depot, UPS Logistics, DHL, HD Supply and numerous third-party logistics firms.","With the strong leasing activity and our stabilized industrial portfolio occupancy at 97.9%, we continue to be able to push rents, as indicated by our rent growth on new and renewal leases of roughly 28% on a straight-line basis and 11% on a cash basis. We reported 6.3% growth in cash same-property net operating income for the quarter. Same-property NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was 4.6%.","Third quarter same-property growth on a GAAP basis approximated our cash growth and about - is about 80 basis points better than cash on a year-to-year basis. Occupancy in the same-property pool of properties increased 150 basis points from the third quarter 2017 and increased 60 basis points from the 9-month period ending September 30 in 2017. This average same-property occupancy increase was the substantial driver in the quarterly same-property NOI increase compared with the previous two quarters. The occupancy was positively impacted by the very strong leasing executed in the first half of the year.","More importantly, the strong leasing and strong rent growth this quarter and year-to-date have raised our expectations for full year same-property NOI growth, which Mark will discuss in a moment.","On the development side of the business, momentum continued to be very good. During the third quarter, we generated $141 million of starts across six projects, totaling 2 million square feet that are 51% leased in aggregate. The new development starts included 618,000 square foot build-to-suit development in Cincinnati for a subsidiary of the Herman Miller Corporation.","On the speculative development side, we started a project in the Inland Empire totaling 340,000 square feet. Shortly after commencing construction, we executed a lease for 100% of space for Legrand Holdings, a French industrial conglomerate. We started three other speculative development projects during the quarter in our Houston and Indianapolis markets totaling about 980,000 square feet. These facilities are located in our existing business park and adjacent to the major cargo airports.","We continued to see strong activity in our development pipeline, and we're confident that we'll close out 2018 in strong fashion, and we're optimistic about early 2019.","Now let me turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover the capital transactions activity.","Nicholas Anthony","Thanks, Jim. We had a light quarter with regard to capital transactions. The acquisition environment is extremely competitive, and we continue to be highly selective and focused on targeted submarkets and Tier 1 markets. From a pricing perspective, there continues to be a wealth of private and public capital seeking increased allocation to Class A industrial in all major markets, which continues to push down cap rates.","We did have one disposition during the quarter, selling a 202,000 square foot facility in Indianapolis that was held in joint venture at strong pricing. Shortly after quarter-end, we sold 1 million square foot facility in Northeast Pennsylvania. The facility was leased to a third-party logistics subsidiary of Sears. We acquired this facility as part of the portfolio several years ago, and the location is tertiary to our core Lehigh Valley submarket. We are pleased with the execution pricing, which was north of $60 per square foot and in line with recent comps.","I'll now turn it over to Mark Denien to cover our earnings results and balance sheet activities.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.35 per share compared to $0.33 per share in the second quarter of 2018 and $0.30 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Core FFO increased from the second quarter of 2018 due to continued improvement in overall operating results, development properties being placed in service and lower general and administrative expenses.","We reported FFO as defined by NAREIT of $0.36 per share for the quarter compared to $0.33 per share for the second quarter of '18 and $0.26 per share in the third quarter of 2017. NAREIT FFO in the third quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by $17 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred due to repaying debt with proceeds from last year's medical office disposition.","We're very pleased with our 17% increase in core FFO over prior year quarter as we have now redeployed the proceeds from our MOB sale quicker and at higher returns than we initially anticipated.","AFFO totaled $113 million for the quarter compared to $107 million for the second quarter of '18 and $94 million for the third quarter of 2017. In addition to the factors impacting core FFO, the improvement in AFFO from the second quarter of 2018 was partially due to the timing of second-gen capital expenditures.","During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured notes at a 4.1% effective interest rate and used a portion of the proceeds to repay 2 secured loans totaling $224 million, which had an average interest rate of over 7.6%. The remainder of the proceeds will be used to fund our development pipeline.","In addition to this debt funding, we raised $28 million on our ATM program at an average price of $29.24 per share. While we have plenty of internal funding capacity looking out the next 12 to 18 months, given the increased volatility trending in the market and rising interest rates and given our strong development pipeline outlook, we took advantage of a very strong equity market during about a one week window in early August. During this time, we were trading at or slightly above consensus NAV per share and at peak pricing compared to the previous two year period.","We finished the quarter with $133 million in available cash and $128 million of cash held in escrows to redeploy the disposition proceeds in the near-term tax-deferred exchanges. We also have $277 million in interest-bearing notes receivable, of which $145 million will mature over the next nine months and no outstanding borrowings on our unsecured line of credit. These sources of liquidity will contribute to funding our near-term growth.","Given our optimistic outlook for strong long-term AFFO growth and given our excellent balance sheet position, yesterday, we were pleased to announce a $0.015 per share or 7.5% increase in our regular quarterly dividend. Even with this increase, our AFFO payout ratio remains at a very conservative level of approximately 70%.","I want to now briefly touch on some retailer bankruptcies that have been in the news. After the sale earlier this month of the Pennsylvania property that was leased to Sears that Nick mentioned just a little bit earlier, our remaining exposure to Sears consists of only four small leases totaling less than 200,000 square feet that are being used for high-end appliance distribution. We also have two small spaces totaling just over 100,000 square feet with Mattress Firm and one leased for 120,000 square feet with American Tire Distributors, each of which recently entered bankruptcy reorganization. All of these tenants are current on their rent, and in total, represent only 0.3% of our annual rent.","These leases are also about 10% below market. If they were to vacate, we view it as a short-term pain for long-term gain similar to our hhgregg situation from last year. Let me now address revisions to our 2018 expected range of estimates, which is an exhibit at the back of our quarterly financial supplement available on our website. As we near the end of 2018, we have narrowed our guidance for core FFO to a range of $1.31 to $1.35 per share, which equates to an additional $0.01 per share increase at the midpoint. We have also increased our guidance for the range of growth in same-property net operating income to 4.2% to 4.8%, an increase of 0.5% at the midpoint. Revisions to certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Finally, I want to address the upcoming change to lease accounting for 2019, specifically as it pertains to lessor's capitalization of internal leasing costs. This accounting change is expected to result in a $0.04 to $0.05 reduction to net income and to NAREIT-defined FFO in 2019.","I know some companies are making changes to their compensation structure, solely to achieve more favorable accounting treatment. We will not be making changes to our compensation structure as a result of these new accounting rules as we believe it is more important to focus on what works for our business rather than the accounting consequences. Even though companies that use an outsourced model for their leasing function are able to achieve a better accounting treatment, we continue to believe our business model is more efficient and effective for a company of our scale.","Last month, we posted a comprehensive packet of materials on our website with respect to this new lease accounting, including our proposed presentation for 2019 as it pertains to our core FFO definition, a definition that should optimize FFO comparability with other companies in our sector. We encourage everyone to review that disclosure.","Now I will turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. In closing, everyone, I'll first note we're very, very pleased with our team's execution year-to-date on leasing performance, capital redeployment and development starts. As indicated earlier, we will closely monitor the macroeconomic and trade negotiation news. But for now, we're very optimistic about a solid finish for the remainder of the year.","One last important transaction to announce. This month, we started construction on our new headquarters here in Indianapolis. As you may have seen from last month's press release, our new home will be LEED-certified Silver, four stories, 78,000 square foot office building containing advanced features to enhance team collaboration, connectivity and contribute to retaining an attractive top talent in the industry. In addition to those productivity benefits, the facility's LEED certification is a natural extension of our longstanding culture and long-term commitment to sustainability here at Duke Realty.","I'm also pleased that our overall strong performance has allowed us to raise our quarterly dividend by 7.5%. Let me give you some additional perspective. Even with selling $5.6 billion of noncore assets between 2015 and 2017, we were able to raise our dividend by over 5% each year and maintained a conservative payout ratio. Going forward, we expect a more modest level of capital recycling each year tied to normal pruning of the portfolio and tied to modest shifting of our geographic locations further into Tier 1 markets, which significantly lessens potential earnings dilution going forward. With this dynamic substantially behind us and assuming the economy stays on sound footing, we're optimistic about our ability to grow our dividend in the mid- to high single-digit range for the foreseeable future, consistent with our potential growth in AFFO.","We'll now open up the lines to the audience. [Operator Instructions]. Greg, you can now open up the lines, and we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman.","Michael Bilerman","Actually, it's Michael Bilerman. I started to learn after 20 years that I have to unmute my line. I apologize. Mark, you talked a little bit about the ATM, that you raised $28 million in the quarter, and you put some context around it, keeps pricing pretty much in line with Street NAV, modest amount. I guess, I'm just stepping back and saying why raise at all when you have so much liquidity on the balance sheet and low leverage? And so if you can sort of help me understand that piece of it. And then if you had your drawdowns, how much would you have raised if the stock continued to move up?","Mark Denien","Sure, Michael. I don't know that we would raise much more, even if the stock continued to move up. I mean, your points are valid. I mean, we don't need the money today. But our stock at that price, after you factor in the special dividend and the effect it had on our stock, there's only been 14 days in the prior two year period we traded at that level. And our development pipeline is very robust. So we think that come this time next year, we'll have uses for that money. But to answer your question, it's 0.2% of our outstanding share raise. It just wasn't a significant amount, and I don't know that we were to raise much more than that regardless of what our stock did.","Michael Bilerman","And so you said I'll give you $60 million of capacity just to have done it at a price without much dilution.","Mark Denien","I'm sorry. I didn't catch that, Michael.","Michael Bilerman","No, I was just summarizing what you had said. Maybe if we can turn to the - just the development pipeline, that's the second question. You're sitting today with a 10.5 million square foot pipe, which is about 52% preleased, some chunky vacancies, the - and stuff in Indy, the bay assets in Atlanta, the big Southern California asset. Can you talk about what the preleasing is like right now on that remaining, call it, 5 million square feet to be leased? And when - how do you see that progressing over the next couple of quarters?","James Connor","Sure, Michael. It's Jim. I just - I wanted you to know we really enjoyed your report last night, no diggity, no doubt. And my answer to your question is, \"cover much ground, got game by the pound.\" For those of you who are not Dr. Dre enthusiasts, I'll translate. Actually, Michael, if you look in the back of our supplemental, the property that will be coming in service here in the fourth quarter, I'll just run through those. We've got a building in Cincinnati and another one following that in Minneapolis. We've got significant amount of activity there, both partial building tenants and full building tenants. So I'm not particularly worried about that. Chicago's got a bunch of activity. I would be surprised if that was around much longer. Atlanta's been a little bit streaky. The bigger building, the activity has been modest, I would say. The small building has got very strong activity. That one, I'm not particularly worried about. St. Louis has got reasonable activity.","The California one that's coming due in the second quarter, the 657, it's a little early for that. We're just tilting panels. We've got a lot of activity on the Heacock asset, which is a little over 400,000 feet. I think, I'm pretty optimistic that will be gone in the fourth quarter. The smaller buildings in Indianapolis, again, those are multi-tenant type 2s. We've leased one of those already, and we've got good activity on that one. And then the New Jersey building, we're in negotiations to execute a lease for a little over half of that building. So as we've talked about, the only places where you've really seen some supply and a little bit of softness in the market is a little bit in kind of that I-80 corridor in Chicago. It's been a little soft. Some of the submarkets in Atlanta, particularly down south, have been a little soft, and then South Dallas, down by the intermodal had been a little soft. But by and large, consistent with the macro numbers that you're seeing, we've got really strong activity across the country.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Jeremy Metz.","Robert Metz","I just wanted to stick with the development topic. You mentioned no real impact from tariffs. You said you're feeling optimistic on the pipeline, but tenants are obviously facing rising costs in other parts of their supply chain. Construction costs are rising. Just wondering what this all means from here in terms of the trajectory of the pipeline going forward. Based on 4Q deliveries versus what's left in your starts guidance, it does suggest the pipeline could shrink a little further from here. So just looking out, should we think about an active pipeline that's going to be slightly below today's level of, call it, $850 million?","James Connor","Well, without giving 2019 guidance, which Mark is kicking me under the table, I would tell you that everything from the macro perspective to the conversations that we're having with our tenants feels like 2019 should be another pretty good year on the development side. Let me give you a couple of detailed points in terms of increased costs. And we've talked about this before. You've got to remember that real estate cost is a fairly small component of the overall logistics and supply chain, literally 4% or 5%. So while prices have been going up and everybody wants to pay attention to the bottom line, the cost of transportation and the cost of labor are a much more significant factor for our clients. The other thing I would tell you is, as our clients are trying to get more efficiency out of the supply chain, the bigger buildings, the higher clear height allow our clients do that. So in a lot of instances, you'll see clients consolidate into larger facilities because they can operate those more efficiently, and that's how they squeeze more savings out of the supply chain.","Robert Metz","But sticking with that point you just made, is there - if tenants facing significant increases on transportation and labor, is this at all - are you seeing anything on the ground where this is starting to eat in your ability to keep pushing the rents you have?","James Connor","No. I think, as demonstrated by the rent growth numbers we've put up this quarter, we're not seeing any of that. And quite candidly, I don't know what a client's alternative would be in terms of - I suppose, they could go to a third-tier market and get less expensive space. But today, it's all about having product that's close to the population and the end consumers as possible.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of John Guinee.","John Guinee","Great. Mark, you gave a carefully crafted explanation of what looks like about a $15 million to $18 million of lease costs, which are now going to be expensed versus capitalized. Do you basically say that you're going to back that number out of NAREIT-defined FFO to get to core FFO?","Mark Denien","That's right, John. Yes, and we've got an exhibit that we put out on our web about I want to say a month or so ago, and we'll update that shortly here with third quarter numbers, but I think the trend is pretty accurate with what's - what we posted. I think we went through a rationale on why that is, and we believe it just makes it more comparable. We could go outsource those functions and pay more money and get better accounting, but it just doesn't make sense for our business to do it that way. So this is a way to be comparable.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Blaine Heck.","Blaine Heck","So you touched on this a little bit, but this quarter's acquisitions and dispositions were pretty light with nothing on the acquisitions side, just one small disposition. Maybe for Nick, can you just talk a little bit more about the investment sales market and cap rates and whether the acquisition market has gotten more difficult recently? Or are you guys just taking a pause or just finding other avenues for investment that are more favorable at this point?","Nicholas Anthony","Well, first of all, our activity was anticipated to be more modest anyway this year and going forward. Definitely, the cap rate environment is frothy is the way I would put it. We haven't seen any expansion cap rates. And we are very focused on high-barrier Tier 1 markets where we can't already develop in. We do - we are still seeing opportunities though. We've looked at a lot of different projects and still think we'll be able to recycle some of our dispositions into these high-barrier tier markets on a go-forward basis.","Blaine Heck","All right. That's helpful. And then, Mark, clearly you guys have established a fortress balance sheet and very low leverage, given all the proceeds you guys have been churning through. But can you just talk about whether you have a longer-term target for debt-to-EBITDA? And how do you think about balancing kind of the safety of a good balance sheet versus a little bit more FFO growth with more leverage?","Mark Denien","Sure, Blaine. Yes, I mean, we're in the upper 4s, like 4.8, 4.9 now on debt-to-EBITDA. I think our longer-term goal is to be more in the mid-5s, which gives us plenty of dry powder to get from where we are to today up to that mid-5s. But we also want to have flexibility to - as long as - we don't know where we are in the cycle, but we're closer to the end than we were a month ago and a year ago and two years ago. So we do like that flexibility. And like I said earlier, we do have a very strong development pipeline. And like Jim said, we're not giving guidance for '19, but '19 to us right now looks pretty good. So having a little bit of extra cash on the balance sheet right now, I think you'll see that put to use, quite honestly, probably by year-end. I think all of the cash will be fully redeployed by year-end, and then we'll be off and running next year.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Eric Frankel.","Eric Frankel","Jim, I know you're trying to make a big push into the West Coast, I didn't realize that your musical taste extended there, too. Quick question, just going back to development. Obviously, you guys are - your - I think one of your core competencies is your ability to procure build-to-suit business. And you established a risk parameter of just having a certain amount of your development pipeline being preleased. Has that precluded, though, the opportunity to start or identify any attractive, speculative development opportunities. So is there another way maybe of rethinking your - the risk parameters regarding developments? Are there - maybe there's more speculative development upside?","James Connor","Yes, Eric. We actually talk about that quite a bit and we've been - our teams have been performing really well. So we've been able to garner enough build-to-suit business to keep us above 50%. We've kind of fluctuated between the low 50s and maybe low 60s, and that's really just kind of driven by the timing of starts in different markets. This quarter's development activity was about 51%. We have dipped below 50% in the last few years. I like to give everybody a little bit of notice when we're going to do that. And again, it's generally driven by timing. So we could go down into the mid- or upper 40s if we started a couple more spec buildings, but we still felt comfortable about the development pipeline. But you're not going to see us have a significant change in strategy and shift the vast majority of our development activities back like some of our peers do. I think we remember what 2008, '09 and '10 were like and are very comfortable with the risk profile that we have with our development pipeline, and it's a substantial development pipeline. So we feel pretty comfortable where it is. It could come down a little bit more as we start some more projects in early 2019.","Eric Frankel","Okay. I appreciate the response. Just a quick follow-up question, I'll jump back in the queue. Maybe it's a question for Nick. But obviously, it's certainly understandable that cap rates are pretty firm everywhere, if not compressed a little bit. Maybe you could talk across markets where you think cap rates have - might have compressed more than others. Is it coastal markets? Is it noncoastal markets? And does that affect your acquisition and disposition strategy?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, they definitely compressed in the high-barrier Tier 1s: Mid-County, South Bay, East Bay, Northern New Jersey, definitely. But like I said earlier, we're still finding opportunities. It's - and we expect that we'll still be able to recycle our disposition proceeds going forward.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Nick Yulico.","Nicholas Yulico","Just first on supply. If I look at some of the top markets where - of yours where supply growth looks like it could be more meaningful in the next couple of years, it's Dallas, Atlanta, Houston, even Indianapolis. Can you just give us an update there on whether - and this is based on your sort of overall market level supply. How are you thinking about those markets and where your portfolio is positioned versus some of the supplies that's coming into those markets?","James Connor","Yes, Nick. We look at all the same data you do, and we've got people on the ground. So we think we've got pretty good tabs on that. And I think what's important to remember is it tends to be submarket by submarket, and Dallas is a great example. The softness in Dallas is primarily South Dallas, down by the intermodal. There's a number of large spec buildings down there. There's no shortage of land, yet if you go up by DFW in the North Airport market, vacancy is under 4%. So it's kind of a Tale of Two Cities, and you'll see that pretty consistently around the system. If you go to Chicago, we're building a small spec building, which is up in DuPage County close to O'Hare. And there's not a lot of product available there. It's really an infill redevelopment play to take advantage of the airport. And the softness in Chicago tends to be way south down in the I-80 corridor in the bigger buildings. So we're very attuned submarket to submarket about what's going on and trying to keep our eyes on that on a pretty consistent basis.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay. And then how would you characterize Atlanta?","James Connor","I would characterize Atlanta the same way. I think you've got some softness in the market down south, but I think in some of the more core markets, I think things look fine. We've got, I think, three buildings down there under construction, one small one and a couple of midsized ones. So I think, for the most part, we're pretty comfortable with the amount of activity that we've got down there. That having been said, I don't think you'll see us teeing up another building until we get some leasing done on a couple of those.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, that's helpful. Just one last one on occupancy. I recognize you have occupancy upside in your nonstabilized pool, but same-store occupancy is now at a pretty high level, higher-than-normal level. It seems like that was the driver of the increase to the same-store guidance. How should we think about same-store NOI growth next year being impacted by what looks like high occupancy today? Does that create tough comps for you next year? And how are you sort of viewing the trade-off between keeping high occupancy versus maybe pushing rents more and having some more frictional vacancy?","James Connor","Well, Nick, I would say that 99% current quarter comp is probably pretty tough, not much you can go above that. But we're happy with that. I mean, I suppose - with 100%, we'd be 1% happier than we are. But the way we look at it, collecting cash earlier than later is not a bad thing. I don't know that you can really look at it and say we're not pushing rent growth enough. I think compared to all of our peers, I think our results on rent growth, whether it be on a GAAP or cash basis, stack up very well, if not maybe top of the class. So it's harder than, I think, pointing fingers, and say we're not pushing rents enough. There's no doubt that 99% same-property occupancy will be a tough comp, but we'll take the cash at the end. If we can keep it at 99% next year, that's a good thing.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Dave Rodgers.","David Rodgers","Jim, just wanted to ask quickly maybe about the move to Tier 1 markets. Obviously, it's been happening for a while. Do you see, I mean, an ability to accelerate that? Or do you look at it out the next couple of years and say, \"Hey, it's going to be a $600 million to $800 million move as we move forward\"? And maybe the second part of that question is, what dilution are you willing to accept on kind of a current basis? And are those market excess portfolio sales? And is there a more strategic way that you're thinking about that over the next couple of years?","James Connor","Thanks, Dave. Well, let me answer the second one first, I think, and then I think that'll lead me into the answer to the first part. When we got done with the medical office disposition and redeploying the bulk of those proceeds, we started to tell everybody that our disposition was going to be much more modest going forward. I think we'll be in the $500 million range this year, but we basically said we ought to be between $200 million and $400 million going forward, which allows us to be good stewards of the portfolio and continue to prune and continue to try and affect the appropriate geographic shift that we want to do. But most of the growth is really - have come through development and through some acquisitions. As Nick said, we haven't completely closed up the acquisition shop. We're out looking at deals, whether it's value-add, redevelopment, covered land plays and some core acquisitions in these Tier 1 high-barrier markets. That's how we're going to supplement our growth beyond what we're able to do with the development. And again, we talked - we're not giving guidance for '19. But if everything is pretty consistent with what it's been here for the last couple of years, I think we would look to do a comparable level of development. If we found the opportunity to accelerate development in those Tier 1 markets beyond the kind of levels we've been running at the last couple of years, we always have the ability to accelerate dispositions. We've always got a pretty accurate pending list of dispositions that's 2 to 3 years out. So we could always bring forward a play or an asset that we want and realize those proceeds and redeploy that into development if we find some great development opportunities.","David Rodgers","And do you think from this point, just kind of looking where you're at for 2018, say FFO guidance, absorbing that dilution, you feel like you can keep that rate of growth going. It sounds like based on your earlier comments on the call, it's not a little stronger.","James Connor","Yes, absolutely. Yes, I mean, look, once - we've told everybody, once we got down with this massive 7-year repositioning of the company, it's now time for us to put our head down and grow, and that's what we're really focused on doing. So minimize dispositions, use acquisitions to supplement our Tier 1 growth and focus on development, which is, a, what we're good at, and we're creating a tremendous amount of value for our stakeholders today as opposed to what we're seeing at acquisitions.","Nicholas Anthony","And keep in mind, on the dispositions side, we're seeing very good pricing there as well. So that will help manage the dilution going forward.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Jamie Feldman.","James Feldman","I know in your remarks, you had mentioned you're really not seeing any kind of slowdown from trade wars or tariffs, but are you seeing any regional shifts in demand? Are customers more comfortable with signing longer-term leases in certain markets than others as you think about the activity you've seen?","James Connor","No, Jamie, not really. It's funny when we talk to our major national customers who are redoing components or their entire supply chain, it's not driven necessarily by their geographic demand. A lot of it is driven by where they own facilities, where they lease facilities, what leases are coming up. And their play is we'll get the whole thing done, but we're going to deal with these assets in this market first or it's - the other side of it is it's driven by demand. And so you may see a national customer start with a build-to-suit in Columbus, Ohio and then go to New Jersey and then go to Atlanta. So I can't tell you that we're seeing any customers telling us that they've got increased demand, and that's changing their focus from a geographic perspective other than what I reiterated earlier, which is the key philosophy of most of our customers is the need to get this product as close to the major population areas and their end consumers as possible. And we're continuing to see that trend. And companies can afford to spend significantly more in rent because rent is a much smaller percentage of the supply chain costs if it gets them closer to the customers and help them save on transportation.","James Feldman","Okay, that's helpful. And then can you take a crack at where you think your mark-to-market is on the portfolio?","Mark Denien","Jamie, I would tell you the lease is rolling in the next 18 months, which, like we always say, that's kind of how far out we look. We think the rent growth is going to look a lot like it has this year. I think it's going to be plus or minus low 20 percents on a GAAP basis and high single digits, maybe pushing low double digits on a cash basis based on what we have coming over the next 18 months. You've got to keep in mind, our portfolio, we've got a lot less rolling each year than a lot of our peers because we have a lot longer lease terms. So we just don't find it useful to figure out what our mark-to-market is on a lease that's rolling nine years from now. But we do look out over the next 18 to 24 months, and I think it looks pretty similar to what we're seeing today.","James Connor","Yes. I think the other point I would make is we've been lucky, and that's probably the result of a lot of hard work by our teams, that we have not been negatively impacted by any of these major bankruptcies. But anytime we get these spaces back, what we're finding is they're below market rents. And while we've got a short downtime of generally four to maybe as much as eight months, depending on the market and the submarket, we're improving rents. We improved rents over 10% on those hhgreggs. And if we get any of these minor spaces back from Sears or Mattress Firm or the tire guys, we're looking at probably north of 10%. And I think that's a pretty good sign about the strength of the markets that we're seeing all over the country.","James Feldman","Okay, and if I could just clarify one thing you said before. You said 2019 will be another good year on development. Is it safe to assume that means the pipe starts would be at least as large as '18?","James Connor","Jamie, without getting kicked really hard under the table that - I'm going to stick by my earlier comment that 2019 looks really good.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Michael Carroll.","Michael Carroll","Yes. Just kind of real quick on the development activity and the near-term starts. Can you kind of highlight where those starts are going to come from? Is it going to be more of the core coastal markets, the Tier 1 markets you kind of want to grow into? I guess, what percentage of the starts will that represent?","James Connor","Well, I think we were just looking at this the other day, Mike. I think Tier 1 starts represent about 60% of our development activity. And while we don't have a clearly defined target, we do have a priority to put money out into those Tier 1 markets in both build-to-suits and spec development. So I think you could - the conclusion you could draw is it would probably be pretty consistent with that. And had we the opportunity to create value and accelerate that to a higher number, I think we'd probably do that.","Michael Carroll","Okay. And then how are development yields different from those Tier 1 markets versus the, I guess, more of the general inland-type markets? Is it a big difference?","James Connor","Yes. It's a pretty widespread, but what it really is, and Nick can give you the detail, is it's a function of the spread over the cap rates. And so as we've continued to see cap rate compression, we've seen our going-in yields go down. But what we're really focused on is the value creation of the margins. And we've consistently been developing for the last few years, maybe as much as five years, in the 20-plus percent range on our entire development pipeline. And we're consistently being able to hold those margins because of the cap rate compression.","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, and I would say, in the Tier 1s, we've actually experienced a lot of rent growth and cap rate compression after we tied up the lands. So the margins have actually done better.","Mark Denien","Yes. Yes, Michael, and I'll add a couple of more points as well. I think the margins in our Tier 1 markets are actually a little bit better than our, I'll call it, our non-Tier 1 markets, partly because the non-Tier 1 markets have more build-to-suits in them as well. So when you look at places like Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, that's a lot of where build-to-suits are coming from. So you get a little bit lower margin, but obviously a lot lower risk as well. So we have higher margins in those Tier 1 markets, even though the yields are lower. And to Nick's point, keep in mind, we stay - the way we do our margins that we put in our supplemental, it's we underwrite based on today's rent, and we always assume a 12-month lease-up period. If you'll go back and you look at the last two years' worth of starts that have now been stabilized, we've actually beat our stabilized yields by about 25 basis points because by the time they went in servicing, got leased, rents had increased. Yet like I say, we underwrite based on today's rent, and we've been able to lease it in less than a year. So we have less carrying costs. So if you look at the 2016 and '17 starts, they closed out about a 25 basis point increase in yields from what we had in our supplemental, which equates to about an extra 5% margin than what we had in our supplemental.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Ki Bin Kim.","Ki Bin Kim","So the 28% lease spread you guys posted this quarter really high number obviously. Where is that mostly coming from? Is it broad based? Or are there just certain markets that are pulling above their weight?","James Connor","No, Ki Bin. I'm telling you, it's pretty broad-based. If there were any standouts plus or - positive or negative, I'd tell you we have cited that in the past when we did a particularly ugly renewal or something like that and it brought the number down. But no, this is - as you had said, it's pretty broad-based across all markets. And I think back to the vacancy numbers we cited, when you've got an average 4.3% vacancy, it gives us a lot of leverage in the marketplace.","Ki Bin Kim","And this still might be a little bit too early, but you have a couple of major e-commerce players in your top 10 list who, I guess, shall remain unnamed. Any of these kind of first-generation leases, have you done any renewals on them lately? Or there's still too many years left in the leases. I was just curious, like how the negotiations would proceed with some of the bigger players.","James Connor","Yes. We have negotiated renewals on a number of those, and we have some in process right now. And I would tell you they're fine. They're not - it's not - we still have the same leverage. And one of the things I would tell you about our e-commerce clients who are very, very focused on growth, the truth is they're so focused on getting more space into production. They don't really have much interest in giving up space. So unless it's really nonstrategic for them, and they make huge, huge capital investments in these buildings, a lot of material handling, equipment and everything else. So it's really not - it's got to be a situation where it really doesn't work. So I think you'll continue to see us have very good success renewing these major tenants, particularly the e-commerce ones that are growing consistently around the country.","Operator","Next we turn to the line of Tom Catherwood.","William Catherwood","So sticking on the Tier 1 development topic, you guys have kind of 1,250 acres available for development and another 550 with purchase options, but you've always talked about how this is the type of land you can put into production pretty quickly. When we think of the Bridge Portfolio, some of those assets, just great locations, but some of those locations took years, if not a decade, to assemble and title and get into production. As you move more into these Tier 1 markets and want to do more development, what are your thoughts on switching to portion of the land bank being kind of more longer-term land for you to work through entitlements on versus what you can put on production right away?","James Connor","Well, Tom, yes, you're absolutely right. Anytime you're doing Tier 1 infill redevelopment, it tends to be very complicated, and that adds time to the process. What we look at is the amount of land that we can carry. We've kind of targeted between 300 million and 400 million. And we can make a certain amount of plays that are more long term in nature. And then in other instances, we can't. We've got to keep a defined balance. So most of the projects that we're working on today have a, I would tell you, a 9 to maybe 18 month time line, and we find that we're very competitive with those, and we can put those into production. But making a big investment in a substantial site that's going to take 5 or 10 years to entitle is probably not in our sweet spot, unless you've got a situation where the landowner is willing to carry the land. But for us to buy and take the development risk and carry it for that long, that doesn't really work for our equation right now.","William Catherwood","Got you. And has that kind of 9 to 18 month time line extended at all relative to Tier 1? Or is that pretty consistent with what it's been for the past few years?","James Connor","They're really all over the board. Most of the infill Tier 1s that have - whether you're talking about a blighted site or have some environmental contamination that needs to be cleaned up, you have great cooperation from the municipality. So that's not the delay. The delay is taking it through the process and getting the clean-up done. In other areas where you're working through the entitlement process and the permitting process, which is, in some of those markets, much more intensive and much more lengthy, that's the challenge. So we see them all across the board. And then you have a setback every once in a while in terms of not getting a certain approval and having to go back and start over and getting some delays. That's the nature of the brownfield redevelopment business. But by and large, that's a pretty good range, and anything outside of 18 months is going to be pretty problematic for us to carry.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Eric Frankel.","Eric Frankel","Just one quick follow-up. I was - maybe you could explain the leasing dynamic that explains the same-store NOI growth guidance increase. Were there any particular markets where you - where rents were growing a little bit faster pace than you expected? Apologies if you didn't - if you've already explained that earlier.","Mark Denien","So Eric, I don't think there is any really markets per se. I think just overall, rent growth across the board is a little bit better than what we had expected. I think this was our best quarter all year and we got really better every quarter as we went through the year. So I think it's just really across the board, and it's overall better rent growth. And I would tell you the other thing is quicker backfill of expiring spaces. We have certain tenants that we are pretty certain are going to vacate, and we were right, they vacated. What we didn't count on was having a tenant ready to take that space the day they left. I mean, almost literally, the day they left, ready to come in. So while our renewal rate was high at 82% for the quarter, if you look at the amount of space that was backfilled the same quarter, it was like 95%. We certainly didn't budget or project that to happen. So it's really just a combination of better rent growth across the board and just the sheer demand for space and the backfill of these expiring tenants happening quicker than we thought.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Manny Korchman.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman, again. Jim, I just wanted to ask you about scale. How much do you think you need additional scale to be effective? You've clearly seen Prologis after the DCT merger jumped up pretty significantly. Blackstone's, obviously, made a massive play, redoubling their efforts on their industrial platform. Global Logistics had to stop theirs. So where do you sort of see yourselves from a scale perspective overall?","James Connor","Well, that's a great question. We believe there are advantages to scale in our business, which is one of the reasons we've continued to grow. Second largest in the sector and largest pure-play industrial U.S.-only REIT. We love to continue to grow, and I think we look at every opportunity. And if we think an opportunity presents itself and we can improve our FFO and our AFFO, and we look at NAV and we're comfortable what that does, and we can grow the organization, we like those kind of opportunities. I think the situation you're seeing today is everything is very, very expensive. And even the deals that are getting done are probably right on the edge from a value-creation perspective. So we'll continue to look. As Mark alluded to earlier, one of the reasons we've tried to keep some dry powder is, given where we are in the cycle, I think there may be some even better opportunities in the future, and I'd like to have the flexibility to take advantage of those.","Michael Bilerman","Well, I guess, how do you think about using your equity, which is post to where you just issued that small amount using your equity in a M&A transaction, whether that's public to public or one of the numerous private large portfolios that's out there, how does that play into the desire for scale? How do you sort of balance those things with the cost of capital that may be very attractive?","James Connor","Yes. I mean, that's one of the tools in our toolbox. And look, we like our price. I liked it a little better when Mark was issuing equity a couple of months ago, but we're in a very strong performing sector. And our stock price has continued to do well, and that's a tool that we can use in certain instances where it makes sense. So we're not opposed to using equity or leverage or a combination of both to go out, again, if we can find an opportunity that's going to create value.","Michael Bilerman","And just the last thing. If you think about the Prologis-DCT merger, a lot of the synergies came from two things. One was eliminating the $30 million of G&A immediately and then basically refinancing the entirety of DCT's debt book with international, current international drawdowns. There's future synergies on the comp, but that was immediate cash uplift that they were able to get, whereas the pricing of the real estate clearly was at or above market. So how do you separate those things in your underwriting, valuing the real estate versus valuing the cash flow potential from basically cost synergies?","James Connor","Well, you've hit on the key components. The only way you can justify paying somebody the prices that you have to pay today at or clearly above replacement cost at the absolute top of the market is if you can gain significant operating efficiencies. We've got a national footprint. We think that opportunity presents itself, but you've got to look at every one of those on a case-by-case basis. And they don't necessarily all line up perfectly. I think that the transaction you've referenced, that was clearly the main impetus. But the other part of it is keeping and maintaining some sort of the culture of the company you buy because that factors into the situation with the seller, because there are a whole lot of willing sellers right now. So it's got to be a balance, but you've got to be able to go out and create enough synergies to be able to save enough money to justify paying the premium.","Operator","Next we turn to the line of Michael Mueller.","Michael Mueller","Yes. A quick question on the GAAP spreads again. Looking at the 25% year-to-date number, can you walk through just some of the factors that are helping you get there? You obviously have the actual cash spread. Looks like the duration on the new leases is about five years. How different is that from what's being replaced? And the same with bumps, what sort of bumps are in the new leases versus the old leases?","Nicholas Anthony","I would tell you the tenor of the leases tend to be the new lease is a little short, generally, than the old because some of these are 10- and 15-year original lease terms that were development and the typical renewal is 5 years, as you just said. So there's a little bit of a roll-down in the term of the new deal compared to the old deal, not significant but a little. Most of it is just good old-fashioned real rent growth. And the other piece is the bumps are growing. We are at about 2.25% to 2.4% in our total portfolio right now. But about every deal we're doing today is at 3%, or in some cases, even more bump. So that means the old - some of the old leases that are rolling were 1.5%. So you're seeing the old lease go from a bump of probably 1.5% to maybe 2% was a good bump and then the new lease is 3%. So the bumps are about double.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Next we turn to the line of John Guinee.","John Guinee","Great. Just to help me on, Mark, or help us all out. Based on your sources and uses, when do you think you'd need to tap the equity markets again?","Mark Denien","When do we need to tap the equity markets again? It won't...","John Guinee","Say at 5.5 net debt-to-EBITDA.","Mark Denien","It won't be 2019. It'll be beyond that. And a lot will depend on development that we'll give guidance on beginning next year. But I can tell you, whatever that guidance is, John, we will not need to tap the equity markets in 2019.","Ronald Hubbard","I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today, and we look forward to reconvening again during our fourth quarter call, scheduled for the same time on Thursday, January 31, 2019.

","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ronald Hubbard","Thanks, Alicia. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, CFO; Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer; and Steve Schnur, Chief Operating Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2018 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying that 2019 was another outstanding year for Duke Realty. We met or exceeded all of our 2019 goals, including our revised guidance throughout the year. We also capped off the year with an excellent fourth quarter from an operational and financial perspective that sets us up for a great start to 2020 and beyond.","Let me just recap some of the highlights from our outstanding year. We signed nearly 26 million square feet of leases, we maintained our stabilized portfolio at about 98% leased on an average throughout the year, and our in-service portfolio at about 96% leased on average. We renewed 77% of our leases and obtained 29% GAAP rent growth and 12% cash rent growth on second-generation leases for the full year, respectively. We grew same-property NOI at 4.7%, which exceeded our revised guidance expectations. We commenced $1.1 billion of new development starts that were 55% preleased, 73% of which were in coastal Tier 1 markets. We placed $715 million of developments in service that are now 75% leased. We completed $494 million of property dispositions and $217 million of acquisitions. We've raised $575 million of debt at an average yield of 2.85%, including the first U.S. issued green bond offering by an industrial REIT and raised $266 million of equity. We grew FFO per share and AFFO on an adjusted basis by 8.3% and 10.2%, respectively, and increased our regular quarterly common dividend by 9.3%. And finally, we continue to run our company with a most responsible manner in an ESG culture with numerous ESG achievements.","Now let me turn it over to Steve Schnur to cover our -- to cover the fourth quarter and touch base on the market fundamentals.","Steven Schnur","Thanks, Jim. I'll first touch base on the overall market fundamentals. Supply exceeded demand for the quarter by about 7 million square feet and for the full year by about 35 million square feet, which nudged up national vacancy rates from about 4.2% earlier in the year to 4.4% at the end of 2019. We anticipated this happening, and I think it's important to note that vacancy at 4.4% is still about 200 basis points below the long-term average. Market rents continue to grow across the country at about 4% during 2019 over the prior year. The under-construction pipeline at year-end was about 310 million square feet or about 2.1% of the U.S. stock.","As we discussed the last few quarters, there are a handful of submarkets currently out of balance. If we add up the 5 mentioned last quarter and now add North Houston to that watch list, our total NOI exposure to these submarkets is approximately 4.3%, and the tenant roll over the next 2 years in these submarkets for us is less than 1% of our total revenue. So we have now modest, yet manageable exposure to these high-supply submarkets and, obviously, they're not the focus of our expected 2020 development activities.","Moreover, demand in the U.S. remains very solid nationwide and exceptionally strong in the submarkets we're focused and to grow. In fact, we had our strongest quarter of the year, as Jim mentioned, with 8.3 million square feet of leases executed, which finished a string of 3 consecutive quarters of leasing over 7 million square feet, which was a record for us. We signed 20 leases in excess of 100,000 square feet and 6 leases over 500,000 feet, with an average of all leases signed of 139,000 feet, demonstrating a continued strong demand for well-located spaces across the entire size spectrum. In addition, the average lease term we signed during the quarter was 9.2 years. A few of the more notable lease transaction this quarter were repeat business transaction with customers, including Samsung, Home Depot, Amazon, US Foods and Crate and Barrel.","I'll also highlight an incidence in Northern New Jersey, where our team got in front of a known late 2020 lease expiration. We signed a new lease to backfill a 650,000 square foot facility when it expired in the third quarter of 2020. The new lease has a term of 15 years, had a GAAP rent growth of in excess of 50%. We also had a tremendous quarter on the first-generation leasing side. When excluding build-to-suits, we signed 2.3 million square feet of space and recently completed or still under-development spec projects, all of which outperformed our original underwriting projections by about 3 months on the lease-up and roughly 25% on rental rate. One of these was a 1 million square foot spec project in Southern California that some of you may have seen in our NAREIT property tour in November. It was a 9 parcel land assemblage and took 3 years to entitle. We broke ground in early '19. And by November, before the building was completed, we have signed a lease for the entire building with a major e-commerce retailer.","The second example was in the New Jersey Meadowlands submarket, where we delivered a 660,000 foot spec facility in the fourth quarter and, immediately upon completion, signed a lease with a major e-commerce user for the entire building. We believe this is yet another example of the e-commerce demand for mid- to large-sized facilities as well as our development expertise in densely-populated and infill markets.","At quarter end, our stabilized in-service portfolio was 97.8% leased. The lease activity for the quarter, combined with strong fundamentals, led to another great quarter of rent growth for us with 12% cash and 32% GAAP. And looking at the GAAP rent growth by size, for the full year in 2019, we realized 24% growth for deals under 250,000 feet and 32% for deals over 250,000 feet. We expect rent growth in 2020 to be relatively similar to 2019 by capturing rent upside on our lease expirations over the next 18 months, which continue to be supported by mid- to single-digit market level rent growth and, in general, a mark-to-market in the 14% to 18% range in our portfolio.","We also had a tremendous quarter on development starts in the fourth quarter, breaking ground on 5 projects totaling over $300 million. These include a 665,000 foot build-to-suit for Home Depot in Atlanta near the Hartsfield Airport as well as spec projects in Northern New Jersey and Southern California. Our development pipeline at year-end totaled $1 billion with 74% allocated to coastal Tier 1 markets. The pipeline was 56% preleased and is expected to generate margins in excess of 33%.","One last note on development. As you saw from a recent press release earlier this month, we've established a policy to develop all future facilities to attain LEED certification. Not only will this initiative enhance our own corporate responsibility goals, but it'll help to meet the needs of a growing universe of our customers with sustainability objectives. We also believe over the long term, it will improve the desirability and operating efficiency of our own portfolio.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover the acquisitions and disposition activity for the quarter.","Nicholas Anthony","Thanks, Steve. We had an active quarter on both dispositions and acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets, we sold $110 million of assets in the fourth quarter, comprised of 2 facilities in Indianapolis and 1 facility in Columbus, Ohio. In turn, we used a portion of these proceeds to acquire 2 projects totaling $68 million. One of the investments was a 240,000 square foot newly completed asset in South Florida at our Countyline Park in the Medley submarket, a transaction I mentioned on last quarter's call.","The second investment was a 220,000 square foot facility in the East Bay submarket of Northern California. While there'll be some minor dilution from these asset trades initially, we anticipate long-term accretion, given the higher growth profile of the assets we are acquiring. We expect this recycling to continue in 2020 with dispositions mostly in our Midwest markets and potentially a few buildings outside the Midwest to manage tenant exposure.","I'll now turn it over to Mark to cover our earnings results and the balance sheet activities.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.38 per share compared to core FFO of $0.37 per share in the third quarter and represented an 8.6% increase over the $0.35 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. Core FFO was $1.44 per share for the full year 2019 compared to $1.33 per share for 2018, which represents an 8.3% annual increase. The increased core FFO for both the year and the quarter compared to 2018 was a result of our continued investment in and lease-up of new developments as well as rent growth on second-generation leases and increased occupancy.","FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $1.40 per share for the full year 2019 compared to $1.34 per share for 2018. AFFO totaled $476 million for the full year 2019 and $115 million for the fourth quarter. Our annual results represented a 10.2% increase to AFFO on a share adjusted basis.","Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the 3 months and 12 months ended December 31, 2019, was 3.7% and 4.7%, respectively. Same-property growth for the quarter was driven by continued strong rent growth, which offset a 40 basis point decline in average commencement occupancy within our same-property portfolio from the fourth quarter of 2018. We anticipate net operating income from non-same-store properties, which was 18.5% of total net operating income for the quarter, will continue to be a source of growth as we lease up recently-developed properties and keep up a robust pace of new development starts. Same-property NOI growth on a GAAP basis was 2.7% for the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the full year 2019.","During the fourth quarter, we issued $400 million of green bonds, the first such issuance by an industrial REIT in the U.S. at a face rate of 2.875%. We also redeemed $250 million of unsecured notes, which were set to mature in early 2021. We now have no significant debt maturities until 2022 and finished 2019 with no borrowings on our $1.2 billion line of credit.","We intend to fund growth in 2020 and beyond, with $111 million of cash on hand at the end of 2019, $110 million that we received earlier this month for the final payment on the seller financing from our medical office portfolio cell. Annual funds available for reinvestment after dividends, which are expected to exceed $150 million in 2020 as well as proceeds from expected 2020 asset sales. With these sources of funding and potentially opportunistic ATM equity issuance, we expect to be able to finance continued growth with a moderate increase in leverage levels.","I'll turn it back over to Jim to provide a macro outlook before I get into our guidance components.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. From a macro outlook perspective, we expect the economic environment in 2020 to be relatively steady compared to 2019, with GDP forecast currently around 2%, with some potential upside from the recent easing of trade tensions, continued strong labor markets and consumer confidence as evidenced by news earlier this week.","Regarding real estate fundamentals, the supply pipeline today is a bit elevated, but not of material concern, as Steve alluded to earlier. In fact, I'll share a downside statistic that I've done before. If the estimated unleased segment of the 300 million square feet in the national pipeline, which will remain vacant once complete, vacancy rates would only rise to about 5.5%, which is still 200 basis points below U.S. historical averages. Our view is that if we can maintain a steady macro environment as just depicted and the majority of our submarkets remain supply constrained, the overall fundamentals picture is quite supportive of continued market growth and, thus, sets up a positive year for pricing power and new development starts.","With that, let me turn it back over to Mark to discuss our 2020 guidance metrics.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Jim. Yesterday, we announced a range for 2020 core FFO per share of $1.48 to $1.54 per share with the midpoint of $1.51. We also announced growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 3.1% and 7.7%, with the midpoint of 5.4%. Our average in-service portfolio occupancy range is expected to be 95.1% to 97.1%.","Same-property NOI growth is projected in the range of 3.6% to 4.4%. Same-property growth will largely be driven by rent growth as we actually expect a slight decrease to occupancy in our same-property portfolio as we focus on maximizing rent growth when leases roll, which at times may result in temporary periods of vacancy. In addition, we continue to expect strong rental rate increases from our re-leasing efforts on the approximately 5% of our total portfolio that expires during the year. This low level of expiration is a result of our leasing teams being able to accelerate early renewals at very favorable new rental rates. Similarly, we expect to be able to pull some 2020 lease expirations into 2020 -- pull some 2021 lease expirations into 2020 to take advantage of the current environment, similar to what we did in 2019.","On the capital recycling front, we expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $300 million to $500 million. The majority of dispositions are expected to come from certain Midwest submarkets as well as some modest pruning-related, managing-tenant exposures Nick alluded.","Acquisitions are projected in a range of $100 million to $300 million with a continued focus on coastal Tier 1 markets. Development starts are projected in a range of $675 million to $875 million with a continuing target to maintain a pipeline at about 50% preleased. Our pipeline of build-to-suit prospects continues to remain robust, and our 2020 guidance is higher than the initial development guidance we provided for 2019.","Our range of G&A expense is $55 million to $59 million [Technical Difficulty]. These G&A levels are slightly lower than 2019, which was impacted by the implementation of a new ERP system.","On the balance sheet side, we expect net debt-to-EBITDA to be in a range of 5.2 to 4.8x and fixed charge coverage should be in a range of 5.0 to 5.4x. These leverage metrics are comparable to 2019 levels. And with the embedded sources of capital mentioned earlier, we expect to be able to finance continued growth, while staying well within the parameters of our current credit rating. More specific assumptions and components of our 2020 guidance are available in the 2020 range of estimates document on the Investor Relations website.","Now I'll turn it back to Jim for final comments.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. In closing, I'd like to reiterate what a great year 2019 was for Duke Realty, with many all-time first and record highs. As we look ahead into 2020, we remain very optimistic about our ability to replicate the type of results we've been able to achieve since becoming a pure-play industrial logistics company in 2017. With best-in-class operating teams on the ground in all of our markets, our balance sheet, as Mark just alluded to, is as good as it's ever been and positioned to fund our growth well into the future. The value creation of our development pipeline will create strong earnings growth beyond 2020 at exceptionally high margins. We have developed our ability -- we've demonstrated our ability to grow in the coastal Tier 1 markets and we'll continue to do so. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank all of my colleagues at Duke Realty for all of their hard work and dedication that has allowed us to achieve the level of success we have. I also want to thank our investors for their continued support and the recognition of our good stewardship of their invested capital.","Now we'll open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","Nick, I think you mentioned this first and then Mark repeated, but you talked about selling assets to manage tenant exposure. Is that managing tenant exposure on weak side where you want to trim those exposures where you think there could be tenant issues? Or is it trim tenant exposure just from the fact that you've gotten too big with some of your larger tenants?","Nicholas Anthony","It's the latter, Manny. Obviously, we have a large tenant that we continue to do a lot of business with. And we have consistently done this over the years, is prune to some of those assets as we continue to do more business with them.","Emmanuel Korchman","And then in terms of managing the relationship between retention and occupancy and rental rate growth, do you guys have a revenue management system in place? Are you building a revenue management system to just sort of control that? Or is it more touch and feel and using your market teams to determine what's appropriate or not?","James Connor","Yes, Manny. We've got part of our budgeting forecasting system. We do have basically downloads that we get with market data and can compare projected deals with what we believe is market rental rate deals to make sure we're getting fair pricing. So we do have that capability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.","Richard Anderson","I couldn't figure out the 1-0, queue, so sorry for that. Anyway, maybe a question for Jim. In the age of e-commerce, there has not been a condition of damaging oversupply. I think that's correct because, obviously, things have ran from an e-commerce perspective over the past several years. Do you guys have any sense of what that might look like? Because even in a situation of national oversupply now, you're still getting fairly substantial market rent growth. I just wonder what your vision would be of when those trees do stop growing to the sky here. What is it going to look like? Do you think it could be a substantial sort of drop off or more of a sort of an easing type of an event?","James Connor","Well, Rich, let me answer it in a couple of ways. I mean the one correction I would point out is we don't think there's national oversupply. We've all spent a lot of time talking about oversupply being limited to a handful of submarkets in what are otherwise generally pretty healthy markets. And we won't digress into all the different submarkets. But more specific to your question, you have to remember, Amazon and the e-commerce industry was around not to the extent that they are today in the financial crisis. But I think what you're seeing today is their primary activity is their desire to get closer into major population areas, and that's typically not where we're seeing the oversupply. The oversupply is greenfield development in submarkets with low barrier to entry. And I think most of the major e-commerce companies and, quite candidly, the retail companies and the consumer companies already have most of those regional facilities in place that would be ideal for that. Most of what Amazon and the others are looking at today is much closer in -- to drive that last-mile 24-hour fulfillment promise that they made starting about a year ago.","Richard Anderson","Okay. And so with that in mind, do you see yourselves perhaps moving closer in? Obviously, you have a lot of different-sized categories in the portfolio, but do you have an appetite to get smaller as the e-commerce business evolves over time?","James Connor","Absolutely. I would make a couple of comments. If you've just touched on the highlighted transaction that Steve covered from the fourth quarter, major deals with Home Depot and Amazon in the Meadowlands, I mean, you can't get much closer in the tri-state area, a lot of our infill redevelopment in Southern California projects that we have teed up for 2020 in the East Bay, in the San Francisco market and the same in Dade County down in Miami. So you will continue to see us focus on that in those coastal Tier 1 markets. But the other comment I would make, if you -- we get a lot of headlines from the million square footers, and we all love that. But as Steve said in his comments, I think our average deal size in the fourth quarter was 139,000 feet. So it's not about million square footers. We're doing plenty of 75,000 and 100,000 square footers along with the other mix.","We've just been trying to combat for the last couple of quarters that people think the rent growth and the performance of the smaller buildings is better than the bigger buildings. And quite candidly, we just haven't seen that in our portfolio. Not that 24% rent growth in the smaller buildings is bad. It just happens to be better in the bigger buildings, but you'll continue to see us take a very broad-based focus on development. Steve has, from time to time, gone through the development pipeline with people. And we have buildings from 75,000 square feet to 1 million square feet. So you'll continue to see us focus on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird.","Nicholas Thillman","It's Nick here with Dave Rodgers. Looking at dispositions, you had like roughly $500 million last year and around $300 million to $500 million this year. Is that a good run rate looking into like 2021?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, I would say so. Probably a little higher this year. But yes, I would say, that we'll consistently run at that -- those levels for the next few years.","James Connor","Nick, I would add the variable to that is, it all depends what the development pipeline looks like. Our guidance was a little lower at the start of last year, just simply because the markets did not perform particularly well at the end of 2018 going into 2019, but, obviously, we were able to accelerate development activity over the course of the year, and that's one of the levers we can pull to help fund that development activity has increased dispositions by $100 million or $150 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James Feldman","Great. I want to go back to the supply question. And -- can you hear me?","James Connor","Sure, Jamie.","James Feldman","Okay, good. I want to go back to the supply discussion. So I mean you talk about these oversupply specific submarkets. And I'm just curious, like, in the broader markets, when you have an oversupply submarket, how does that impact fundamentals in the not-oversupply submarkets? Like, our people just completely treating them as different and you're still able to push rents and people aren't pushing back on concessions or anything like that. Can you just give some color on how that's playing out within the same market?","James Connor","Yes, let me start with that and then Steve can give you a little bit more color. Take any of the major metros, take Chicago. And we've talked in the past, although, I would tell you Chicago's kind of off of our watch list, simply because they had a huge second half of the year and took vacancies in that I-80 corridor, down probably 300 basis points. But when you have softness in that market, particularly in the big box side, but you have markets in Chicago like DuPage County and O'Hare, which are probably 20 to 40 miles away, and they suit different customer base. So very few people in our world are going to leave one of those markets to go to the I-80 corridor to take advantage of the softness of the market and drive the prices down. And I think you'd see the same in Dallas, if you were in the DFW market. There's very few people that are going to leave that market and go 30 miles south to South Dallas to take advantage of the softer market. Now it could happen, but, generally, people are where they are because they -- that's where they need to be.","Steven Schnur","Yes. Jamie, I'll add to that is I think an advantage we have with our local operating teams is knowing the markets very well. There is some -- obviously, there's some drafting and some of the tenant rep folks out there try to do the best they can for their clients, but knowing your product, knowing your submarkets, I think, it pays dividends and cases like that.","James Feldman","So when you think about your weaker submarkets, are there any that do have more bleed across the entire market? Or it's pretty consistent?","Steven Schnur","No. I mean, I think the big metros, if you're looking at, like Jim mentioned, south of Chicago, there's I-80 drag down a little bit in I-55. Again, it depends on the kind of requirement that there is and what the ultimate use of that facility is. I'd say, the same with South Dallas. Again, it depends how far south, what size use it is. You really need to drill into that level of specificity to understand if that's going to affect you or not.","James Feldman","Okay. And then finally for me, if you think about your guidance last year, I think you came out at a much lower same-store NOI growth rate than you -- I think you came out at 4.5%, and you're ending -- ended much higher than that. I think you initially guided to like $700 million of starts and you're now finishing the year at $1.1 billion. Can you just talk through kind of how you got to -- how you're getting to your initial numbers for this year? And what the -- what would take it a lot higher or even lower? Just how much conservative is baked into your current estimates?","James Connor","Yes. Jamie, I'll start and then Mark can chime in. We start our budget process literally in August and build it up from there. We think the budget today, and our guidance has, what I would tell you is, the appropriate amount of conservatism in it. It's not overly aggressive. We don't think given everything that we're seeing in the world, it's a time to put an overly aggressive budget out there. What would lead us to be able to outperform like we did last year and the last couple of years since we become pure-play, Steve alluded to, it's build-to-suit activity to keeping that development pipeline above 50% preleased. It's leasing our first-generation spec space as it comes into service or before, keeping that second-generation occupancy up as well with our continued focus on rent growth. So we can continue to do that, which we did last year. That will give us the ability to outperform.","The other thing, which we've talked about earlier is, you got to remember that even if we outperform on the new development starts by, pick a number, several hundred million dollars, that's not going to fall to the bottom line in 2020. That's future growth beyond, because those are buildings that we're starting this year. Even if they're build-to-suits, there's very, very little income that's going to come in from those in 2020. So what we're doing is building in growth for 2021 and 2022. But leasing, keeping the pipeline occupied and continue to focus on rent growth, will allow us to continue to outperform in all the metrics.","Mark Denien","And Jamie, the only thing I would add to that, from a same-property perspective, we had virtually no bad debt or tenant default issues in our same-property portfolio in either '19 or '18. But we believe from a budgetary guidance perspective, it is prudent to build a little bit more of a normalized amount in there. If it doesn't happen and we have another successful year of not having any issues like that, there would certainly be some upside based on that.","James Feldman","Okay. So how much -- how many basis points of your same-store growth is? Is that a drag?","Mark Denien","If you look at occupancy, bad debt, whatever you want to call it, which sometimes are one and the same, it's about 50 basis points.","James Feldman","50, 5-0. Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.","Vikram Malhotra","Just so on this, the big box, small box numbers you alluded to, I just wanted to clarify the rent numbers that you were giving, the 14% to 18% overall. I'm assuming those were cash rent spreads. And can you give us a sense kind of how that may look across the property sizes? And just related to that, one of your peers alluded to the fact that smaller retailers are now sort of starting to retool their supply chains, maybe lagging some of the larger ones. And so there's a pickup in big box demand. Is that what you're seeing as well?","James Connor","Well, that's one of the things we alluded to in earlier calls is e-commerce has been a great tailwind for us. But the other one that doesn't get nearly as much credit is, as you alluded to, retailers and consumer products reengineering their supply chain because, effectively, Amazon has set consumer expectations at overnight, 24-hour delivery. So if you want to compete, you have to have a supply chain in place that can allow you to do that. So there's been a lot of that repositioning. And that's been, obviously, another big benefit for us. And then I'll let Steve give you some of the details.","Steven Schnur","I guess I'd add one thing before I get into the rent growth side. Just from a demand standpoint, I mentioned in my comments, it's pretty broad and widespread. I think the category is leading that demand or 3PL, e-commerce, retail, food and beverage, and we saw some auto deals as well this past year. So back to your question on rent growth by size, I'll give you our breakdown. For deals under 100,000 feet for '19, our cash rent growth was 10.6% and our GAAP was 25%; between 100,000 and 250,000 was 10% cash, 24% GAAP; 250,000 to 500,000 was 14% cash and 29% GAAP; and over 500,000 was 16% cash and 44% GAAP. So again, I think as Jim made a comment, very good across the board, in particular, to the assets we own, quite opposite of some of the big box headlines that have been out there in the past.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. Great. And then just last one for me. So some of your -- some of the 3PLs have cited maybe slowing down or hesitating to go into certain submarkets or markets, not because of supply or just the absolute level of rents, but more because of labor and the challenges to find labor. Are there any markets that you would -- I don't know, if you want to call it -- if we'd call it a watch list, but any markets where you are seeing tenants just sort of step back and say, \"Hey, how do I get this fully operational because of labor issues?\"","James Connor","Yes. I mean, I guess, I think two things. One, I think the labor issue and the oversupply issue, there's -- not surprisingly, there is a little bit of overlap there. Labor is a big issue for our tenants. It is something that we take very serious on our side, and we do labor studies on every major parcel land we look at as well as any big exposures we have so that we're prepared in how to address that and whether we want to make that investment as it relates to land. But yes, labor is a concern. And I'd say, if you're looking for specific markets or submarkets, it actually overlays pretty well with the ones you mentioned what we've talked about from an oversupply standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel","Just per your same-property NOI growth guidance, can you just provide the explanation of what drives the difference between your GAAP and cash same-store NOI growth?","James Connor","Yes, Eric. Probably the biggest thing is if you look at 2020 same property, we added 34 properties to the pool. So these are properties that got stabilized kind of at the end of 2018. So now if you go to 2020, it's the first time you've got 2 full years. So you add those 34 properties in, most all of which were already leased on 1\/1\/19. So the GAAP rent growth is exactly 0, but you do have some cash rent growth either through some free rent burn off and\/or you get the rent bumps at least. So that's probably the biggest factor that's driving that, maybe a little bit bigger than normal gap between the cash and the GAAP number.","Eric Frankel","Okay. And then just per your investments this quarter, Nick, I think you always say that the yield you get on acquisition is a little bit lower than your disposition cap rates. But it actually looks somewhat narrow this quarter on a relative basis. Maybe you can provide just some color on the deals you've struck? And what kind of yield you expect in a couple of years on your acquisitions because actually -- 4.8% actually looks fairly high?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, it was a little narrower this quarter, partially because it was more of a pure quarter in terms of we're trading industrial for industrial. Some of the other quarters, we may have had some flex assets or some other assets in there that made the spread a little bit wider. And it's also just the mix. We actually sold a couple of Class A facilities in our Midwest markets that got very good pricing. So I think going forward, depending on the mix, you should see a similar results on spreads.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Lee with BMO.","Frank Lee","You mentioned earlier, you're able to complete a decent amount of early renewals, with only 5% of the portfolio expiring this year. Just want to get a sense of how do you balance decisions on early renewals versus holding off a bit potentially for higher rents?","Mark Denien","I'll start and then maybe Steve can chime in a little bit. If you look at 2019, we actually kind of doubled the amount of leasing we did on a renewal basis from what was going to expire. So if you look and forecast that, that would happen again in 2020, that 5% that's expiring, I think we can actually roll closer to 10% of those leases. The only thing -- and I'll let Steve talk about the economics, how we look at it. But just keep in mind that when we talk about early renewals, for the most part, we're talking a couple of quarters early. We're not talking a couple of years early. By the time the lease comes to -- the lease maturity date comes, if you haven't already got it renewed a quarter earlier, you're going to lose that tenant. So a lot of deals that are going to be expiring in the second and third quarter, we're doing those deals now, and the early renewals we'll be talking about in 2020 will likely be the first half of '21. So they're not extremely early, and then I'll let Steve comment on how we look at it from an economic perspective.","Steven Schnur","Yes, I think from an operations perspective, it's an asset management focus in terms of getting out in front of where our exposure is. But as Mark mentioned, it's -- this is still a landlord's market. So many times, these, what we'll call, early renewal discussions happen from the other side of the table, where the tenant deems their facility is mission critical and they want to make an investment in their facility, they want to lock -- tied up longer term and we welcome those discussions.","Frank Lee","Okay. Also -- and then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect a similar level of rent spreads this year. Are you able to break that down, your rent growth expectations between Tier 1 versus non-Tier 1 markets?","Steven Schnur","It's actually pretty consistent across all of our markets. And a lot of that has to do with lease term, because, obviously, the rents in the coastal Tier 1 markets are growing a lot faster than they are in the noncoastal markets. But we've got a lot of longer-term leases that have several years of embedded rent growth in them. So we're really seeing a pretty consistent rent growth across all of our markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jason on for Mike. Just a follow-up on Nick and Mark's comments around dispositions. I'm wondering what level of concentration with single tenant you're comfortable with before you begin looking to trim that exposure.","Mark Denien","Well, we've always said, we would start getting concerned when somebody approach 10%. Last year, our largest single tenant from an NOI perspective was 6% going to 7.5%, I think. And what we're seeing simply because of the amount of business that we have going with that tenant is that number approaching 10%. So we're just trying to be proactive and manage that. Look at our portfolio, look at lease expirations with that tenant and try and select the most appropriate targets to peel out of the portfolio and hopefully get the best pricing on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Guinee with Stifel.","John Guinee","Jim, there might be a typo in your financial statements, but it looks like you've reduced your land held for development down by about $95 million in the last 12 months, and you're down around $240 million. If that's correct? And not sure it is. And then you assume, say, $20 per buildable square foot, you're only down to, say, 12 million square feet of development capacity. If those numbers are right, and correct me if I'm wrong, where do you have your land inventory?","James Connor","Well, John, I assure you the numbers are correct. And that's actually -- we finished the year a little lower than we had anticipated. I would have told you 60 days ago that we thought that number would probably be a little bit closer to $300 million, but robust development activity in the fourth quarter and our ability to push some land closings into the first quarter of 2020 gave us a somewhat more favorable balance. You also have to remember, we control land that is under contract. It's not on the books yet or that's under option agreement. So we do have access to more land or just the $240 million that's referenced there.","And I will tell you, and we've all talked about this, land is one of our biggest challenges. We are out every day, pursuing a lot of different sites, particularly, as we've talked about in the coastal Tier 1 markets in the infill markets. And that's an area where we've been able to differentiate ourselves. Quite candidly, the more complicated the site, the better the opportunity for us. So you will continue to see us be very active on the land acquisition side, with the one caveat that, given where we are in the cycle, we're probably not interested in making really huge land bets that are going to take 3 or 4 years to entitle or put into the development pipeline. I just think that's probably a little bit careless at this point in the cycle. But we monetized $360 million to the land last year, doing $1 billion of development. As I said, answering some earlier questions, we can keep the build-to-suit pipeline going. We can keep our occupancies up. We'd sort of like to replicate that, and that will have us out buying another $300 million to $350 million worth of land.","John Guinee","Okay. And then Nick or Mark, what was your most recent dividend increase? And where are you up against your dividend payout ratios relative to taxable income? And how much if any gains in the disposition pipeline can be sheltered versus a need to 1031 Exchange them?","Mark Denien","Yes, John, we -- our last increase was in October. We raised our dividend -- our quarterly dividend $0.02 in October. We're pretty much up against it, quite frankly, but we've been able to shelter all the gains through 1031s. Most of those 1031s have been development because we can 1031 our development. It's somewhat complicated, but we've been able to do that. So we've been able to shelter those -- the gains that Nick's creating through 1031s. 2020 is the last year we have taxable income coming in from the medical office cell. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we collected the final installment on our note there of $110 million. So that will trigger another gain in 2020 as well. But long-winded answer, I don't think we have to raise our dividend to meet our requirement, but we're pretty close.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.","James Feldman","I'm sorry, if I missed it. Did you guys say what you think rent growth could be this year across your markets -- market rent growth?","Mark Denien","Yes, Jamie, I think we said that. Generally, for the next 12 to 18 months, we think rent growth is going to look pretty similar to what it was in '19, kind of that low double digit, kind of around 10% or maybe a little better on the cash and mid- to upper 20s on a GAAP basis.","James Feldman","This is your leasing spread or actual -- I'm thinking about market rent growth.","Mark Denien","Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I think we said in my comments, Jamie, I think we'll see U.S. market rent growth similar to what we had in '19, which is sort of probably mid-single digits in the middle part of the country, and you'll see some higher single digits to double digits on the coast.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors.","Eric Frankel","Can you just help me understand how much of your development starts' expectations for '20 is kind of already called for -- or accounted for, excuse me?","James Connor","For 2020, our development starts?","Eric Frankel","Yes.","James Connor","I mean, I would tell you, short of the build-to-suit side of the house. Obviously, we've got the spec projects identified with land that we either own or control. Our build-to-suit pipeline today looks good, but that's the variable component. If that answers your question?","Eric Frankel","Yes.","James Connor","That mix is 50-50. We did 25 projects this year in 2019, I should say, and 13 were spec and 12 were build-to-suits.","Eric Frankel","Okay. And then just your -- the timing of some of your Midwest sales this year, is that going to be towards the beginning of the year, end of the year, or is that just kind of dependent on your investment activity generally?","Nicholas Anthony","It depends on our investment activity, but it will be spread pretty evenly throughout the year. That's sort of how we stage it out. I think we've closed one asset so far this quarter. I think maybe first quarter might be a little lighter, and the second and third quarter will be a little heavier.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we do have a question from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","I was wondering is the mix of building sizes or would you consider to be infill when it comes to your 2020 development starts. Is that any different than what you saw over the past few years?","James Connor","No, I don't think so. You have to remember, a lot of the infill, the size of the building is driven by the land size. We're simply trying to max out the building. So in one case, it might be a mid-sized building of 150,000 feet, the next one might be 350,000 square feet. So it's not that we're specifically trying to target one size versus the other. On the infill, we're trying to maximize the value. It's really what we're trying to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.","Joshua Burr","This is Josh Burr on for Nick. Could you give us a breakout of your current exposure to the Tier 1 markets? And if you could get to that 70% goal this year, given your higher development and disposition guidance? And then can you talk about the development spreads you're getting in the Tier 1 markets? And how you see that trending?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, I'll start with that. Basically, on the coastal Tier 1, we moved that from 31% to 37% on a gross asset value basis by year-end of 2019. And we just -- because 75% of our land bank is in coastal Tier 1 markets, we expect that to continue to grow. And then just overall, on Tier 1, the gross asset value went from 59% to 65%. So the noncoastal Tier 1s are basically holding steady, and most of the growth is in the coastal Tier 1s.","Mark Denien","And then I would just comment on the yields. I think you had a question on the yield spreads. I'd tell you, the margins are still very, very healthy. I think our whole pipeline is at 33% from a margin perspective. I think we expect that to continue. Our yield did come down. It really came down during the year, but that's just a factor of what Nick just went through. It's because more of our development is done now in these infill high-barrier markets. And we're creating a great deal of value, but the yield is lower on a GAAP basis because the cap rates are lower.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Going back to the submarkets that are prone to oversupply, I know you don't have a lot of exposure there. But I'm just kind of looking at that as maybe as a lesson learned for how those markets behave when it is becoming oversupplied. Is it fairly typical to what we've seen in other cycles, like higher TIs or free rent and lower rent? Like what are you seeing in those submarkets?","James Connor","Yes, I think in those submarkets that don't have the barriers to entry that we talked about, you're seeing concessions in terms of free rent starting to creep in, obviously, you're seeing pressure on rental rates. We've seen TIs creep up. So yes, those are the things. I mean I would tell you that the bigger concern, whether it's these handful of submarkets or anything else, a lot of headlines gets talked about relative to supply. I think you need to keep in mind, we still did 185 million feet of absorption for the year and that's better than the historical average of about 175 million. And as long as that number keeps up, we'll continue to see good economics in our space.","Ki Bin Kim","Well, what do you think like the net effective rent declines are in those markets?","James Connor","It's hard to say. I mean, I think you've probably seen -- probably in the worst submarkets, maybe you've seen 10% declines. But I mean that's a nuance type of stat.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just last question. Within your Tier 1 bucket, what submarkets are you in? I guess I should say it this way, are you pretty satisfied with the submarkets you're in within those Tier 1s? Or do you think there's even more kind of movement that you want to do or portfolio reshuffling within those Tier 1 buckets to go into that barrier submarkets?","Nicholas Anthony","Well, I mean, Ki Bin, we're always looking at our portfolio and ways that we can improve it. So there will be times where we may have an asset or 2 that we either got through a portfolio acquisition or something that we've had for a while in a submarket that we may prune out one of the Tier 1s. I would say, it's mostly going to be in the noncoastal Tier 1s if that would occur, not the costal Tier 1s. We're relatively new in those markets, and we're very happy with where those portfolios are situated right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Ronald Hubbard","Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you during the year at various industry conferences as well as hopefully getting out to our regional markets.

And welcome to the Duke Realty Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference to our host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Hubbard","Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2017, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now, for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks Ron. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start up with a short update on the business environment we're seeing today and then cover our second quarter results. Demand for logistics space has never been strong. An expanding economy and the rapid pace of supply chain reconfiguration and expansion continues to provide tailwinds for logistics real estate. Across the U.S., industrial market fundamentals maintain the momentum we saw in the first quarter. Demand outpaced supply by 10 million square feet for the quarter.","Year-to-date, net absorption was about 105 million square feet, slightly above the rate for 2017, but similar to what we've seen for the last few years. Completions year-to-date were about 90 million square feet also relatively similar to the last few years. U.S. industrial market vacancy now stands at 4.4% which is down 20 basis points from a year ago. Nationally, rents grew 6% for the quarter compared to the second quarter a year ago and we would expect that rent growth to remain constant through the remainder of the year.","We're seeing new construction across the country maintaining a somewhat level pace. Total supply under construction is about 230 million square feet. Yet we expect demand to continue to outpace supply which bodes well for continued tight fundamentals and rent growth for the foreseeable future. Let me touch on the topic of trade tariffs, which are currently in the headlines. We are not currently seeing or hearing of any impact from our customers today.","I would also point to business inventories and industrial production, both of which grew in the second quarter. Consumer spending rates a data point that's highly correlated to the demand for our type of product are at the highest level since the 2008 recession. This news combined with strong consumer sentiment leads us to believe the tariffs will not materially impact our business for the foreseeable future.","Even if the situation would escalate and the impact on consumption or consumer confidence, we believe the supply chain trends occurring today with the demand for larger more cost effective facilities and last mile infill development will continue to drive demand on our sector. Switching to the construction side, we have seen increases in steel pricing and labor costs and those increased have pushed our total hard costs up by about 5% to 6%. However, market rents continuing to rise. These increases have of not really impacted our yields.","Turning to our own operating results, we\u2019re seeing similar strength in our own portfolio with stabilized in-service occupancy at 98.2%, which is down slightly from the last quarter, but still very strong. Total in-service occupancy is up 40 basis points to 97.4% due largely the leasing progress in our spec projects. During the quarter, we executed 7.8 million square foot of leases across 16 markets, which is very strong in light of the high occupancy and relatively low lease explorations in our portfolio.","The lease activity included space from recent acquisitions as well as spec developments and exceeded our underwriting on both lease-up timing and rental rates. A few notable leasing transactions for the quarter included a 1 million square foot 20-year lease in the Lehigh Valley, which is our newest speculative facility, was delivered the same month. This lease was with a major parcel carrier, logistics firm and brings the occupancy of our 2.7 million square foot 33 Logistics Park to 100%.","Secondly, there were three leases executed in the Bridge portfolio, which brought that entire 3.4 million square foot portfolio to a 100% lease, compared to 58% lease when we agreed to terms just over a year ago. The leasing in this portfolio exceeded our original expectations both in terms of timing and rental rates. In general, the performance of these acquired Bridge assets as well as other investments funded from the 2017 MOB sale has contributed to our decision to raise full year 2018 occupancy and earnings expectations, which Mark will discuss in a moment. Overall, the leasing activity is strong fundamentals led to another outstanding quarter of rent growth of 9% and 22% on a cash and GAAP basis respectively.","Turning to the development for the quarter, we started $393 million of projects across 9 markets. These projects were 53% preleased in aggregate and are projected to earn an average initial cash yield of 6.5%. Our development outlook for the remainder of the year looks very solid. We have a healthy pipeline of prospects across our entire platform. This combined with the outstanding year-to-date results is driving our increase guidance for development work, which Mark will also cover in a moment.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Nick to cover acquisitions and disposition activity for the quarter.","Nick Anthony","Thanks Jim. We close 301 million of disposition in the second quarter with all of those proceeds were from the Columbus portfolio, which we mentioned in previous calls and a deal that went in news from the buyer's press release back in May. As you recall, this was a 3.8 million square foot portfolio located about 50 miles west to the Columbus, Ohio that Bon-Ton stores, a company and liquidation contributing 20% NOI.","In context of this risk and some other lease expirations in the few years, we believe we achieved very strong price in the sale of $61 per square feet. We've recycled the portion of these dispositions proceeds into acquisitions which totals $187 million for the quarter. The largest one was a 1.1 million square foot, 3 buildings state-of-the-art logistic portfolio in Miami, Florida. These assets are located in the Medley Submarket near the Miami airport.","Moreover, we expect this recycling from the Columbus assets and to infill Miami to be accretive on a long-term IRR basis by approximately 90 basis points, given the near-term vacancy and rollover in the Columbus portfolios compared to those tech players and expected better market rent growth in Miami, we were pleased with the execution of our redeployment.","I will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and revised guidance.","Mark Denien","Thanks Nick. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.33 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2018 and $0.32 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Core FFO increased from the first quarter of 2018 due to the typical first quarter spike in non-cash G&A expense related to our annual stock-based compensation grant in February, along with continued overall strong operating results.","We reported FFO as defined by NAREIT of $0.33 per share for the quarter compared to $0.31 per share for the first quarter of '18 and $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2017. NAREIT FFO in the second quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by $20 million of promote income we've recognized in connection with the medical office sale.","Same property NOI growth for the quarter was 3.9% on a cash basis, up from 3.4% in the first quarter and growth is 3.7% year-to-date as a result of continued rental rate growth on releasing as well as free rent periods burning off on leases that commenced over the last few quarters. Year-to-date, same property NOI on a GAAP basis is about 130 basis points higher than our cash basis due to free rent and some prior straight line rent bad debt expense. Looking out for the remainder of the year, we expect same property growth to continue to accelerate in Q3.","We finished the quarter with $232 million in available cash to redeploy into new investments. We also have $277 million in interest bearing notes, of which a $145 million will mature over the 12 months and no outstanding borrowings under unsecured line of credit. As discussed last quarter, our capital needs for the remainder of the year includes the prepayment of two secured loans in September totaling $227 million which were interest at an average rate of over 7.6%.","Let me now address our revisions to our 2018 expected range of estimates, which is an exhibit at the back of our quarterly supplement as well as on our website. To reflect the continued leasing momentum and overall strong rental rate growth which continues at a pace that significantly exceeds our original expectations, we have further increased guidance for core FFO to a range of $1.29 to a $1.35 per share which equates to $0.03 per share at the midpoint.","As mentioned in April, the majority of this growth will be generated from newer developments. A perfect example of this is our second quarter development deliveries. We delivered 2.9 million square feet representing an investment of a $198 million that were 57% preleased when we started the projects, but were delivered at 100% leased. The margin on these deliveries was almost 50% well ahead of our original expectations. We continue to have tremendous earnings upside from our platform that will not be included in our same property results, but is nonetheless a great outcome.","W will balances with continue solid growth in our same property population, which is impressive given the risk return nature of this population at 98% occupied with very little rollover the next couple of years. This increase in core FFO guidance is indicative of an 8% to 11% increase for the second half of 2018, compared to the first half of 2018 and an 11% to 15% increase over the second half of 2017.","We\u2019ve been saying that we believe, we are positioned for strong growth by the second half of this year, and this guidance update reflects that. We also increased our ranges for average percentage lease for both our stabilized and in-service portfolios with midpoints increasing my 30 and 40 basis points respectively.","We increased our estimate for development starts by $100 million to a range of $758 million to $950 million for the year and reduce the high-end of our acquisition guidance by $100 million. In addition, we increased our range on dispositions by 85 million at the midpoint to arrange a $472 million to $600 million. Reverse revisions to certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks Mark. In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our team\u2019s execution through mid-year across our operations, capital redeployment and development. Logistics real estate fundamentals are firing in all cylinders. It appears the economies on solid footing and our strategy and platform is work very well positioned to capture growth opportunities for our shareholders. We will now open up the lines to the audience. We asked participants that you keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two short questions. You of course are welcome to get back in the queue.","Operator, you may open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our question today -- first question today comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Jim, I appreciate the comments on sort of the tenant health or trade environment. I was just wondering at the top, how you measure sort of the health of your sort of tendency or especially in the growth plan? And how it relates to specific properties in your portfolio?","James Connor","Well, I think there\u2019s two components there, Manny. The health or what we would refer to as the financial health, we\u2019ve got fairly strict credit rating and underwriting guidelines that we\u2019ve always maintained. So, those are in place and those haven\u2019t changed. In terms of our client outlook and in particular their reaction to all of the headlines about tariffs, we have meetings and conversations with our major tenants on an ongoing basis.","We sat personally with three of the larger ones just this week and had those same conversations in terms of what they\u2019re feeling, what they\u2019re seeing, if they\u2019re changing any of their expectations for their use of space and their need of space for the balance of this year or next year. And we have yet to see one of our major clients tell us, they\u2019re putting things on hold or pulling back. So, we\u2019re still pretty optimistic that the overall positive direction of the economy is going to continue to hold from a logistics sector.","Manny Korchman","And then in terms of your development pipeline, as a pipeline grows in your pre-leasing stats have come down a little bit and getting closer I guess the lower end of your comfort zone? Does that comfort zone shift at all given how well the economies doing and given sort of your opportunities that for development?","James Connor","Manny, I think it\u2019s really the change if you see the last couple of quarters is just timing. Given the nationwide nature of our development activities, we do more development in the summer month. So typically the second quarter result is probably our strongest development quarter. So we had anticipated that that preleased percentage would come down the lower end of the range. And it may yet come down again towards the bottom of that range in the third quarter. But again that should we expected and as long as we keep leasing than going build-to-suit, we expect to stay above 50% and continue to push our development volumes across the country.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck","Jim, clearly you guys had a big win with the UBS lease this quarter. So I wanted your thoughts on the Lehigh Valley market in general. There has been some off-and-on talk of oversupply there. But I'd be curious to hear, how you think it's positioned at this point?","James Connor","That would not make the top of our caution list. There is a fair bit of space out there, but there always been demand and it tends to come and go in pretty big increments. The ones that we historically always talked about have been in no particular order probably Atlanta, Dallas and then the Inland Empire East, which is where there is a lot of spec base out there, but there continues to be good demand.","So in short order, I would tell you we're not concerned about the Lehigh Valley. We've got another 130,000 foot building that's under construction become in-service here the next couple of weeks and we've got really strong activity on that as well.","Blaine Heck","That's helpful. And then I noticed the cap rate you guys are using in the value creation calculation on the development pipeline increased from last quarter. All of the commentary we've heard points to decreasing cap rates. So I'm assuming it's a mixed issue, but wanted to get some commentary on what exactly drove that change?","James Connor","You're exactly right, Blaine. As far as the population driving this cap rate, it's entirely mixed. I'll let Nick to comment on the overall cap rate environment because I think it's the opposite.","Nick Anthony","Yes, that's correct. We continue to see some cap rate compression. CBRE just came out what their cap rate survey and I think they noted that Tier 1 markets cap rate compressed by about 10 basis points and the Tier 2 markets decreased about 15 basis points.","Blaine Heck","Great.","James Connor","Just a mixed issue this quarter.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Rich Anderson. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","So, on the asset sales in particular Columbus and Bon-Ton component to that and then the redeployment, can you talk about and if it's in your some place I missed it that there is kind of the spread -- cap rate spread that you -- that impacted perhaps your numbers and maybe some dilution from that trade in particular that perhaps could allow you to grow your FFO guidance even further had it not been for that trade?","Mark Denien","Well, the in place cap rate for the Columbus portfolio was fixed. But once Bon-Ton vacated, it was high-4s. And that compares to the acquisitions which were mid 4s. So, it's actually sort of a wash when you factored into the fact that Bon-Ton vacated. And then as we noted on our long term basis, the yields are much higher on the Miami transaction.","James Connor","So, it is a little dilutive from what it was in the first half of the year, but it wasn't only dilutive for the last half of the year once that Bon-Ton lease rolled.","Richard Anderson","Right but in terms of what your run-rate was because you did have fixed working for you at this point in time?","James Connor","Yes, it is dilutive, you're right, for the second half a year. I guess my point is, it would have been dilutive what we did to Miami transaction not because of the vacancy that was coming out of some Bon-Ton.","Rich Anderson","And then, I want to talk about property taxes and as I just chatted with Ron a little bit pre-earnings about the fact that you\u2019re largely triple net like a lot of your peers. And I\u2019m curious to what degree do you worry about property taxes given that a lot of that would be passed through and how you\u2019re managing that issue in particular?","James Connor","Well, [Brad], I would make a couple of comments. Property taxes are our second biggest expense in operating the portfolio and even though we\u2019re 98% leased and most of these buildings are our true triple net leased. The fact the overall gross rent that we can achieve in the marketplace, so we\u2019re always very sensitive to tax increases, we also very sensitive to markets where they have tax abatement and tax basement burns off. So, it\u2019s a big part of our asset management strategy and we pay a lot of attention to it.","Mark Denien","And we do, Rich, have an in-house real estate tax consulting team that works with our tenants. They try to bring that down as best we can. So we do, we can't.","Rich Anderson","And what\u2019s the growth rate in property taxes, if I could just tag on assumed in your guidance?","James Connor","Well, effectively at zero because like you said, it is all the pass-through. So at this occupancy level, it really doesn\u2019t affect our bottom line for the short-term. It\u2019s just the flexibility to grow overall rents over the long-term.","Operator","And we do have a question for the line Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","I just wanted -- I was hoping to get more color on the markets and where you think you can grow the development pipeline given you raise the guidance. So kind of which markets and what gives you more confidence to raise that number here?","James Connor","Well, I would give you a couple of answers, Jamie. First of all from a spec development perspective, the state of our portfolio in terms of occupancy and near-term role, we could build stacking in literally every one of our markets that we\u2019re not going to, but we\u2019ve got operating business guys that are chopping at the build to build more spec. So, it\u2019s a blend of how much leasing we get done in the existing spec development and the existing portfolio and how much build-to-suit.","Right now, we\u2019ve got a very healthy build-to-suit pipeline that kind of refers back to the original conversation about tariffs. We spent a lot of time talking to our clients about their needs coming up here for the next 18 months and everything remains very positive. So, the ultimate about of development we do is really a function of how much fact leasing we do and how many build-to-suit we do. Because we can always do more spec development, but we\u2019re just trying to manage our risk.","Mark Denien","Jamie, perfect indication as just where we built in the second quarter because if you look at our year-to-date starts, we're already and what was the previous low-end of our guidance. So, we really didn\u2019t raise guidance that much and respect to future development for the year. We\u2019re already at the low-end of the guidance. So with the strong second quarter we had that\u2019s a good indication of where the markets too strong.","Jamie Feldman","And then as we\u2019ve seen, as the trade stocks have been more vocal. And you guys were always a little differentiated, having more of a Southeast focus, Midwest focus, less around the major port markets. The Bridge portfolio obviously grew you into some of those markets. Do you I mean do you think going forward you'll try to get back to your kind of formal market concentration? Are you still feel very good about the recent plan -- the more recent plan that kind of grow in some of these more global trade markets?","James Connor","No, Jamie, you're going to see us remain consistent to what we've talked about in terms of our strategic plan. We need to grow in more of the Tier 1 and more of Tier 1 high barrier market. So, you'll continue to see us focused on that. But I don't think those markets bear any more risk than any the other logistics markets around the country because you're talking about logistics and supply chain. So, warehouses are full all over the U.S. right now and as long as we continue with the economy unreasonably stable footing and growing we should be in pretty good shape.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jeremy Metz. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Jim, you might have just touched on this a little bit. But going back to the trade topic, you've talked about not seeing any business plan changes from your tenants. But as you think about the development and the lead time to build and to lease and taking on some of this spec, obviously, you don't want to be called holding a bunch of vacancy, if your tenants do change your plans and unless they do change them suddenly. So, as we look at in next year, could we see proactively maybe hit the pause button a bit and see others plays out or at least maybe pause some of the developments in those markets most potentially impacting for many strange trade dispute?","James Connor","Well I think, Jeremy, the governors that we put in place would come into there. So if demand started to diminish in the second half of this year the beginning of next year or build-to-suit started diminish or both, you would automatically see us pullback dramatically on stack, because again, we're not going to go below that 50% pipeline. And as we're looking at the lease up times on all of our speculative projects across the system, and monitoring what that's doing, that factors into all of those spec decisions. So I think as long as we stay committed to the operational goals that we've stated to you guys and our shareholders that will happen. So, if you see spec space start to slowdown, if you see build-to-suit start to fall off, you'll see our development numbers come down appropriately.","Jeremy Metz","And then second for me, you mentioned demand, we obviously continue to hear plenty of our last mile demand and the significant upward pressure on ranks to those assets. I was wondering, if maybe you could bifurcate your market between coastal infill and poor markets and then central? And what difference you're seeing today in terms of your ability to push ranks, demand, timing to lease space, et cetera?","James Connor","Yes, I think my answer would be pretty consistent with what we've seen for the last few quarters, which is the high barrier markets continue to perform at the top-end of the rent growth range which is upwards of 10%. And the second tier markets are probably in the mid-single digits 4% to 6% given that. So we saw last quarter you're overall at 6%. So that probably averages out. I think you're seeing that very consistently. There is such demand for that infield space in these urban areas and these high barrier markets that we're continuing to be able to push rent pretty dramatically.","And I think the biggest fundamental thing that we've learned and we've talked about it in some of our previous calls is. The last mile is necessarily small as everybody thinks it is. Amazon and UPS and FedEx are not doing 20,000 foot releases. They\u2019re outdoing 200,000 foot releases and 400,000 foot leases. And that\u2019s really what drives the last mile. It\u2019s the package delivery guys and the e-commerce guys. It\u2019s not local guys doing 20,000 foot leases. And we\u2019ve talked about some of those deals that we\u2019ve done infill deals for UPS of 400,000 feet and on the surface, people wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of that as last mile, but that\u2019s exactly what it is.","Operator","And we do have a question for the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Just given the success of your sales of the Columbus portfolio, what are your thoughts of more actively recycling some of the assets that you want to or in markets where you want to reduce your exposure?","James Connor","Well, let me start and then I\u2019ll get let Nick give you a little bit of commentary. I think what we\u2019re seeing in the market with our increased guidance on disposition and development and our reduce guidance on acquisitions is pretty indicative of our outlook. I think you are going to see us accelerates and dispositions because we\u2019ve got more than ample opportunities on the development side to put that money to work, and I give Nick and give you a little bit more.","Nick Anthony","Yes. And I think the reality is that we\u2019re always looking at improving our high quality portfolio through strategic dispositions. But the reality is the acquisition opportunities out there at regional prices are still pretty slim. So, we got to be very cautious about doing that. We don\u2019t want to accelerate and dispositions and not be able to redeploy the proceeds.","Eric Frankel","And just a quick follow-up question. I just noticed with the start, I think this is referenced earlier. I know the new starts that your developing margins are a little bit thinner and even look like some of the build-to-suits are coming at a pretty high cost per square foot. So, can you just comment on the build-to-suit business and whether you\u2019re amortizing a lot of improvements since your costs basis and whether you\u2019re properly compensated for that?","James Connor","No, that\u2019s not a problem, Eric. Yes, we\u2019ve all continue to see costs increase across the country. We talked about in previous calls and meetings we talked about the cost of land. The cost of entitling land, we talked a little bit earlier about construction costs. So yes, we\u2019ve continued to see prices go up.","One of the reasons you probably have seen some erosion on those margins are or yield is we\u2019re not compromising our underwriting by amortizing a bunch of e-commerce, material handling equipment or everything else into our building. We\u2019ve been very consistent in terms of what goes in to the base of our buildings. So, we\u2019re very comfortable with the cost of those buildings because what these guys put in, they got to take out at the end of the lease, whether it\u2019s mezzanines, material handling, robotics, all of that stuff comes out and we\u2019ve got a good quality box.","The other thing that\u2019s driving some of these costs increases, particularly on the larger buildings is the amount of parking, trailer storage, truck docks and clear heights that are going into these buildings. So today a million square foot building is 40 foot clear. A few years ago that would have been 32 or 36 foot clear. It\u2019s not uncommon to have 500 trailer spots that\u2019s two or three extra acres of land going in. So that\u2019s some of what you\u2019re seeing contributing and this in addition to land cost and construction costs.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Jim or Nick, can you provide some color on the recent acquisition in Miami? I mean these deals are completed at low yield. Is that because you saw additional benefits from increasing scale in that market?","Nick Anthony","Yes, that's a higher barrier market we're very focused on. The in place escalator on the existing leases are 2.5% to 3%. And we think long term rents are going to grow there at much higher pace and obviously Columbus Ohio.","Michael Carroll","Okay. And then since you've lowered your acquisition guidance, should we assume Duke is less focus on the acquisition market going forward? Are you not seeing as many attractive deals available?","Nick Anthony","We are very focused. We probably underwritten close to $2 billion worth of deals this year, but I think we're not seeing as many opportunities. And we're seeing a lot more opportunities on the development side to offset that.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","And my question is on development. So you guys have about $1 billion development pipeline of which, 55% fleet which is pretty amazing. But if you look at profit margin at the midpoint it's about 17%, you're earning about 40 basis points spread. Some of your peers because they're growing more spec, we seen might be much higher rate to fit the 300 basis points spread. So my question is, when you start thinking about development philosophically about your pipeline. How you think about allocating capital to build to suite at which seems like to be a very low spread versus spec? And one of the factors I was thinking about and as a fact that maybe have a deep personnel bench development team. Does that make you ultimately run faster on the treadmill because you had to put people at work? Is that part of that decision making process?","James Connor","Let me take the last question first. We're not interested in keeping people busy. Our people are plenty busy. And in terms of the spreads of the yields on the build-to-suite, everyone obviously everyone that we do we've approved, we don\u2019t approved a lot of those deals, because it's competitive marketplace out there. And we may have underwritten something a little bit more considerably than some of our peers. So in spite of our pretty strong track record, we don't win them all or we don't choose to necessarily pursue them all.","But as we've talked in the past, there is competitive pressures out there and there are some deals getting done at some various in margins. In terms of the amount of spec, Ki Bin, we thought long and hard about that over the years and we debated internally from time-to-time. And we remain consistent to what we said when we started this cycle, which was this cycle isn't going to last forever.","And we're going to keep that development pipeline above 50%. You're right, we could probably tell you that we were going to get better theoretical margins, but high risk high reward. Not all spec projects deliver what they're underwritten to. And at this point in the cycle, I don't think it's a prudent to be turning up on the aggressive scale and doing more and more spec development. Particularly when we've got ample build-to-suite opportunities we've got great leasing spec leasing volume going on to be able keep it there.","Ki Bin Kim","And just one accounting question maybe for mark. With a new lease accounting change, I think you guys had already put a lot of thought into it. Last week, you capitalized about $19 million for internal leasing costs. I know this accounting change is not -- it\u2019s not just a pure good thing, there is something that will have unintended detriment to companies like you who have skill, but maybe you can provide some comments on how much you think will impact your report FFO next year and maybe any other comments behind it?","Mark Denien","Sure, Ki Bin. Yes, you\u2019re right. I mean it\u2019s sort of complicated and I think this was an unintended consequences the accounting literature. It wasn\u2019t really directed at us. It was directed more on the lesser side. Nonetheless, we\u2019re doing with it. We have a leasing team in-house fully staff. We do all of our leasing in-house, obviously, we pay out several brokers on the tenant side, but we do all of our own representation on our side. And we pay our people on a combination of salary, bonus and commission.","And under the new accounting only the commission will be able to be capitalized under the current accounting it's a portion or if you\u2019re effective on the leasing you do, it\u2019s a lot of the salary and bonus as well. Not to mention dedicated attorneys for example. We have an in-house leasing legal team and under the current accounting, we can capitalize the cost for that. Under the new accounting you can.","Some of our peers and whether it\u2019d be in our sector other sectors outsourced a lot of those functions. So, they\u2019re writing checks to law firms and they\u2019re writing checks to brokerage houses. We\u2019ve done our own analysis from the amount of those checks that they\u2019re writing versus the payroll costs in our house or we believe we\u2019re doing a cheaper at a minimum. We\u2019re doing it for equal. We\u2019re doing it more for ourselves.","So we think our business model is the right business model on the accounting to us is secondary. Having said all that you\u2019re right it\u2019s probably a $0.04 to $0.05 difference in recorded FFO from the old accounting to the new and it will be -- what will be expensing that extra $0.04 or $0.05? Our plan right now is to adjust our core FFO so that we\u2019re apples-to-apples with our own reporting from year -- from current year to next year.","But also apples-to-apples with peers whether it\u2019d be in our no sector or other sectors that are outsourcing that and paying same dollars, but capitalizing and running expense again. So we will, and we do plan on adjusting for that. So the way we look at it, we like our business model, the way it is, we think it adds value and we\u2019re going to keep doing what we do.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Tom Catherwood. Please go ahead.","Tom Catherwood","Jim, question for you. I want to circle back to the question on oversupply and look at it slightly different angle. Are there any markets where labor availability could limit tenant demand? And how could that impact your capital allocation decisions?","James Connor","Yes. Tom, that\u2019s a great question. For the first time since I\u2019ve been in this crazy business. We as a developer have started doing labor analytic studies. Anytime, we go to buy a big site or anytime we go to build a building because we want to have the answer to the question before we\u2019ve got the investment made. So it does drive a lot of our investment capital allocation decisions today.","If you spend any time out in business parks, you\u2019ve always seen help wanted. Now hiring signs, you\u2019ll see them more than ever and that does affect decisions that the tenants are making, when they\u2019re out in the marketplace, whether they\u2019re doing spec leasing or they\u2019re doing build-to-suit. They\u2019re very, very concerned about labor.","So, we have that ammunition upfront so that we\u2019re comfortable when we\u2019ve made an investment in a site for development in South Florida or the Lehigh Valley or we go to build a building we know the answer to the question in terms of our clients ability to get labor in there what it's going to cost what the ability is.","Tom Catherwood","Mark, question for you. Can you remind me other than maturities how they kind of roll in for the loans outstanding from the MOB portfolio sale? And when those are paid back, do you have to do 1031 exchanges to avoid tax impacts?","Mark Denien","Yes, Tom, it's right around $115 million a year. And it's called a give or take June of each year. So, it will come in June of '19, June of 2020, and there is a little payment and early '21. And no, we do not need to do 1031. We basically just deferred the game on those into the years that the cash comes in and that will be taxable income and the year comes in, but we planned that where we had a cushion and it wouldn't cause any issues.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thanks just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I noticed a lot of your start this quarter were in Atlanta and that seems to be a market that's always targeted as one with a lot of developers and suppliers. And maybe just you can comment on prospects there? And second, I think there was that news article this morning from Cranes that highlighted that Bridge development with developer whom you bought here large portfolio last year. They're under contracted to buy a large site in Brooklyn. Maybe it sounds like you're going to picking a pretty massive development in terms of dollar value. So maybe wanted your thoughts on developing the burrows in the future?","James Conor","Yes, sure, Eric. In terms of Atlanta, a little bit of it is timing, but we do develop in Atlanta in a number of different submarkets and some of those are larger bulk buildings on a couple of those are what I would called mid-sized multi-tenant building. So when we look at that, when we made those decisions particularly on the last couple, we wanted to make sure we were comfortable with our risk and our exposure land and portfolio it is really good shape right now. So we're comfortable with those decisions. In terms of Bridge, we knew they were going to take the money, we gave them go out spend it somewhere. So I haven't heard that they were under contract in Brooklyn, but good for them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Michael Mueller. Please go ahead.",".","Michael Mueller","Just the quick one market exposure. Looking at Page 11 in the sup and the occupancies and for the stabilizing service, the one market that seems to just jump out at DC Baltimore which around 90% and everything else is closer to 100. Just curious, if you can give us little color on that market?","James Conor","Yes, we've got one spec building there that came in service earlier this year, Mike. And I think we've got, I think we're about to commit as substantial piece of that. And our holdings there are not that significant compared to some of our others. So on a percentage occupancy basis, it looks a little low, but I think it's really a couple of 100,000 square feet. So it's not really high on our radar, and I think we've got decent activity. And I would say we'll have some substantial leasing done next quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it does appear at this time, there are no further questions from the phone lines. Please continue","James Connor","Thanks Brad. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening in our third quarter call scheduled for October 25th.

Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, Ronda. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, President & CEO and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2015 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Ron good afternoon everyone. I'll start out with an update on the overall business environment and our second quarter results. Naturally, the industrial markets\u2019 momentum continues to be very strong. Demand outpaced supply for the 25th straight quarter, new supply in substantially all markets is balance and demand for modern bulk space year-to-date continues to beat expectations. Net absorption for the second quarter was 64 million square feet and year-to-date absorption is 124 million square feet. New supply in the second quarter totaled 35 million square feet, resulting in another 10 basis point drop in vacancy nationwide to approximately 5.2%. Our outlook is for these fundamentals to continue to be favorable for the remainder of 2016.","We're seeing similar strength in our own portfolio with the completion of 6.9 million square feet of leasing for the quarter this drove our in-service occupancy up to 96.7%, 100 basis point increase from the first quarter and the highest in the Company\u2019s history. Rents on renewal leases for the quarter, grew by 18.6% also the highest on record for the overall portfolio, reflecting continued strong supply demand fundamentals and our solid pricing power.","Of particular note was our continued success in leasing recently completed speculative projects and a leasing of second generation space with new tenants within our portfolio. One notable new lease was signed with Amazon for 1.1 million square feet, in our speculative project in Pennsylvania that was delivered in the first quarter of the year. Also we signed two new leases in the Indianapolis with R.R. Donnelley and Stryker, totaling over 1.3 million square feet.","On the lease renewal side, we executed two leases with the container store in Dallas in our Freeport Park near DWF Airport, comprised with a 956,000 square foot lease renewal of existing space and 146,000 square feet of expansion space. In addition we executed two significant renewal leases with Hewlett Packard in Indianapolis and Genco Distribution in Columbus, each over 400,000 square feet.","I will also note that while our renewal percentage for the quarter was 63%, it was impacted by 4 large expirations that were immediately back filled with new leases at much better rates. The largest drivers of leasing in our portfolio continue to be e-commerce, retail and consumer products distribution, both directly with our corporate clients and indirectly with 3PL clients as well as positive drivers from the food and beverage industry. In addition we\u2019re seeing most of these customers continuing to allocate additional capital to their supply chain and inventory optimization. Our medical office portfolio continues to have good momentum with in-service occupancy increasing 20 basis points to 95.8% another all time record. And we continue to have a strong development pipeline for future development to go along with our existing pipeline.","Turning to overall development for the quarter, we started $108 million of industrial projects, given our strong leasing performance we\u2019re allocating more capital to speculative projects in our strategy to grow in Tier 1 markets. Three of these four developments starts are speculative and located in Southern California and Pennsylvania markets, all the while maintaining our pre-lease percentage and our overall development pipeline of over 70%. Our overall development pipeline at the end of the quarter had 18 projects under construction, totaling 6 million square feet and a projected $504 million in stabilized cost at our share that was 72% preleased. We expect these projects to create 20% margins and generate about a 6.6% initial stabilized cash yield. Our development outlook is very solid with a pipeline of prospects, many of which are build-to-suits that will continue strong value creation for the balance of the year.","Our land inventory now sits at 344 million, as a result of monetizing about $40 million of land during in the quarter through sales and development. This is our lowest inventory level since 2003 and below our 2004 stated goal to maintain the land bank between $350 million and $400 million. With respect to capital recycling activity, we closed $173 million of building dispositions during the quarter in six transactions. This includes 55 million related to the Gramercy Property Trust joint venture dissolution that Mark will extend on in a moment.","Similar to what we stated in the last call, the majority of our expected dispositions for the full year are scheduled to close in the third and fourth quarters and are proceeding as planned. But we also mentioned that we are under contract to sell our 936,000 square foot vacant speculative industrial building in the Indianapolis. This is a user sale and along with a significant leasing we completed during the quarter, raises our Indianapolis in-service occupancy to 99.8%.","I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Mark to discuss the financial results and the capital transactions.","Mark Denien","Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon everyone. Core FFO per share was $0.30 for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $0.28 per share for both the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015. This $0.02 increase is reflective of our continued improvements in our overall operating performance. NAREIT defined FFO was $0.35 per share, the largest reconciling item between Core FFO and NAREIT defined FFO was $24 million for both income recognized related to the dissolution of Gramercy joint venture that I will expand on in a minute. The promote income is excluded in FFO as defined by NAREIT but not Core FFO.","We generated $0.27 per share in AFFO for the second quarter of 2016, which equates to an AFFO payout ratio of 67% compared to $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Same property NOI growth for the 12 and three months ended June 30, 2016 was 4.5% and 3.5% respectively. Let me point out that the second quarter\u2019s three month figure is negatively impacted by a few individually small non-recurring expense items. These items will have virtually no impact on our full year results as we look out to the remainder of the year. While occupancy growth should slow a little bit in the latter half of the year, we still expect strong rent growth which led to our increase in same-property NOI growth guidance of 1.375% at the mid-point.","As I mentioned earlier we dissolved our joint venture of Gramercy Property Trust in which we had a 20% interest. This dissolution transaction consisted of seven of the joint ventures buildings being distributed to Gramercy, one industrial property being distributed to us, and the final property being sold to a third-party late last week. Two of the properties distributed to Gramercy were suburban office buildings. Our $173 million of property dispositions for the quarter includes $55 million for our 20% ownership interest in the seven joint venture buildings that were distributed to Gramercy and our $67 million of acquisitions for the quarter includes $51 million for Gramercy to 80% interest in the industrial property that was distributed to us. Also as I mentioned earlier the dissolution of this JV resulted in a $24 million promote fee being recognized in the second quarter.","From a capital raising perspective, I\u2019d like to note that during the second quarter we received full repayment of the $200 million seller financing, that we had extended as part of the $1.1 billion office disposition that we executed in April 2015. We executed some significant debt transactions during the quarter as well. We used the proceeds that have been received from the seller financing I just mentioned and property shelves to payoff secured loans totaling $330 million to bore interest at an average effective rate of 5.8%. In June, we issued $375 million of 10 year 3.25% unsecured notes, which represent the lowest rate on a 10 year issuance in company history. In connection with this issuance, we initiated a tender offer that resulted in the repurchases $72 million of our 5.95% unsecured notes that were due in February of 2017. And we repaid the remaining $203 million of these notes earlier this week. These transactions significantly lower our overall borrowing costs.","In the equity capital markets, we issued 4.6 million shares under our ATM program through July 08, 2016 for net proceeds of $111 million at an average issue price of $24.19 per share. With our growing list of development prospects and due to the fact that our shares did not traded at full interest of our net asset value in quite a while. We thought it was prudent to take some risk off the table and pre-fund some of this highly accretive development. We have only $14 million left in our current ATM filing plan to re-up the program to be prepared for future strategic and freedom opportunities.","We concluded the quarter with $141 million of cash and lower outstanding borrowings on our line of credit. These capital sources along with the third quarter property sales are more than sufficient for the repayment we just made of the remaining February 2017 notes and the funding of our development pipeline for this foreseeable future. I would also point out that we have only $69 million of debt maturities until our next bond maturity in early 2018.","All of these capital transactions coupled with our operational performance resulted in a significant improvement to our key financial metrics and we expect to see further improvements for the remainder of the year, resulting from the transactions and new income producing properties being in placed in-service. This is reflected in our revised guidance.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim.","Jim Connor","Thanks Mark. In reflection of our strong performance for the first half of the year, and positive outlook for the second half of 2016, we increased our AFFO per share guidance by $0.01 at the mid-point. Given the strong outlook on our development pipeline, we also raised our development guidance to $500 million to $650 million up $75 million from the original mid-point. Also due to continued strong overall operating fundamentals, we raised our same-property NOI growth guidance to 4.25% to 5.5%, up 1.375% from the previous mid-point.","Finally, given our capital recycling activities and our recent debt pay downs as Mark touched on, we\u2019ve changed the guidance for all three of our leveraged metrics in a positive direction. Details are provided in the supplemental package in the last night\u2019s press release. We believe these improved leverage metrics put us firmly in a position for a ratings upgrade in the near future. Revisions to certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section on our Web site.","In closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our team\u2019s execution through the mid-year and our leasing performance, capital redeployment and balance sheet management. We are very optimistic about a strong performance for the remainder of the year. We\u2019ll now open up the lines for the audience. And we ask participants to keep the dialog to one question or perhaps two very short questions and you of course are welcomed to get back in the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck","Great, thanks. Mark, as you mentioned, you guys were active on the ATM during the quarter with $111 million of issuance on what seemed to be pretty good pricing. But your stock is up almost $4 a share from the average price of this quarter's issuance. So can you just talk about your appetite for further ATM issuance when you re-up the program?","Mark Denien","Yes Blaine well if you look at the guidance that we changed for development and acquisitions, if you combine those we raised our total investment outlay by about $175 million. So we kind of looked at that incremental $175 million of investments and where our stock was trading at it was a good way to prefund that. So, we're really taking care of both from a balance sheet perspective and really everything we have baked in our guidance through the rest of the year. I mean certainly we like our stock price better where it is today and we did the deal. So I think we would look at any additional equity going forward as it would have to be to fund incremental investment opportunities above and beyond what's already in our guidance.","Blaine Heck","Okay and that's helpful. And then just a follow-up: the increase in same-store NOI guidance is pretty substantial, over 1% higher at the midpoint. So can you give us some color on what you're seeing at this point? It's much better than what you had expected in the beginning of the year, whether it's on the rent side, occupancy side, or even expense savings. And was it driven by better execution in the first half of the year or kind of better expectations for the second half?","Mark Denien","Quite honestly Blaine it's a little bit of everything you just mentioned, I mean our occupancy is better than what we had expected and that is reflective in the increase in our guidance. Some of that occupancy hasn't made its way in the rent yet and most of our actions stay on lease sign basis. So as those leases come online we do expect rental increases, some of the leasing we did early in the year or even late last year may have had just some minimal free ground or reduced rent in there that's burning off so you we have, rental rate increases, you've got occupancy increases and then rental rate growth is better than what we expected at the beginning here as well. We reported almost 19% increase in rents this year on a GAAP basis and as we look forward about 25% of all of our leases rolling in the next 18 months were signed in that trough period. So, we do believe we can continue to grow those in the 20% range and you couple those with some newer deals and we still think rent growth is going to look very similar going forward. So, I think it's just a little bit of everything that you mentioned that is driving that.","Blaine Heck","Okay. Sounds great, thanks guys.","Operator","Brad Burke. Please go ahead.","Brad Burke","Hi good afternoon guys. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on the suburban asset sales that you have planned for the balance of the year: one, whether the pricing and the interest that you're seeing in the market now is in line with what you had expected when you had initially given the guidance for the full year? And then, two, the guidance that you have for the remainder of the year -- the implied proceeds, is that entirely suburban ops at this point or would we expect there to be some industrial sales included in that total as well?","Mark Denien","Well, Brad I would say that everything is on track, a couple of kind of general comments. I think that buyer pools in general, while they are still deep enough for us to get deals done are a little shallower than they had historically been, but we\u2019re making progress and we\u2019re kind of on track with everything we have got planned for the remaining office dispositions for the rest of the year, so we didn\u2019t feel it was warranted to change any of our guidance there. It\u2019s not a 100% office as we talk about we sold some buildings in Phoenix this year we sold a couple of buildings in California. And I think through our year-end numbers were projecting about 70%-75% of it could be office and about 25% to 30% of it could be industrial and a couple of one off we do -- we sold the last of our retail things and a few other clean up items. So I would say 70%-75% of it is office.","Brad Burke","And just related to that, on my math it's almost $500 million of guidance at the midpoint for the back two quarters of the year for dispositions. So 75% of that -- is it right to think that $350 million to $400 million would be suburban office proceeds? And would that represent the bulk of your suburban office portfolio?","Jim Connor","My CFO is sitting next to me shaking his head, so he confirms your math.","Brad Burke","He is shaking, yes, okay good.","Jim Connor","Up and down.","Brad Burke","Good. All right. That's it for me, thank you.","Operator","John Guinee. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","You guys are really rocking and rolling, how the hell did you ever get down to $300 million of land?","Jim Connor","Well thank you John, I will take that as a compliment. As we have talked about this at the last meeting, we have really changed the culture of Duke Reality. Many of you who have followed us over the years, we used to love to buy 500 acre farms and turn them into business parks and it\u2019s really tough to economically carry land for extended periods for time like that, so we have a much shorter time horizon on vacant land that we want to carry, we prefer to take it down and bite those pieces and put it into production as quickly as possible. So as tough as has been for us to get here, it\u2019s really been a welcome change, because the guys that need land can buy land and can put it into production right away. So I appreciate the compliment, it has been a long road getting here from the roughly $980 million we had back in 2008, but we think, we\u2019re in a sweet spot and we think we could stay here for the foreseeable future.","John Guinee","All right okay, now.","Jim Connor","Now the real question?","John Guinee","Yes, one more question. Looking at page 28, looks like you have got a big build-to-suit in Southern California and then a couple 600,000 square feet of spec product. And that's almost half of your stabilized costs of bulk distribution, but you've got -- your yields on these, on the whole page at about 6.3% on a cash basis, what do you -- can you talk a little bit more about where in Southern California these deals are located, and what sort of yield on costs you're expecting in So Cal?","Jim Connor","Yes sure John, the -- most of our development in Southern California right now is in the Inland Empire that large build-to-suit that you referred to is out there and several of the other buildings, although we\u2019re doing one into a redevelopment project, closer in, in Orange County, while those cash yields are down from what you have had historically seen from Duke Realty's portfolio in our either more mature or our mid-western markets. They are still -- it is a great spread over what the exit cap would be as you know pricing in Southern California has reached just virtually record levels, every deal we are seeing today is trading now in the 4s, and some of the exception of properties that are trading in the high 3s from a rate perspective. So even in a 63 we are still creating a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders there, if we would look to monetize that which we are not, we want to hold and grow that portfolio out there.","John Guinee","Are any of these the Chevron site? Did you win that site? I think it was Chevron. I know it was an oil\u2026","Jim Connor","[Multiple Speakers] none of those has a Chevron site, we do have that under contract and if everything holds that\u2019s probably a very late fourth quarter or first quarter start next year.","John Guinee","Okay, keep up the good work. Thanks.","Operator","Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Maybe if we just think back to combining your, the desire to do equity or the ATM with the -- through the portfolios that are out on the market, especially when your stock's trading at a premium to NAV, do you look at those portfolios now in a different way than you would have before the recent run in your stock price? Maybe how do you balance between the ATM and the larger equity offering?","Jim Connor","Well, I think we'll both chime in on this. We look at every major portfolio that\u2019s out there, and most of the smaller ones and one off deals, it is nothing else just to be apprised of what's going in the market, what investor activity is and what pricing expectations are. So we are abreast of everything that\u2019s going on and we have yet to see an opportunity that we think is available at a price that we could demonstrate value creation. And really fits in our targeted growth portfolio. And for us that\u2019s the West Coast and predominantly the North-East, maybe South Florida. We have got really dominant portfolios in most of the other cities, so if we were on a stretch today, we would be in probably one of those three geographic areas. And we have them tune the right opportunity. So Mark I will let you add a little additional color.","Mark Denien","Yes, I think as Jim said right on, I think you still first Manny look at the quality of the property and where the property is located and is it a property we want to own, regardless of what our capital cost is. Just because we are trading at a nicer stock price today than we were six months ago, doesn\u2019t make us want to go out and over pay for properties. So I think the quality of the property and where it is still number one and if we are trading at a nice size premium it may help us justify stretching a little bit it still got to be property that we want.","Manny Korchman","So if we combine all of those thoughts together, what's the likelihood that you actually act on picking up a larger portfolio in the next, call it, six to 12 months? Are you seeing anything you like, especially now that you can pay for it? I'll ask it differently.","Mark Denien","No, I don\u2019t think we see anything out there right now that we like well enough to do that. And as far as large portfolios, I am not saying that there won't be a one off transaction here or there but no large portfolios out there right now that we see.","Manny Korchman","That was it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers","Jim, I think in your commentary you talked about having a pretty big backlog of build-to-suit activity, but obviously the start to the quarter were all spec. So I don't know -- maybe a little color on kind of was it just a timing issue in terms of what you started and what you plan to start the rest of the year? And I guess maybe a second part of that question is, I guess, looking maybe into 2017 without giving specific guidance, does that give us a good confidence that that pipeline could be equal to or larger going into 2017 than it is today?","Jim Connor","Yes. Sure Dave. It\u2019s always about timing and try as I may, I can\u2019t always get my clients to sign leases by quarter end. They just don\u2019t feel the same sense of urgency that Mark and I do. But yes, we took a very close look and we assumed several of you would ask this very same question. Because, if you look at where we are midpoint, and we\u2019d tell you, we were pretty much in line with what we had originally projected. But we do have a very-very strong pipeline for the second half of the year, it\u2019s very consistent with the business that we\u2019ve been doing. A lot of our existing clients in the areas of ecommerce and consumer products some directly with them, some with 3PL providers. And we\u2019ve got a good mix all across the country, so given that we felt very comfortable raising the guidance on the development side. So I think you can look well forward to bigger numbers in the third quarter.","I will tell you looking out beyond kind of the six month horizon. We\u2019re still very optimistic, our clients are not showing any skittishness, any pullback. Everything that\u2019s on track to get signed, I would say in the foreseeable future, the next three or four months is going full speed ahead. And our clients are probably more engaged with us today about their future needs whether it\u2019s in the form of build suits or taking speculative space, because the markets have gotten so tight. So you are a 800,000 foot user or a million square foot user in a major market. You don\u2019t have nearly the number of options. So we\u2019ve gotten engaged with much more of our clients, they\u2019ve been much more forthcoming with what their needs and expectations are over the next 24 months. And that has left us fairly optimistic as well.","Dave Rodgers","Great, thanks.","Operator","Michael Carroll. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Thanks. Kind of off of Dave's question, Jim, you seem much more comfortable starting speculative projects today compared to six months ago. Is this a function of leasing up the existing pipeline? Or are you seeing something, this activity in the market, that makes you more encouraged?","Jim Connor","Well, I think it\u2019s a couple of those things. If we all reflect back on where we were about seven months ago going into 2016, we were all talking about markets reaching equilibrium sometime in 2017. We were anticipating that absorption was probably going to be in that closer to 180 million to 200 million square feet. And I think all of us are peers and you guys anybody that follows the sector has been very pleasantly surprised. We\u2019re on track to be at or above absorption, the average for the last couple of years if you just look at where we are for the first couple of quarters. And then you impair with that how successful we\u2019ve been leasing virtually all of these major spec projects that we have put. We\u2019ve leased a bunch of them right before they\u2019ve even come in-service, we\u2019ve leased another few right as they have come in-service, the one that we have under contract to sell through user here in Indianapolis that was probably in-service for about six or seven months. It was probably the longest one we had on the shelf. So I think given the confidence in our operating teams, our record high occupancy. And the state of the overall demand in the marketplace, we feel more comfortable accelerating a number of those spec projects.","Mark Denien","Yes. And I would just reiterate what Jim said earlier too that this quarter being almost entirely spec, it was just more timing than anything. We\u2019ve got some pretty good datapoints looking forward of build-to-suits in the pipeline prospect so I think just going forward it will be still in that above 50% to 60% prelease range in total, so.","Michael Carroll","Great, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Could you just comment on what you think lease spread could be going forward? You obviously put about 18% this quarter. If you look at the mix of what's coming due and the strength in just overall industrial market rents, do you think that is a sustainable number, or could it actually get better?","Jim Connor","Yes, I will try that Ki Bin. I think it's for the next six to nine months I think it\u2019s pretty sustainable, I think I mentioned earlier about a fourth of our leases rolling into next 18 months for what we still consider to be those trough leases and we're going to push rents really-really hard there and they will be in the, several of those would be in the 25%-30% range. But I think overall we reported 19% this quarter I think we were more or like 14-15 the previous quarter I still think you will see us in that mid to upper-teens on average for the next three to six months.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And\u2026","Mark Denien","Yes. And Ki Bin I would add to that. If you just if we all step back and we look at the macro numbers today most of the brokerage and research firms are attracting somewhere 165 million and may be 180 million square feet of supply, that's projected to come in-service over the course of the next year and we're on track to have another year of 240 million to 250 million plus square feet of absorption. So I think in the short-term if there is a higher probability that that overall vacancy goes down, before it goes up again, and I think if you see that macro trend you're going to see us continuing to have the leverage to continue to push rent.","Ki Bin Kim","And just tied to that, typically I think your expiration profile is about 10% per year. How much do you really pull forward -- so from a practical standpoint, even though you show 10%, is it really like 12%, 15%? Just curious how that looks like.","Jim Connor","Yes Ki Bin we don't like to get right up to the day the lease rolls. So, when that lease renews it's typically going to be two to six months before it comes up so you could be looking at pulling forward call it may be six months of the next year's leases so that takes you from 10% to closer to 15%.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And this is just a question based on your same-store revenue off those two things. But if you are rolling over, like, around 15%, and -- let's give it the benefit of the doubt that you can do 18% market rent growth, how do you get above 2.5%, 2.7% same-store revenue growth or 3% revenue growth on a go-forward basis, even though industrial fundamentals are really strong? What are we missing in that equation?","Jim Connor","Okay. I am not sure I followed that one Ki Bin. So, are you quoting a number that we reported, are you looking to\u2026","Ki Bin Kim","No, no. I'm just saying, in theory, if you are rolling over 15% of your portfolio and market rents are up, on a GAAP basis, 18%, how do we get above 3% same-store revenue growth?","Jim Connor","Same-store NOI growth?","Ki Bin Kim","Well assuming occupancies are flat, right?","Jim Connor","Well I don't think we're assuming occupancy to be flat, we're assuming we're still going to drive occupancy. Occupancy growth will slow but we're not assuming flat occupancy. So we believe that we will still grow occupancy in that pool for properties for the next six months. You couple that with the rent bumps, which we have about 2.25% rent bump. You then add the call it 15% that you talked about rolling, that we can push rents up close to 20% and then the final factor is burn off of free or reduced rent and all that together is what gets you up to that number.","Operator","Sumit Sharma. Please go ahead.","Sumit Sharma","Hi. A question on capitalized interest, so you've increased the guidance for development starts, and that should result in higher capitalized interest, at least maybe in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering what level of capitalized interest savings or what level of overall interest savings are you contemplating from this versus, say, 2015?","Jim Connor","Really about the same run rate that we\u2019ve had the first half of the year, even though we\u2019re quoting a start number, we capitalize our interest based on the actual spend, so a lot of the starts that we\u2019re quoting, the development spend won\u2019t happen until late this year, or early next year. So we\u2019re really looking at continuing at about the run rate that we have for the first half of the year. And then to couple that I would say also, with the fact that our overall average borrowing costs are going down, so that actually lowers the amount of interest we capitalize a little bit as well.","Operator","Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Mark, can you help me out with -- do you have on hand the re-leasing starts for renewal leases if you factor in those new deals that were signed as soon as the spaces went vacant?","Jim Connor","Yes, I would tell you that Eric we have always -- are you just talking about the new second generation leases that backfilled, what that would have been?","Eric Frankel","Right, yes, yes, just because you threw in the renewal percentages [Multiple Speakers].","Jim Connor","If you just isolated those deals, it would have improved it quite a bit.","Eric Frankel","Okay.","Jim Connor","In total I would tell you that the total new second generation leasing this quarter, because it was easy, it was like an apples to apple comparison of the old tenants out with the new tenants, in the past we have never quoted that number because sometimes it all take the same space and all that. This quarter it happened to be pretty easy. I would tell you, if we would have quoted that number it would have actually been a little bit better than our renewal.","Eric Frankel","Okay.","Jim Connor","Not a lot but a little bit.","Eric Frankel","That's helpful to know. And just another question; I'll jump in the queue if there's other people, but I'm trying to understand the same-store NOI growth calculation and how development -- contributions from development influence that, just because, as you said, there's a lot of leases that are coming -- there's a lot of properties coming to the portfolio with leases that are just signed. And I'm trying to understand just how that's -- how it's influencing the same-store NOI growth statistic and whether NOI is actually understated this quarter as a result of all of that lease-up that occurred?","Jim Connor","Yes and I may have misled you there Eric, it\u2019s not just development it\u2019s leasing in general and an example of that will be those four big backfill deals, they are in our occupancy numbers as the leases are signed, but we\u2019re not collecting rent yet but we\u2019ll start to collect rent on that in the third and fourth quarter, so it\u2019s not just development that is causing that it is just, it\u2019s all that we say we are doing not just development. But the way -- but there may be a specific answer to your development question, the way we do same-property is we put properties in our same-property pool, after they have been in-service for 24 full months. So as you sit here today the only development projects we have in our same-property pool, would have to have been in-service on March -- I am sorry on April 01, 2014, so that you had two-full years in there. But I don\u2019t know if that answers your question or not?","Eric Frankel","Okay. I just -- so you think that the timing issue related to some of the leases you sign during the second quarter -- that just hadn't quite flown through?","Jim Connor","I think that is right, it's more timing than anything and then as I tried to mention in my opening remarks, in the second quarter there were three or four individually small expense true up type items that hurt us this quarter. And actually if you went back to the previous year\u2019s quarter, we had a couple of adjustments that were revenue related that helped that quarter so when you look at the 2 together it distorts this quarter's NOI growth a little bit. And FYI I think you've heard me say this a million times, I don\u2019t like to look too much at just the quarterly number, I like the 12 month number better because it doesn\u2019t take one little item and multiply it by four and skew your result.","Eric Frankel","Understood, okay, we'll do some work. We'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","James Feldman. Please go ahead.","James Feldman","Thank you. With your large build-to-suit pipeline, can you talk about what's happening to the space those tenants are leaving behind? Are these new requirements and space reconfigurations, or are they already in the portfolio? It seems like everybody is looking for new buildings, but how do we think about the fallout from that?","Jim Connor","Well Jimmy, I think if you just look at our existing portfolio and the fact that we have been able to raise occupancy, net-net there is a great deal of net absorption out there. If you want us to talk specifically about those build-to-suits, some are absolutely new deals where the client has not given up any space, some of which are consolidations of multiple spaces where they are looking to gain some additional efficiencies, they are generally additional space in there because most of these clients are growing. But as we did this quarter, we have been able to backfill space at very good rental rates. So in that there is probably a little bit of both, but there is a lot of demand out there when you have got overall nationwide vacancy is 5.2% and you have got a lot of big users out there seeking new space. It's a good time for us in the industrial business.","James Feldman","Okay. And then in terms of the speculative starts in the quarter, it looks like Eastern Pennsylvania and Southern California. Are there other markets, do you think you'll spread to more markets with the speculative starts? I know it sounds like it will still be pretty measured. And then how would you say the count -- like, other developers in the market, are you seeing them start to get more comfortable with spec, also?","Jim Connor","Well, I\u2019ll take the last question first. Yes, there is no shortage of people doing spec development, I think what we are all very happy or pleased with is that demand continues to outpace supply by a find pretty healthy margin. To your first question when we have got I think 18 of our 21 markets above 90%, and 12 above 95% and a couple at 100%. We are in a position to start specing virtually all of our markets. We will probably be a little bit more measured than that. Particularly some of the markets like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Southern California are the high barrier markets where it takes a little longer to entitle land and improve projects. You probably can't reload quite as fastest as you would like, and that\u2019s a burden we bear for being a little bit more cautious than perhaps some of the local developers. But it\u2019s worked for us very well so far. So you\u2019ll continue to see us take a measured approach do some speculative development in a number of these different markets we mix that in with our build-to-suit, and I think the pipeline will look very-very good in the second half of the year.","James Feldman","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Just a quick clarification related to the vacant Indianapolis asset you guys have under contract. So was that move to held-for-sale during this quarter, and thus had a positive effect on occupancy during 2Q? Or is that going to be a positive for occupancy in the third quarter?","Jim Connor","No Blaine, it was moved in the second quarter. So it\u2019s moved out of our population, if you will down in the held for sale, so that did help occupancy in the second quarter. And when we sell it in the third quarter it will have no impact on occupancy since it has already been taken out.","Blaine Heck","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","One more question. How tough it is to buy land today?","Jim Connor","Eric, it\u2019s not tough, it\u2019s expensive. And most of our markets that we\u2019re active in land prices have exceeded previous peaks of 2007-2008. I think that\u2019s another reason why our strategy to be very-very prudent on our land inventory is paying off for us. So I was asked so I think it was probably at NAREIT if given where we were, we were going to go out and bulk up on land and we have continually advised our business guys. Now is not the time to bulk up on that. We will buy what we need put it in-service as quickly and efficiently as possible and keep that land inventory at a very efficient level. And we will look to make some key buys somewhere down the road when land prices return to a somewhat more normalized level.","Eric Frankel","Okay. Actually, I misspoke. I have one more question. Can you just clarify the valuation of the JV breakup with Gramercy? I think on the back page of the supp, you value a building at $67 million. But I think you, in your opening commentary, made it sound like it was actually closer to -- $53 million was the portion of which that you paid. So I'm just trying to understand the valuation better.","Jim Connor","No there were two buildings Eric. We bought two buildings this quarter, I think we quoted 51 million for the value of the industrial building that we effectively bought I am air quotes here from Gramercy and then about $16 million for a medical office building that we had actually had under contract for well over a year. So there were 2 buildings in that 67 million in the supplementals.","Eric Frankel","And that $51 million -- for the 80% interest?","Jim Connor","Correct.","Eric Frankel","Okay. That's all I need to know. Okay, thank you.","Jim Connor","All right, thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. Please continue.","Jim Connor","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening during our third quarter call that is the October 27th.

[Operator Instructions] I'd also like to remind you that today's conference is being recorded.","And I'd now like to turn the conference to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Hubbard.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, Justin. And good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2016, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by that 2017 was another outstanding year for Duke Realty. We exceeded all of our beginning of the year goals including completing the transformation of the company that evolved over the last eight years to what is now the largest domestic only pure play industrial REIT. We also kept off the year with an excellent fourth quarter from an operational and financial perspective that sets us up for a great start to 2018. ","Let me recap our outstanding year. We signed nearly 24 million square feet of leases which are impressive given our all time high occupancy levels. We improved stabilized occupancy to 95.8%, up from 98.1% at yearend 2016. We grew same property NOI at 4%. We attained over 19% rent growth on second generation leases. We commenced $866 million in new development starts that were in aggregate 60% released. We completed $3.1 billion in property dispositions culminating in the sale of our medical office platform at a much better than expected 4.65 cap rates. We sold $66 million of non strategic land and monetize another $226 million through our development activity. We recycled the majority of the capital received from disposition accretively into industrial investment, de-lever the balance sheet and returned a portion to our shareholders in the form of $0.85 per share special dividend. ","We also deferred some of the sale proceeds in the form of seller financing to minimize dilution and fund the future investments. Even as the results of shrinking the company in the short term for stronger future growth, we were still able to grow AFFO on a share adjusted basis by 3.8%, and increase our regular quarterly common dividend by 5.3%. Now let me turn to our leasing and development results from the fourth quarter. We had our strongest quarter of the year for with 7.8 million square feet of leases executed. We signed 19 leases in excess of 100,000 square feet individually, demonstrating the continued strong demand for mid sized and large basis. We also signed 4.3 million square feet of renewal leases including Electolux in Chicago for $960,000 fee prime distribution in Indianapolis for $1.2 million square feet and ConAgra in Northern California for $727,000 fee. ","Turning to our development activity in the fourth quarter. We started $207 million of projects. We started 368,000 square foot 44% pre released facility in Houston at our Gateway North Business Park. On the speculative development side, we started two deals that were both at Tier 1 markets. The first project is a 282,000 square foot facility in the Inland Empire West submarket and the second project is the 659,000 square foot development in the Newark submarket of New Jersey, just north of the Newark airport, a land we acquired during the quarter as a part of the Bridge portfolio acquisition.","Our development pipeline at yearend is $676 million and 63% pre released and is expected to generate GAAP yields of 6.4% with margin in excess of 20%.","I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover the acquisitions and dispositions activity for the quarter. ","Nick Anthony","Thanks Jim. We had a very active quarter on both acquisitions and dispositions. Building dispositions total $248 million in the fourth quarter, the largest of which was the final assets sold as part of our MOB sale. Also included in fourth quarter dispositions was our suburban office building located in the South Florida and the final sale in the quarter was a non strategic industrial property in Columbus, Ohio. ","Turning to acquisitions. We closed $367 million during the quarter. The majority at the fourth quarter acquisitions comprised five assets in Northern New Jersey totaling 1.8 million square feet which represents the final closings of the Bridge portfolio we announced last quarter. We also acquired a 100% lease two building portfolio totaling 772,000 square feet in the Port submarket in Houston. Finally, we acquired a 100% lease 71,000 square foot facility in the south based submarket in Southern California. As noted last quarter, the 3.4 square foot Bridge portfolio was 58% leased when we agreed to terms when we had signed and we had signed additional leasing to bring it to roughly 70% leased at the time of the various closing phase in late Q3 and Q4. While we underwrote to stabilize the assets 12 months from the acquisition day, the markets are very strong and market rent growth exceeded our original expectations. We are now 80% leased and in active lease negotiations on two more spaces in the portfolio, which would bring the occupancy into this portfolio to over 95%.","Lastly on the Bridge transaction. Let me remind everyone how unique and opportunistic our acquisition of some of these assets is for Northern New Jersey. In the Meadowlands submarket they are roughly 1,300 building yet only 18 of them are 1997 or newer with 30 foot or greater clear height. In the Newark submarket there are 730 building but only 4 are 1997 or newer with 30 foot plus clear height. Obviously, all the buildings we acquired at this criteria making them truly unique assets for this high barrier submarkets. ","I'll now turn it over Mark Denien to cover our earnings results and balance sheet activities. ","Mark Denien","Thanks Nick. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.30 per share compared to core FFO of $0.30 in the third quarter of 2017 and $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The slight decrease to Core FFO compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was due to the temporarily dilutive effect of the medical office disposition. The impact of the medical office disposition was largely offset by improved operational performance, new properties being placed in service and lower interest expense. We reported core FFO of $1.24 per share for the full year 2017, compared to a $1.20 per share for 2016. The impact of the lower interest expense achieved through using dispositions proceeds to significantly reduce leverage in 2017 improved operational performance and new properties being placed in service which more than enough to offset the dilutive effect of the medical office disposition.","We reported FFO as defined by NAREIT of $1.27 per for the full year 2017, compared to a $1.21 per share for 2016. In addition to the factors driving the increase in core FFO, FFO is defined by NAREIT also increased due to lower losses on debt extinguishment in land and premature use in 2017 compared to 2016. AFFO totaled $399 million for the full year of 2017 and $84 million for the fourth quarter. Our annual results represented roughly a 4% increase to AFFO on a share adjusted basis which is impressive given the short-term dilution from the MOB transaction. ","Same property NOI growth for the three months and twelve months ended December 31st, 2017 was 3.2% and 4.0% respectively. This growth is mainly the result of increasing rental rate within our same property population as occupancy and its portfolio for the quarter was down 20 basis points compared to previous used quarter and for the full year was up only 40 basis points compared to previous years. ","With regard to capital activities during the quarter. We issued $300 million of 10 year unsecured notes n December, to bear interest of 3.375%, earlier in the quarter if we previously announced we extended our $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility from January 2019 out to January 2022 at a current variable rate of LIBOR plus 0.875%. These capital transactions improved our weighted average cost to borrowing and will allow us ample capacity to fund future growth of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion without any equity need, while still maintaining our leverage metrics within our current ratings level. We finished the quarter with no outstanding borrowing on our line of credit and have no significant debt maturities until 2019. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim to discuss our outlook for the coming year. ","James Connor","Thanks Mark. From a macro outlook perspective we expect the economic environment in 2018 to improve over 2017. GDP forecast are in the mid to high 2% range with some probable upside from the recent tax cuts. The secular growth trends in ecommerce sales continue to be very strong. We continuing forecast in the mid to high teens percent growth for 2018. Similar to the last few years, we believe moderate but increase in GDP growth and continued double digit growth in ecommerce will drive outsized demand for modern industrial logistics facilities. ","In 2017, demand continues to outpace supply. Nationwide vacancies continue to decline to an all time low of about 4.4%. Other demand indicator for industrial real estate remains positive as well. Port container traffic was up 6.6% year-over-year and interposal rail volume was up 2.1% year-over-year. Also some of this week's general economic reports bode well for growth in 2018. For instance, the Commerce department noted consumer spending accelerated at 3.8% on an annualized basis during the fourth quarter, the fastest rate in three years. In addition, consumer confidence reported was stronger than expected in January hovering near 17 year high. These dynamics contributed to year-over-year rent growth in the 5.5% range, a bit below 2016 levels but still very strong. Sitting here a year ago we expected to reach supply demand equilibrium by about this time. However, demand exceeded our expectation and supply has been more disciplined during the cycle as we previously discussed. Our industrial outlook for 2018 continues to be favorable based on strong demand and adequate governors on supply. We expect absorption to outpace supply and vacancy to maintain the current trend down to the low 4% range and expect rent to grow in the mid to high single digits depending on the market. These dynamics have still favorable for us to drive portfolio rent growth, maintain our high occupancies and strong leasing volumes for the foreseeable future. ","With this macro perspective in mind, yesterday we announced our range for 2018 core FFO per share of $1.27 to $1.30 with a midpoint of $1.27. In addition, we announced a range for NAREIT defined FFO per share of a $1.24 to $1.32 with a midpoint per share of a $1.28. We also announced growth in AFFO per share basis to range between 2.7% and 8.2% with the midpoint of 5.5%. As we have mentioned before the timing of last year's asset sales and redeployment of the capital is expected to produce modest earnings growth in the first half of 2018, with acceleration in the second half of the year. In fact, we expect earnings in the second half of 2018 to be approximately 5% to 8% higher than the first half of the year as our newer development and acquisitions that were funded with MOB proceeds become stabilized. We think this growth rate we expect to achieve in the second half of the year is more indicative of our ability to grow earnings moving forward.","Now Mark will touch on a few key performance metrics outlined in the 2018 range of estimates which is in exhibit at the back of our supplement package and available on our website. ","Mark Denien","Yes, thanks, Jim. Our average stabilized in-service portfolio occupancy range is expected to be 97.1% to 98.1% which compares to the 98.1% record average we experienced in 2017. The slight decrease we expect for 2018 is due partly to the current un-stabilized project that will reach their one year in-service state at some point in 2018 and then move into our stabilized portfolio, but are not expected to be fully leased at that time. Same property NOI growth is projected in the range of 3.25% to 4.75%. The base case for this assumes a slight occupancy decline from our current record levels. In addition, we continue to expect strong rental rate increases from both embedded lease escalators as well as re-leasing efforts on the approximately 7% of our total portfolio square footage that expires during the year. ","Also keep in mind that we will benefit from all the rent growth we achieved on 2017 rollovers as the impact from those transactions will not be fully reflected until 2018. I'll point out that as we disclosed in our press release a few weeks ago, we are changing our methodology for the pool of properties to make up distinct property NOI growth calculation. We will no longer include un-stabilized properties that were in-service at the beginning of the prior year. But rather will only include properties that were stabilized at the beginning of the prior period. We expect this change in methodology to have 20 to 80 basis points negative impact on a reported same property growth depending on the level of un-stabilized properties in the service portfolio. Our reported 2017 full year same property growth of 4.0% would have been 3.2% under this new methodology. In comparison, the midpoint of our 2018 guidance of 4.0% represents an acceleration in same property NOI growth over 2017 levels which using the same methodology.","Separately with respect to same property NOI we expect to see an approximately 35 basis points positive impact from the 2017 hhgregg bankruptcy. This is in part of an offset of the negative 50 basis point impact from this event on 2017 same property NOI. It is not 1 for 1 reversal due to the timing of 2018 lease commencements and some free rent. In regards to overall NOI growth potential, keep in mind including recently completed development projects that are not yet included in our same property population along with our current development pipeline, our total portfolio upside to NOI from the fourth quarter of 2017 is approximately 17% to 18%. ","On the capital recycling front, we expect proceeds from building dispositions in a range of $300 million to $500 million. The majority of these dispositions will come from two small portfolios that we expect to sell by early in the second quarter. The first is the three building portfolio datacenters that we built and are leased to Amazon in the Washington DC market and expected to close early in the second quarter. The second portfolio consistent of four buildings in the West Jefferson Industrial Park located in Columbus, Ohio. This portfolio is currently being marketed. One thing to note with this portfolio is that Bon-Ton stores currently comprises 20% of the total square feet of this portfolio. Bon-Ton has been in the news recently with some financial concerns. They are current on all of their rent and this property is critical to their supply chain as referenced in their recently filed 8-K. But regardless of any potential negative outcome on their operations, we do not believe it will have any impact on any of our guidance metrics including same property NOI growth as we expect to sell these properties as part of the portfolio by early in the second quarter. ","Acquisitions are projected in the range of $100 million to $500 million focusing on Tier 1 markets. And development starts to project in a range of $500 million to $700 million. This modest decline in development starts from 2017 is largely due to beginning 2018 with a significant backlog of development projects currently under construction as well as continuing a disciplined approach to managing lease-up risk and maintaining our development pipeline in a healthy level pre-leasing. Our pipeline of build-to-suit prospects continues to remain steady. ","James Connor","Thanks Mark. In conclusion, as I wrap this up and we turn it over to Q&A. We believe the reposition company, our high quality assets, exceptional balance sheet and the best in class operating team we have put us in a great competitive position to take advantage of the attractive long term industrial fundamentals. With this we are confident in continuing to drive long-term cash flow growth and annual dividend growth for our shareholders. Before we open up the lines, I'd like to acknowledge the entire Duke Realty team leadership for its efforts and producing another great year of execution on our real estate operations and capital activities.","Now we'll open it up to questions. I'd ask everyone to limit themselves to one or perhaps two short questions and you are always welcome to get back in the queue. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","It looks like our first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just thinking about acquisitions in 2018 do you think those would mimic the acquisitions you did in 2017 in terms of markets pricing, occupancy levels, age of assets et cetera?","James Connor","Yes. Manny, I think from a general perspective I think we would start off thinking that way. Clearly, I'd like to believe Nick is going to do better and find better properties. But and you know it's pretty frothy and expensive out there which is why our acquisitions number is at fairly low range compared to years gone by. And we are looking to lot of things in this Tier 1 markets but it's hard to find things that we think we can justify are creating value. So that's why the range is a little lower than normal and we are little bit vague at this point in time just simply because we are not sure what we will be able to find. ","Manny Korchman","Then maybe one to Mark. If you had to tag a sort of mark-to-market across the whole portfolio where do think that would be? ","Mark Denien","Maybe we should just start to try to figure out that I guess Manny since we've always say we don't calculate that because we don't look out 10 or 15 years on some of our leases. So I'll give you the standard answer. I think we give every quarter, looking out over the next 12 to 24 months, which we have obviously a lot of good visibility on that, we are expecting rent growth right around the same range that we had in 2017. So call it high teens to low 20s on a GAAP basis and probably mid to high single digits on cash basis. Beyond that it's average everything beyond that. If I bring that level down a little bit, obviously the longer in the future this rolling the more recently we probably signed the lease so it's not quite at that level. So it's probably 500 basis points lower than that maybe. ","Operator","Thank you. We have the line of Jeremy Metz. Your line is open. ","Jeremy Metz","Hey guys. Jim, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more details around your supply and demand expectations. How those are relative to the 2017 levels and then maybe where you think the most vulnerability lies in your forecast? ","James Connor","Yes, thanks, Jeremy. It's -- I think we all look at all of these different metrics and every one of them is -- it's just matter of how high they are up. So I think everybody believes we are going to continue to see strong demand. I think some of the weakness in demand that we've seen in the last few years is really driven by a lack of available opportunities in the marketplace. So I think we have a lot less concern about supply than we may have had in the last few years. I do not think we reached equilibrium in 2016. I think with the expected growth in GDP and all of these other positive metrics, I think again we will outpace, absorption will outpace supply. And that\u2019s going to drive that overall vacancy rate down into the low 4% range. In terms of where I most concerned, it's the bigger low barrier market. Right now if you look at Chicago and Dallas and Inland Empire, they all had phenomenal years in 2017 in terms of their net absorption all in the 20 million square foot range. But they also had completions that are slightly more than that. Dallas has probably the biggest gap, which is about 5 million square feet of completions more than net absorption. Now for market of that size 5 million square feet is not all that significant. But a lot of the other Tier 1 market absorption last year outpaced supply. So you'll continue to see vacancy rates fall. So those are probably the three that are on the top of our list. ","Jeremy Metz","Great, appreciate that color. And then the follow up here. Obviously, you posted really strong renewal rate in the quarter over 19%, the foot size at the market is really strong from a demand perspective you just talked about that as well and rents continue to push higher. So as obviously an argument that can be made then maybe you should have pushed harder here. So can you just comment on that and how you think about balancing retention here given the strength in rents?","James Connor","Well, I think we are comfortable that we are pushing pretty good when we are achieving 19% rent growth. Rental earnings, we always have to balance is the rent growth we are getting from a renewal tenant versus rent growth we might get on the next turn. However, you got to factor in the downtime and the increase cost of the transaction. So our guys are pretty sensitive to that. And if you are pushing rents on renewals 19%-20%, I got to believe your eliminating the risk on the roll; I think we are pretty happy with that level. ","Jeremy Metz","Make sense. ","Operator","Next in queue we have the line of Ki Bin Kim. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Good morning. Did you guys commented on the cap rate for planned dispositions and the range for acquisitions for next year or I guess 2018 this year? ","Mark Denien ","No. We didn't keeping that from acquisition standpoint. I mean we really have no visibility on what is even out there right. I mean it's not like we have anything hot right now. So no visibility on the cap rate from acquisition other than to say like Jim mentioned, it will probably end market similar to the markets we are doing right now. So it will probably be -- probably in the high 4s, low 5s something like that. I don't know. Nick, do you have anything to add? ","Nick Anthony","Well, I don't think we've seen a change in cap rate yet from 2017 so we expecting to be consistent with where they were in 2017.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Going back to the same store NOI construct, could you help us just walk through the various levers of how you get to that 4%, specially given that you are partially looking at moderating occupancy and the fact you are not really a rolling whole lot every year. So just curious how you get to that 4%?","Mark Denien","Sure. Let me try that Ki Bin. One thing I think that you need to keep in mind is we gave guidance on stabilized occupancy, that doesn't necessarily 1for 1 translate to the same property pool. For the stabilized portfolio changes by the day as we either buys a building, sells a building, building reaches stabilization and gets included. So that is a moving portfolio, if you will. But it does come probably pretty close to the same property pool. I would tell you that we expect just a moderator decline in same property occupancy probably not quite to the 0.5% decline that we expect in the overall stabilized portfolio. So something little less than that. So just a little bit of decline in occupancy but then you offset that with the rent bumps we embedded in our existing leases which we average about two on our quarter on our existing portfolio. But the deals that we are doing today and really that we did in 2017 are closer to 3% rent bumps. So you get some pretty good growth there. And then the thing I think people miss is not only that you need to look at the 2018 roll that we have coming at us which seems pretty low at 7% but it's a level that we quite honestly like, at least from the risk adjusted basis. We do expect very good growth in that 2018 roll but you also got to look at all the deals we did in 2017. And especially when you look at the fourth quarter 2017, we signed by far in a way our highest quarterly leasing in 2017 at 20% rent growth. So you don't really get any other rent growth from those deals in 2017. It all hits in 2018. So you add all that up and that's kind of how you get to the 4%. ","Ki Bin Kim","Anything unusual year-over-year that would help or hurt? ","Mark Denien","No. I think the only probably unusual thing is probably hhgregg. Hhgregg hurt 2017 by 50 basis points should help 2018 by about 35 basis points. It's all re-lease, we don't get all 50 basis points back. So there is a little bit of free rent here earlier in 2018 but that's really the only thing I would point out. ","Operator","Next we have the line of Blaine Heck. Your line is open. ","Blaine Heck ","Thanks. Given the dynamics you talked about with demand continuing to outpace supply. Does it make sense to get a little bit more aggressive as far as spec development goes? And do you think it's likely you guys could increase start cut and says we progress throughout the year? ","James Connor","Blaine I certainly hope so. We have always committed to you guys that we would keep that development pipeline above 50%. I think today we are about 13% above that. So I think as long as we can continue to see good volume and good activity in the marketplace, I think you'll continue to see us push on the spec side. Our built-to-suit pipeline is also very strong. We did a lot of great volume last year but we didn't do as many of the big projects as we had historically done. So I think if we were to land a couple of those and we are able to continue to lease our spec space, yes, I think you could see us revive that guidance upward. ","Blaine Heck ","Okay. And related to that Jim, your land back has definitely decreased pretty substantially over the past couple of years. You've got more dispositions planned, a little bit more planned but now you've got a lot of cash to put into the development pipeline, do you think you are going to have to be purchasing land more aggressively to feed the pipeline or how should we think about that?","James Connor","Yes, absolutely. And the good news is yes we have been. We bought $240 million of land last year. The good news is we put $226 million in production. So our land inventory is actually up slightly from the low point in 2017. We are actually under $200 million I think we bought it down at about $190 million. And we are back up to about $240 million. So we've been able to put some land on the book to New Jersey, South Florida, Chicago and Southern California, Tier 1 markets where we needed some more land to be able to compete for build-to-suit and do some spec development. ","Operator","Next up we have the line of John Guinee. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. Sometimes you guys are very straight forward and sometimes you talk in code. Mark, thinking about you, when you say that the portfolio NOI can increase 17% to 18% over the fourth quarter number, is that GAAP or cash number? ","Mark Denien","Cash number, John. And all this is taken; it's just fully stabilizing everything that we have in service not just the same property pool. We do have a lot of assets in the un-stabilized in-service. So just stabilizing those and then completing the development projects. So it's no future development but it does include completion of the current development pipeline we have. You add all that up and NOI on stabilized basis should be 17% to 18% higher than the fourth quarter number. ","John Guinee","So it includes acquisitions and dispositions?","Mark Denien","No. ","John Guinee","And then you said the basically your FFO guidance is backend weighted 5% to 8% higher. Should I assume that 2018 FFO is maybe $030, $0.31, $0.33, $0.34?","Mark Denien","We don't quarterly guidance, John. We are just trying to give you a sense for the run rate growth that we are looking forward once we get our balance sheet that closer to what I call the pre-MOB levels which still really won't even be there by the end of 2018 if you look at our guidance. We'll still be under levered but I think will be at pretty good position. ","John Guinee","Great, okay. And I think someone asked you about the cap rate on the datacenter I think you --did you give that I missed it?","Mark Denien","No, we didn't. ","John Guinee","Can you? ","James Connor","Hasn't closed yet. ","John Guinee","I know that Jim.","James Connor ","That's me telling, Nick. No, he can't tell you. ","John Guinee","Call me back, call me later, Nick, thanks. ","Operator","Next we have the line of Rich Anderson. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. So I am going to maybe play a little more cynical role in the dialogue and ask, how much do you have your antennas up? I know Jim you said things are just great, it's just matter of how great they are but when you start to see this little whispers of occupancy trending down a little bit, I know it's not much but little bit supply and some very important markets outpacing absorption. To what degree is Duke like at already to be a more significant net seller in advance of some inevitable deceleration in the fundamental picture for logistics and industrial real estate?","James Connor","Well, Rich, I think accelerating dispositions is always one of the levers we can pull. We have talked throughout 2017 and even 2016 where we have accelerated some dispositions because our development volume and our opportunities under development side were better than expected. And so it's a combination of selling or pruning so more the bottom of the portfolio but at the same time we've always harvest some nearly nice gains on some of this big build-to-suit that we've done. We've sold a number of big Amazon build-to-suits in the last couple of year. That's a very, very nice pricing. So I think that's one of the things that we are always watching is what is going on our development front. What is the next couple of quarters look like and is there an opportunity to for us to accelerate development both on the build-to-suit or on an speculative basis, And if so where do we choose to raise the funds to do that. We've got lots of room on balance sheet to lever up at still very effective interest rates. Or do we choose to accelerate some of the dispositions. ","Rich Anderson","Okay, great. Yes, I mean obviously things are great just looking for second derivative from here but really great quarter of course. Question number two on the Bridge deal, I mean you have some standout quality there in Northern New Jersey. I am curious how that come about in a sense of you happened to have the proceeds from the MOB sale. Was it just kind of almost lucky in the sense that it became available at that time or how would you characterize that and to the extent that there is opportunity similar to that elsewhere in your markets of interest? ","James Connor ","Well, let me answer this and then Nick can give you some color. This is the tribute to Nick and his team. The opportunity for the big Bridge deal came from a smaller Bridge deal that we did earlier in the year. And it's a combination of -- you are absolutely right, having the capital and proactively outworking in the markets for some of these off market deals. And having a good reputation, our ability to perform with the seller and put this kind of transaction together. Nick can give you little bit more color but that's why this deal wasn't widely shot because we had a relationship with these guys. We done a deal and proven ourselves. And we have the capital and I think they believe they got a fair price and so do we. ","Nick Anthony","Yes. We knew we would have the proceeds from the MOB sale. And we were working that long before that profit even started in earnest because we knew we have -- we'd want to -- exchanges and redeploy the capital. And Jim said, we really strategically focused on a smaller deal to get them comfortable that we are performers on a transaction and we do what we said we are going to do. And we worked with them and they worked with us. And it was a great partnership to get the transaction over the goal line.","Rich Anderson","Right. To what degree you are nudging today other folks in a similar way. ","James Connor","Now let's just say Nick is going to get on the phone at 4 O'clock when we are done this all and see if you can find some more deal. That's a big part of what we are always trying to do and the beauty of where our portfolio is performing today is we can take on spec risk and we can take on development risk. And we are very comfortable with our operating teams and all of those local market and we believe we can underwrite those appropriately as evidences by the fact that we are outperforming even in our own underwriting from the second quarter of last year. So we will continue to look for opportunities. ","Operator","Next in question we have the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I know this has kind of been beaten to death, just the same-store NOI growth methodology, but could you confirm, Mark? So your 2018 NOI growth, if you had used the old methodology, you would say that it might be 20 to 40 basis points higher than what you're actually guiding to, is that correct?","Mark Denien","Probably right. Probably towards the low end so it all comes down Eric is you probably know that how many properties you have in that un-stabilized pool under the old method. It's not there in the new. We have a lot of those last year. So we heard last year's number by taking those out by about 80 basis points. That's why we went from 4.0 down to 3.2 on the restated new method if you will. Then you go to the 2017 to 2018 number that we just guided to under the new method at 4.0. I would tell you it probably hurt us probably towards the low end of only about 20 basis points. So we would have probably guided another 20 basis points higher, if we would have included those un-stabilized properties. Because I think we only have four un-stabilized properties 1-1 of 2017. Thereby pulling those out it just wasn't that significant. But it would have been little bit higher. ","Eric Frankel","Okay, that's helpful. So thanks for the update regarding the potential sale there of some buildings in the -- near Columbus. So related to Bon-Ton, I guess, one, are there any of their credit issues that you incorporated in the guidance, just assuming Bon-Ton is not going to -- you're going to sell the asset? That's my first question related to that.","James Connor","Nothing individually significant, Eric. I would just tell you we kind of took our normal bad debt run rate that we would always do. It was obviously little bit higher in 2017 and normal because of hhgregg. So our guidance is more of a normal probably 20 basis point impact. And other than Bon-Ton which we do have Bon-Ton in Columbus, there is also in about 250,000 square feet in Chicago. But that was also distribution location that they mentioned in the 8-K they filed that they plan on keeping as part of their strategic plan. So we don't think anything imminent there, you never know but there is nothing other than Bon-Ton that I would consider to be significant. And the biggest Bon-Ton risk we have is in Columbus. Nick can talk a little bit about the pricing but we don't think it's going to hold up that transaction at all and be able to sell that by late first quarter early second quarter.","Nick Anthony","Yes. So it's only about 20% of that portfolio. So it shouldn't have that dramatic effect on pricing and we don't know what's going to happen or when it's going to happen. So we feel like it's the right time to go ahead and move forward with the transaction in that submarket. ","Eric Frankel","Okay, yes, that should be an interesting bellwether. All right. I'll jump back into the queue. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. We have the line of Richard Schiller. Your line is open.","Richard Schiller","Thanks, good afternoon, guys. Can you guys provide the timing for commencement back filing the 3 hhgregg vacancies that in 2017 now that all the 750 square feet are leased? ","Mark Denien ","Well, they all have commenced I believe right, Jim. So they all commenced, there is -- I am thinking out loud here, I think there is one of the spaces was in paying rent kind of early fourth quarter. The other two, one started paying right at the end of the fourth quarter and we got a little bit of free rent on the third space for the first couple of months of 2018. ","James Connor","Yes. Richard, I would say of the top of my head and we can circle back and get you the data. I think its October, December and probably February. ","Richard Schiller","Got it, thank you. And for the leasing activity in the fourth quarter you guys had a 4.2 million big number of renewals. What percentages would you say are early renewals versus the regular renewals? And do you see that continue into 2018?","Mark Denien","Yes. We had -- I would say probably about 30% of that is what I would call early renewals that we pull forward. One of them is close to 12 months early and then the other 70% was probably the normal 1 to 3 months early. So do we see that going forward? Yes, I mean with only 7% of our leases rolling in 2018, we're already looking at 2019 leases and trying to be proactive. ","James Connor","Richard, the other color I would add is the brokers in the service companies had actually been really good at this because what they are telling their client is if you have a mission critical facility and you got a lease rolling in the next three years, you are better off engaging do now than three years from now. And so we have had the ability throughout 2017 to pull forward leases probably as far as 18 months and I think we'll continue to have that opportunity to pull those forward for all of 2018 and into 2019.","Operator","Next up in queue we have the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Hey, thank you. Jim, you sounded even more confident in this time last year on the supply demand equilibrium. And I think you made the comment about even more governors on supply. Can you just talk about what feels different starting this year than it did last year? Especially on those governors. ","James Connor","Yes. The first on the macro side. I think everybody's expectation was before the tax reform was passed, the GDP was going to be 25 to 50 basis points higher just because of the growing strength in economy. I think you factor-in conservative expectations on what this tax reform another 25 to 50 basis points. So I think that's a big part of it. And then as you look at all the other drivers, it's just really hard to find a place that is giving you any indication that you are going to see a slowdown on the demand side. I think probably today one of the biggest things that are a governor on the new supply piece is land. And there isn't nearly the amount of available land, we've talked on past calls and meetings at NAREIT about the cost of land going up, the cost and the difficulty to entitle site. Construction cost are probably the least of worries while they are going up, they have been going up at what I would call modest rate or modest increases that we've been able to pass through the customers. But I think that's a big part of it is. You just -- particularly in these more land constrained Tier 1 markets, you just can't go and find a site put it under contract and start build the building. ","Jamie Feldman","Okay, that's helpful. And then as you think about -- you mentioned that the Bridge rents are higher and faster than you expected. What are your latest thoughts on stabilized yields from that investment? ","James Connor","We haven't looked at it. But I think when we talked to most everybody at NAREIT, we had underwritten that at just slightly above where we bought or where we sold the MOB at 4.65 or 4.68 and I think depending on the final few leases the rents and everything else, I think we are expecting that to probably work up towards a 4.8. They are all nodding in agreement. So I must be right. ","Mark Denien","Well, good rent ups, that's the initial. ","Operator","Next we have the line of Michael Mueller. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Hi. Mark, you talked a little bit about the bumps on new leases versus existing leases. I know that partially drives the GAAP spreads but I guess as you are looking out over the next few years, are you expecting a similar GAAP between the cash and GAAP spread or do you think there will be some contraction between the two? ","Mark Denien","From state property perspective, Mike? ","Michael Mueller","Yes. ","Mark Denien","Yes. We don't disclose really calculators look at GAAP as closely as we do cash. I'd tell you that probably there has been a 50 to 100 basis points GAAP on average between cash and GAAP with cash obviously being higher because of those rent bumps but I suspect what you said is probably accurate, well probably expect that GAAP to become a little tighter as we look forward based on that. The other thing I would point out if you went and looked at 2017, we had a significant GAAP rent growth in those deals that we signed. It's not fully reflected like I said on a cash basis either till 2018. But when you are doing 20% GAAP deal, it's really eating into that split. So I think you are probably right that GAAP cash spreads will continue to get closer. But we are more comfortable talking on a cash basis because that's what we really look at. But I expect to run it. ","Michael Mueller","And if you take that conversation and just apply to the leasing spreads as well, would you expect some contraction there as well between in terms of the GAAP size? ","Mark Denien","I think all that depends on the length of the lease. I think that's probably the biggest factor between the two. If just looking at renewal or rollover rent growth, the longer the lease could affect the GAAP a lot more than it could the cash. So said differently, the shorter the lease term I think the closer they get, the longer the lease term they further away they get. ","Michael Mueller","Got it. So it sounds like the deals are signing or generally little bit longer on average and you kind of expect them to stay that way. ","Mark Denien","Yes. They are pretty typical on rollover deals, you are generally looking five years on a renewal and a new second generation lease a long one 10 years, the development yields are obviously longer than that. But on a rollover deal it should probably in that seven year range on average. ","Michael Mueller","Got it. ","James Connor","Yes. Mike, the other thing I would to that is one of the benefits of the bigger buildings which we have on our portfolio is the credit tenants that we have tend to make longer term commitments. ","Operator","Next up we have the line of Michael Carroll. Your line is open.","Michael Carroll","Yes, thanks. Nick, can you talk a little bit about the types of deals you're pursuing today? Is there any specific market that you're focusing on? Or is it just the number of the opportunities that you're finding?","Nick Anthony","We are almost exclusively focusing on the high barrier Tier 1 market on the acquisition side to balance out our geography. There are a lot of deal supporting around out there right now, they starting to pickup little bit more in the last week or so. But really what we are trying to do is balance out our geography with the acquisitions as we sell that in the non strategic market. ","Michael Carroll","And then can you remind us why the Columbus asset was a non-strategic asset? Is that due to the specific asset or that market in general? Would you like to reduce your exposure to Columbus in general?","Nick Anthony","Yes. We want to reduce our exposure in Columbus, that was an older asset that we bought -- it was 22 years old and it was sort of one off asset. It is in submarket that we I think acquired back in the 90s to do a build-the-suit. So it was the right time for us to monetize that asset. ","Operator","Next we have a follow up question from the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Hey, guys. Just quick one for me. Earlier in the call you talked about the couple of assets coming into the leasing stats from the development pipeline that just simply were, I think you use term under leased at the moment, just given the strength of demand and sort of everything else we talked about which has been lot of positive, what's causing those assets to take longer lease up and I assumed you would expect it -- it is something specific with the asset in the market? Or just something else that we should be thinking about? ","Mark Denien","Manny, I don't know, a lot of -- is there any specific assets, obviously we are looking forward. So we just have -- we've got a lot of still vacancy in that un-stabilized portfolio. So I think we are just trying to be cautious on our guidance there. We still underwrite one year for stabilization on our development. I'd tell on average we are coming in and around right eight months. So we are beating it almost across the board. But when you look at it we've got 3.2 million square feet of spec in that population that's roll ahead. But I think we are just kind of taking a conservative view and say there are maybe few of those assets to lease when they hit that one year period. ","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. Just quick question on the same store and I appreciate the fact that all you guys got together and set your egos aside and agreed on definitions for all the variables. So thank you for doing that. ","Mark Denien ","We don't have egos. ","Michael Bilerman","Okay. You said you have to tell every other sector that they should do the same. But you only release the cash same store guidance. Is there a difference on GAAP and will you sort of report those and just so that we should expect, a, about the differential between GAAP and cash and how you will be reporting it going forward? ","Mark Denien ","No. This is -- we've work-- we've been consistent in how we done this since the beginning of time of Michael. What I would tell you is what I told the previous caller, I can't remember who he was. On a GAAP basis I think you could expect our number to be probably 50 to 100 basis points lower than our cash number on average. But I would tell you that this year I don't think it will be quite that much. I think it would be probably closer to the cash number because of the significant GAAP rent growth we experienced on leases we signed at the end of 2017. It will be more of a pick up on GAAP basis than it will be for cash in 2018. So we are pretty close to the same number probably for 2018.","Operator","Next we have the line of David Rodgers. Your line is open. ","David Rodgers","Hey, good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit more about acquisitions and I do get on the call late. So I apologize if this has been asked in a different way. But I heard you talked a little but about the acquisitions but Jim in the past you said you were comfortable doing voyage kind of with or without the MOB sales. Mark I think most recently even in NAREIT you talked about kind of getting leveraged back up and moving back into kind of maybe more normalized range for you guys. But acquisition guidance versus dispositions came out what I would think is fairly conservation development spend or development starts per 2018 or down from 2017. But your comments in general were really robust. So maybe the simplistic portion of the question is do you anticipate beating the acquisition guidance this year? Is that a far stretched in your mind to kind of put much more dollars out to work in the current environment? Kind of given what you have already said. ","James Connor","Dave, I would tell you of the development guidance, the disposition guidance and the acquisition guidance, I think the probability of beating the high end of the acquisition guidance is probably the lowest probability. I mean clearly we would like to do more development and we will continue to push. We got room on the amount of spec development just simply because our pre-leasing percentage into the development pipeline is now 63%. So we can continue to do so more spec development and bring that down into the low 50s. We've got a good build-to-suit pipeline. We talked earlier about one of the levers we can pull as accelerating dispositions whether it's older assets that we want to prune from the bottom of the portfolio, or some of our second, third tier exposure like we talked about with Columbus. But I got to tell you much as we saw cap rate compressed in 2017 and the record level of pricing and the amount of capital they are chasing, I just think opportunities for us to find another Bridge at a yield, going to yield of -- in the high 4s is -- I just don't think if there is high probability to that. And most of the stuff and as Nick said it's really near bottom line of activity. But most of the stuff we've seen is one off deals, smaller deals. And look, we will continue to do some infill deals in Miami, New Jersey and Southern California. But buying in $20 million and $30 million eclipse doesn't give you a lot of confidence that we are going to get in excess of $500 million. So that's probably really long -winded answer but I think that gives you some color. And that was long-winded question. So thanks. ","Operator","Next looks we have again line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, regarding the development on Delancey Street in Newark. Obviously, it looks like that market's performing really well and should lease up fairly quickly. But obviously, the value per square foot, just given land and development cost there is quite -- it's higher than normal industrial developments. Have you thought about the prospect of doing multi storey at a site like that?","Mark Denien","We did Eric. And that development was a little far down the road for us to seriously look at it. Plus it's an awfully big building to do multi level. That would have taken it to over a million square feet. One of the reasons the cost is little higher there obviously we got great loading but we did go to 44 clear on spec on there because we think that's a great opportunity for some of our ecommerce clients to be very close in to the Manhattan area. So we went ahead and spend the extra money for that.","Eric Frankel","Okay. And then just a follow-up question for Mark regarding your office portfolio. Can you just clarify, I thought I heard you say you sold your last office building, but I'm assuming that your non-core portfolio is comprised solely of your smaller office assets that are still to be sold. Is that correct?","Mark Denien","Correct. We sold our last office building in South Florida. Maybe we should emphasis the in, Eric, sorry for that confusion. ","James Connor","I want to thank everyone for joining the call. I look forward to seeing many of you during the year at industry conferences as well as getting you out to visit our regional markets.

Welcome to the Duke Realty Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. You will have an opportunity to ask questions during the presentation. Instructions will be given then. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Denny Oklak, Chairman and CEO; Jim Connor, Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2012 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Denny Oklak.","Denny Oklak","Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I will highlight some of our key accomplishments during 2013, followed by our thoughts on the overall real estate operating environment and how it is affecting us. Jim Connor will then give you an update on our real estate operation, I\u2019ll review our asset of repositioning activity and Mark will then address our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and progress on our capital strategy and then we\u2019ll share details of our 2014 guidance.","Our solid operational performance, strong new development starts and achievement of the asset repositioning and capital goals we established back in 2009 resulted in an outstanding year for Duke Realty.","A few of the highlights for the year were as follows. We signed 30 million square feet of leases equal an all-time record and achieved a solid 70% tenant retention rate. We improved in-service occupancy to 94.2% and grew same property NOI 3.7%. We commence 666 million in new development starts, acquired over 540 million of industrial properties and completed nearly 930 million in dispositions.","We issued 500 million of unsecured debt at a weighted average yield interest rate of 3.8%, as well as executed $250 million term loan at a currently rate of about 1.5%. We redeemed $178 million of our 8.375% Series O Preferred Shares and we raised 669 million of common equity during the year which we used to fund our development pipeline and significantly improve our overall leverage profile.","The strong performance in 2013 accomplished the final leg of our strategic plan laid out to you over four years ago as follows. We achieved our asset repositioning to 60% industrial, 25% suburban office and 15% medical office on an NOI basis and today we have a best-in-class portfolio in each of our product types.","Over the last four years our team also executed flawlessly on the operational segment of the strategic plan, improving in-service occupancy over 800 basis points to over 94%, including the achievement of over 117 million square feet of total leasing activity since we embarked on the strategy.","We deposed of roughly $3.3 billion of non-core primarily suburban office properties and recycled $3 billion of capital into acquisitions of an extremely high quality portfolio of primarily bulk industrial facilities in key distribution markets around the country.","Also on the asset side, we started about $1.5 billion in new projects since 2009. Most important, the asset recycling has had a positive return for our shareholders in terms of AFFO, as we have grown our AFFO per share each year, again consistent with what we outlined over four years ago.","We also improved balance sheet metrics since 2009 with debt plus preferred EBITDA improved by roughly 80 basis point and fix charge coverage improved by nearly 50 basis points.","The score card in executing strategic plans speaks to itself. We have achieved the compounded average growth rate on AFFO per share of nearly 6% since 2010. This transforming -- transformative plan has been a success for our stakeholders and the company\u2019s future opportunities and strategic direction are equally bright which we will touch on in a moment in connection with our 2014 expectations.","I will now discuss the overall market conditions we're experiencing and how this is affecting our business. Recent GDP reports indicate we are breaking out of the sub 2% to 2.5% growth we have experienced for the last two years with 2014 consensus GDP growth in the 3% range. This would be a nice boost to an already strong real estate fundamental picture across all of our product types and in most markets.","Starting on the industrial side, all leading indicators across trucking, rail, ISM, retail sales, e-commerce have continued to show growth which bodes well for strong leasing fundamentals and development opportunities.","Preliminary fourth quarter market reports depict one of the best quarters on record with nearly 45 million square feet of net absorption. This is a level not seen since 2007 and contribute significant 40 basis point drop in the national industrial vacancy rates during the quarter to an overall mid to high 7% range according to a number of sources.","The PPR54 Index also reported market rent growth for the fourth quarter up nearly 4% on a year-over-year basis. These positive statistics are not surprising to us and there are representative of the positive results were experienced in our portfolio.","With respect to leasing in our in-service portfolio, all the five of our 22 industrial markets are over 90% leased and 15 or over 95% lease with an overall occupancy level of 95.3%. We finish with strongest quarter of industrial leasing in history of the company, with total leasing of 10.1 million square feet nearly 3 million square feet above the previous record.","Rents on the industrial renewal leases grew nearly 5% for the quarter and nearly 4.5% for the full year and with continued strong demand for modern space and moderate supply, we are optimistic about improving rent growth picture for 2014.","As noted last quarter, we believe we have additional upside in overall industrial occupancy and coupled with contractual rent escalations and improving rent growth supports a very solid same property growth outlook that Mark will discuss in a moment.","The medical office business continues to benefit ongoing legislative changes in the industry, hospital consolidation is happening at a strong pace and physician practices are being sold to major hospital systems.","Even with trepidations on the launch of the Affordable Care Act health systems continued to have aggressive plans to invest in modern outpatient facilities. This is driving strong demand in our medical office business.","In 2013, we started nearly 180 million of healthcare development projects with a lease term yield averaging above 8.7% and our premium MOB development franchise has a strong backlog of potential projects we are working on now. Overall, the medical office business has tremendous growth prospects.","Finally, the suburban office sector has continued to show more positive trends. Although, the national vacancies are still in the mid teens, net absorption stayed positive for the 15th consecutive quarter.","We see continued strength in our portfolio and in the context of our active disposition program, our quarterly average same property occupancy is up 240 basis points over last year.","I'm pleased to announce that four of our eight markets, Raleigh, South Florida, Indianapolis and Nashville have achieved occupancies in the 92% to 95% range. Regarding office land positions over the last two years we've had outstanding success at winning corporate build to suite deals and also commencing substantially pre-leased or speculative development opportunities in select market such as Houston and Raleigh monetizing much of this land. These opportunistic office developments have produced very strong 9% to 10% stabilized yields representing excellent value creation for our share.","So now I will turn it over to Jim Connor to give a little more color on our leasing activity and the development pipeline.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everyone. As Denny mentioned, we had a record fourth quarter in leasing. We did over 11 million square feet of leasing. We also commenced a record 362 million square feet of new development starts.","I will start with the leasing side, our overall in-service occupancy increased 70 basis points from last quarter to 92 -- 94.2%. Leasing activity on the industrial side was terrific. We signed a record 10.1 million square feet of leases during the quarter and increased our industrial in-service occupancy from 94.6% at the end of the third quarter to 95.3% at year end.","I\u2019ll hit some of the highlights around the local markets starting with Indianapolis. We are seeing significant increase in customer demand in both the northwest and the airport submarkets. We signed a 312,000 square foot new lease and 270,000 square foot renewal with a major tenant in park 100 Business Park. We signed the 343,000 square foot new lease at our recently delivered and some spec project which brings that to 60% leased.","In Indianapolis, we also executed an 800,000 foot renewal combined with a 200,000 square foot expansion for client of ours had shared books in our Lebanon Business Park. Couple of other notable deals around the system and new lease for 240,000 square feet with Amazon, they took 100% of our Houston spec\/industrial project.","We also signed a 320,000 square foot new lease with Rock Tenn in our World Park 3 project in Cincinnati. There are also quite a few new leases signed in connection with build-to-suit developments which I'll touch on in just a moment.","Turning to the office side. Our overall in-service occupancy in the office portfolio at quarter end was 87.8%, that\u2019s up 60 basis points from the previous quarter and up 150 basis points over the prior year. Overall leasing activity for 2013 was strong at 4.5 million square feet signed and over 1 million square feet increase from 2012 and this was accomplished with a 60% smaller portfolio, I might add.","For the fourth quarter, we signed over 800,000 square feet of deals including a few notable ones in Cincinnati and 81,000 square foot lease on 11-year term for HSS Systems and 59,000 square foot renewal for FRCH worldwide for the seven-year term.","Turning to the medical side, our medical office portfolio continues to produce very strong results with over 925,000 square feet of leases signed during the year. We ended the year with occupancy at 93.7%. That\u2019s 230 basis point improvement over year end 2012.","Now I\u2019ll turn to the development business. In 2013, we started 26 new projects totaling $660 million -- excuse me $666 million in projected stabilized cost. That\u2019s an excellent year and exceeded even our expectations going in from the beginning of the year. For the fourth quarter, we started 362 million of primarily industrial build-to-suits as well as three medical office projects, totaling 4.3 million square feet with a weighted average gap yield of 8%.","Early in the quarter, we broke ground on a 1 million square foot build-to-suit for Amazon at Chesapeake Commerce Center at the port of Baltimore. This is a deal we mentioned on our last call. We also started two build-to-suit projects in our joint venture, AllPoints Midwest in Indianapolis. One transaction was 1.1 million square feet, the other was 614,000 square feet both with major national retailers.","In Atlanta, we started two build-to-suit facilities totaling 480,000 square feet, one for HH Gregg appliances and the other for Federal Express. Our final industrial build-to-suit was of 300,000 square foot distribution facility in our Gateway North park in Minneapolis for Ruan Transportation.","In addition to the industrial build-to-suits, we started one industrial speculative project in our Linden, New Jersey that\u2019s a Brownfield redevelopment site, just south of Newark International Airport. We monetized 24 acres of land that we had just acquired out of joint venture that we had a 50% interest in. That will support that 494,000 square foot modern bulk facility and just a couple of comments about that market. This is a submarket. The total is about 45 million square feet with vacancies under 9%.","Finally, we started three medical office projects totaling 197,000 square feet. Two of these projects were with existing hospital system relationships we have with Ascension and Centerre. The third was a new relationship in New Jersey with Palisades Medical Group.","These facilities are located in Indiana, Tennessee and New Jersey, respectively. Three projects are 79% pre-leased with terms -- with lease terms ranging from 7 to 15 years. Including this very strong fourth quarter activity, our development pipeline at year end is over $610 million with a weighted average stabilized initial cash yield of 7.7% and a gap yield of 8.4% and is 89% pre-leased in the aggregate.","This development pipeline is one of the key value creation drivers for us at this point in the economic cycle with development spread approximating 150 to 200 basis points above market cap rates. This is an excellent investment focus and with such high pre-leased percentage, the news lease revenue is immediately accretive when the building is complete and put in service.","Just a quick note on the supply outlook for the industrial sector. Spec projects in our markets for the -- totaling for the fourth quarter of 2013 ended the year at just under 53 million square feet. This is an 11 million square foot increase over the third quarter of 2013. However, during that same period of time leasing increased 3.2 million square feet at year end.","We saw the percentage of leased -- the percentage leased of this spec inventory increased by just under 8% to 22.21% overall. In this context that we've alluded to on the previous earning calls, we think supplies has relatively disciplined and essentially in all of these markets in this cycle compared to historical levels. We\u2019re monitoring this activity closely but feel comfortable right now.","Given our entitled land positions which can support approximately 50 million square feet of bulk industrial development and given our relationships and track records at winning major build-to-suits with top customers, our development platform is in a dominant position to drive strong risk-adjusted growth through the cycle.","I'll now turn it back over to Denny to talk a little bit about our asset recycling activities.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Jim. During the fourth quarter, we acquired two industrial facilities totaling nearly 1.2 million square feet or $73 million, bringing the total executed acquisitions to $545 million for the year.","On the disposition side, proceeds from asset and land sales for the fourth quarter were $412 million and $19 million respectively. For the full year, proceeds from asset and land sales were $877 million and $52 million respectively.","With this activity, we ended the year at 60% industrial, 25% office and 15% medical, hitting our four year strategic goal. In comparison, looking back four years ago, we had 56% office and 36% industrial. And I\u2019ll emphasize today we\u2019re much geographically better positioned and the quality of our portfolio is top tier.","Regarding the acquisitions for the quarter, we bought only two assets. Both were industrial assets, one in Chicago and one in Miami that we bought from users in sale leaseback transactions. These properties require below-market valuations with leases that have solid annual rent escalations that will produce future same property growth.","Turning to disposition transactions. During the quarter, we closed on a series of transactions encompassing 11 suburban office assets and 15 medical office facility deals which we've been discussing with you since mid-2013. Our ownership share of the suburban office disposition represented about 1.5 million square feet and totaled $192 million in aggregate sales price whereas the medical portfolio encompassed about 750,000 square feet and totaled $210 million in aggregate sales price.","Both the medical office and Midwest suburban office dispositions that closed in the fourth quarter represent most of the disposition pipeline we set out to sell last year. For various reasons, a few of these transactions are spilling over into 2014 as we expected. About 60 million of which have already closed so far in January. In addition, there are number of disposition transactions in process, which means we should get off to a strong start in 2014.","Finally, regarding the land sales component of our dispositions, for the quarter we sold $19 million and for the year we sold $52 million achieving the top end of our expectations and realizing about 20% gain to our book basis. Coupled with development starts, the aggregate amount of land monetized in 2013 was $114 million.","So now I'll turn the call over to Mark to discuss the financial results, capital plan and our 2014 plan.","Mark Denien","Thanks Denny. Good afternoon everyone. As Denny mentioned, I\u2019d like to recap our 2013 financial performance and progress on our capital strategy. I'm pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.29 per share, up from $0.28 per share in the third quarter.","The improvement in Core FFO for the quarter was driven by continued stronger operational performance as evidence by increased occupancy and same property results, as well as due to the earnings from new development projects that were placed in service.","We reported core FFO of $1.10 per share for the full year compared to a $1.2 per share for 2012. We\u2019re extremely pleased to report AFFO of $0.90 per share for the full year and $0.21 per share for the fourth quarter of \u201813. AFFO per share for the full year represents a nearly 10% improvement over 2012 results and translates into a very conservative payout ratio of slightly below 76%.","In addition, the increased earnings is reflected within core FFO, the growth in AFFO over 2012 was the result of our asset repositioning efforts as our concentration in less capital intensive bulk industrial assets have steadily increased over the last two years.","Our same property growth was strong for the year and reached the top end of our expectations. Same property NOI for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31 was a positive 2.3% and positive 3.7%, respectively. Continued occupancy increases, contractual rent escalations and improving rental rate growth on expirations drove the solid performance. Our growth from net effective rent on renewals was 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 3.1% for the full year, driven in large part due to the rental growth across all product types.","We expect this trend to continue as rental rates continue to grow in all product types in our markets. I would also like to remind everyone that the occupancy percentages we quote are on a lease signed basis. This means that not all of this increase leasing activity has actually commenced and started paying rent. So we have some cash flow upsides here in addition to further leasing that we can do. In summary, our operational performance continued to improve over the last year, and we expect continued solid operating fundamentals moving into 2014.","Now, I will quickly recap capital transactions for the quarter and for the full year. As previously announced in December, we refinanced $250 million of unsecured bonds which had a stated rate of 5.4%, and an effective rate of 6.3% with a new 3.875%, $250 million issuance that\u2019s due in 2021. This seven plus year issuance fits well within our future maturities and essentially covers us on all debt maturities until 2015.","Including this transaction, we issued $750 million of unsecured debt during the full year of \u201913, of which $500 million is fixed in an average effective interest rate of 3.8%, and $250 million represents a five-year term loan that bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.35%. During 2013, we repaid $675 million of higher rate unsecured bonds, which had an effective interest rate of 6.4%. We also repaid 12 secured loans, totaling $154 million, which had a weighted average effective rate of 5.5%.","Looking back to February of 2013, we redeemed $178 million of 8.375% Series O Preferred Shares, which resulted in a $3.7 million quarterly reduction of preferred dividends. Following our $41.4 million share equity offering that raised $572 million in January of \u201813, we opportunistically used our ATM program, issuing 4.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $16.67 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately $78 million for the year.","We all see building and land disposition proceeds as an additional source of funding for a new development. Proceeds from dispositions including our share of joint venture sells, totaled $431 million for the quarter and $929 million for the year. We expect a strong pace of disposition activity to continue in 2014, which will allow us to fund our development pipeline, while still improving upon our key leverage metrics.","We ended the year with $88 million outstanding on the line of credit. We expect to pay this line down further in 2014, using the proceeds from near-term dispositions. We have no individual debt maturities of any significance until February of 2015. We also achieved improvements in our key leverage metrics during the fourth quarter, reporting ","a fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.1 times for the rolling 12-months ended 12\/31\/13, compared to 2.0 times for the rolling 12-months ended September 30th of 2013.","Fixed charge coverage for just the fourth quarter was 2.3 times, demonstrating our continued improving leverage profile. Net debt plus preferred to EBITDA after pro forma adjustments for dispositions, acquisitions and the impact of our development pipeline was 7.7 times for the fourth quarter of 2013.","Reduced leverage improved operational performance and the impact of development deliveries drove this result, which is favorable compared to net debt plus preferred to EBITDA of 8.9 times back in the fourth quarter of 2012. These improvements to our key leverage metrics, as I\u2019ve said in the last couple of quarters are partially due to completing development projects where we\u2019ve incurred significant costs without realizing the earnings.","Because of our development projects under construction are currently 89% pre-leased in the aggregate, we will continued to realize improvements to our key credit metrics as projects continue to come online. With no debt maturities of any significance in 2014, our much improved balance sheet, anticipated disposition proceeds and virtually untapped line of credit, we are well-positioned for future growth heading into 2014.","Now, turning to our 2014 outlook, yesterday, we announced a range for 2014 FFO per share of $1.11 to $1.19, with a midpoint of a $1.15 per share and AFFO per share of $0.91 to $0.97 with a midpoint of $0.94 per share. This guidance supports what we've been saying for the past four years that our asset repositioning strategy would not be dilutive on a cash flow basis, and would ultimately put the company on an upward plain of growth, which is now occurring.","First, from a macro outlook perspective, we expect a slightly improved economic environment in 2014 and continued solid real estate fundamentals, which are reflected in our guidance. A few specifics on some of the anticipated key performance metrics outlined on the 2014 range of estimates page provided on our website are as follows.","Our average in-service portfolio occupancy range for 2014 is expected to be 93.25% to 94.75%. The midpoint of which would be about 70 basis points better than our average 2013 numbers. Lease expirations are slightly below average at 8%. Same-property NOI is projected to grow at a range of 2.0% to 4.0%. As noted, we expect some incremental occupancy growth as well as continued improvement in rental rates.","On the capital recycling front, we project proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $500 million to $700 million, and proceeds from land dispositions of $30 million to $50 million. This range is inclusive of the dispositions that are currently in process that Denny mentioned earlier. Our disposition program will continue to focus on primarily suburban office and our remaining few retail properties.","Acquisitions are projected in the range of $150 million to $300 million. We expect to be pretty selective given today\u2019s pricing environment and still focused on high-quality industrial assets that are strategic and accretive to cash flow. Development starts are projected in the range of $350 million to $450 million, a level that was partially impacted downward by the strong fourth quarter 2013 deals that got signed a little bit earlier than we expected. These will be primarily industrial and medical office projects, and we expect to fund our development pipeline primarily with proceeds from our building and land dispositions.","Service operations should be in the range of $16 million to $22 million, consistent with our fourth quarter 2013 run rate, and G&A expense is expected to be in a range of $40 million to $44 million as we continue to realize operational efficiencies. We close the year with fantastic performance and executed our strategic plan as outlined over four years ago.","To reiterate these 2013 highlights, we grew AFFO per share by nearly 10%. We grew FFO per share by nearly 8%. Our leasing team executed 30 million square feet of leased transactions and we experienced improving rental rate growth throughout the year and ended with 5% growth on renewal rents in the fourth quarter.","We started $666 million in new developments, and in the process monetized $62 million of land. Our $611 million development pipeline is 89% pre-leased. We sold $52 million of land at a $10 million gain. We significantly improved our leverage profile. We accomplished our asset target goals. All of these accomplishments have positioned the company for continued growth as we head into 2014 and beyond.","With that I will turn it over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Mark. I would just like to thank the entire Duke Realty team for their efforts. They were instrumental in helping us achieve the asset repositioning capital strategy goals that we\u2019ve laid out four years ago. It's pretty amazing when you look at the volume of transactions it took to accomplish these goals.","From an asset repositioning perspective over this four year period, we\u2019ve closed on average one transaction every eight business days. From a capital strategy perspective over this four year period, we raised on average $6 million every business day, pretty impressive work.","In closing, we have a premium franchise real estate company made better by our strategic efforts over the past few years and we are poised to drive strong and steady investment returns and create long-term value for our shareholders.","So with that, thank you again for your support in 2013 and for joining us today. And with that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. I just had a couple of questions regarding your 2014 guidance -- FFO guidance. If I exclude -- when I look at it, it says unexpected dispositions of about $600 million. It will probably add about roughly $0.05 to your FFO guidance. It seems high. I\u2019m sure there is some other moving parts to this. I was wondering if could provide a little more clarity, especially touch on -- are you capitalizing more G&A and perhaps talk a little bit more about the timing of dispositions and development completions throughout the year?","Mark Denien","Ki Bin, I\u2019ll try to address some of that, I don't know the math behind your $0.05 but a couple of things. Our overhead overall is pretty flat. I would say in 2014 versus \u201913, we do expect to be a little bit more efficient, have a little more volumes. So we probably had -- we will have a little bit more G&A capitalized but should not be significant. That\u2019s why our G&A numbers are pretty flat from \u201913 to \u201914 in our guidance.","From development and acquisition and disposition timing perspective, the way we really looked at it is we really wanted to able to support our development pipeline through being a net disposal of properties. So as far as timing, I would tell the timing in the yields, the yields on development projects should be higher than the yield or the cap rate on the dispositions.","So that would be a pickup, although the development deliveries probably be a little bit backend loaded compared to dispositions. So, overall, those should probably pretty much washout.","I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re getting your $0.05 maybe we can talk about that offline and go through that. But that\u2019s a little bit around the timing and yields. So I think, we\u2019re pretty bullish that our yields underdevelopment, it\u2019s going to exceed the dispositions and then in that like I said we\u2019ll fund that development pipeline through our disposition program and that\u2019s why you see our disposition number where they are.","Denny Oklak","Yeah. Just a couple points on that, I think, as I mentioned in the remarks Ki Bin, I think with the closing that carried over into the early this year along with the pipeline, we\u2019ll probably get off to a fairly fast start on the dispositions for the year hopefully.","And then second, even though if you look at starts from year-to-year and starts in 2013 on the development side were up some, overall volume is not of as much as the start comparison. So really, when you look at overall development volume, it\u2019s going to be up a little bit in 2014, but right now based on our guidance since not up to that significantly from where we were in 2013.","Mark Denien","Yeah. That\u2019s a good point and if you look in our supplement, I don\u2019t have the page in front of me, Ki Bin, but if you look at the first and second quarter deliveries of our development pipeline, its mainly office and MOB projects. So that's what will bring our development pipeline down a little bit quicker and have the overall volume in \u201914 fairly close to \u201913.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And so maybe just as a follow-up, what cap ratio we expect on average for your dispositions in 2014. And what dollar volume of completion should we expect?","Mark Denien","I am sorry, the dollar volume of\u2026","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Development completions.","Mark Denien","Development completions, so I think its really going to vary on the mix of our products that we sell on the cap rates. Again it\u2019s primarily the suburban office assets and couple of retail projects that will likely sell the last little bit of retail we have.","So, I don't even really feel comfortable necessarily giving you cap rate guidance today. But I think, if you look historically its going to fall in the range that you've seen over the last year or so, 18 months on our dispositions, I don't see any change there.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Mark Denien","Thanks Ki Bin.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Thank you. So, are there any, Mark, I know you guys said you think supply in the warehouse side is pretty much in check. Are there any market or submarkets where you are feeling a little bit more concerned?","Denny Oklak","Well, Jamie, I would tell you that that most of us use the metric in terms of the amount of spec space, that's in the pipeline as a percentage of the overall portfolio and everybody tends to feel pretty comfortable at 1% or below.","There\u2019s really only a couple of markets nationally that are above that. Phoenix and Seattle are the only two and they\u2019re slightly above and between the third and the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t track any additional new spec developments announced or started and they both made some improvement in their leasing. So, they are improving on it, so there is none that really worry us right now.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I guess, turning to office. Can you just give a little more color about where you think we are in the cycle and maybe just some anecdotal evidence of what you're seeing in the market in terms of maybe its spreading to new market, is it new types of tenants. Just try to dig a little deeper, given you have such a wide breathe of markets, kind of how people should be thinking about where we are in the cycle and where it goes from here?","Denny Oklak","Well, I would tell you the, our year end results are fairly consistent with what we saw through the third quarter and we talk a little bit about on the third quarter call and that many of the conferences when we saw each other. You\u2019re seeing financial services companies, healthcare companies, healthcare service companies, a lot of retailers and food companies are the drivers behind a lot of the growth and the job, the hiring that we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s a -- we\u2019re seeing it across the country. We gave a couple of highlights of some very nice deals. But lot of that growth was made up of small and mid-size deals that are growing and expanding as well.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I apologies if I miss this, but did you say for your same-store outlook. What it will be for office versus industrial?","Denny Oklak","No. We didn\u2019t, Jamie, we just commented overall that it\u2019s going to be a net 2% to 4% range. But I would tell you that it probably won't be a lot different because we\u2019ve got, while the occupancy growth on the industrial side is slowing. We\u2019re making that up in rental rate growth. You have the inverse on the office side. We still have quite a bit of occupancy growth. We can get on the occupancy side even though the rental rate side challenging. So I think that they should be really pretty close.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe for Jim or for Denny on the industrial side, demand clearly pretty strong to end the year, I'll be curious on your thoughts and how it\u2019s moving into 2014. The demand that you're seeing in January and maybe kind of the mix between build to suit activity and spec activity and development for industrial and whether you're getting more confident to put more spec out there over the course of this year.","Denny Oklak","Jim?","Jim Connor","Well, I would tell you, obviously, we had a very strong finish and we\u2019re kind of expecting a fairly significant falloff right after the holidays given everything we accomplished.","But I would tell you that through the first four weeks of the year, we\u2019re still very optimistic. We've seen continued increase about demand, deals that are in process are continuing to track. So, I think, we feel pretty optimistic about the outlook for momentum in 2014.","In terms of development versus spec, we\u2019ve answered a lot of questions about that recently. We\u2019ve always concluded, as long as we can continue to meet our development budgets doing really good build to suit development deals with credit tenants with good terms and good yields.","We\u2019re going to keep the governor on the spec development. We don't need to take that much additional risk. We\u2019re still getting great yields on the build to suit portfolios that we\u2019ve reported. Its much more creative for us as this portfolio is 89% pre-released, as soon as it comes in service we start adding value. So in short, we\u2019ll continue to pick and choose the places to do some spec development, but I don't think you'll see us significantly ramping up spec activity.","I think it will be consistent with 2013 because we feel pretty strong that our build to suit activity will remain constant. And we\u2019re still see it, even though we signed a bunch of deals in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve still got new opportunities that have come about since, since the holidays and the pipeline was pretty good going into the holiday. So I think we\u2019ll remain consistent on that on the front.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","And then Mark, maybe with regard to guidance, two things, does the guidance or have you contemplated I guess and talk about preferred redemption this year, what\u2019s callable out there and any land sale gains that you included in the guidance itself?","Mark Denien","Yeah. Dave, I\u2019ll start with the land. We don't include land gains in our core AFFO and our guidance was on core AFFO. So, I would tell you that the margins we experienced on a land sale gains in \u201913 is probably what we would expect going into \u201914 but we don't include that in our guidance. Then from -- I\u2019m sorry what was the first question, Dave?","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Preferred redemption.","Mark Denien","Well, preferred redemptions, yeah, we always looking at that. We know it\u2019s out there and it\u2019s fairly costly, but at the same time it\u2019s a source of capital that we don't have to redeem. I think a lot of that would come down to what are our other opportunities. And right now being a net disposer of call it $500 million give or take, $500 million development pipeline, that\u2019s the good way to fund that in the short-term.","Denny Oklak","Yeah. I guess, Dave, just to be clear. Our guidance does not include any preferred redemptions.","Mark Denien","Yeah. It does not include that, correct.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","All right. The next question comes from the line of Josh Attie. Please go ahead.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just going back to the question on guidance, it seems like more details and kind of asset sales and capitalized interest assumptions could be helpful. Can you tell us at the mid-point of guidance, what are you assuming for capitalized interest and how does this compared to the 2013 number?","Mark Denien","Yeah. Josh, I mean, it\u2019s maybe just a tip higher than 2013 but less than a penny. Like Denny said, our overall development pipeline on average in 14 is going to be about same levels of 13, because all these starts we started late in \u201813 our industrial project, you turn a lot quicker, the bill times a lot quicker than the office name will be. So we have a higher development pipeline going into 2014 than when we likely will come in out of \u201814. So on average it\u2019s not a big difference.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","And also on capitalized G&A?","Mark Denien","Capitalized G&A, I mean, you could probably look at it like this. Our overhead assumptions are pretty flat from \u201813 to \u201814 and our G&A guidance is, well, if I remember, our midpoint maybe down a million or two, so that\u2019s probably the difference in capitalized G&A give or take.","Denny Oklak","Yeah. I guess, I would add on the capitalization side, especially when you have a very highly pre-leased development portfolio, the capitalization is really at a very low, low end because you don\u2019t capitalize anything once the building, the shell building is down and goes in service. So I think our capitalization numbers are probably, as well as, they would be in our history is with this type of development pipeline.","Mark Denien","Yeah. That\u2019s right.","Denny Oklak","And then\u2026","Josh Attie - Citigroup","And so.","Denny Oklak","The other question was on disposition timing, is that correct.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Yeah. Maybe if you could just, it sounds like capitalized G&A and capitalized interest are maybe a little bit of benefit in 2014, but not a large benefit that\u2019s the right way to think about it?","Mark Denien","Yeah. Definitely.","D","Absolutely.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay. And then on asset sales, at the midpoint of, can you just tell us kind of that the midpoint of guidance, what are you assuming for timing, does the midpoint of guidance assume that they close midyear, the midpoint assume back half of the year, first half of the year?","Denny Oklak","I guess, what I would say is, it's probably weighted slightly to maybe the first four months of the year. In other words maybe first four months of the year includes 35% to 40% of the dispositions roughly because, I think, we\u2019ve got a couple bigger ones that are carrying over potentially plus might that we would be marketing earlier. But again it\u2019s -- there isn\u2019t any big lump in it, I guess, Josh, it\u2019s fairly evenly spread throughout the year.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","And the cap rate that we should think about the average cap rate.","Denny Oklak","Well, again, I hate throwing this out because the mix of these things very so much, but like, I suppose you guys aren\u2019t going to quit until I took that kind of number out there. So, again, its primarily suburban office properties in various geographical locations, various quality, I think if we put out in place cap rate on NOI and probably the 7.5% to 8% range is probably about where we are and we -- than we think that definitely make sense when you look at this specific assets that we\u2019re looking at so on this year.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I heard your remarks said, the increased development spending this year will be funded mainly through asset sales, which implies that you won't need any new equity to fund your growth. But you also highlighted in the press release and on call that you are very happy with kind of where your debt-to-EBITA and your fixed charge coverage ratios are kind of shaking out? And I guess, I just want to ask, to the extent that there was timing lags between asset sales and when some development comes online, are you comfortable with some of those metrics moving around a bit and your comfortable funding the pipeline entirely with asset sales and not raising new equity.","Mark Denien","Yeah. Josh, I think we are and like Denny said, there will be some timing differences. But I think it will probably work in our favor from the balance sheet perspective because like Denny mentioned, probably a little bit more front-end loaded on the dispositions and a little bit more backend loaded on the deliveries and the spend.","So, like I say, keep in mind, a lot of the deliveries that are going to hit us in Q1 and Q2 is already on our balance sheet from the debt perspective. So we immediately get the EBITDA today goes in service, I think that\u2019s disconnect.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay. It sound like.","Mark Denien","And there could be some timing, you are right, but I don't think it's going to be a negative.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay.","Denny Oklak","Well -- the significant, I mean when you are, with the size of company that we have just the timing of building and putting in service and selling and paying down just doesn't have that significant effect on those measure ratios.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay. So it sounds like where the balance sheet is today and kind of what your growth plans are that you don't need new equity if for 2014 to fund what you want to do?","Denny Oklak","That\u2019s correct.","Josh Attie - Citigroup","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good afternoon. Mark, the same store NOI growth guidance that you gave. Just -- I\u2019m sorry, is that cash gap or is that two to four is that for both?","Mark Denien","That\u2019s cash Brendan. We don\u2019t -- we\u2019ve not disclosed GAAP.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Okay.","Mark Denien","We\u2019re probably not a lot different but it is a cash number.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","So just kind of Big picture I guess I look at it, you\u2019ve got 70 basis points of occupancy growth that's probably about 100 basis point of same store NOI, kind of year-over-year but at the midpoint, the remaining 200 basis point is that, kind of just in place bumps and maybe a little bit of positive spread?","Mark Denien","Yes, both. Hopefully it\u2019s more than a little bit of positive spread.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Okay. Okay -- that\u2019s help. So I guess the bigger question is do you think given that your occupancy is now at what I would characterizes is pretty stabilized levels. Do you do think two to four is sustainable beyond 2014. That\u2019s a reasonable run rate or do you feel like that\u2019s a little bit higher than average because you\u2019ve got a little bit of occupancy pickup this year?","Mark Denien","No, I think its sustainable specially on the cash basis, Brendan, I mean one of big differences at least in our industrial portfolio from say five years ago is the fact that we now over the last two to three years have really done good job of building in 2% to 2.5% ramp up and all the deals that we have, which was really not terrified 5 to 6 years ago. So as we continue to build those bumps in on top of the going in increase sale on. And I think it is a sustainable number.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Okay, okay that\u2019s helpful.","Jim Connor","Brendan.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Yeah go ahead.","Jim Connor","Add one thing to that because even on occupancy, we think we\u2019ve got a little bit more in the industrial. You have typically the bulk portfolio. When the market start, we can run it 96 you know maybe a little bit about that and we\u2019re just below that now. But also I think you can\u2019t forget about our -- it's driven office portfolio. Even though, we\u2019ve had some nice improvement over the last 12 to 18 months that\u2019s still below 88% leased.","And again that portfolio we typically run in the low -- at least in the low 90s. And so I think we\u2019ve definitely got some -- some occupancy growth in that suburban office portfolio hopefully as we, look out over the next 12 to 24 months.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Yeah. Okay now that\u2019s helpful and Denny on that, it sounds like if you do $500 million to $700 million of disposition. There is probably, if I look at your retail portfolio, I don\u2019t know exactly what it's worth let say 150 to 200. So you probably have somewhere around $400 million to $500 million of disposition on suburban office in the plan for \u201814. Given that you reduced to that percentage down to 25% of your total. What\u2019s kind of left in and is it geographic regions that are just picking off some of the non-core stuff and then how should we think about the suburban office portfolio over the next several years. So they continued to get little down even after 14.","Denny Oklak","Well I guess lets start up with what we have left and I\u2019ll make some comments and Jim can chime in on what I\u2019m not thinking. But it\u2019s oppose the Blackstone sales that we\u2019ve completed now about two to three years ago. You\u2019ve got -- we exited completely and most a number of market. So the suburban office portfolio is really concentrated in just a few markets today. And give you the major ones, it would be South Florida, Raleigh, Indianapolis and Cincinnati, St. Louis and DC. But DC is mostly joint venture.","So that\u2019s not significant and a little bit national. So those -- my office -- our office portfolio investments is concentrated in those markets. Quite obviously those markets are all doing very well. As I mentioned, I think in the remarks four of those markets are we\u2019re in the 92% to 95% lease range.","Activity is strong in several of those markets. Aand yeah I think what you'll see, there's there are some, I\u2019ll call maybe larger non-strategic assets in that portfolio that we look to down size similar to what we did last year when we sold Cap Trust in Raleigh. We still -- I think there\u2019s some additional assets we looked through in a couple of the Midwest markets like Cincinnati and St. Louis.","So -- but then as you know, we started two nice development projects in Raleigh last year and we started one on some land in Dallas. So I think what you'll see is to continue including that portfolio. Generally speaking again I think cap rates are going to be better, be lower on the stuff that we sell, go forward and some one to stop we sold over the last two to fours years. And I think you\u2019ll see us do selected developments on some of that land we own. So trending down probably in the overall percentage, but I wouldn't sit here and say there is any major moves from like 25 to 15 or anything like that.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Okay. That's helpful. I got two more quick ones if I can. Mark, you guys mentioned that you monetized $66 million of land in the quarter, but it looked like your land balance went up by $10 million or so. I know you took on the stuff in New Jersey. I think that was maybe around $30 million or so, but what makes up the difference and why did the land balance go up?","","Mark Denien","Yeah. So we did take on the joint venture land and the way you got to look it at because it came on our balance sheet and we brought out our partner. The whole amount came on the balance sheet and moved. I think the $66 million, Brendan, was for the full year, not the quarter of the land for development that was monetized. We did have a total of $110 million of reductions in land, $60 some million went into development, we sold $50 million.","Earlier in the third quarter, we had acquired some land in Houston to do a development project, so we immediately took down. So you can't look at the balance sheet from 12\/31\/12 to 12\/31\/13 and see the $110 million coming out, because we did actually acquire some land on top of that.","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","","Okay. That's helpful. Let\u2019s give it at 100% on the JV I didn\u2019t calculate that in. Last question, you guys done a nice job growing the AFFO. You've also done a nice job bringing your leverage where it needs to be. Your payout ratio now on the dividend is pretty low relatively to where your AFFO is. When do you revisit the dividend level?","","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we\u2019ve been watching it. I think you'll probably see us going forward and we\u2019ve been very conservative on the dividend payout ratio. We spent too many years during the downturn with that percentage be in over a 100 to ever want to go back there again. And so we've really been pretty conservative on rate raising the dividend.","But clearly, I think now with the repositioning substantially done with business getting better with our ability to grow the company through the new development process again on and monetizing this land by putting it into service. I think that's clearly something we'll continue to monitor on a very regular basis as to whether we want to look at increasing it.","","Brendan Maiorana - Wells Fargo","Okay. All right. Thank you.","","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato. Please go ahead.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. Good afternoon. Jim, I think you mentioned that build-to-suit industrial developments, we are getting a 150 basis points spread over acquisition cap rates. I was wondering, what that spread has been historically for you guys?","","Denny Oklak","","You mean by historically like?","","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Like over the last ","","Denny Oklak","20 years?","","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Yes, yes.","","Denny Oklak","Well, I would tell you that it's probably been thinner. But that was as a result of a lot more spec space in the market. I think we could all remember back in the mid-2000s, when there was a lot more spec space available and that was putting some pressure on pricing, which was affecting the yields. But as we said earlier and we talked about some of the numbers, we feel very comfortable that these markets are in balance.","So we're not seeing that same pricing pressure. And a lot of the deals that we're doing, a lot of these big deals, there isn\u2019t spec space available. I mean, you look at the 500,000 plus deals, you can\u2019t go to a lot of markets and find spec space available. So a lot of our corporate institutional clients are forced to turn to build-to-suits and that's obviously a good thing for us.","","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And so to kind of further that thought, if the build-to-suit spreads are healthy for you guys and then presumably for others, why isn't there more development capital going to build-to-suits in the market that is?","","Denny Oklak","Well, because we're getting them all. Well, I think we're seeing other build-to-suits too. But one of the keys I would add on this Paul on the build-to-suit business is having the right land positions. And we've always been very good in owning the right industrial land positions in the key markets. And really when you look at the deals that we did last year, substantially all of them -- I will say a 100% because I\u2019m sure I have missed one or two in there, but it\u2019s substantially all of them.","We're on our land. Like for example, Amazon or Chesapeake Commerce Center at Baltimore. Jim mentioned the two big ones we did at our AllPoints Midwest in Indianapolis. The deal we did in Minneapolis in the fourth quarter was on land that we've owned. So you really tell, one of the keys is having the land position and having the teams in place to deliver that build-to-suit.","","Jim Connor","Well, that was going to be my point. If you look at the spec development across the country, we're doing a little bit and our peers are doing so. Some are doing a little bit more than others, but spec development is predominantly done by local merchant builders who tie up the site, go out and secure the necessary equity and go out and get financing, build the building, hope to lease it up and sell it and make a marble of spread. They're not in a really good competitive position to chase build-to-suits, because they don't necessarily own the land and they don't have the financing and everything tied up whereas we've got the land fully entitled.","We've got the construction leasing and development people in place and we don't have any financing contingency. So we're really much better positioned, particularly when you look at these large transactions, which we've been adding at just a bunch of into our portfolio. Local merchant builders find it hard to raise necessary capital to go out and do a million square foot build-to-suit for some of these big clients that we're doing with. Those are anywhere from $50 million plus to $80 million and they don't have the resources necessary.","Paul Adornato - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","","Denny Oklak","Thanks Paul.","Operator","All right. Next question come from the line of [Aaron Isakson].","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good afternoon guys. Quick question on the land value, you guys have about $790 million land on your balance sheet currently. If you had to mark that to market today, what do you think that value would go to?","","Denny Oklak","Well, it's going to vary, Aaron. But I guess when you think back over the last few years that market value is kind of varied. It\u2019s been a little bit of a rollercoaster ride. But when I think -- when we start looking at it today, clearly, all that land, the values at or above are carrying value today.","I think in a lot of situations -- in certain situations, a lot of our industrial lands probably were 25% more than we're carrying it at. And even if you just look at some of the sales that we've done, which is not necessarily from quarterly end, but it\u2019s still land as Mark said, we have what a, 10% to 15% profit margin on that 15% to 20%. So, I definitely think you could -- a very conservative number will be 10% to 15% value above the carrying value today.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay. And then you mentioned on your range of estimates, lands sale proceeds expected in '13. I would expect that does not include the land you plan to develop on?","","Denny Oklak","That's correct, yes.","Unidentified Analyst","","How much land do you think you'll monetize in development in 2014?","","Denny Oklak","Yeah, I mean we've been running it. We went back and look there on about 10 to 15 year average between sales and development, monetizing about a $100 million a year and certainly some years are higher and lower than others. But not coincidently if you look at 2013 in total, we monetized about $110 million.","And I think that's probably pretty good going into '14 as well, that's combined land sales and development. So you got, call it $40 million, $50 million in our guidance for land sales and then that would lead to $60 million or so of development to get to monetize.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Denny Oklak","Thanks, Aaron.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Thank you for taking the call. Just a couple of questions on the build-to-suits. Annual tenants from your -- are they exiting out of any buildings in your existing portfolio? I'm guessing Amazon is obviously not, but what about the others?","","Denny Oklak","No, no. None.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Terrific. Mark, can you remind us under build-to-suit for Amazon and the economics that's around that in terms of customary improvements that Amazon likes to have installed into a new development?","","Mark Denien","Yeah, Eric. We in our development pipeline, they have a right to basically pay for the, what I call the above standard improvements either upfront or over the lease term. If they chose a lease term, it\u2019s obviously part of the lease term is that are charged to them and it ends up at a higher return. We closed the lower return, because our assumption is that they are going to pay that off early.","So if you look at the development cost in our pipeline, it\u2019s got the costs in there to build the building with the higher above standard. But the yield is the lower yield is that they're going to pay that themselves. Did I answer the question?","","Denny Oklak","Let me just add to that. I guess, I would say it\u2019s box mixed to us because if we funded, their payments are returned on over the term of the lease that is I will say roughly comparable to yield that we are getting on the project and if they pay it off, you know they pay it off and we just take it, redeploy back into the next development. So it\u2019s in the initial numbers but it really hasn\u2019t -- we do not view it as having any real effect to us.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I think the concern is just to make sure that investors aren\u2019t capitalizing above market rent when they are trying to value the portfolio when its completed, so that\u2019s just what I am getting at\u2026","Denny Oklak","That\u2019s what I -- that's why I wanted to say what I said because I think the way we are reporting it, it won\u2019t matter.","Jim Connor","Yes because we are reporting the lower yield and the lower NOI, that\u2019s right.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. So when it\u2019s completed, will that -- we'll take a loan receivable in the above market portion that we are in?","Jim Connor","It is essentially exactly what it is, yes.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Great. Just the next question on the New Jersey development, could you disclose what amount you have actually paid your partner for the industrial land? Was it at the original value that you allocated to at the purchase or is it something different?","Mark Denien","Our partner wanted us to actually market that land and we marketed that land and got a fair value for it. But I think as I recall, I mean it was roughly equal to our original purchase price, the fair value. I can\u2019t remember exactly but there wasn\u2019t a material difference between the original purchase price of the joint venture paid and what we have paid them for their half when all was said and done, is that your question, Eric?","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Well, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fair enough. I think and then just a quick question on the medical office portfolio. As I recall, I think you guys expected there will be -- get about $250 million in proceeds. So is it just a reminder that the future buyer is going to close on in the next month or so?","Denny Oklak","Yes. As a matter of fact, we have mentioned in the call -- in the script that we already closed 60 million all but one building was in that number. There is one other building that are hospital actually healthcare system, actually exercise their option and that probably because of some of ways -- they are right at first half that was probably one close till some time in February but everything else is closed.","Eric Frankel - Green Street Advisors","Okay. Great. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was suburban office or medical office. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon guys. Most of my questions have been answered, just had a couple of quick follow ups here. The 2% to 4% of total portfolio, can you break it out just because obviously you have got a little bit better growth potential, the occupancy on the suburban office like can you kind break out what\u2019s your expectations are for the industrial portfolio?","Jim Connor","Yes Michael, It\u2019s last I said earlier on. I remembered who asked the question, really, it\u2019s really a similar growth. So we are looking at 2% to 4% for really each product type. On the industrial, I would tell you that let just pick a mid point and say you are 3%, about 1% of that 3% will likely come from occupancy like Denny said.","We still do believe we have some occupancy upside with the remaining amounts coming from rental rate bumps already in existing leases coupled with, we reported a 5% renewal rental rate growth in the fourth quarter. We expect that\u2019s trend to do nothing but to give better as we head into 2014. So if you are -- say 3% mid-point on industrial, you got 1% of occupancy and call it 2% on rent, give or take. Does that help?","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Second question just looking at kind of releasing trends for \u201814, if you look at the portfolio today, where is kind of the mark-to-market on the industrial portfolio. What I am really trying to get is what kind of acceleration should we expect in terms of releasing spreads in \u201914. We had good momentum in the back half of the year, just wonder if you expect that to continue to acelate in \u201814?","Jim Connor","Yes, the shorter answer is yes. We absolutely anticipate the same kind of performance. We have done some internal analysis and marking, help me with some of the numbers. But we\u2019ve gone back and looked at the role in our industrial portfolio which again is a little below normal which we think is by and large a good thing. But we have looked at the percentage of that role where the original lease that is in place was done back in the last five years of really a tough market. And help me between 2009 and 2011?","Mark Denien","Yes.","Jim Connor","Between 2009 and 2011 about 45% of the leases that are -- 45% of the leases that are rolling in \u201814 were signed between 2009, 2011.","Mark Denien","Right.","Jim Connor","You know either the peak of the downturn or still in the recession period, I would call it. So on that 45%, its rolling in that lease period. We certainly expect significant rental rate bumps.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Then the final part, just going back to our pervious question. Several of your peers have been more aggressive in taking down leverage. As you continue to sale down some of the suburban assets here, you are picking up really good cash flow because as to your point, its not necessarily FFO derivative. Why not be a bit more aggressive in selling some of suburban office assets given the execution that you had in the fourth quarter and first quarter and may be using a take up prefers or take down leverage a bit more just -- while fundamentals are good right now?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think we have a pretty aggressive disposition plan. I mean when you think we did about $877 million last year, we are talking still pretty significant number this year. I think we are more just very comfortable with where we are.","So one think I will comment on leverage though. And Mark can chime in here. Our leverages even without selling and redeeming preferred or paying down further debs et cetera. Our leverage metrics are going to get much-much better because of this development pipeline and the way we funded it and our coverage ratios will continue to improve. So we \u2013 you will still see fairly sizable. I will call it deleveraging because our numbers get better during the year.","Mark Denien","I mean, I agree with that Denny, I mean, especially the coverage metrics with deleverage profile.","Denny Oklak","Yes. Yes.","Mark Denien","You may not see as much movement in debt process and some things like that. But from a coverage perspective, they should improve significantly.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","And in the same sense, quite a bit of higher coupon debt relative to where you could issue in the market today, given the compression. They pulled back we\u2019ve seen as of late in interest rates any impetus to may be I\u2019ll little dip more active, more active and kind of pre-addressing some of the damage you have next couple of years?","Mark Denien","Yes I mean Michael, we really only have -- you go out -- you got to out the February of \u201815 before you really have anything of significance coming. We have $250 million to there and we did the transaction that I talked about earlier in December and we paid $8 million premium to take out debt about eight months early but then of that $8 million, we get about $3 million back immediately in the seven month period and interest saving.","So net-net it costs us about $5 million, so not too significant all in we like to rate. But the further out you go it gets pretty punitive to do those deal. So we are constantly looking at it but just really taking another interest rate bet and we believe interest rates are going to be rising but at the same time when you factor that premium in and look at it on an all in basis, it gets pretty costly.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. I appreciate the color guys. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. Just a quick follow up. Your new rates on lease rollovers is really based on just purely renewals like it hasn\u2019t been for a very long time. I was wondering if you could provide some data on what your rollover rate was for new leases.","Mark Denien","Well again the reason we haven\u2019t done that in the past is that a lot -- most of the time or lot of time, you don\u2019t release the same space. So it just gets confusing to do that. You know you get a look at, it goes confusing when you look at how much tenant improvement money you put in versus what the rates are.","So we always thought that the most accurate and reflective rate calculation of what\u2019s really going on in the market is what we are able to do on renewals because generally your TIs are very well on renewals and I think particularly on the industrial side. And we think that\u2019s a good market reflective as we have and that\u2019s why we used that. So we up until this time anyway haven\u2019t even really calculated that other number.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","So you basically do not track the estimate, your systems will basically track that status, that is what you are saying?","Mark Denien","Yes because as we go space by space and its just harder to track.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time, please continue.","Denny Oklak","Yes, I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you during the year at industry conferences as well as hoping to get more of you at -- visit our regional markets.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you, Hart. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, President and CEO; and Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we refer you to our December 31, 2015, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now, for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor.","Jim Connor","Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start out with an update on the overall business environment and then transition into our third quarter results. Nationally, the industrial market\u2019s momentum continues to be very strong. Demand outpaced supply for the 25th straight quarter. New supply in substantially all markets is in balance and demand for modern bulk space year-to-date continues to beat everybody\u2019s expectations. Net absorption for the third quarter was 77 million square feet, that\u2019s the most since the fourth quarter of 2005. Although 40% of this absorption was in five of our markets, those markets include Southern California, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, and Pennsylvania.","On the supply side, new supply in the third quarter totaled 53 million square feet, the most since the fourth quarter of 2008, yet speculative deliveries were down 15% from the previous quarter. The net result was another 20 basis point drop in the overall vacancy nationwide to approximately 5%, just from a historical perspective, the tenure average is about 8% and the recession was about 10%. These positive fundamentals continue to drive strong rent growth, 40% of all markets nationally are expected to post double-digit rent growth in 2016.","As we\u2019ve stated on previous calls, demand has been broad based even in the relatively slow 2% GDP growth environment. Containerized traffic flow, transportation industries and consumer confidence all trending in a positive direction with regard to demand for industrial product. We\u2019re seeing similar strength in our own portfolio with the completion of 4.4 million square feet of leasing for the quarter, which drove our in-service occupancy to 97.3%, a 60 basis point increase from the second quarter, which achieved another record high occupancy in the company\u2019s history. Rents on new and renewal leases for the quarter grew by 19%, reflecting continued strong supply demand fundamentals and our solid pricing power.","A particular note was our continued success in leasing recently completed speculative projects. One notable transaction executed during the third quarter was a 615,000 square foot lease, for 100% of the space in our speculative project at our Camp Creek Business Center in Atlanta. This lease was signed by a major consumer products company for a term of 10 years. Overall, demand for space continue to be strong from traditional customers of industrial distribution space and of course the powerful direct and indirect demand forces of e-commerce. We believe our platform is in a very strong position to continue to capture this growth.","The strong supply demand dynamics help contribute to same property NOI growth with 12 months and three months ended September 30, 2016 at 5.1% and 5.7% respectively. On the development side of the business, momentum continues to be very strong, as I\u2019ve alluded to in the last few calls. During the third quarter, we generated a $183 million of starts across six industrial projects and two medical office projects, in aggregate totaling 3 million square feet and about 50% pre-leased.","The industrial development projects were spread across markets such as Chicago, Baltimore, Tampa, Indianapolis and Savannah. Many of you may recall hearing about the Savannah project was in the news recently. The 1.4 million square feet build-to-suit with a national retailer Floor & Decor was for a lease term of 15 years. On medical office side, we started 200% pre-leased projects in Raleigh and Dallas totaling 72,000 square feet. Both transactions were with existing healthcare system clients of ours and both were for lease terms of 15 years.","I\u2019m also pleased to share with you that we have started three fully leased build-to-suit industrial projects after quarter end in early October with an expected cost of $113 million and an aggregate totaling nearly 1 million square feet. These deals were all executed with major brand name tenants. They were all executed on our land. These October starts are consistent with our increased 2016 guidance for development starts, which I\u2019ll expand on momentarily.","We\u2019ve continued to see strong activity in our development pipeline, and our confident will close at 2016 in strong fashion, and are optimistic about 2017 as of today. Our overall development pipeline at quarter end has 21 projects under construction, totaling 7.2 million square feet and a projected $575 million in stabilized cost at our share. We\u2019re 58% pre-leased in the aggregate.","We\u2019ll continue to closely manage pre-leasing levels on new development start opportunities, as noted numerous times in the past. While our company has an excellent track record in competing for build-to-suit projects, we\u2019ll also continue to strategically allocate capital to speculative developments. In fact since the fourth quarter of 2014, we delivered 24 spec industrial projects that were initially 14% pre-leased. These projects are now 85% leased with strong prospects for the remaining space. Margins on the pipeline are expected to continue in the 20% range. We believe our strategy will continue to represent a solid risk-adjusted value creation engine for our shareholders.","Turning to dispositions, we closed $227 million of transactions during the quarter at an overall average in-place cap rate of 7.4%. The largest component of these dispositions was the sale of an eight-building 1.2 million square foot office part in Indianapolis that included our corporate headquarters facility. I know there are notable dispositions that I alluded to on our last call with the closing of the user sale on the 936,000 square feet speculative industrial building in Indianapolis that had been placed in service, but was yet unleased. A few other notes on this industrial sale, first we sold this building for more than 20% gain to a major retailer for its dedicated Midwestern regional e-commerce facility.","If we exclude this sale from our third quarter dispositions, the reported aggregate in-place cap rate would be 8.2%. For the remainder of the year, we expect $140 million to $260 million of dispositions, reflecting a small reduction in the previous midpoint of our guidance, part of this reduced guidance relates to an office part sale in Indianapolis that we had to put on hold until after an M&A transaction involving the primary tenant in the park is completed late in 2016 or early 2017.","In addition, there were a few other assets that we expect to close late in the year, but could ultimately spill over into the first quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the year and we\u2019re still progressing towards our target of completely exiting the suburban office business by year end or shortly thereafter. Even with these dispositions, we continue to be confident in our ability to growth our AFFO just as we\u2019ve done for the last five years. With this continued steady AFFO growth outlook, and with what we believe is a very defensive portfolio to handle cyclicality. We\u2019re very pleased to announce a 5.6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and the capital transactions for the quarter.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO per share was $0.31 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $0.30 per share for the second quarter of 2016, and $0.29 per share for the third quarter of 2015. The increase in core FFO per share is due to our continued improvement in key operating statistics that Jim just touched on, as well as lower interest expense that resulted from our deleveraging activities over the last several quarters. AFFO for the quarter totaled $103 million, which was a 7.6% increase from the $95 million in AFFO reported last quarter. Our high quality portfolio continues to produce positive AFFO growth and we\u2019re still comfortable with our original full year guidance of AFFO growth on a share adjusted basis of approximately 5%.","In the equity capital markets, we issued $3.7 million shares under our ATM program in August and September for net proceeds of $103 million at an average issue price of $28.07 per share. In considering our share price relative to net asset value, the increases in our development pipeline that Jim previously mentioned along with our growing list of future prospects, we determined that prudent to use our ATM pre-funds development.","We now raised all the capital necessary to fund the current pipeline as well as the next couple of quarter\u2019s works of expected development starts from a few others on our prospect list and have less than $80 million of debt maturities through 2017. Our recent de-levering transactions have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and resulted in ongoing reductions to interest expense. Along these lines, I\u2019m pleased to note that in early October, Fitch Ratings upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB to BBB plus with a stable outlook. All of these capital transactions coupled with our operational performance, resulted in improvements to our key financial metrics during the quarter. We expect to see further improvement during the remainder of the year resulting from disposition transactions and highly leased development properties being placed in service. This is reflected in our revised guidance.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Mark. In review of the year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of the year, yesterday we raised the low-end of guidance for core FFO by $0.02 per share, narrowing the 2016 range to $1.18 to $1.20 per share, and affectively raising the midpoint by $0.01. Given the strong outlook on our development pipeline, we raised the development guidance to a range of $650 million to $750 million, up $125 million from the previous midpoint. Also due to continued overall strong operating fundaments, we raised our same property NOI growth guidance from a range of 5.2% to 6%, up about 70 basis points from the previous midpoint.","Finally, given our capital recycling activities and recent debt pay downs, we changed the guidance for all three leverage metrics in a positive direction. We believe these improved leverage metrics put us firmly in position for a continued ratings upgrades in the near future. As noted in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, the full details on revisions to certain guidance factors can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website as well as on the back page of our quarterly supplemental. Let me reemphasize once again how proud we are to have the company repositioned with a rock solid balance sheet, a low AFFO payout ratio and positioned to support raising the regular quarterly common dividend by 5.6%.","Now, we\u2019ll open the lines up to the audience, and I would ask that participants keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions, and you are, of course, welcome to get back in the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kyle McGrady [Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.]. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open.","Kyle McGrady","I\u2019m going to get back in the queue, let me ask \u2013 let me get my ducks in a row, call on us in 15 minutes.","Jim Connor","Thank you, Kyle.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of [indiscernible]. You are open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Thanks, guys. Just a quick question, Page 22 of the sub, you reported growth in net effective rent slightly differently this quarter, where you wrapped up both the new and renewal leases for medical office and bulk industrial. What was the breakdown by those different property types for a growth in net effective rent for this quarter?","Mark Denien","Yeah, Tom, this is Mark. We in our effort can try to provide enhanced and better guidance for everybody. We\u2019ll admit we inadvertently kind of omitted that. So we\u2019ll work on this page for the future and get that back in. But I would tell you two things on that. The medical office piece is just a small piece of the overall pie. It really doesn\u2019t move the needle. So if you look, for example, the third quarter number of 19.3% that\u2019s right about what the bulk was. We only had just a few thousand square feet, 23,000 square feet of medical deals signed in the quarter compared to 2 million square feet on the industrial side. So the medical is just not moving that overall numbers. So the overall numbers pretty closely industrial, I would tell you the medical is probably slightly lower than that and it was just a mix, but nothing now the ordinary there.","Unidentified Analyst","Completely fair. And then just one more quick one from me. Acquisition guide was bumped up for the full year. This is kind of bucking trends we\u2019ve seen from other companies in the sector, everyone else seems to be slightly taking down their acquisitions just based on pricing for core assets being still very strong. What was it about? What you guys see in the market right now that led you to bump up the acquisition guide?","Mark Denien","Yeah. We\u2019re probably seeing the same things most or overall. But I would tell you the reason, we have ours \u2013 that we raised it is really related to a joint venture transaction that we planned on executing here. So in some existing relationship we have, we already have a part ownership in these assets and we\u2019re just going to take our partner out this quarter. So that\u2019s where most of that fourth quarter activity is going to come from.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have the line of Manny Korchman [Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)]. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, Jim, if I go back to your comments on spec building, you said over the last couple of years, you\u2019ve done a bunch of projects. If I had to rank your confidence now in starting a new spec project today versus if we sat here two years ago, so in October 2014, where would you be more confident in getting a spec project off the ground?","Jim Connor","Well, I think, we\u2019d be more confident today, just given the surprisingly strong numbers that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date from both the demand and the supply side. I think it was particularly interesting that that spec deliveries in the quarter were actually down quarter-over-quarter by about 15%. And there has been some speculation that Fed has tighten the reigns a little bit on the money center and regional banks on construction lending, so that that was going to perhaps put a crimp in some of the local developers that were developing spec projects. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve really seen that come to pass. But I would tell you sitting here today, we\u2019re very confident given the track record we\u2019ve had in getting this space leased. And I think you see that by the fact that we announced four spec projects last quarter.","Manny Korchman","Great. And then Mark on that the \u2013 I guess the JV buyout, it sounds like that you\u2019re thinking about, what would sort of a cap rate be on that, is that pre-negotiated?","Mark Denien","Yeah. It\u2019s a pre-negotiated cap rate, Manny. I won\u2019t disclose it individually, but I would tell you that we believe it\u2019s a cap rates or it\u2019s in a yield, it\u2019s in excess of the cap rate. So we think that there is a \u2013 some good value there that we\u2019re buying.","Manny Korchman","So if we\u2019re just thinking about the modeling your total acquisition pool, where would that be now?","Mark Denien","Yeah. Total acquisition pool is probably going to be close to 7%, I would say.","Manny Korchman","That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Jim Connor","Yep. ","Mark Denien","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz [UBS Securities LLC]. Please go ahead, Jeremy. You\u2019re open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. I\u2019m just wondering your industrial occupancy is over 97%, so I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about this in terms of are you really pushing rents hard enough and then as we think about it going forward should we expect to see that occupancy actually start to tick down as you push around here?","Jim Connor","Well, Jeremy, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in a really interesting time. I would tell you that I see the final terms of all of the major deals that we\u2019re doing. And I would tell you, I\u2019m comfortable. I think that\u2019s backed up by 19% rent growth for the quarter. So, yeah, we\u2019re comfortable where it is. I think it\u2019s a reasonable to expect that that\u2019s going to come down. I think we could come down 100 basis points and we\u2019d still be in a very, very good spot.","I don\u2019t anticipate that that\u2019s going to happen, because given the volume of leasing that we\u2019re seeing out there. I just think it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019ll have an off quarter or two, where we\u2019ll bring a bunch of spec projects in, that aren\u2019t substantially pre-leased. And I think we\u2019re seeing great renewal activity in our portfolio. So, we\u2019re not anticipating getting any major vacancies backed this year or early next year that we can handle with our normal leasing volume.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then just one on the development front, you mentioned the strong build-to-suit pipeline. I was just wondering is there anything in particular that\u2019s driving that increased activity and then maybe can you talk about what markets those opportunities are really coming in, is that how much of it is maybe e-commerce related?","Jim Connor","E-com \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second question first, Jeremy. E-commerce continues to be a very big driver of our business both on the leasing and on the development side. And you just think about it logically, we positioned the company, particularly the industrial portfolio, focused on the modern large bulk products and that\u2019s what e-commerce users need today. With the exception of some of the smaller infill last mile, which we\u2019re doing a little bit of most of the fulfillment centers today we\u2019re looking at are 800 square feet to 1.2 million square feet that brand new state-of-the-art 36 foot and 40 foot clear and that\u2019s really in our sweet spot. So, we\u2019ll continue to do a lot of business with the e-commerce companies and they will continue to be a great driver of our business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Muller. Please go ahead. You are open.","Mike Mueller","Hi, quick question. On your GAAP rent spreads, they\u2019re running at about two times the 2015 level. And I was wondering in terms of the drivers of the increase from the nine to ten to the high-teens now, would you say it\u2019s primarily higher rate driving it or other dynamics and lease terms changing such as you\u2019re getting bigger bumps longer term. I was just wondering can you give us a little more background on that?","Mark Denien","Yeah, I would tell you it\u2019s really all the above. It\u2019s just overall better quality leases. We\u2019re getting as good or better bumps, we\u2019re getting better starting rents. It\u2019s really all the above. It\u2019s not really lease vintage driven, if you will. We\u2019re doing about a third of the leases right now that are rolling or what I consider to be in the trough period. That\u2019s about the same percentage we were running at last year.","The overall amount of leases rolling are getting smaller, because their overall expiration schedule is pretty light. But as far as the percentage of the leases rolling, the vintage of them are pretty consistent from 2015 to 2016. So, that doubled the increase, if you will, and that net effective rent growth is really just overall rent growth that we are driving, whether it be starting rent, or rent bumps, or truly all the above.","Jim Connor","Yeah, Mike, the only point I would add to that is and you touched on it in your question as lease term. Two things, the more really large deals we do, always tend to have longer terms, 10-year and 15-year lease terms. So that clearly helps there. The other side of it is with our portfolio is well leased as it is, we are doing very, very few short-term leases.","Historically, it\u2019s not uncommon to get a tenant to come to us and say, I\u2019m just not really sure what my business is going to do, I want to renew for 12 months or I want to renew for 18 months. And the truth is, we\u2019re not doing very many of those leases. Today, kind of the short-term for us is three years and we\u2019re really looking a lot of tenants up for the longer term, while we\u2019ve got some leverage, so we can push rents and escalation.","So, I think it\u2019s all of those things but that\u2019s one point I wanted to add.","Mike Mueller","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you. I guess starting with the guidance, can you talk about \u2013 you did some delevering activity, so like if you would just move your guidance on your, kind of core operations, how much you would have increased it and then what was the drag from some of the deleveraging you did?","Mark Denien","Jamie, you mean the drag on earnings from delevering?","Jamie Feldman","Yeah.","Mark Denien","I would say that really nothing in what we reported. There maybe a little drag in the fourth quarter, because we\u2019re sitting on cash in October until we can get that redeployed in the bonds that we bought back just last week in our development pipeline. So you may be looking at a penny drag in the fourth quarter, but it really didn\u2019t have any impact on the numbers we reported, nor would I say it would have an impact as we look forward to next year because it will all be fully redeployed by then.","And then as far as the leverage metrics that we are at, I would tell you that they\u2019re a little bit low because of raising the capital that we did in the third quarter to prefund. So, as an example, that debt-to-EBITDA number really close to 5.0. As we look out in the 2017, we\u2019ll probably be closer into the mid-5s. We won\u2019t need to raise any additional capital to fund all of this that I \u2013 like I talked about. So that leverage metrics will naturally move up closer to the mid-5s.","But I would also point out that without any additional delivering, fixed charge will continue to get better because we have high coupon debt that continues to burn off. So, fixed charge will get better and debt-to-EBITDA will be kind of in the mid-5s.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then, I guess as you think about next year, big picture activity, like any big dispositions you think we might do, like how you guys are thinking about MLP now? I\u2019m just turing to think about, I mean your core seems like it\u2019s improving, but what are the noise might we see next year? Do you guys continue to make some changes to the business to the balancesheet?","Mark Denien","Well, Jamie, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re, at this point in the year, we are not planning to create any additional noise next year. I think the bulk of the heavy lifting will be done. I think we\u2019ve really positioned the company to grow. And I think that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on as we start to look forward to 2017.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we have a line of Sumit Sharma. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open.","Sumit Sharma","Thank you. So thanks for the commentary and all of the disclosure and commentary this quarter. I see that the GAAP rents, but it\u2019s had me confused too, but Ron was instrumental in clearing that up.","But I guess it sounds like NOI\u2019s growth is accelerating into fourth quarter, which is great and this may be an early indicator that 2017 could look a lot like 2016, maybe get some comments on that. But more importantly as a owner and manager of industrial real estate, I guess where are you guys most cautious, because if you think about the investor mindset, they\u2019re all trying to say, we\u2019re all trying to figure out well, this is little too good.","Jim Connor","No, guys, it\u2019s not too good. You know, it\u2019s good, you should enjoy it.","Well, let me take your first question about 2017. Sitting here, kind of towards the end of October, I would tell you we feel fairly optimistic about 2017. There is nothing in the macro drivers of the industrial business, so called storm clouds on the horizon that would really give you pause. We\u2019ve been in a slow growth market, but that\u2019s been really good for the industrial business. Consumer confidence is still up, although as I referenced earlier in my earlier comments the transportation indices are a little inconsistent, but by and large, they are all reasonably positive. I think we look at the, particularly the supply and demand equilibrium in the marketplace.","I think that we\u2019ve had a fundamental change in the industrial business that is here for the foreseeable future, which is e-commerce. And if you look at the pace at which e-commerce is growing and the amount of space they need to support that business and most of that is in the form of new big boxes. I think we\u2019re positioned very, very well for the future.","In terms of what worries us in the future, I would tell you it\u2019s not the U.S. and it\u2019s not real estate. I think you got to go global macro to anticipate anything that could really put the U.S. economy in a bad spot or have some really negative trickle over into our market right now. But thankfully we don\u2019t see that right now. So we\u2019re fairly optimistic.","Sumit Sharma","Thank you so much. If I may just ask one follow-up to that, I mean, if you were just thinking about it from \u2013 like you mentioned bulk distribution, in fact you categorized your industrial portfolio as a bulk distribution portfolio. What if in 2018 or going into 2019, it\u2019s not about the bulk and it\u2019s more about such a smaller, closer to last mile in-fill kind of assets. How are you prepping for that, how are you\u2019re getting into new markets, any commentary on that?","Jim Connor","Sure. I\u2019ll give you a couple of data points. First of all, that\u2019s a business we are in and we have been in for many years. And it probably doesn\u2019t get talked about enough and that\u2019s our fault. But Duke has a long track record of redevelopment, brownfield redevelopment, we\u2019ve done a number of these projects in major metropolitan areas all over the country. So we do that, we\u2019re doing business with some of our favorite e-commerce companies, and some of our transportation and 3PL companies right now. So, A, we are addressing that business.","The second point is the last mile, which has gotten a lot of attention our industry of late is really fairly small. If you look at and do research on Amazon, for example, They have about two million square feet of these last mile facilities. They average about 50,000 square feet or 60,000 square feet a piece, right. They have 70 million square feet, a fulfillment center. And you need the fulfillment centers to drive this huge volume, I mean this is a company that has 30% market share of the e-commerce business in the U.S., it is growing at 15% or 16% a year. They\u2019re not going to be able to keep up that growth by focusing on 50,000 square foot in-fill, that\u2019s just really small piece of the equation.","You look at the number of projects that they have in the pipeline, that are debated out there in the different public forum, they have twice as many of these major fulfillment centers, which average about one million square feet as compared to the number of the last mile. So, it\u2019s an important piece of their business and it\u2019s important piece of e-commerce going forward. But, quite candidly, it\u2019s just not going to move the needle.","Sumit Sharma","Fair enough. Thank you for your comments. We will continue the conversation at [indiscernible]. Thanks.","Operator","And, our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open.","Blaine Heck","Thanks. Good afternoon. So, I guess just back on the topic of acquisitions you guys have, the best balance sheet, you guys have had in a long time and there have been some pretty significant industrial portfolios on the market. So, if there was an opportunity to expand your presence in target markets with a substantial portfolio acquisition, would you guys consider it or do you think pricing is still at a place that might keep you from kind of chasing a deal like that?","Jim Connor","Blaine, if you got one, call me afterwards, we\u2019ll work on the deal. No, guys, the truth is we look at every deal that comes down the pipeline, every deal. And, the ones that we talked about in this last quarter, it\u2019s a combination of the quality of the portfolio, the location of the real estate and the pricing. And all the ones that we looked at, we passed on for a variety of reasons. If the right portfolio came along, if it was, particularly, if it was heavily weighted into the markets that we want to grow in, we know what a reasonable price is. I think we\u2019d certainly try and be willing to pay up for that. And given where our stock has been trading and our balance sheet, I think, our currency is strong and we\u2019ve got the ability to stretch. So when we find the right one, I think, we\u2019ll certainly be \u2013 we\u2019ll certainly try and make it happen. We just haven\u2019t found the right thing. And it\u2019s like you tell your kids, just because you got money in your pocket doesn\u2019t mean you got to go spend it.","Blaine Heck","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Mark, you guys have seen very strong same-store NOI performance over the past several quarters and looks like guidance implies another good one in the fourth quarter. It seems as though occupancy has been a big win at your back [indiscernible], but given that you guys announced 97.3%, it will be pretty hard to maintain the year-over-year increase.","So I guess, given where rent spreads are and where rent bumps are right now, what kind of level of the same-store NOI growth do you think you can achieve without kind of the benefit of increasing year-over-year occupancy?","Mark Denien","Yeah, Blaine, I mean, obviously we\u2019ll give a little bit better color on that again everyone to give our guidance for 2017. But I would tell you that if you just look at where we are today and where we think we\u2019re going to be closing out 2016, about half of our same-property growth is coming right now from rent bumps and rent growth on rollovers.","I think that is very sustainable as we look forward, because we\u2019ve got rent bumps filled into really all of our leases. I think we are very bullish in our ability to continue to drive rental rate growth on rollover. So that that half of what we get, or getting right now, I think we feel very comfortable about that going forward.","You\u2019re exactly right on the occupancy piece. If you look right now, the remaining half of that same property growth, a good chunk of that is occupancy related. And it is going to be tough to continue to drive occupancy up, and like Jim even mentioned, I think, if we were to bet something right now, we may bet that it may tick back just a little bit, at least early in the year, next year. So let\u2019s just call it out flat and then you got to look at just efficiencies in your portfolio and where you can drive those.","So that\u2019s a long-winded answer for San. I think, we\u2019re still very positive in our ability to drive same property growth, maybe not at today\u2019s level. But I will caveat all that by reminding everybody that we don\u2019t put properties in our same property pool, until they\u2019ve been in our population for 24 whole months. So we believe we have just as much NOI upside if you look at total NOI growth on all the properties that we\u2019ve delivered and are going to deliver in our development pipeline.","So I think that overall NOI growth can continuously look forward at about the same levels that we\u2019re driving today.","Blaine Heck","So can I push a little bit and ask whether it\u2019s kind of between two and three or three and four?","Mark Denien","I\u2019ll let you know in January, Blaine.","Blaine Heck","Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next, we have the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open.","Eric Frankel ","Thank you. Obviously, everything is in great shape and you\u2019re commenting on the demand picture or nationally and specifically, some of the biggest markets, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, Pennsylvania, and Southern California. Are you seeing any supply, any \u2013 I know, obviously supply and demand has been imbalanced for last couple of years, where demand has outpaced supply. So are you seeing any big supply issues on the horizon in those markets? I think, just in the local reports, we\u2019ve read over the last couple of weeks, we \u2013 I think, certainly in Chicago and Atlanta supply has picked up immensely. And I think it would, at the current development volumes, it would probably match with what demand has been in the last couple of quarters.","Jim Connor","Yeah. Eric, I would answer that in a couple of ways. We\u2019ve seen over the last few years, a handful of markets get, what I would call maybe slightly over built , and that the beauty of the markets today is how efficiently they are operating and you can look at, we\u2019ve talked about over the last number of quarters, we\u2019ve talked about Indianapolis, we\u2019ve talked about Houston, we\u2019ve talked about Columbus. And anytime those markets got slightly out of balance, all developers took their foot off the accelerator, we waited for demand to come back, which it has in all of those instances.","So, I think from a macro level, the market is operating very efficiently. Yeah, you look at some of the numbers, we were having the same conversation probably a year ago, about Dallas, when Dallas was pushing I don\u2019t know 25 million square feet of speculative.","Dallas is on track to do 20 million square feet of net absorption this year. So, Chicago and Atlanta have kind of joined that club, but they\u2019re both having really strong quarters of absorption and the amount of activity that we\u2019ve got is evidence by that 600,000 foot lease in our Camp Creek Park, is very, very strong. So, I don\u2019t see any, real warning clouds, there is a lot of activity out there to cover this spec development.","Eric Frankel ","Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. Switching to the build-to-suit side. I am not sure about the cost basis for what you, what you started this quarter. But what you just announced in terms of your three build-to-suit, starts in early October, I guess that comes down to roughly $113 per rentable square foot. Can you comment maybe on the nature of the leases that seems somewhat expensive for industrial.","Jim Connor","Yeah. There might be one of those in there, that\u2019s got a little bit higher basis and a little bit more in-fill specialty use to it. Obviously, it\u2019s early we can\u2019t give you specifics on each individual deal, I think we\u2019ll get into more specifics next quarter, when we announce everything, but there is one project there that\u2019s probably skewing the other two a little bit.","Eric Frankel ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kyle McGrady. Please go ahead. You\u2019re open.","Kyle McGrady","Great. Great. Hey, Jim if you guys marked \u2013 if you guys have answered this let me know, because I missed the first part of the call. But we noticed that the service operation expectations are declining while G&A is rising, anymore color on what\u2019s actually going on there?","Jim Connor","When you say...","Kyle McGrady","Page 32.","Jim Connor","I\u2019m sorry, John.","Kyle McGrady","What you have...","Jim Connor","32 as a couple of\u2026","Kyle McGrady","Service operations essentially was...","Jim Connor","So, let me try that John. I think tried nowhere you\u2019re going here. So, if you look \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about from 2015 to 2016 levels, not revised guidance, right, I assume that\u2019s what you mean.","Kyle McGrady","Yeah.","Jim Connor","Yeah. So, early service operations are declining because we\u2019re taking all of our development expertise and we\u2019re building more buildings for ourselves rather than building buildings for third-parties. It\u2019s not really directly correlated with G&A either, I\u2019ve seeing there\u2019s not some correlation. But it\u2019s really just a change in focus, we\u2019re now on pace to do $700 million give or take a development this year for our own account. We haven\u2019t staffed up to any measurable level on our people. So, what that means is we\u2019re just doing less lower margin third-party projects, because we can do projects for ourselves. So, that\u2019s why service officers going down, that\u2019s really just a focus from third-party work to wholly-owned. And in G&A is actually if you look at G&A, it\u2019s not as much, we were $51 million last year, a bit quite of our range this year is $53 million, that\u2019s really just the lovely cost of our government and being a public company. It\u2019s not really any inefficiencies or anything like that, it\u2019s just increased SECBs and things like that.","Kyle McGrady","Okay. And then, Jim and I always talk about this, what\u2019s your long-term expectation for your land inventory, Jim. Are you going to get back up to $1 million dollars or what do you think is appropriate?","Jim Connor","Sorry John, I choked a little bit there. No, we have worked really, really hard over the last four years, five years to get the inventory down to the level it is, it\u2019s actually under $350 million right now. We believe we can run this business through cycle with between $350 million and $400 million of land held for development and it\u2019s really we\u2019ve changed the culture on how we approach land. We are not buying it in 500 acre chunks and controlling it for 10 years, we\u2019re buying it in smaller pieces. We\u2019re focused on putting it in to production much more quickly.","So I think, it\u2019s taken us a while to get there, but we are certainly in no hurry to get back, and I think you\u2019ll see us continue to stay in that $350 million to $400 million range.","Kyle McGrady","Great. All right. See you soon. Thanks a lot.","Jim Connor","Thanks.","Operator","And next we have the line of Rich Anderson. Please go ahead, you\u2019re open.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. So, earlier in the call given the sort of problems emerging in the industrial space kind of made you chuckle a little bit and I get it, you guys are in great shape, no argument. But in previous past cycle, not so much in industrial, but other sectors, REITs did a really poor job of no one went to walk away from the Blackjack table. So \u2013 speaking specifically about development, your expanding development, what are you looking for, if everything is just track record driven and you\u2019re feeling great and you\u2019re adding to the pipeline, what are you looking for as a signal to get to be early before it\u2019s too late and you have some real problems. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s now, but what are the some of the tell-tale signal that you\u2019re looking for this time around.","Jim Connor","Well, Rich, I think we can all reflect back on what the market look like in 2007 and 2008, and there were \u2013 there were comparable levels of supply coming on the market. It was much less preleased. So the entire market had much more spec risk out there. And I don\u2019t have the numbers right off the top of my head. But I would going for memory, I think we were 10% or 15% preleased as an industry last time. And now we\u2019re in the 35% or 40% range. So I think that\u2019s one of the factors that we look at. The fact that demand has continued to outpace supply, and I think the fundamental difference this time and we\u2019ve been talking about it on last several calls is e-commerce and the changes that has fundamentally may do our business.","You could step back and look at all kinds of projections and forecasts out there for that side of the business. The most conservative ones I\u2019ve seen have it growing at 8% to 10% a year. The more aggressive ones are 15% to 18% a year. So I think that bodes very, very well for us. But on the outside, we\u2019re looking at the supply demand fundamentals, both from a macro perspective and a local perspective, and even when you get to a local perspective we\u2019re drilling down into specific submarkets.","And then we\u2019re looking at our portfolio. We\u2019ve committed to you guys and our investors that we\u2019re going to keep our development pipeline, whatever size it is, at least 50% preleased. We\u2019re going to manage our risk much better this time. And some people have from time-to-time, but a little critical and said we might be leaving some opportunity at the table and if that\u2019s the case, so be it. And we continued to perform very well and keeping that prelease percentage up and today the pipelines at roughly 58% and I think in actuality, that maybe go up in the fourth quarter, given the build-to-suit volume compared to the timing on some spec projects, but that remains to be seen a little bit. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it and what the things that we\u2019re trying to manage.","Rich Anderson","Okay. So 58% is not quite the floor, but kind of close to the floor, you wouldn\u2019t want to see the overall pipeline go much below that, before you would get some leasing done and then add to it, is that the right way to think about it?","Jim Connor","Yeah. I mean I would say, we think the floor is 50% and in the last I think three years, we dipped below that one-time and I want to \u2013 I made a point of telling you guys a quarter in advance that it was going to happen and why. And in that particular case, it was simply just the timing from one quarter to the next of a number of spec projects and yeah, a lot of the markets that we deal in you can\u2019t build in 12 months a year, you can do that in Texas and you can do that in Florida, but in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Chicago, you can only build about nine months a year or so. There is some of those instances. But yeah, the magic number for us is 50% that we\u2019re trying to stay above.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And for Mark, if you could just answer a quick modeling question, maybe we could do this offline, if it\u2019s not right at your finger tips. But FFO from unconsolidated, to bounces around from quarter-to-quarter, but your \u2013 you are going to have a deal in the fourth quarter. Can you give me sort of sense of what the run rate should be \u2013 on a kind of a go forward basis and if that\u2019s not a question you can answer now, maybe offline.","Mark Denien","Yeah, Rich, I could probably answer now, but I may not answer it correctly. So let\u2019s try to do that offline.","Rich Anderson","Okay. No problem.","Mark Denien","I probably think I know, but I\u2019d like to look at [indiscernible].","Rich Anderson","Okay. Sounds good. Thanks very much.","Mark Denien","Yeah.","Jim Connor","Yeah.","Operator: Next we have in line from Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead, you are open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So Mark, you actually I made a quick mention about how you guys have a little bit less lease expirations going forward and I\u2019ll say compared to your peers more noticeably less just because you have longer leases. So how do you maintain 4% to 5% same-store NOI growth when you have less to recoup, even though Mark, rent growths are higher. I know you\u2019ve about \u2013 probably about 2.5% cash rent step ups, but it just seems like it might be a little bit more difficult to get \u2013 to maintain a high same-store NOI run rate, just because you have less [indiscernible].","Mark Denien","Yeah, Ki Bin. I mean, like I had mentioned earlier, I think, we need to finish lowering our budget up for next year before we give guidance for next year on this number. I guess, my point there is I\u2019m not giving guidance, I\u2019m saying that I think it is difficult to imagine we can see this run rate next year. But somewhere, half of that give or take, I think we can get there, there is always efficiencies you can try to drive out your portfolio as well. We\u2019ve done a good job at doing that, so that\u2019s on top of the rent bumps, that\u2019s on top of the rent growth. So it\u2019s somewhere in that, call it close to 3% range give or take, I think, a pretty good baseline start out and then we\u2019ll just see when we roll everything up how much north or south of that it is.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And now just quickly on G&A, you\u2019re going to exit the office portfolio completely by year end, it sounds like. But your G&A is just \u2013 actually been increasing over the past couple of years. So I\u2019m just curious if there is anything we can expect in the efficiencies on that line item?","Mark Denien","No, not really Ki Bin, I\u2019m mean, we\u2019ve already really driven all the efficiencies out of G&A I think for the most part that we can. Most of the \u2013 any additional I should say cost savings that come out of the remaining dispositions we have are really sitting up in property NOI, it\u2019ll be property level efficiencies that we have, what I would call the relatively slight increases we\u2019ve had in G&A, the last couple of years are just kind of what I call cost of being a public company, they\u2019re just raising greater than inflation. I would point out that if you look at our G&A load relative to probably any of our peers, one of the metrics we look at is, G&A is a percentage of gross revenues or G&A is a percentage of gross assets. While I\u2019d acknowledge our G&A has increased a little bit over the last couple of years, I\u2019d still put us best in class.","Ki Bin Kim","And just a last quick one. Are you \u2013 our cash lease price generally as a rule of thumb about half of the GAAP lease spreads, how do I think about that?","Mark Denien","No. We don\u2019t really calculate that Ki Bin. I would tell you it\u2019s probably less than half. Because the GAAP lease spreads, the lease term matters, so if you got a five-year lease, you may have to divide that number by five even.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay.","Mark Denien","So, it\u2019s probably, if you\u2019re at 20%, it\u2019s probably closer to the mid single-digits give or take.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Mark Denien","Yeah.","Operator: Yeah. We have a follow-up question from the line of Eric Frankel. You\u2019re open. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Just a follow-up question regarding future asset sales and asset recycling. So obviously you\u2019ve had this non-core pool of assets [indiscernible] with sell down and use at the fund development. If \u2013 for whatever reason your share price isn\u2019t quite as attractive in a year or two year, as it is maybe today, do you have a self-funding formula for funding development or cap allocation opportunities in the future?","Jim Connor","Well, Eric, that\u2019s just the last we talking about our stock price like that. No, I\u2019m just kidding. Yeah, I think we can always recycle assets. I think, as I alluded to earlier, we\u2019d like where the portfolio is. We\u2019ve done obviously all of the heavy lifting as it relates to the office portfolio, but we\u2019ve also harvested some gains, we\u2019ve sold a couple of Amazon buildings, we\u2019ve liquidated a couple of joint ventures. We\u2019ve proven some industrial assets here and there. So, if we need to, we can certainly look at that as an opportunity to raise capital. Sitting here today, Mark will tell you we\u2019ve got the vast majority of our development and borrowings for the next year, pretty well covered. So, even if we don\u2019t like where the price is from an equity perspective, I think we\u2019re pretty well covered next year.","Eric Frankel","All right. That\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And speakers no one else has queued up. Please continue.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Hart. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening during our fourth quarter call, tenderly scheduled for January 26, 2017 and hope to see you many of you at May REIT next month.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer; and Steve Schnur, Chief Operating Officer. ","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results. For more information about those risk factors, I would refer you to our 10-K or 10-Q that we have on file with the SEC and the company's other SEC filings.

A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures that we provide on this call is included in our earnings release.

You can also find our earnings release, supplemental package, SEC reports and an audio webcast of this call in the IR section of our website. Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everybody. Demand for well-located, state-of-the-art logistics space in key submarkets continues to remain robust. Overall fundamentals are still strong, driving rent growth and development opportunity, and our platform continues to provide creative solutions for our clients and outstanding value creation. ","Let me start off with a bit of macro and strategic front, and then the rest of the team will expand on our operational results and our capital activity. Yesterday, preliminary third quarter GDP was announced at 1.9%, down slightly from the 2% pace in the second quarter but still above consensus. While the bright spots in the GDP report was consumer spending, which was up 2.9% on an annualized basis, the report also indicates business spending continues to weaken a bit, which we've seen in some of the other recent indicators. We're monitoring this closely for any possible impact to the consumer, but it doesn't appear to be an issue at this time. Initially, e-commerce sales have grown by 13.1%, and brick-and-mortar retail sales were up 2.4% for the first half of the year. The retail inventories continue to trend up at 3.9% year-over-year through the third quarter. ","As we've noted previously, we're seeing significant investments by not only e-commerce company but also retail and consumer products companies into their supply chains to improve delivery times and efficiency. This, combined with continued increases in consumer spending, will continue to drive demand for well-located logistics real estate. Now turning to the real estate fundamentals. Vacancy across the U.S. markets ticked up about 10 basis points in the third quarter to 4.4%. CBRE preliminary data shows third quarter absorption of 45 million square feet, trailed by deliveries of about 56 million square feet. On a year-to-date basis, the gap is less than 15 million square feet with projected full year 2019 deliveries exceeding demand by about 25 million square feet. ","To put this in perspective, across a 14.5 billion square foot stock in the U.S., this gap will approximate to about a 10 basis point rise in vacancy from the beginning of the year levels. So we're looking at roughly 4.5% nationwide vacancy range by the end of the year. This is still 300 basis points below long-term historical average vacancies in the United States. CBRE is also reporting asking rents during the third quarter have increased 5.7% year-over-year, more than 2 percentage points above the average annual growth rate since 2012. ","So at a high level, we're continuing to see low vacancies, good rent growth and positive demand for buildings in high-quality, well-located portfolio. ","I'll now turn it over Steve Schnur to touch a bit more on market fundamentals at the submarket level as well as our third quarter operational performance.","Steven Schnur","Thanks, Jim. I'd like to start by expanding a bit on the market supply data points as it pertains to certain markets, and more importantly, the submarkets that have been in the headlines for the last several quarters. ","Let me first say that you have to be careful when looking at MSA level data on supply, particularly in some of the larger Tier 1 metro areas that can have a geographic diameter of up to 80 miles. So if you look at our NOI exposure at the total city level of Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, it comprises about 24% of our total NOI. However, in the heavier supply pockets of Northeast Atlanta, South Dallas and I-80 of Chicago, our exposure is just 9 assets would contribute only 2.8% of our total company NOI. ","Furthermore, only about 800,000 square feet in those three submarkets expires through the end of 2021. From a vacancy standpoint, the three submarkets I mentioned are about 9.5% vacant, yet comparatively, our remaining assets outside of these three submarkets, or the other 21% of our NOI, the market vacancy is 6%, and our portfolio occupancy across those three cities is between 99% and 100%. Finally, as a testament to our portfolio performance in these three large metros, our rent growth year-to-date in these three cities has averaged 14.6% on a cash basis and 30% on a GAAP basis. The supply risk data points and rent growth figures at the submarket level support what we have been emphasizing, that our location strategy is heavily focused on the top logistics corridors for local and regional distribution within each MSA. As a result, as a case in point, across our 20 markets, there are roughly 220 total submarkets. Of these 220 submarkets, our 513 properties touch only 77 of those submarkets. So again, you have to be careful with some of this data, and hopefully, each of you will have an opportunity to get out to our regional markets to see this firsthand.","Now we move on to the highlights in our portfolio for the third quarter. We executed over 7 million square feet of leases across 17 markets at an average size of 117,000 square feet. This includes 22 leases signed over 100,000 square feet and 5 leases signed over 250,000 feet. Some of the more notable lease transactions were with customers such as Snyder's-Lance Foods, International Paper, Coca-Cola, Walmart and XPO Logistics. ","At quarter end, our stabilized portfolio was 97.9% leased. Our in-service occupancy increased from 95.4% to 96.2% during the third quarter, primarily through the lease-up of recently completed speculative developments. We signed over 1.8 million square feet of first gen leases and recently completed spec project that helps us stabilize over 7 facilities. As everyone is aware, this first-generation leasing will not impact same-store results in the near term, but it will drive significant overall NOI growth going forward.","The lease activity, combined with strong fundamentals, led to another quarter of solid rent growth of 14% and 27% on a cash and GAAP basis, respectively, with only 5% of this activity derived from our coastal markets of California, New Jersey and Florida. There's also been a lot of discussion recently about tenant demand by building size, so I thought it would be important to share with you some of our year-to-date stats by building size.","Year-to-date, we've realized GAAP rent growth for buildings under 100,000 square feet of 18%; 29% rent growth for buildings between 100,000 and 250,000 feet; 23% for buildings 250,000 to 500,000; and 48% for buildings greater than 500,000 feet. This reflects strong fundamentals across the size spectrum, and it also echoes our strategic and concentrated submarket focus I just laid out. ","On the development side of the business, momentum continues to be very strong. During the third quarter, we generated $211 million of starts across 6 projects, totaling 2.1 million feet that are 49% preleased. The new development starts included a 210,000-foot build-to-suit in the Atlanta airport submarket for Porsche USA and a 615,000-foot build-to-suit in the Eastern Pennsylvania for one of the largest tire wholesalers in the Northeast. ","On the speculative development side, we started a project in the Inland Empire totaling 800,000 square feet and a 210,000-foot project in the East Bay submarket in Northern California. Our overall development pipeline at quarter end had 19 projects under construction, totaling 7.2 million square feet at a projected $916 million in stabilized costs. These projects are 46% preleased, and our estimated margins on the pipeline remain over 30%. Our development outlook for the remainder of this year is very solid. We have a healthy pipeline of prospects across our entire platform. This, combined with our outstanding year-to-date results, is driving our increased guidance for development, which Mark will cover later on. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover capital transaction activity.","Nicholas Anthony","Thanks, Steve. We continue to be strategic in our capital recycling for the purpose of both self-funding development, achieving our strategic objective for Tier 1 geographic exposure. During this quarter, we closed on the sale of 5 transactions located primarily in the Midwest totaling $280 million. The bulk of the activity comprised an 18-building, 4.1 million square foot portfolio across Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Columbus that sold for $218 million. The buildings in this portfolio have an average age of 25 years, and we believe the sale maximized our return on these properties. The remaining sales were small portfolios of one-off assets across Minneapolis, Atlanta, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C. ","In turn, we recycled a portion of these proceeds during the third quarter into a 252,000 square foot facility located in Miami at Countyline Corporate Park. In addition, after the third quarter, in late October, we completed a second acquisition also at Countyline totaling 241,000 square feet. In aggregate, we acquired from 490,000 -- 493,000 square feet for about $78 million. We now own 1.8 million square feet in this park, and together with our Miami industrial logistics park nearby, we own over 2.4 million square feet of what we believe are the most desirable facilities in the Medley submarket of Miami. ","The acquisitions at Countyline bring our year-to-date total acquisitions to $188 million and, coupled with development, have increased our Tier 1 exposure on a GAV basis to 64%. This is up from 59% at 12\/31\/18 and on the path to reach our Tier 1 strategic goal of approximately 70% by the end of 2021.","I'll now turn it over to Mark Denien to cover our earnings result and balance sheet activities.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.37 per share compared to $0.36 per share in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.35 per share in the third quarter of 2018. On a year-to-date percentage basis, core FFO per share is up over 9% compared to the similar year-to-date period of 2018, and AFFO on a share-adjusted basis is up right about 10% year-over-year. ","Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis was 2.8% for the third quarter, down from 4.4% in the second quarter. As we discussed extensively in our last earnings call, this moderation of same-property NOI growth was expected due to coming off an extremely high comparable occupancy level of 98.8% in the third quarter of 2018. In addition, third quarter same-property NOI was negatively impacted by previously announced tenant bankruptcy which was immediately backfilled but will not begin paying rent until the end of the year and also from the relocation of a tenant from 2 of our existing properties to one of our newly completed build-to-suit developments.","The combined impact of these tenant situations to same-property NOI was about 35 basis points for the third quarter and will be about 60 basis points in the fourth quarter. Once again, we expect this negative impact of 50 basis points on the second half of 2019 to turn to a positive in 2020 as rent commences from the bankruptcy backfill and the other 2 spaces are leased. We do expect same-property NOI growth to accelerate modestly in the fourth quarter, and this is considered in our revised guidance which I'll cover in a minute. ","Same-property NOI growth on a GAAP basis was 2.9% for the third quarter and 3.5% on a year-to-date basis. In August, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and issued $175 million of unsecured notes as part of the reopening of our 3.375% coupon 2027 bonds at a 2.8% effective interest rate. Between August and early October, we issued 6 million shares through our ATM program at an average price of $33.56, generating net proceeds of $200 million. I'll add some context given we're very thoughtful and deliberate on issuing equity. ","With our significantly increased development prospects since the beginning of the year, we felt it was prudent to issue a bit of equity to maintain a strong competitive balance sheet to fund these investments. In addition, the equity markets are providing a very competitive cost that we estimate is significantly accretive to our overall investment returns. While our leverage metrics improved this quarter from already strong levels, this is temporary. We view this as a portion of the prefunding for our current development pipeline along with future development prospects rather than a delevering activity. This funding will come from future unsecured debt issuances and other capital sources. ","As we head into 2020, I anticipate a gradual path towards a debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the low 5x area from the mid-4s area currently. This level is in the range we previously discussed. ","Last week, we redeemed $250 million of 3.9% unsecured notes which had a scheduled maturity in February of 2021. The approximately $6 million prepayment of interest incurred in connection with this redemption will impact FFO as defined by NAREIT in the fourth quarter 2019 with no impact to core FFO. The source of funds for this redemption will ultimately come from a new unsecured debt issuance we anticipate in the near future.","Let me now address revisions to our 2019 expected range of estimates, which is an exhibit at the back of our quarterly supplement as well as on our website. As we near the end of 2019, we have narrowed our guidance for core FFO to a range of $1.42 to $1.46 per share, which equates to an additional $0.01 per share increase at the midpoint and 8.3% growth over the prior year. We increased our guidance for same-property net operating income to a range of 4.4% to 4.8% from the previous range of 4.0% to 5.0%. We've also increased our guidance for development starts to a range of $1 billion to $1.15 billion, representing a $75 million increase at the midpoint. Revisions to certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. In closing, we're very pleased with the team's execution on leasing performance, capital redeployment and development starts. We laid out solid growth expectations for the year, and we have exceeded all of those expectations. In addition, we're executing on our long-term strategic goal to generate high single-digit AFFO growth in a modest economic environment and execute on our goal to achieve 70% Tier 1 geographic exposure by 2021 with a very targeted submarket focus. Of course, we're carefully watching macroeconomic data trends, trade negotiations and our customer sentiment. But for now, we continue to be optimistic about a solid finish for the remainder of the year and demand drivers continuing intact for a good start to early 2020. ","I'm also very pleased that our overall strong performance has allowed us to raise the quarterly dividend by $0.02 a share or 9.3% over the previous dividend rate, while maintaining our very conservative payout ratio. The increase is reflective of our team's outstanding execution and strong year-to-date results. ","We will now open up the result -- open up the lines to the audience. [Operator Instructions]. I've also been notified that there was some static on the line during my remarks and Steve's remarks, so if you need us to readdress any of those numbers or any of those comments, feel free to ask, and we will address them. ","Tony, you can open up the lines for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Manny Korchman.","Emmanuel Korchman","Can we focus on the asset sales for a second, talk about the buyer pool that you're looking at -- or that was looking at those assets and whether you marketed other assets that you didn't sell to them?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes. So Manny, the most significant one was the Midwest portfolio sale, and we were very pleased with the buyer pool. It was very deep. It was a low double-digit number of bidders offering on that. And I believe we had, I think, 3 or 4 rounds of final bidding with a final field bid process.","Emmanuel Korchman","And then as we think about your portfolio improvement from selling out of these more secondary markets, what is it that limits further sales? Is it the gains and sort of using those into other properties? Do you like the rest of your portfolio? And as you get to that 70% goal that you mentioned, do you think you do that for buying and development? Or do you think there are more sales that we should think about?","Nicholas Anthony","I would tell you that we are very happy with our existing portfolio, so it is very -- it's getting harder and harder to find assets that we do want to sell. So we've been gradually doing the sales to partially fund our development. But going forward, the bulk of our growth into the Tier 1 will be through development.","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from the line of Blaine Heck.","Blaine Heck","So you guys highlighted the fact that only 5% of your leasing volume was in Tier 1 markets, and you're still able to put up very strong rent spreads. Can you provide us with that percentage of 2020 rents that are in Tier 1 markets? And I guess what are the implications for rent spreads as we look forward?","Mark Denien","Yes. Blaine, I'll try to address that. First of all, to make sure we're clear, and I just made that in the part where there was static, the 5% was actually not Tier 1 markets. It was coastal markets. So that was California, New Jersey and South Florida. We obviously count Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas as Tier 1. So that was not in that 5% number, just the coastal markets was 5%. ","So as we look forward for the next 18 to 24 months, that 5% is going to be about 20%. It could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. For example, we've got, I want to say, about 22% to 25% in coastal markets that are expiring in 2020. But it's likely we made -- get a couple of those deals done here in the fourth quarter actually. ","So the way that translates into overall rent growth expectations if we look forward, I would tell you for the next 12 to 24 months, on average, and like I said, there may be some swings from quarter-to-quarter, but on average, we expect similar results to what we've shown this year. So call it high to low -- high single to low double digits on a cash basis and right around the mid-20s on a GAAP basis. And then for our whole portfolio, we've done -- tried to do an analysis to look at what that would be on a mark-to-market basis on a GAAP, and we think we're close to 14% to 18%, somewhere in that range on a total GAAP basis.","Blaine Heck","Very helpful. And then so what's the break out of your exposure between Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 at this point? And then maybe for Jim, what's the ideal portfolio? Is it all Tier 1? Or is it the targeted 70% that you're looking for by in 2021 and you still do want to have some exposure to those secondary markets?","James Connor","Well, I'll let Nick give you the breakdown between the high-barrier Tier 1s, the Tier 1s and the remainder. But at this point, we're just trying to get to our target of 70. I think beyond that, you'll continue to see that number grow, but we haven't set specific targets. We've grown pretty substantially in Southern California and New Jersey, but we have a long way to go before we think we would reach our long-term target size. Plus we're still relatively new in Northern California and Seattle. Those also represent good growth opportunities for us in those Tier 1 high-barrier markets.","Nicholas Anthony","Yes. And in terms of the composition, our high-barrier Tier 1 on a gross asset value basis is just over 40%, and the low barrier Tier 1 is right around 25%. Going forward, and what we've seen historically, is the high-barrier Tier 1 is the ones moving the most, that's moving us to that 70%. The low-barrier Tier 1 are really staying rather static as we go through this repositioning.","Operator","The next question in queue will come from Jamie Feldman.","James Feldman","So we see more consolidation in your sector this week with Prologis and Liberty. I just wanted to get your thoughts, you now have a player in this space that's just getting larger and larger and is kind of pitching the idea that there's real synergies in the business from doing that. I just want to get your thoughts on the need to get larger to compete. And as you think about that combined entity as a competitor, what changes for you guys?","James Connor","Well, Jamie, I'll take the second one first. I don't think anything changes. Our friends at Prologis had been a proverbial 900-pound gorilla for some time, and I don't think this really changes the landscape. We've all talked about the advantages of scale in this sector, and we are, in fact, big believers in that. But with an enterprise value of $14 billion or $15 billion, we don't have to get big for the sake of getting big. I would have a hard time convincing our Board and our senior leadership to get big if we weren't creating additional value. So when we look at portfolios and we look at M&A, obviously we're looking at the impact to top line FFO growth, but we're also looking at AFFO growth and NAV. And the sector is very expensive today and a little bit frothy, and we haven't seen that value creation opportunity since probably the larger Bridge Portfolio that we bought a couple of years ago. So -- and I think that's probably a fairly realistic outlook for the foreseeable future in our sector in terms of the pricing.","James Feldman","Okay. I mean did you take a close look at Liberty? And did you -- strategically, did you think it would've been a good fit? It sounds like pricing, maybe not.","James Connor","I think you can assume that we're large and substantial enough that we look at every opportunity, both private and public. The amount of detailed underwriting we do depends on what we think the fit would be. But we've had a lot of respect for Bill and the Liberty guys and their portfolio over the years, and it's a good company, and we applaud our friends at PLD for putting the deal together.","Operator","The next question in queue will come from Eric Frankel.","Eric Frankel","I just wanted to drill down dispositions a little bit further. The Midwest portfolio, is the cap that you guys disclosed in your supplemental, would that apply to that portfolio? And I'm assuming that, that was fully occupied for the last year, and it should be for this year. So is that correct?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, that roughly equates to that portfolio. The reason that portfolio was so -- was highly leased though is we actually, as part of that transaction, spun a vacant building out of that portfolio and sold it to another buyer that was ascribing more value to that building.","Eric Frankel","And then that was part of that 4.1 million square feet?","Nicholas Anthony","No, that was outside of the 4.1. The 4.1 was the Midwest portfolio.","Eric Frankel","Okay. Got you. Got you. Okay. That makes sense. And then more broadly, I think the public market has had pretty different views on how fundamentals and where values are for different markets in the U.S. so I think coastal markets seem to be getting a really good bid, and anywhere else is probably a little bit softer. What are you seeing on the ground, maybe in your noncoastal Tier 1 markets and some of the markets you're recycling out? What are the fundamentals actually look like? Have rents gone up a good bit for last year? Have they been kind of flat with where supply has been?","Steven Schnur","Yes. Eric, this is Steve. Yes. I would tell you we see good demand in all the submarkets we operate in. I think we're pretty choosy as I try to lay out and hopefully it came through with the static, but I think we're pretty choosy on our submarket focus. ","In terms of the demand drivers, Jim touched on this, but e-commerce, retail, consumer, nondurables, food and beverage. So -- and I guess the one thing that I would point out that we don't publish but we track pretty closely here is our build-to-suit development pipeline. And that pipeline for us has been pretty consistent in terms of the number of prospects we're chasing, and that seems to be a good indicator of the health of our clients. So we're looking out 12 to 24 months for a new space, and we watch that pretty closely, so I think that's a good indicator for us.","James Connor","Eric, the only thing I would add is if you look at the occupancy of our noncoastal markets, it's continued to be very strong. And as Mark alluded to earlier, our rent growth numbers, which were pretty good for this quarter and have been pretty good for the year, are based on the fact that only 5% of our leases rolled in those high-barrier coastal markets. ","So look, we've said this all along. The sector is in great shape all across the country. Vacancies are at record low. There's still really strong demand, and there's still really good rent growth, and we see that at all sizes as well.","Operator","The next question is from Vikram Malhotra.","Vikram Malhotra","I have two quick ones. So just based on your commentary around expirations now being -- going forward, being a bigger part in the coastal markets. Would you actually expect accelerating cash rent spreads or similar cash rent spreads to this year?","Mark Denien","It's probably going to be fairly similar, I would say, Vik, in the near future. But part of that, you got to remember, the leases that will be rolling in the coastal markets are generally shorter-term leases, 5-year deals, let's just call it on average, while some of the leases that are rolling in the noncoastal markets were kind of what I would call legacy longer-term build-to-suit leases of 10 years. So you have just as good of embedded rent growth as some of those non-high-barrier markets because of the length of the lease term that's coming up.","Vikram Malhotra","Okay. That's fair. And then just to clarify, I know you narrowed the same-store NOI growth range, but I just want to understand, what caused you to kind of narrow the top end.","Mark Denien","Well, we narrowed both ends, I think. We raised the bottom end, and we lowered the top end, just to get closer to where we are at the end of the year. So our new midpoint went from 4.5 up to 4.6. And then if you just compare that to our year-to-date number, where we're at 4.9, keep in mind that's 75% of the total year NOI, at the 4.9, that would imply, I think if you just do simple math, a 3.5% expected growth in the fourth quarter to hit that 4.6. But the narrowing, that you'll see later in the year, we have better data now.","Vikram Malhotra","And the decel is essentially what you called out at 60 basis point impact.","Mark Denien","Yes. Well, it's 60 basis points -- from the third quarter -- for the 2 tenants in the third quarter that I mentioned in sort of 2 situations, 1 bankruptcy tenant in Atlanta and then we had 1 tenant in 2 spaces in Cincinnati that we moved into a new development. The 2 spaces in Cincinnati, the tenant held over in 1 of them for most of the third quarter while they were moving into their new building, and then they'll be out of both spaces in the fourth quarter. So what you have with those 2 situations, you had a 35 basis point negative impact in the third quarter that will grow to 60 basis points in the fourth quarter because they will be out of all of those spaces.","But more than offsetting that, because that is part of the 2.8% growth for the third quarter, we do expect a reacceleration. So more than offsetting that will be the continual pop we get from all the leases we've been signing on the rent growth side, plus a little bit less free rent in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. ","So all that, even though occupancy will probably dip down a little bit more in the fourth quarter because of those situations, should be more than offset by continued positive momentum elsewhere.","Operator","Next question is from Ki Bin Kim.","Ki Bin Kim","So going back to your comments about the Tier 1 70% goal over time, I think that's about $750 million on a growth asset value basis. Just curious how you want to get there. Is it more by building your way there or buying?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes. The majority of it will be through development, and obviously, we will be selling a little bit out of the Tier 2 markets and redeploying that in Tier 1. But the majority of it will be in the development side. The vast majority of our land -- current land bank is focused on high-barrier Tier 1 markets right now.","Mark Denien","Yes. And Ki Bin, just for example, if you look at our $900 million development pipeline now, over 80% of that's in those Tier 1 markets already.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And any particular reason why some of the assets that you sold, I think, were less than stabilized? Is the demand just that strong where you're getting kind of full pricing even though the demand falls?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes. There's always some unusual circumstances like that. The one was a vacant building that got carved out of the portfolio. A lot of times, if the buyer is more optimistic on the underwriting than we are, then we're a seller. That's kind of the way we look at it. And then there were 2 office buildings -- 2 legacy office buildings in that population, too, that had lower occupancy.","Operator","The next question, that will come from Michael Carroll.","Michael Carroll","I was hoping to provide some color on your ongoing development strategy. I know Steve commented that there's pretty big pipeline of build-to-suits, and through most of 2019, you've been increasing your start guidance. I mean is it fair to assume that you can break ground about 1 billion of projects a year in a stabilized pace going forward? Or is it going to be more like the start guidance that you had at the beginning of the year?","James Connor","Mike, I think we always want to start out the year with maybe a little bit more conservative guidance because we're building budgets effectively 15 months out. So I wouldn't be surprised if in January our guidance was a little bit more conservative. But if market dynamics stay pretty consistent in 2020 with what we've seen in 2019, I think we can absolutely replicate the year. The build-to-suit pipeline, as Steve alluded to, is as strong as it's been in the last 3 years, in terms of number of prospects, the size of the deals and the geographic coverage. So that, mixed with spec developments, selected spec development around the country, we certainly hope to be having this same conversation next year where we've raised guidance to these kind of levels.","Michael Carroll","Okay. Great. And then I guess second question, can you talk a little bit about your acquisition strategy? I know it seems like you've been doing a couple of one-off acquisitions in these top-tier markets. I mean is there anything behind those deals? Are they adjacent to your existing land parcels? Do you see some value-add opportunities? I guess what makes you pursue those low cap rate deals in those good markets?","Nicholas Anthony","We are primarily -- actually exclusively focused on the high-barrier Tier 1 markets where we want greater exposure. That's where you saw $5 billion in Northern California. We've bought several buildings in South Florida as part of a transaction where we have a right of first offer on future buildings, and we evaluate those on a one-off basis. And then obviously ones that -- assets like in Southern California that provide some diversity to our current base there in California, which is our largest market now.","Operator","The next question in queue will come from John Guinee.","John Guinee","John Guinee here. Hey, Steve, you had some great stats about, I think, you own assets in 73 of the 220 submarkets. Some of your peers actually track the key submarkets where there is simply no more land and no more ability to increase supply. Do you guys go to that level of detail? And do you have any of that sort of information about your portfolio?","Steven Schnur","I wouldn't say -- I guess it would depend on what sort of information you're referring to exactly. But I'd say, in all of our markets, we certainly like submarkets where there's less available opportunities for development. We do a fair number redevelopment projects. I think half of our projects we currently have in our pipeline, we're building about 24 buildings right now, half of those projects will be considered redevelopments where we've either taken down an existing facility, be it a manufacturing plant or an old office building or steel plant or something. So that's what we're spending a lot of our time and effort. So I guess it's a long way to answer your question that obviously we're focused on those markets. I don't know that there's a stat out there that tracks availability of sites though.","James Connor","Well, I think it varies quarter-to-quarter. I mean our people are always out looking for those opportunities to find functionally obsolete facilities that we can turn around and redevelop cost effectively into new logistics facilities. And we're doing it in South Florida. We're doing it in New Jersey. We're doing it in Chicago, Southern California. And Steve even pointed out we just torn down 2 office buildings in Northern California to develop state-of-the-art logistics in the East Bay. So they may be out of vacant land, but they're not out of opportunities, and we're continuing to find good ones.","Operator","Our next question will come from Caitlin Burrows.","Caitlin Burrows","I know we've talked a little bit about the development pipeline already, but I guess in terms of you were saying that the advance side is a strong as ever, in terms of buying land and getting entitlements, are you seeing anything from there that makes you think that you wouldn't be able to keep up the development volumes as high as you've reached this year?","Steven Schnur","I think other people have commented on this as well. I think it does get more difficult, and certainly with the info markets that we're pursuing and those opportunities to go through the entitlement process, I think it's added some length to the overall duration of projects. So what used to be maybe a 9- or 10-month project may drag out to 13, 14 months. So I guess that could have some lingering effect. But right now, we see a lot of opportunities. And as Jim said, I think sitting here today, assuming that the build-to-suits and the preleasing of our spec projects can keep up, I think you'll see similar results for what we have going forward.","James Connor","Yes. Caitlin, the thing that I would add to that is we already have the land in our portfolio or at the very least under contract in the process that's going to feed our 2020 development pipeline. The buildings we're going to build next year are not on site that we haven't identified and have to go out and find. That will be the 2021 to 2022 pipeline. So I think Steve's being -- he's very comfortable that he's got the land that he needs to meet our development needs for 2020.","Caitlin Burrows","That makes sense. And then maybe also on Amazon, it looks like they grew again in terms of your largest tenant. I guess, on one hand, it's definitely a positive given their growing needs and your development services. But what are your thoughts on kind of concentration risk and also what kind of pricing power do you have with such a large tenant?","James Connor","We've had a great, long-term partnership with Amazon, and we continue to do a lot of business with them. I've told this story before. Our direction to the Amazon team and our teams in the field is we'll take as much of that business that we think makes financial sense around the country. So we're developing last-mile facilities for them, delivery sortation facilities as well as fulfillment centers. And we'll manage our exposure to Amazon at the corporate level through Nick's group with either dispositions, joint ventures, bonds, however the case may be. Sitting here today, I think they're in the 7.5% range. Given the activity that we had if we don't do anything, that number works its way up probably to 9% or 9.5%. But I think we'll address that in 2020 as we look to maybe prune some of that exposure.","Nicholas Anthony","Yes. And to Jim's point, we sold $100 million facility in Columbus, Ohio earlier this year to manage our exposure.","Mark Denien","And then finally as far as pricing power -- sorry to keep jumping around on here, Caitlin. As far as pricing power, we've had 4 Amazon leases come up for renewal in the last 24 months. And I would tell you the rent growth we achieved on those renewals in each particular market was better than the market average we had achieved in that market. So pretty good.","Operator","The next question, that will come from Rich Anderson.","Richard Anderson","So is there anything about the Liberty deal at 4.2 cap rate that makes you recall circa 2007 and EOP selling. And that kind of topping sort of number, can it get any better? What do you think about that 4.2 number for the Liberty portfolio in the context of the future and the ability to see value creation from this point going forward?","James Connor","Well, Rich, I'll make a couple of comments. Relative to the cap rate, good for the Liberty shareholders, I guess. Every year at the conferences that we all see each other at, we've been asked about our projections for cap rates and the amount of capital that's flowing into our sector. And every year, I've said, and literally for the last 3 years, cap rates can't get any lower, and cap rates continue to get lower. And I think today, we're still seeing a significant amount of capital, both domestic and foreign capital, that wants to be in U.S. industrial. And there is -- there are premiums being paid for portfolios, and we've seen that consistently throughout this year and quite candidly for the last several years. So sitting here today, it wouldn't surprise me the least if cap rates continue to compress in this sector as we have more and more capital that wants to be put to work in the industrial sector. So I think it could get better.","Richard Anderson","Right. And when you made the comment about perhaps coming out conservatively on the development side in 2020, how much of that was just simply being conservative and not being a hero coming out of the gate? And how much of it was some of these observations that you made earlier in the call? Perhaps splitting hairs, but GDP you own are spending down, so on and so forth. Are any of those sort of observations influencing your thought process about development going forward?","James Connor","Well, Rich, my first thought process is to under promise and over deliver. It's been my experience that you guys don't react well when I disappoint you in the second, third quarters. So a little bit of conservative in January is a good thing. Sitting here today, I think we all recognize that the macro drivers that we look at for our sector in a lot of instances are not as strong as they have been in the past couple of years. We've heard the term decelerating in a number of these areas. So I think a certain amount of caution is probably warranted, but as we've said, and I don't want to send the wrong message, I'm pretty optimistic about 2020 based on everything that we're seeing today in terms of the drivers and what our clients are saying, our existing tenants and their need to grow. So I think 2020 is going to be a pretty good year for us, absent some really large catastrophic thing that we may not know about today.","Richard Anderson","Right. And then last question, I said earlier that the -- I think it was Mark or somebody, over the next 12 to 24 months, you're looking at GAAP re-leasing spreads in the 20s, and that the mark-to-market for the full portfolio is 14% to 15%. I just want to make sure I have that logically correct. The stuff that's about to expire the next year or 2 is call it -- has had the benefit of 10 years of existence and so you kind of get the market rent growth from that. And then at the other end of the spectrum, stuff that just got re-let is effectively 0% GAAP re-leasing spread at this point from a mark-to-market perspective. Is that the way to think about it like over a 10-year time horizon and that the average of all of that is somewhere in the middle? Is that what you're kind of saying when you're giving that math?","James Connor","Yes. I think that's the right -- first, I need to clarify, and of course, this will make Mark nervous. It's 14% to 18%, not 14% to 15%.","Richard Anderson","Oh, forget it, forget it then.","James Connor","You're absolutely right. I would tell you, in some of our infill markets, like Northern New Jersey and Orange County in Southern California, deals that we did 6 months ago are under market right now. I mean that's how strong some of those markets are. You talk about Orange County, we had a presentation on our Board earlier this week, we are talking about vacancies that are under 2% and not a lot of new supply out there. So that continues to allow developers and landlords to push rents. So it's the combination of all of those things and our ability to go out and execute on it.","Mark Denien","Yes. But I think your logic is right on, Rich. I mean obviously the deals that are closest to coming at us are generally the older deals. The deals that we just signed won't roll for 10 or 12 years, which is why quite frankly, I don't necessarily put a whole lot of stock in the numbers we just quoted, but it is what it is. So the deals that we just signed to have 15 more years of term may be close to 0, and the deals that are coming up are going to be a lot higher than that.","Operator","The next question in queue, that will come from Jeremy Metz.","Robert Metz","Jim, just a little bit of a high-level question. You guys continue to focus on the shift into the Tier 1 markets. Is there also a desire as you go ahead and buy and sell and build to also shift the size mix shift into more multitenants, create a little more of whether it'd be annual tenant roll to be able to take advantage at times of where the market's at. And is there a desire to continue to shift the portfolio in other ways beyond just kind of geographically been in those markets?","James Connor","Yes. Jeremy, that's a good question. I'm actually glad you brought that up because people think our portfolio is all million square foot buildings. But the reality is 20% of our portfolio is buildings 100,000 square feet or smaller. And a lot of our 200,000 and 300,000 square foot buildings are exactly as you described, multitenant. So what drives the development decisions and, in many cases, the acquisition decisions of those buildings in those markets is driven by tenant needs in those markets. So when you go to South Florida or Central Florida or even Houston, it's not million square foot, it's much more reasonable average size buildings. And we've always been an active player in that marketplace. And Steve can give you a little bit more color on our average tenant size and some of the other factors.","Steven Schnur","Yes. Jeremy, I've indicated in my opening remarks, I mean our average deal size is 117,000 feet. And then if you look at our new development pipeline, what we're under construction with right now, I think our smallest building is 66,000 feet, and our largest building is upward over 1 million. So as Jim said, it really depends on the submarket we're in, in terms of what the demand is that we're going after.","Operator","The next question, that will come from Michael Mueller.","Michael Mueller","A quick question. In looking at the various JVs that you have, what portion of them are actively growing?","Nicholas Anthony","Well, this is Nick. We've really only got one significant joint venture at this point, and that is we've had it for several years. It's primarily focused on Dallas, and there hasn't been a lot of growth in that portfolio going forward. Now we do have a couple of development joint ventures that are active on the development side, but most of those assets are sold upon stabilization.","Michael Mueller","And I guess for you to do something there, is it the partners bring you land, they find a site, and you'll end up doing it there?","Nicholas Anthony","Well, no. The land's already been established, and we are codeveloping those projects and then selling them.","Michael Mueller","Okay. So it sounds like it's going to -- everything's going to stay pretty small from that perspective, it sounds like.","Nicholas Anthony","Correct. Correct. Our JV exposure, we've cleaned it up quite a bit over the years, and it's a very small part of our business right now.","Operator","We do have a follow-up in queue. That's from Ki Bin Kim.","Ki Bin Kim","Just a quick one. How much of the new leasing or leasing in the development pipeline would you say is just net new demand, tenants expanding versus shuffling seats? I know you lost one tenant to your development pipeline, but maybe excluding that one.","Steven Schnur","I'd say the majority of the deals we're seeing are net new demand. We've got -- there's -- Jim indicated, I think, when he was talking through some of the demand drivers, there is a lot of investment going on in the supply chain, so there is some consolidation business that we're benefiting from. And I guess in the case of the tenant that moved out of two of our buildings into a larger build-to-suit was not a total net add to us. But outside of the consolidation, most of the demand we're seeing, I'd say, would be net new demand.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And I know this business has always been on a square foot basis, but I was just curious if you ever looked at the cost of a real estate to your tenants in terms of like cubic square foot. Could I -- I would bet the cost per cubic square foot is actually not that bad. So maybe the rent growth to a tenant is not as high as maybe what we think.","James Connor","Yes. Ki Bin, I would make a couple of comments. It's not unlike some of the coastal markets where rent is quoted on a monthly basis as opposed to an annual basis. We do have a small number of tenants that are looking at their occupancy cost on a cubic basis. But I would tell you that it's the minority, and those are the clients that are using the clear height. They're using the full 36- or 44-foot clear. Some of them are exploring going beyond that, particularly in the infill markets. So to us, it's just math whether you use a square foot or the cubic foot. But as you have probably heard or seen, some of the tenants are starting to look more closely at that and finding that to be advantageous to go up as opposed to out.","Ki Bin Kim","I meant just more implicitly not verbatim.","Operator","Thank you very much. At this time, there's no additional questions in the queue.","Ronald Hubbard","Thanks, Tony. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening during our fourth quarter and year-end call, tentatively scheduled for the same time on Thursday, January 30, 2020. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

"],"8143":["Duke Realty Corp.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ronald Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, CFO; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2018, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start off with a few comments on the national logistics market and then I'll cover our first quarter results. In the national markets according to CBRE vacancy across the U.S. remained at record low level 4.3% and has now been below 5% for over 13 quarters.","First quarter asking rents grew and estimated 8% over the prior year nationally. For the full year, CBRE and other expect rent growth on asking rental rates to be in the 5% to 6% range. For the first quarter supply exceeded demand by about 1.6 million square feet. So, still fairly in balance and it represents only the third quarter in the last 36 quarters where supply outpaced demands slightly.","We see supply and demand in balance for the remainder of the year and expect both to finish in the 200 million square foot range. We believe this balance combined with historic low vacancy rates will continue to provide an environment for strong rent growth. In addition, the March macroeconomic figures had been solid with favorable retail and e-commerce sales consumer incentive business inventories and employment data points.","Even with 2019 GDP growth projected to be in the low-to-mid 2% range, we still feel confident in the macro demand drivers for logistics space like increased truck tonnage poor traffic and intermodal volume all support a very favorable outlook.","Now turning to our own results, we followed up a very strong 2018 with a solid start to 2019. Given the significant leasing we had in the fourth quarter of 2018, we had a comparatively light quarter with leasing volume of 2.8 million square feet. We simply did not have that many expirations particularly any of any size to renew or backfill.","We increased our stabilized occupancy by 40 basis points to 98.4%. This was primarily driven by leasing up three speculative facilities totaling 927,000 square feet. Our in service portfolio was 95.5% leased. This is down from 96.3% the previous quarter which was due to speculative projects just placed in service as well as a slight impact from acquisitions that were 72% lease.","We renewed 83% of our expiring leases during the quarter and rent growth averaged 23.4% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a cash basis which was impressive given that less than 10% of this activity came from South Florida and there were no second generation leases in any other coastal markets.","Rent growth was broad across all building sizes and all leases sizes as it has been throughout this cycle. Once again, this demonstrates if you have high quality assets in the right sub market with a top-tier operating platform all of which we have, you're in a position to capture demand and rent growth in all markets.","We had a good start to the year and new developments with a $165 million across five projects totaling 2 million square feet. All of these projects were speculative starts in key sub markets with tight fundamentals across our Southern California; Dallas; Houston; and South Florida markets.","Looking at the landscape today, our leasing prospect list is strong for our recently delivered and soon to be delivered spec projects supported by my earlier comment about the stabilization this quarter of three previously delivered spec projects. We also have a nice backlog of build to suit projects with requirements between 100,000 square feet to over 1 million square feet all across the country. ","In aggregate, it's possible our pre-leasing percentage may dip slightly below 50% during 2019 due to timing but overall we're very comfortable with our development pipeline and the speculative projects we have underway and their ability to contribute earnings growth beyond 2019.","Our overall development pipeline at quarter end had 20 projects under construction totaling 9.2 million square feet at a projected $765 million in stabilized costs for our share. These projects are 52% preleased and our margins on the pipeline are expected to continue to be in excess of 20%. With stabilized occupancy at 98.4% these projects provide a valuable source of future growth.","Now I'll turn it over to Nick to cover our acquisition and disposition activities.","Nicholas Anthony","Thanks Jim. We had a light quarter on acquisitions and dispositions. Require two state-of-the-art 36 foot clear logistics facilities totaling $78 million in Seattle and Eastern PA. In aggregate, the two assets total 577,000 square feet and were 72% leased on average. On dispositions we saw on JV asset in Indianapolis with our share of the proceeds totaling $8 million.","However, as I alluded to on the January call, we have quite a few assets projected to be sold in our Middle West markets this year with time expected in the third quarter. Regarding the broader acquisition market, we continue to look at many opportunities. However, the market is extremely competitive and thus making it difficult to find select assets in our target growth market which is reflected in our modest full-year range of guidance for acquisitions.","I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.33 per share compared to core FFO $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Core FFO was negatively impacted by an approximate $0.3 per share increase to non-cash general and administrative expense compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 which is a normal first quarter item resulting from the accounting requirement to immediately expense a significant portion of our annual stock based compensation grant that takes place every February.","Core FFO per share increased by 10% from the $0.30 per share deluded reported in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of grocery development as well as continued improved overall operational performance. We reported FFO was defined by NAREIT of $0.33 per share for the quarter compared to $0.31 per share for the first quarter of 2018 with the increase also being driven by improved overall operational performance.","AFFO totaled $119 million for the quarter compared to a $108 million for the first quarter of 2018. This 10% increase was driven by the same positive factors impacting FFO in addition to lower capital expenditures that our modern portfolio affords us. This impressive AFFO growth continue to be the driver of future dividend growth.","Same property NOI growth on a cash basis for the three months ended March 31, 2019, was a very strong 7.2%. In addition to increased occupancy and rent growth our same property NOI growth this quarter benefited from about 300 basis points of burn off a free rent compared to the first quarter of 2018.","This was attributable to some acquisition and development properties that stabilized in late 2017 and had some free rent in early 2018. Same property NOI for the first quarter on a GAAP basis was 4.3% which is lower than the cash number due largely to the lack of the impact from the free rent burn off on a GAAP basis but nonetheless still very strong.","We do expect subsequent quarters to remain solid based on continued strong rent growth and high occupancy levels but to decelerate a bit from the current level as there will not be as much lift from free rent and 2018 occupancy comparables get tougher. Also the last half of the year will be negatively impacted by about 40 basis points or about 20 basis points impact for the full-year due to one unique situation.","We have a tenant in two different spaces in our same property portfolio totaling about 425,000 square feet. They were looking to consolidate and expand and needed 620,000 square feet. So, we're building a new building for them which should be completed by the end of the second quarter. This is a great transaction for us and will increase total NOI but will be a drag on same property NOI for the last half the year until we can release their former space.","In addition, we would like to stress that about 14% of our total cash NOI for the first quarter came from our non same property pool and with 73% occupied reflecting substantial NOI growth prospects from this segment of our portfolio.","I would now like to address some refinements to our 2019 guidance that we announced yesterday. First we've increased our guidance for core FFO to a range of $1.39 to $1.45 per deluded share from the previous range of $1.37 to $1.43 per deluded share which equates to $0.2 increase at the midpoint.","We have also increased our guidance for NAREIT FFO to a range of $1.36 to a $1.46 per share from the previous range of $1.33 per share to $1.43 per share. Although, growth in same property NOI will moderate from the 7.2% reported this quarter, we still expect solid results and have increased our guidance for same property net operating income to a range of 3.5% to 5.0% from the previous range of 3.25% to 4.75%.","We are also revising our guidance for growth in adjusted funds from operations on a share adjusted basis upward to a range of 5.9% to a 11% from the previous range of 5.1% to 10.2%.","Finally, we increased our guidance for a stabilize portfolio average percentage least to a range of 97.5% to 98.5% which is up 0.3% at the midpoint.","Now I will turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark. In closing, just a couple of comments. Logistic demand drivers for modern facilities remain very strong in both traditional distribution and e-commerce fulfillment. The macro front maybe a little bumpier than prior years and we are mindful of those risks yet we still feel very good about 2019 as represented by our increase in expected ranges for key growth drivers.","And finally, we are confident in our overall ability to drive high single digit AFFO growth and corresponding dividend growth for the foreseeable future.","We will now open up the lines to the audience, we would ask participants to keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two short questions, you of course are always welcome to get back in the queue. Louise you can open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jeremy Metz. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey guys. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you think about the trade-offs between pushing rent and occupancy at this stage given the strong rent spreads you achieved and continue to achieve balance against the upward revisions to your occupancy guidance here and just some of your comments on your outlook for supply and demand balance at this point?","James Connor","Well thanks, Jeremy. I would tell you that's always a question we're asking and I think at the end of the day when we look at our cash and GAAP rent growth and we look at our CapEx to net effective rent which are both very strong numbers and we were able to improve on occupancy, I think we're really hitting on all cylinders.","We've all talked about this before, it always costs us more capital to retain at a building than it does to renew a tenant. So, if we can continue to keep our renewal percentage high keep our occupancy percentage high but maintain these roughly 25% and 10% rent growth numbers that we're getting I think we'd hit the right balance.","Jeremy Metz","I appreciate, and --.","James Connor","And on supply and demand, I think we're in a really good spot. The difference between the two of this quarter of 1.6 million square feet in the U.S. logistics market that's one or two deals. So, it could have been timing or anything else. I think we've all been prepared for a point in this cycle when we're going to reach some level of balance and we may in fact be there.","And if we are, I think at 4.3% vacancy that's a pretty good spot and I think we'll continue to be able to maintain our occupancies and continue to push rent growth.","Jeremy Metz","I appreciate it. And just second one from me, I just wanted to touch on the development starts here. The 170 million in the quarter was all spec, so maybe just what the leasing prospects look like for that as well as what you just placed in to service in the quarter and then from here should we just expect to see that next layer starts to be more tilted to build the suits at this point?","James Connor","Yes. As you guys know, quarter-to-quarter it's all timing. I didn't put in the script but we've actually already this quarter signed three builder suits. Would I love to have them in the first quarter? Absolutely. But that's just what it is. So, yes I think you'll continue to see us maintain that balance. Our builder suit pipeline is as good as it's ever been and it's as I referenced in the script it's anywhere from a 100,000 square feet up to north of a million square feet and pretty consistent across all the markets.","So, I think you'll see us continue to have very positive results on the new development pipeline.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Hey guys, good afternoon. Nick, I've got one for you. If you think about sort of the acquisition pipeline and maybe especially the two acquisitions you closed, why are those buildings I guess leasing quicker? Is it something wrong with the way that the developer and the owner is trying to lease them if demand is so good and you guys proved out the bridge how quickly you can get them lease, why aren't they leasing them before selling them to you or others?","Nicholas Anthony","Well first of all, one asset was already fully leased in Seattle. The other building with we bought in the Lehigh Valley had just delivered and they signed a lease in that and we've got three RFPs on that space right now. So, we do expect it will you know we underwrite 12 months but we fully expect that we will beat that underwriting like we do typically on other acquisitions we've done. So, I don't think there's not a lack of demand.","Manny Korchman","And if you look at the rest of the pipeline, are those similar deals whether new out of the ground and either not stabilized yet or getting closer to stabilize or is there going to be a different flavor to sort of value add than that MO?","Nicholas Anthony","You mean the other assets we are pursuing?","Manny Korchman","Sure, yes.","Nicholas Anthony","Yes. Most of the acquisition we've been pursuing are pretty well leased. In fact, this last acquisition that was half lease was unusual for us. I think it was the first one we've done in the last 18 months.","Manny Korchman","Thanks, Nick.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Nick Yulico. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Jim, I guess given all the positive commentary on fundamentals and the trends here in the overall market and in your portfolio as well, have you considered increasing development start activity? It is but I guess and just wondering why not?","James Connor","Yes we have and we actually talked about that from a guidance perspective and I think as indicated by Jeremy's question with five spec buildings in the first quarter, we thought it would be prudent to wait to reassess at the end of the second quarter and hopefully get a little bit more build to suit volume and a little bit more releasing teed up before we made a move on the development pipeline.","I think sitting here today I would tell you we think it's trending toward the high end of the range that we had announced in January and as we've said feels an awful lot like it has the last couple of years. So, we would hope we'd be able to get these build to suits signed up and be able to give some good news in the second quarter call.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then Mark, just question going back to the guidance. I mean it sounds like there are, we should think about occupancy not being as high as we get into the back half of the year.","I guess because I'm just wondering though I mean what's going to what would surprise to the upside there? I mean is it just tenants willing to stay in place more, is it even better leasing on the spec projects I mean what's sort of the upside to occupancy?","Mark Denien","Yes I think Nick it's everything you said, you had around in your head. I would tell you that first off in the first quarter we were surprised a little bit to the upside based on our occupancy levels. We quite frankly did not budget or underwrite than our renewal rate would be as high as it was in the first quarter. So, that was part of the reason we're already off to a better start in Q1 and what we had budgeted.","We do believe occupancy will tick down a bit from here. One, because as those leases that roll we're pushing rents like Jim said and I don't think that we believe will keep the same retention rate for the remainder of the year that we posted in the first quarter. So, we're anticipating a little downward tick there.","I mentioned the two spaces that we have a tenant in that totaled 425,000 square feet that we know is coming back to us at the end of the second quarter because we're moving into a build to suit. So, that will bring occupancy down as well. So, to the upside it would be the quicker releasing of space like that. It would be retention rates coming in for the rest of you closer to what they came in in the first quarter compared to our what I would say normal run rate of closer to 75% percent.","So, be some combination of all that that could cause it to go to the upside.","Nick Yulico","Thanks.","Mark Denien","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the types of demand you're seeing. I think there's been a lot of discussion in the market about smaller tenant demand in some markets versus larger. Have you seen any split in that along those lines in your portfolio?","James Connor","Yes, thanks Jamie. No, we really haven't. We had picked up on some of the chatter and that question some of our peers. So, we took a look at our first quarter results which obviously with only 2.8 million square feet of leasing wasn't a particularly deep pool of data. So, we went back and looked at all of 2018 as well and the truth is it all performed really well.","I mean I'm not going to kid here for us in actuality, the big space is north of 500,000 feet did perform the best for us in terms of occupancy and rent growth and the smaller under a 100,000 was probably the lowest performing but you're talking about the under 100,000 foot buildings being 97.2% compared to the over 500 at 98.9.","So, they're all really good. Rent growth was probably the strongest in the big buildings at 31 and 10 and 22.4 and 7.1 in the smaller buildings; again really good numbers for any which way you want to slice it and it's funny because a lot of people think of our portfolio and we get a lot of credit for the million square foot Amazon buildings.","But you have to remember that we have 300 buildings out of our 504 that are in service that are under 250,000 feet and that totals 40 million square feet of our 146 million that's in service. So, we've got a fair bit of exposure and we're really active in this size range. So, I'm happy to tell you it's good all over the board.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then as you guys think about growing a portfolio through acquisitions I mean do you have a bias, would you want to get more into kind of smaller footprint and small type assets or are you contend staying investing even more in kind of larger bombers?","James Connor","I would tell you under a 100,000 feet we don't have a particularly strong appetite unless it was part of a package or deals like that but between a 100 and a million, it fits in our portfolio like anything else and a number of the one-off deals that Nick and his team have acquired this year and last would fall into that 100,000 to 250,000 square foot category and many of those are multi-tenant building.","So, that's a product type that we've always played in. We're just probably not as well known for that as some of our peers but we've got a lot of that product and we do a lot of that leasing.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And the ones that Nick's been buying is that's just more because you can find them or that's more because you felt like you wanted to round out the portfolio with more of that?","James Connor","Well, we're really just refining our geography a little bit with those small amount of acquisitions we're doing then using disposition proceeds for it and it's very selective in just a handful of high breed tier one markets. And those assets tend to be a little smaller.","Jamie Feldman","I'm sorry?","James Connor","And those assets tend to be a little bit smaller.","Jamie Feldman","Right, okay, alright thank you.","James Connor","Good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck","Thanks, good afternoon. So, you guys are a little slow out of the gate this here on the disposition front relative to kind of the quarterly taste hit guidance. You talked last quarter about getting Midwest dispositions done in the first half. So, is there anything to read into that related to the appetite for properties and tier two markets?","Are sales taking any longer to complete then kind of your expectation or are those sales still on track?","Nicholas Anthony","No, there are no issues. In fact, we have about a 100 million of volume nonrefundable right now that we expect to close very early in the third quarter and we've got most of our target disposition list and various stages of the process. So, traditionally dispositions have always happened later in the year and we always for whatever reason people wait till the end of the year to get things sold.","Blaine Heck","Okay, I got it. And then, maybe sticking with you Nick, on the acquisitions just to get from the 3% in place to the 4.5% stabilized in there, is it just a matter of leasing them up to a stabilized level or is there any rent growth assumption built in there?","Nicholas Anthony","No rent growth assumption built into it, it's just a one unit that needs to get leased up.","Blaine Heck","Got it, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Jim I guess you might have answered my question partially with your comment on the build to suit one this quarter. But just looking, I understand you have your 50% of kind of prelease minimum requirement for your development pipeline but you combine your unstabilized portfolio with your under developing portfolio I think the occupancy decrease from safe or lease percentage decrease in about 45% about I think 37% or so.","Could you guys, are you guys thinking about altering your measure kind of what your risk cap is in terms of development and unstabilized assets?","James Connor","No Eric, I can't tell you -- we're going to start looking at it any differently than I think we historically have. I think a combination of the occupancy of the underdevelopment the in service and the stabilized was the right cross section of all of our occupancy matrix to look at.","And then, as big as we are we have to look at the development pipeline in totality. And we look at every spec project and measure the risk that we're taking on and as we talked in the past, that's not just from a company perspective but also looks at what's going on that business unit.","What we got coming at us in the next 12 to 18 months in terms of lease role. What kind of rent growth and occupancy and that absorption we're seeing in those specific markets. So, I think we got our hand on the pulse of the right matrix, we'll be making all of those decisions.","But we're always happy to talk about slicing and dicing the data differently if there is a better way to do it.","Nicholas Anthony","Yes. The only thing I would add to that Eric I like Jim said. The 50% kind of preleased and the development pipeline is an easy thing to talk about. But we got a whole lot more matrix in that and totally that we look at before we pull the trigger on any new.","Eric Frankel","That's helpful to know, thank you. I just have one follow-up and then I'll go queue back in. just on the build to suits that you're seeing for the rest of the year, have the margins at all changed for what you're able to offer, I mean it sounds like it's all supplies in check, it still seems that and most like a more even more competitive environment and then what it was a year or two ago.","So, any thoughts on build to suit margins?","Nicholas Anthony","No, our margins, we're projecting our margins to continue to be north of 20% which is where they literally averaged for the last probably 10 years. And that's a makeup of some of the more competitive build to suits, are probably in the mid-to-high teens, maybe 15% to 17%. And the speculative development particularly on land that we bought right, is probably 25%.","Eric Frankel","Okay, I'll queue back in, thank you.","Nicholas Anthony","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Hey, guys. So, if you look back at the industrial market for the past few years, I don\u2019t think it matter where you owned it, you pay I mean money on it.","James Connor","We're okay with that.","Ki Bin Kim","Yes, and I didn\u2019t make any money on this, well here there goes on our story. So, but going forward, how do you think about long-term market mix. And is it better to buy things in LA four caps even at this point versus and selling assets in the Midwest that low to mid five caps.","I just want to get a sense of your broader thoughts on that topic.","James Connor","Well, keep it up. I'll give you a couple of comments. We've done a pretty good job of analyzing the REIT growth in our portfolio and market dynamics and I think that's one of the big reasons you're seeing us as we've transitioned the company over the last few years pushing into those coastal markets. Because those coastal markets are where you had historically always gotten the strongest rent growth.","When we go into a downturn over sessions, all of the markets are going to move the wrong way but typically those costal markets particularly the high barrier ones that we talk a lot about, those are the markets where you get the greatest returns. I would tell you our primary focus is on development and not necessarily acquisition, although we do do a bit of that.","But I much rather be developing in and as you referenced LA, at a 5.5 as opposed to buy it at a four. But in today's world you're creating value with either one.","Ki Bin Kim","And like the asset in 4375 Paris Boulevard, I'll be honest I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s our market, others saw market as a good one or bad one. I know it's only mile or a two mile stop at the other development that you have that was fully leased.","But is development or our build to suit activity taking you away further way from the city center and is there some risk with that?","James Connor","Well, if you want to look at individual assets, we do a combination of infill redevelopment and more traditional Greenfield development. So, if you look at what we're doing or what we've done in Southern California, when you go out to Perris in the Moreno Valley, that's more traditional Greenfield development.","But when you go into the IE West and into Orange County where we've done a number of projects, that\u2019s much closer in infield. It has a higher degree of difficulty because you're generally dealing with having to assemble a complicated site. There's probably environmental issues.","The development process in California as you know was a challenging one. So, in order to get the site fully entitled, you probably looking at 12 or 15 months with the work. But again, we do it all, we're doing a lot of infield development, we own a lot of infield properties, we'll continue to have a focus there.","But we're also doing the bigger Greenfield because if you're in the Los Angeles and you need a million square foot distribution center, you can do it in Orange County if it doesn't exist. That's why all those big those big million square footers have gone out to the IE because that's where the land is available for those kind of developments.","Ki Bin Kim","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Yes, thanks. Tim, I just wanted to touch on I guess your development leasing. I'm sorry if I miss this but I know you recently completed a number of projects where there has been some available space. And last quarter you gave us some pretty good details about the trends of those projects.","I guess are those trends, are you still happy with leasing progress and we should expect to see some leases signed here over the next few quarters, is it still just a prime thing and why some of that space is still available?","James Connor","Well you better expect to see some leases because I expect to see some huge sign. We will be in some serious trouble. No, I'll tell you Michael, the thing that we look at and again you can't get hung-up looking at an individual building because when we underwrite a speculative development irrespective of how good we think it is or how mediocre we think it is, we put in 12 months at least.","And some of those buildings gets leased the first month and some gets leased in month 12 and unfortunately some gets leased in month 18. If you look across our entire portfolio for the last two years or three years?","Nicholas Anthony","Three.","James Connor","Three years, we've been averaging across all our speculative development complete lease up and stabilization in month nine. So, we've been running ahead of our underwriting. A lot of winners, a lot coming on on budget but a few losers. And that's what I think you'll continue to see, that's the nature of the beast with speculative development.","Michael Carroll","Okay. And the, I guess your highlight on the build to suit pipeline, should we read into that since you started for the many spec projects in 1Q that you're going to be more focused on build to suit less on spec over the next few quarters or a spec's still interesting to you?","James Connor","No, spec is still very interesting to us and we're always focused on build to suit because that's what has enabled us to drive new development to the levels that we have. What I would tell you and we've talked about this from time-to-time when I've referenced our development pipeline may dip below 50%.","As we have worked our way into high barrier markets like Northern New Jersey and further into the Southern California infield markets like Orange County and even in Dade County where we have some very expensive land tied up. It pays for us to put that into production absolutely as soon as we can.","So, in years gone by, I might have wanted to move some of those around from quarter-to-quarter to maintain that 50%, but in these instances we think the market is strong enough and the carry on the land is significant enough that we're probably going to move ahead and put those into production as soon as possible.","And that's what driving that, what's behind my statement of where it may dip below, it's not going to go to 35% or 40%. But we just may choose from a timing perspective to move ahead with a few spec projects sooner than we thought we would have in the past but you'll also continue to see just as I referenced earlier since we already signed three build to suits have a good number of build to suit projects.","Michael Carroll","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Richard Anderson. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Thanks, good afternoon. So, Jim or anyone, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about obsolescence, not maybe this year but as the business of logistics moves closer in and this kind of been just underwriting this call, away from perhaps these huge fulfilment centers into smaller spaces.","Even Amazon is doing that more and more. What is an alternative us of a million two square foot rectangle.","James Connor","Well, we've talked in the past, we've never lost Amazon from any one of our facilities, now that isn\u2019t to say they haven\u2019t moved out and so and eventually someday they'll move out of lot. And as we've spent a lot of time --.","Richard Anderson","They moved out of Coffeyville I believe I recall reading that but that's a long time ago. Anyway, okay.","James Connor","That wasn\u2019t one of our projects.","Richard Anderson","I know, yes.","James Connor","So, but you know what, some day they will, you're absolutely right. And what we want to remind everybody is we own just the box, okay we don\u2019t own any of the material, handling, equipment or mezzanines or robotics or anything like that. And we've got restoration costs.","So, at the end of the day I own a good clean functional 1.2 million 1.1 whatever the size is box with plenty of parking and plenty of tailor storage, plenty of loading facilities. That building can be released to Walmart, to Procter & Gamble to target, that building could be divided into half or quarters, I can do 500,000 foot leases or 300,000 foot leases.","So, we've always got an eye towards the future in any of our development whether it's speculative of build to suit and we think we've underwritten those at the right basis that at the end of that lease term if we were to lose in Amazon, we'll be able to compete for deals very favorably.","Nicholas Anthony","Rich, the other thing I would say is these, take Amazon for example, these 90,000 80,000 square foot buildings are not replacing anything, and they're purely additive to their supply chain. They also still serviced by these fulfilment centers. So, it's just maybe that the fulfilment center is servicing both the direct and consumer and those delivery stations or whatever you want to call them.","So, they're not replacing anything, they're just additive to their supply chain.","Richard Anderson","Okay, fair enough. And then another thing that was touched on then and on off was explicitly answered, you don\u2019t have a bent either way about having your average asset size go higher or lower over the course of the next few years. Do you or you're thinking in terms of well maybe you said 100,000 or a million square feet fit into our kind of business model.","Are you kind of showing your cards a little bit that they'll be willing to get a little bit smaller?","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, I would tell you we do not have a component of our strategic plan or our annual budget. That says we want to get our average building size bigger or our average tenant size bigger or the inverse, smaller by any stretch of the imagination.","Our local operating teams are out just trying to do good quality business. And we own, we still own, I'm looking at the latest numbers here, we still own 95 buildings under a 100,000 square feet, 202 between a 100,000 and 250,000 feet, a 140 between 250 and 500 and 87 over 500. I mean that's pretty good balance across all sizes.","And I'd happily take more of any of those.","Ronald Hubbard","Yes, and if you look at our pipeline of what we're building Rich, we're building everything from a 140 to a million and everything in between.","Richard Anderson","Yes.","Ronald Hubbard","It's more about where the asset is and what it's going to serve and how big the asset is.","Richard Anderson","So, size doesn't matter, is that right?","James Connor","Rich, I'm not going there, buddy, not on a public line.","Richard Anderson","I kind of partially stumped, okay you guys stumbled first time, alright thanks, that's all.","Operator","Our next question is from John Guinee. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","Great, thank you. Mark, by the way you're building a 77,000 foot building in Indianapolis to say now.","Mark Denien","That's true, I forgot about that one.","Nicholas Anthony","True John, you're right.","John Guinee","So, big picture, Jim. Not all these sub markets are created equal and some of them are basically out of land clearly out of Greenfield land and into repurposing land. Can you talk about the bigger markets say Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, you guys have a great team in Atlanta, great team in Dallas.","Maybe whatever markets you care about that where are you essentially out of land and where particularly with sub markets as the DFW sub market and then where are those land as far as the eye can see and then take it into the ability to have long-term pricing power in these markets where you're essentially out of land?","James Connor","Well John, you've hit on what is the key to some of these Tier 1 markets, I do we might have some data handy because I thought we might get this question. So, if you take Dallas for example which by and large in its entirety is reasonably healthy, has good strong net absorption but you drill down to the sub market level and you go to on the South Dallas and we've all talked about South Dallas before.","No barriers to entry, plenty of available land, good expressway access, reasonably new intermodal and a vacancy in South Dallas is 15.3%. So, like four times the national average. You go to the DFW sub market which you and I would call infill and there's very little available land, there vacancy is 6%.","If you go to Chicago, it's the same extreme. You go under the I80 corridor, again not a lot of barriers to entry, good expressway access and the vacancy down there is a 11.7%. You go to the O'Hare Market, we've all been in toward through the O'Hare Market. It's 2.4% vacancy.","So, you're absolutely right, not only do you not have pricing power today when the vacancy in those overbuilt markets, is where it is but you can anticipate having any pricing power over the long-term.","So, when if you have a building down there and you got lease role coming at you, your tenant probably has the opportunity to look at a number of different spec buildings or potentially go to a build to suit whereas you go to these infill markets around the airport - ","and some of the other high barrier Tier 1 markets that we've talked about and those opportunities don\u2019t avail themselves and which is why you can generally get up to twice the rent growth in those markets that you can and some of these low barrier markets.","John Guinee","Well said, good job, thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Michael Mueller. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi. I guess in the released upfront, you called out that you're going to have a little level of lease for wherever the rest of 2019. Because I'm curious, is there anything you need to you're trying to point out about this year that you are trying to get us focused on because when I like at the first quarter '18 stop, it was the same exact dynamic.","James Connor","No, I don\u2019t necessarily think so, Michael. I think it's just its lower risk. I mean, we may not have the ability to push rent growth quite as much as some of our peers but at the same time there is a risk related to do in that. So, it's a little bit around the guidance that we gave on same proper NOI.","That's another reason that it will decelerate a little bit for the remainder of the year because we won't be rowing as many tenants as maybe we would like to in this environment. But in the long run we like the balance of what we have.","Michael Mueller","Okay, so it's nothing really atypical about this year then?","James Connor","Not necessarily, I think this year was still a little lower than the past because we did just a tremendous amount of pull forwards in the fourth quarter that we talked about on the fourth quarter call. And when I say pull forwards, some of them were just four to six months early, not like they were dramatically early.","But we just took care of more of this year's expirations at the end of last year than I think would be normal, not a lot more but a little bit more.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay. That was it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll move to the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I think one market and then I just want maybe some we might have some better clarity on, is Atlanta we've done some spec development. Can you just describe the recent activity there and how quickly you're taking the lease up your recent development?","James Connor","Yes, we got really activity down there and I note when you look at Atlanta in its entirety, people see 6%, that's actually down first quarter of 2018, it was 6.8%. And I think Atlanta had depending on who you talked to, 18 million square feet plus or minus. So, a lot of good activity.","But there is as you pointed Eric, a fair bit of development down there. So, we've got three buildings. One of which is 589, one of which is a 193, hold on I'm searching for the other one. The other one's 498. The 498 is I'm looking at a prospect list right now, we got two good prospects.","The 193, we've signed a lease for over a half of that building that will be announced at the second quarter. So, we got over 90,000 feet there left and my sheet says we got two prospects for that. And then, the big building the 598, we got three prospects forward.","And so, we're continuing to see good demand across the board and we always are evaluating at this point in the cycle whether we want to hold out for full building tenants or we're into break the building up. And that's a little bit of what's going on depending on the kind of activity that we're seeing.","But again, those buildings have a fair bit of flexibility. So, we can do single tenant dealings or we can break the building up and lease it to two different tenants.","Eric Frankel","Okay. And then maybe another market just to touch on Central PA, any concerns there, I hear that recent activity is a little bit softer and there's since there has been a lot that in development it's going to be coming online in the next few quarters.","James Connor","Yes, as I mentioned in the past, Central PA is has been a little bit slow, we've got a big building there, looking forward on my list here, 832. We got one full building prospected to partial building prospects, half and then three quarters of the building.","So, I would tell you activity is good but that building came into service in the third quarter of last year. And as I like to remind my leasing team out there, I think it's ripe for leasing.","Eric Frankel","Okay. So alright, we'll see it happen. Are there any tenants on the watch list in terms of credit that's that we should know about or there might be a factor in same-store guidance?","James Connor","No, nothing new other than we do have one tenant, one new event I guess you'd say, ZGallerie filed bankruptcy back in March. They are current on the rent, they're down in about 200,000 square feet in Atlanta. From everything we've been told, it's a chapter 11 situation, the facility is pretty critical.","Those are a supply chain. So, we think it'll be business as usual but if something were to change in that, the rent is below market. So, I think it would be a situation of kind of like the HH spreads, there'd be a period of time to retenant it if that would happen but it be at better rounds.","Other than that, nothing new Eric.","Eric Frankel","Okay, final question. You might have seen pretty sure heard of off from the Journo yesterday about a fairly large portfolio platform coming online that might come to market this year. Do you think there's actual appetites to take down a super large portfolio that's worth say $15 billion or $20 billion?","James Connor","Eric, on that I don\u2019t know that order of magnitude, there is an awful lot of dry powder out there chasing logistics properties and I think a number of the deals that have been done over the last couple of years in the let's call it $3 billion to $7 billion range, have had multiple bidders.","So, I don\u2019t think it's out of the question. I don\u2019t think it's out of the question that you could create a partnership that could take down a project of that magnitude. But I was selling guys earlier. Looking at big deals like that, it's a little bit like shopping for a new big boat.","It's really fun to look at it and talk about it but it's financially hard to do.","Eric Frankel","Yes, understood, okay thank you.","Operator","And there are no further question. Thank you.","James Connor","I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to see many of you at the NAREIT conference in New York in early June.","With that, you may disconnect the line.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and we're using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"8142":["Duke Realty Corp.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.","Ronald Hubbard","Thank you, Josh. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2017, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone.","Let me start by saying that 2018 was another outstanding year for Duke Realty. We've met or exceeded all of our 2018 goals, including our revised guidance throughout the year. We capped off the year with an excellent fourth quarter from an operational and financial perspective that sets us up for great 2019.","Let me recap some of the highlights from our outstanding year. We signed over 28 million square feet of leases, which is an all-time record for us. We improved in-service occupancy up 96.3%, which is up from 95.7% at year-end 2017, which is impressive when you consider we placed 4.5 million square feet of spec development in service during the year.","We grew same property NOI at 4.3% and total industrial NOI at 15% over 2017. We attained over 25% GAAP rent growth and 10% cash rent growth on second generation leases for the full year, respectively up from 19% and 7% growth from the previous full year.","We commenced $862 million in new development starts that were 57% pre-leased. We completed $558 million of property dispositions and $353 million of acquisitions. We've refinanced $275 million of debt and reduced our overall borrowing costs by about 30 basis points. We grew FFO per share and AFFO on a share adjusted basis both by 7.3% and increased our regular quarter common dividend by 7.5%.","Now let me turn to some of our leasing and development results for the fourth quarter. We had our strongest quarter of the year with 8.1 million square feet of leases executed. We signed 21 leases in excess of 100,000 square feet, demonstrating the continued strong demand for mid-size and large spaces.","Within this activity were lease transactions with customers such as Kraft Foods, Solo Cup, HD Supply, Amazon and RR Donnelley. We renewed 88% of our leases during the quarter, higher than normal because we pulled several leases forward from 2019 into the fourth quarter. Excluding these pull-forwards, our renewal percentage would have been closer to 70%. Nonetheless, rent growth on second generation was strong at 25% on a GAAP basis and 7% on a cash basis.","I'd also like to note something about our full year rent growth performance I mentioned in my opening remarks. Of the 185 second-generation leases we executed in 2018 at a 25% rent growth rate, only one of those transactions was located in California or New Jersey. Granted, we have primarily newer assets in these coastal markets and thus limited rollover. The point is the strong rent growth throughout 2018 was pretty much evident across all 20 of our markets, without the benefit of those two high growth markets.","I'd also like to touch on our first generation spec leasing in the fourth quarter. We placed four new projects in service late in the year, which increased our first generation space up to 2.5 million square feet, and our spec leasing was a little lighter in the fourth quarter.","I'm pleased to report that since January 1st, we've signed 600,000 square feet of leases in spec space as well as we have 1.3 million square feet with leases in negotiation. In summary, we've got a very strong prospect list for all of our projects and I expect we'll continue to maintain strong leasing volumes.","We started $101 million of development during the quarter across three projects that were 68% leased. Our development pipeline at year-end is $749 million and is 55% pre-leased and expected to generate GAAP yields of 6.5% with margins in excess of 20%.","Now let me turn it over to Nicky Anthony to cover our acquisition and disposition activity for the quarter.","Nicholas Anthony","Thanks, Jim.","We had a light quarter on both acquisitions and dispositions, yet we executed consistent with our strategy. We acquired two projects totaling $143 million. One acquisition this quarter was a two-building, 512,000 square foot project in Seattle. The project is strategically located, a few miles from Sea-Tac International Airport and has excellent access to Interstate 5. This project is one of only four projects with a 36-foot clear height in the Kent Valley submarket and we expect it to produce solid rent growth going forward.","The second acquisition was in Miami, where we exercised direct first offer at Countyline Corporate Park, where we already own over 1 million square feet of logistics properties. Coupled with other assets in the area, we now own 2 million square feet of the most modern facilities in the Medley submarket of Miami. Over a 10 year hold period, we expect to earn an IRR in the 6% to 7% range in these assets, which is in excess of the expected IRR from the dispositions we are using to fund these acquisitions.","Building disposition for the quarter totaled $78 million in the fourth quarter comprised primarily of the Sears building in Pennsylvania, which we announced on last quarter's call, as well as a few smaller non-strategic assets in Indianapolis and Atlanta.","As we've communicated throughout 2018, our acquisition strategy consists of selective acquisitions in high-barrier markets funded with dispositions from Tier 2 markets, with the effect of gradually increasing our geography towards greater Tier 1 exposure, which currently stands at about 60%.","We expect this recycling to continue in 2019 with a number of assets currently being marketed in our Midwest market and expected to close during the first half of this year. The volume resizing will be much lower than in the past several years and expected to be modestly dilutive short-term but accretive long-term. Mark will discuss our expected acquisition and disposition volumes in his 2019 guidance remarks.","I'll now turn it over to Mark to cover his earning results and the balance sheet activities.","Mark Denien","Thanks Nick. Good afternoon, everyone.","I am pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.35 per share, which is consistent with core FFO of $0.35 per share in the third quarter and represented over a 16% increase over the $0.30 per share reported for the fourth quarter of 2017. We reported core FFO of $1.33 per share for the full year 2018 compared to $1.24 per share for 2017, which represents a 7.3% increase over the prior year.","We reported FFO as defined by NAREIT of $1.34 per share for the full year 2018 compared to $1.25 per share for 2017. AFFO totaled $428 million for the full year 2018 and $100 million for the fourth quarter. Our annual results represented a 7.3% increase to AFFO on a share adjusted basis.","The growth in all these metrics is especially impressive when you consider that we had over half of a year of operations from our medical office business in our 2017 results. Since 2016, we've been able to achieve a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 5.5% for FFO and AFFO even after disposing of this $3 billion of assets and substantially deleveraging our balance sheet to provide funding for continued future growth.","Same property NOI growth on a cash basis for the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2018, was 3.5% and 4.3% respectively. This growth is a result of increasing occupancy and rental rates. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted a bit by some free rent on a few of our 2019 pull-forward renewals that Jim mentioned earlier.","On a GAAP basis, full year 2018 same property NOI was about 70 basis points higher than on a cash basis due to free rent and some straight-line rent bad debt adjustments.","We intend to fund growth in 2019 and beyond with an increasing level of annual funds available for reinvestment after dividends now in the range of $130 million to $140 million as well as funds from further non-strategic asset sales and $273 million of notes receivable that will mature at various points through January 2020.","With our leverage levels, we also have the ability to further increase leverage to fund growth while still maintaining our leverage metrics well within the parameters of our current ratings level. We have no significant debt maturities until 2021 and finished 2018 with virtually all of our $1.2 billion line of credit available.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim to discuss our outlook on 2019.","James Connor","Thanks, Mark.","From a macro perspective, we expect the economic environment in 2019 to be relatively steady compared to 2018, with GDP forecast currently in the mid-2% range. We are aware of the current global and domestic political noise and will continue to monitor the situation. Yet at this time, we do not view this as a material risk. We believe demand trends in logistics real estate will remain very strong for the foreseeable future.","Similar to the last few years, we believe moderate GDP growth, continued double-digit growth in e-commerce sales and the competitive pressures to modernize supply chains for all types of distribution, not just e-commerce, will drive outsized demand for modern industrial logistics facilities.","Now let me comment on a few key industrial fundamentals and data points. For the full year 2018, absorption was 230 million square feet, which was about 30 million square feet above new construction deliveries. Vacancy ended the year at 4.3%, a similar level to the last few quarters, with rent growth for 2018 at roughly 7.5%. Looking forward, the tone from our market is 2019 demand and supply should look relatively similar to 2018 and an expected rent growth estimate of 5% according to CBRE.","Other demand indicators for industrial real estate remain positive as well. Port container traffic and intermodal rail traffic were up 4% and 4.5% year-over-year and truck tonnage was up about 7.5% year-over-year. For 2019, we believe absorption will continue to outpace supply and vacancy will remain in the low 4% range. And we expect rent once again to grow in the mid-single digits.","Even if we are to reach equilibrium in supply and demand, overall fundamentals are still relatively tight and we'd still be able to drive portfolio rent growth, maintain our high occupancies and strong leasing volumes for the foreseeable future. And this favorable outlook is reflected in our 2019 guidance, which Mark will now cover in detail.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Jim.","Yesterday we announced a range for 2019 core FFO per share of $1.37 to $1.43 per share, with the midpoint of $1.40. We also announced growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 5.1% and 10.2%, with the midpoint of 7.6%.","In addition, we announced a range for NAREIT defined FFO of $1.33 to $1.43 per share with the midpoint of $1.38. NAREIT defined FFO is expected to be negatively impacted by between $0.02 to $0.04 per share by the new lease accounting rules which will require us to expense a significant portion of the internal leasing costs that we previously capitalized and will tend to have a more negative impact on REITs and operate a full in-house leasing function. For comparability purposes, we will exclude incremental expense from the new accounting standard from our core FFO definition.","Our average stabilized in-service portfolio occupancy range is expected to be 96.7% to 98.7%, down just slightly at the midpoint from the 98.2% record average that we experienced in 2018 and reflects the impact of the stabilization and lease-up of speculative properties.","Same property NOI growth is projected in the range of 3.25% to 4.75%. The base case for this assumes continued rent growth and a slight occupancy decline from our current record levels.","In addition, we continue to expect strong rental rate increases from the leasing efforts on the approximately 5% of our total portfolio that expires during the year. This low level of expirations is a result of our leasing team's being able to accelerate early renewals at very favorable new rental rates. In these early renewals, we essentially capture the rent upside earlier which will have a positive impact in 2019, reduce our risk and allow us to focus on the lease-up of our newer spec space.","In regards to overall NOI growth potential, keep in mind we have grown our industrial NOI by a compounded annual growth rate of 13% over the last two years when you include recently completed development projects that are not yet included in our same property population. For 2019, we believe we can grow total NOI in 2019 over 2018 in the high single digit to low double digit percentage range.","On the capital recycling front, we expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $350 million to $550 million. The majority of these dispositions will come from Midwest markets. Acquisitions are projected in the range of $100 million to $300 million focusing on Tier 1 markets, and development starts are projected in the range of $600 million to $800 million, with a continuing target to maintain the pipeline at about 50% pre-leased. Our pipeline of build to suit prospects continues to remain robust.","Our range of G&A is $57 million to $61 million with a midpoint of $59 million. This is effectively a 5% increase over 2018 G&A levels, which is a result of increased spending on technology, including a new ERP system, as well as additional investments in ES&G initiatives.","On the balance sheet side, we expect debt-to-EBITDA to be in the range of 5.0 to 5.5 times, which reflects a modest increase from 2018, well within the levels expected of our current credit ratings. More specific assumptions and components of our 2019 guidance are available in the 2019 range of estimates document on the Investor Relations website.","And now, I'll turn it back over to Jim for final comments.","James Connor","Thanks Mark.","In conclusion, as we wrap this up and turn it over to Q&A, we believe our high quality assets, exceptional balance sheet and best-in-class operating team we have put us in a great competitive position to take advantage of attractive long-term industrial logistics fundamentals.","As I alluded to last quarter, we feel more certain now that 2019 feels a lot like 2018, barring any material impact from global or domestic political uncertainties. With this, we're confident in continuing to drive long-term cash flow growth and annual dividend growth for our shareholders.","Before we open up the lines, I'd like to acknowledge the entire Duke Realty leadership team for its efforts in producing another great year of execution in our real estate operations and capital activities.","We will now open up the lines for questions, and I would ask that you limit it to one question or perhaps two short questions and you're always welcome to get back in the queue. Josh, you may open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Manny Korchman","Guys, can we talk about the economics of the leases that you pulled forward from '19 into '18, especially rent growth and then what you're rent growth expectations are for the rest of leases that you have expiring in '19?","James Connor","Yes, Manny, I'll try to cover that. I mentioned that - the pull-forward of those leases did have a little bit of a negative impact on fourth quarter same property NOI as you give a even a month's worth of free rent to a tenant to induce them to pull forward, that is negatively impacting us probably 20 bps or so on same property. I would tell you the lease quality of the deals we signed are right in line with what we've been doing for the whole year. If you look at the average lease term of the deals we did in the fourth quarter, it's quite a bit higher or longer lease terms than what we had been operating at.","So if you look at that from a cash rent growth perspective you maybe give $0.01 or $0.02 on the face rate to get them done, to get a longer term, but on a GAAP basis, it's just as high quality and the deals were all very good. And what it allows us to do is really take a lot of risk off the table from '19 and really focus on leasing up our spec space. So it's a long-winded answer for saying we think they are all really good deals and they'll really benefit us in '19.","Manny Korchman","And the rest of the expirations you have left, are they going to be similar to that or is there going to be some differential between those and what you've done?","James Connor","Yes, I think that all the expirations we have in '19, it's only 5% of our portfolio is rolling in '19. I was just looking at - we're down to like - of everything that's expiring over the next 18 months, about 10% to 13% of those were kind of trough deals, which is what we've been doing over the last year, so not a lot of difference there in the vintage leases.","We'll, certainly as we get probably halfway through 2019, look to start pulling forward some 2020 leases and maybe achieve some rent upside. That's not yet in our expiration table for '19 and maybe try to pull some forward there. But I think that the deals that we're coming out of in '19 are very similar to what we experienced this year.","Manny Korchman","Maybe sticking with that point for a second, if we think about sort of the trend of pulling forward leases year-in, year-out, the impact you had from the free rents in 4Q, is that something that's repetitive? And we just haven't spoken about it in the past, so I guess the question is, if we're sitting here a year from now, are we talking about that the same topic for the 2020 leases impacting the 2019 same store?","James Connor","It's always there, I guess, but I think that we pulled forward more of this year and what we normally would do and probably more than what we would expect next year. So you know anytime you do something like that, it's likely you'll have a little bit of an impact but as we sit here today, I think the impact next year wouldn't be near as big as it was this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeremy Metz. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","I guess I just wanted to stick with that topic for one quick second here. Just - Jim, given the strength you see in the market, you talked about your confidence and the fundamentals as you look out, I guess I'm wondering why even go ahead and give any extra free rent or even take a little bit lower rent versus just waiting a bit. It seems like you're very confident on what's out there. So why even give at all?","James Connor","Jeremy, you do it on a case-by-case basis and you evaluate bringing the lease forward, eliminating the risk, taking the - expensing the capital this year. And as - as Mark said, we probably did a little bit more this year than we've done in years gone by and I think 2019 will be less than it was in 2018. But they're all - they're all judgment cases, and at the end of the day when you look at the overall long-term rent growth, we think we executed good transactions that took risk off the table.","Jeremy Metz","All right. And I appreciate that. And then in terms of dispositions, it sounds like you're targeting some product in the Midwest. I think you used the term non-strategic in the press release. The total for 2019 is called $350 million to $550 million.","So I'm wondering beyond this, how much additional of that non-strategic property do you see left in the portfolio at this point. And would you look to accelerate those sales if you're able to - and build additional liquidity? Or would you only do that I guess if you found opportunities on the acquisitions or additional development starts?","James Connor","Well, Jeremy, let me answer the second part first and then I'll let Nick chime in and give a little bit of color. As we've built our business plan for the next few years and we've repeatedly told everybody we're going to significantly reduce our acquisition and disposition activity from the last five years. So we're really trying to rein that in and manage the dilution that comes from that.","We do have a pretty good target list of those non-strategic assets, and I think going forward, without giving '20 guidance and '21 guidance, I think we've pretty consistently said you can expect the same kind of levels. And much like we did in 2018, if we find exceptional acquisition opportunities in some of the high-barrier markets, or more importantly, increased development opportunities, yes, we will accelerate dispositions much like we did in 2018. So, Nick, you want to give a little color?","Nicholas Anthony","At this point, Jeremy, our - it's not about quality as far as the non-strategic assets. The reality is, it's more about geography. So we're really focused on markets where we're - we've got over-allocated and redirecting that capital into markets where we are under-allocated. So that's what you'll see going forward for the most part. And yes, we are being proactive, so that if a development or an acquisition - bigger opportunity exists, we can react quickly to it going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Just going back to your 2019 guidance for same store NOI. Can you help build up the high end of the guidance, the 4.75%? What are the different levers?","Mark Denien","Yes, I'll try that, Ki Bin. We've been saying that our average rent bump is in the 2% in the quarter to 2%, 3% range, give or take. So you kind of start with that. And then the these deals that we pulled forward, in addition to the 5% we had rolling where we think we're going to get tremendous rent growth, you combine the deals we pulled forward and the burn-off of some free rent from 2018 and the '19 and in the strong rent growth that we already achieved on deals we signed late in '18 and deals we expect to sign in '19, that's another - call it 2.5% to 3%.","So that gets you well above the top end of the guidance. But then we temper that down with an occupancy\/bad debt, if you will, adjustment of, call it maybe 100 basis points at the midpoint. And that's a combination of - coming off of record high occupancies, we don't think at this point in the year, it's prudent to expect that we can keep that. So there will probably be a little bit of retraction there. And then on top of that, we had virtually no bad debt expense in 2018.","So we typically go in and budget more historical norms, it would be more like 40 basis points. So without that occupancy\/bad debt adjustment, that's how you get to the top end and maybe even above the top end, but we certainly need to bake some of that into our numbers. So that's how I would answer that.","Ki Bin Kim","And in terms of your development start guidance, it's obviously down a little bit compared to what you did in 2018. Is that a - is that just because it's hard to time those things or project it? Or is that more of a statement about your risk tolerance about development at this point of the cycle?","James Connor","Well, Ki Bin, it's a couple of things. It is down from both our '17 and '18 results, but we thought you could appreciate it's dramatically higher than the guidance we gave at the outset of 2018. It's kind of a good, middle of the road number. What drives that? Remember, our commitment to stay at or above 50% in the development pipeline is leasing the spec space and continuing to be able to sign build to suit transactions.","So I think you'll see us have an opportunity to get ahead of that number if we can accelerate first gen spec leasing in the first half of the year or if we can sign a number of large build to suits and keep that development pipeline. So we do think we have some upside and that's what we're focused about trying to get a pretty optimistic outlook.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nick Yulico. Please go ahead.","Nick Yulico","I just want to follow up on the same-store NOI growth question. Mark, I'm still confused about this. If you guys did 4.3% same-store NOI growth cash basis last year and you got 60 basis points of occupancy growth, the midpoint for this year is 4% and you're talking about 100 basis points of negative impact from occupancy or bad debt. I'm struggling to see how those numbers make sense.","Mark Denien","Well, I'm not sure if I could follow you, Nick. But I think a lot of it's got to do with the deals that we've already signed that were a negative impact to 2018 compared to '19. And just take, for example, I mentioned deals that got signed with free rent for one month, maybe.","So you have zero rent in December of '18 and now you're going to have full rent in December of '19, plus, you're going to get the roll-up of the rents on all those deals. So that, like I said, will be significantly impactful to 2019 cash flow. So that's probably the main example. Same store is a bit of a Rubik's cube. You can't just look at expirations and do simple math on growth on rollover and things like that because it's - can be a - sometimes it's a leading indicator, sometimes it's a lagging indicator.","So I appreciate the confusion on how you get to the numbers sometimes, because I get confused myself. It's a complicated formula. But I think a lot of that lies in the fact of the deals that we've already signed in late '18, it really had no impact on '17 to '18, they had significant impact from '18 to '19.","Nick Yulico","So there's some extra free rent burnoff benefit this year.","Mark Denien","In '19, there will be. Sure.","Nick Yulico","And then just to be clear, the 100 basis point impact for occupancy bad debt, is that at the midpoint of the guidance for same store NOI growth?","Mark Denien","Yes, that's right around the midpoint, I would say.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","So Prologis commented on their call that they set their guidance and then two weeks before they released it, they took a more conservative cut to it. I'm just curious what was your process to come up with your guidance range and how you thought about kind of stretch versus super-conservative outlooks.","James Connor","Well, Jamie, Mark and I can both give you a comment. We have a rather - like the ground-up budgeting process that we use and then we start to roll that up in great detail in November and December, work through it over the holidays and ultimately with the Board in January.","I think the advantage of having our call 10 days later than our friends from the West Coast is we seem to be through some of the uncertainty that mid and the end of December cause and we were at a 52 week high yesterday. So I think there's a little bit more optimism and - than there was perhaps 10 days or two weeks ago. So I think that's probably the biggest contributor.","Mark Denien","Yes, the only thing I would add to that, Jamie - like Jim mentioned, there's obviously a lot of news and noise, but we continue to not really see it affect our business on the ground and we're still pretty bullish about that. The only thing I would say from a cautious tone, and I don't know if you call it cautious or prudent, I think it's just prudent, I just mentioned bad debt expense and budgeting and some things like that.","We do have some of that in this budget and in our guidance numbers that are above 2018 levels. The 2018 levels were historically low, historically great, depending on what word you want to use. So we have some prudency in our numbers, but we had those in our numbers for the last couple of months through this process as, Jim mentioned.","Jamie Feldman","And then I guess just thinking about the development pipeline, where do you think there is the most opportunity to do more starts? Like which markets and which markets you think are starting to see more supply and get fully built out?","James Connor","Well, Jamie, I guess, it's easier to tell you that the handful of markets that we're watching a little bit, and I am sure it comes as no surprise. We've talked about the south side Chicago, that RE market. There's a few too many big buildings and things are little bit slow down there. So I don't think you'll see us venture into that market with spec. South Dallas is - and Dallas had a great year overall but South Dallas just continues to be a little bit small - or a little bit soft, and there are too many barriers to entry.","So there's a little bit too much product down there. I think Central PA is a little soft, right now. We haven't seen quite as good a demand in Central PA as we've seen. So those are probably the only three that we're somewhat cautious about. But we've got really good activity across all of our markets. So I think we continue to see opportunity for both spec development and build-to-suits in virtually all of our 22 markets.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead.","Blaine Heck","So, looking at your development pipeline, you guys have a lot of vacancy delivering in the first quarter. Jim, you talked about some of the leasing you've done since the end of the year. But even with those leases should we expect a drop in occupancy in Q1? And then, I know it's just one quarter, but can you comment on whether the pace of leasing has changed on spec development projects or is this more of a mix or maybe regional issue?","James Connor","No. I think, Blaine, this is more just simply a phenomenon of timing. I mean, I mentioned those four spec buildings. Three of those four spec buildings we literally delivered, literally at the very end of the year, within the last 10 days of the year. So we really didn't give ourselves much chance to impact leasing on those, given the timing. We think we will lose some occupancy in the first and second quarter as a result of the amount of spec that we have coming in service.","But I would tell you, given the prospect list and what we've seen just in the first 30 days of January, I'm not - I'm not the least bit concerned about that. I think it's really just timing, and I think the next time we're - at the end of the first quarter, we'll be able to have good results, and we've got a number of projects coming in service in the first quarter. So we'll still have the same mountain to climb, but I think you'll see good leasing volume.","Blaine Heck","And then just following up on the pull-forward of the renewals topic, can you just give a little color on those negotiations? Are you guys actively going out and approaching tenants ahead of their expiration or is it a case where the tenant approaches you and want to lock in for longer because they think in the near term, maybe they can get some free rent, but longer term rents are just going up from here? I guess just a little color on that conversation would be helpful.","James Connor","Blaine, it's actually both. So our leasing and development people are out working 18 to 24 months in advance of lease expirations. And some companies just don't know and they want to wait right up until 90 days before the lease expires. And those are the companies that are paying the premium for that.","Those that understand that they have a mission critical facility and that they know they want to be there for a long term tend to engage us a little bit sooner. And it's really a function of what the tenant needs, how long the lease is. They might be looking for some capital items.","So some of those that Mark alluded to earlier that we elected to pull forward, we might have had capital to spend this year. So elected to take that - sign the lease this year and take that charge this year. And as he said, sometimes there's a little bit of free rent to induce tenants to do that, but some of those lease renewal terms are 10 and 12 years, and that's a pretty small price to pay in order to get good long-term commitments when you want them from credit tenants.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Carroll. Please go ahead.","Mike Carroll","Nick, can you throw some color on the recent acquisitions? And where do you see the upside in buying those properties, albeit in great markets at a 4% cap rate? What does that provide Duke at those prices?","Nicholas Anthony","What it provides to us, it allows us to diversify our geography. We were very under-allocated in NorCal and Seattle, two high-barrier Tier 1 markets. And we think that the overall risk profile will be better if we can diversify and get a greater exposure there and lower exposure in some of the other markets where we're exiting out of.","Mike Carroll","Can you talk about I guess your current platform in those markets? And I guess then what you're saying is that you've got some platform value by expanding in those markets and will help you continue to grow going forward?","James Connor","Yes, Mike, I guess, let me add a comment to that. I think you're - we've owned - we've owned property in Northern California and Seattle. But we've - in the second half of last year put boots on the ground. So we elected to acquire a couple of assets to give our local operating team a little bit of momentum in the marketplace. Our real priority is to build a development pipeline out there. But as you know in high barrier Tier 1 markets that takes some time.","So we're hopeful we'll have some projects underway in the third or fourth quarter of 2019. But this is a way as Nick said to take Midwestern assets that had a lower than normal growth profile and reallocate that money into Tier 1 high barrier markets where we think we've got a better long-term growth profile.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Mark, can you just help me - help us understand with the leases you just signed on your development pipeline, how that affects your earnings guide and how much of a - and how much lease-up of your - of your un-stabilized properties is included in your FFO guidance?","Mark Denien","Yes, Eric. I mean, it's - I'll start with a very general comment. We underwrite a one-year lease-up on all of our spec development. Just generally, in this budget guidance at the midpoint, it's more reflective of our run rate that we've been experiencing for the last couple years, which is closer to nine months.","So on a lease-up basis, I would tell you on average the development pipeline that we had in here is getting leased up on the ninth or tenth month and on a commencement basis, a month or two behind that.","Eric Frankel","So is it fair to say though that the 600,000 square feet of signed leases and 1.3 million square feet of leases negotiation, that's kind of part of where your - that kind of the core point to where your midpoint is?","Mark Denien","Sure. I mean, the - when we put our guidance out there, we knew these leases were in process. So, yeah, that's part of our guidance.","Eric Frankel","And just a quick follow-up question on capital allocation for next year, for anybody. Is there any thought that given this is where asset values are in kind of the state of the world that it's worth maybe even if your - the credit rating agencies would allow you to increase leverage a little bit, just to keep leverage a little bit lower to have little more dry-power - dry powder, and in order to do that, maybe sell off a little bit more of the - of your - of the Midwest bucket?","James Connor","Well, I'll let Nick speak specifically to the asset sell side. But I would tell you from a balance sheet dry powder and credit market standpoint. We're effectively not moving our leverage metrics at all. I mean, maybe debt to EBITDA goes up 2 basis point, 0.02 or something like that. And the credit rating agencies are very, very happy with us.","Our metrics right now are A levels, and when we talk about being able to moderately increase leverage to stay well within our current levels. The way I look at that is to stay at the high, high BBB plus level. So I don't - wouldn't view that we need more dry powder or anything like that. But I'll let Nick address the specifics to the asset sales themselves.","Nicholas Anthony","Yes, I would say - I would say that we're very comfortable with the more moderate type activity on the acquisition\/disposition side. The overall - we're very happy with the overall quality of our portfolio.","As you can - as we mentioned earlier, we're getting great growth out of that portfolio. So we will be opportunistic. If we see some opportunities where we like we can always react to that and accelerate dispositions to fund that, but right now we're very comfortable with the volumes that we've been doing.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Guinee. Please go ahead.","John Guinee","John Guinee here. Nick, I have to ask you this. When you tell people with confidence that you're buying at a 4 cap and $200 a foot, can you do that without smiling and breaking out laughing?","Nicholas Anthony","John, they're great assets. And also keep in mind that we're also getting great pricing where we're selling assets.","John Guinee","I know. All right. Jim, I took my eye off the ball and I noticed that land in the last 12 months went from a little under $200 million to $340 million, about a 70% increase. Can you talk about where and why and how quickly that gets monetized?","James Connor","Well, absolutely, John. As we've said, we've maintained that kind of the sweet spot for us is a land bank of $300 million to $400 million. And you will not see us go above $400 million. We might get close to it for a while. And I can tell you the biggest attributing factor without going line by line through the land inventory is our buying, development opportunity is in high barrier Tier 1 markets.","So we're buying sites where we can do large logistics centers in Northern New Jersey. We're buying sites in Northern California that we can develop and infill in Southern California. And the key for us is our kind of just-in-time land practice. So I don't want to tie up sites, particularly large expensive sites and then ride them through the entitlement process for two or three years. So we're comfortable either paying the landowner or waiting it out.","So you'll see us put a lot of that expensive land into production in the first half of the year. So we actually expect at the end of the first quarter that land inventory will go up slightly. And then I think you'll see in the third quarter that land inventory come way back down as we put a lot of those expensive larger projects into construction.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dave Rodgers. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers","Jim, you talked about positive absorption in 2019. At least, that's something that I took from your comments earlier. But you have guided down on occupancy and you've talked about kind of floor leasing and development which you explained recently. But I guess if you talk about 70% retention last year, excluding the pull-forward, what do you think that retention is this year? Is that weighing on it? And what are the factors that are kind of causing that rollover just given how tight the market is?","James Connor","Dave, I think you answered the question. It's the tightness of the market. The reality of it is when you've got vacancy at 4.3%, unless you in one of those very few submarkets, we've got around the country that were little soft with a number of large options out there, companies don't have a lot of options out there. And most of the options that are out there are new construction at today's new construction prices.","So I think that's probably the biggest factor that allows us to continue to renew tenants and push rents. And as we - we all know renewals are less expensive than new deals. We put less capital in, we pay less leasing commissions and there's no downtime. So as long as we can continue the strong performance in our rent growth metrics, I'm happy to renew 70% of our tenants.","Dave Rodgers","And what are the biggest reasons that you're losing the other 30%? I realize 70% is good. I'm just saying what the other reason is. Is it the new supply that you're losing out too?","James Connor","No, generally not. Probably the biggest problem we have in our in-service portfolio's 98% is we don't have available space for our clients that need additional space. Sometimes we'll get clients that have a degree of uncertainty about what they want to do and clients will say we need a six month extension or a 12 month extension and in today's marketplace we're not really interested in doing that.","So we've had to park company with a few people that needed some more flexibility and we were committed to getting longer-term leases with good rent bumps. So it's really driven by the tightness of the market.","Dave Rodgers","And then maybe for Nick or Jim, sticking with you, with regard to non-strategic, give us a sense of kind of how you defined that or maybe redefined that. Is that purely regional geography, is that local geography, building, quality? What's driving that number to be a little bit higher I think than most of us expected?","James Connor","I think maybe nonstrategic is a bit of a misnomer. I would tell you, we cleaned out the real non-strategic portfolio a number of years ago, and it's really geographic balancing. So as we're trying to kind of right-size some of our Midwestern markets, we're looking at the portfolios within those different cities and taking the - what I would say is the worst our lowest performing components of that portfolio and selling it off, and then as Nick said, redeploying the asset. So again, it's really not nonstrategic. It's right-sizing markets and reallocating capital into the coastal and high growth markets that we want to be in.","Dave Rodgers","Last from me. Mark, how much we build in for ATM issuance this year?","Mark Denien","We have nothing in here for that, Dave.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Mueller. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","I have two quick Mark questions. First, I guess where in the income statement are the new lease accounting costs showing up? And then second, you mentioned about - I think it was $120 million or $140 million of notes receivable. What's the interest rate on those?","Mark Denien","Yes, the - first of all, the lease accounting we are going to make it as clear as we possibly can and it's going to be its own line. So it will be - it's not a G&A item, it's not an NOI item, it's part of - it's part of other expenses, so we'll put it on its own line and show exactly what the number is so it will be easy to find. As far as the second question, the interest rate on those notes is 4%.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vikram Malhotra. Please go ahead.","Vikram Malhotra","Just wanted to clarify and maybe get at a bit more color. When you talk about sort of your expectations for market rent growth in that 5% range, can you give us a bit more color, sort of what markets and what levels are sort of above that and then what's below that to get to you that average? And I just wanted to make sure there is no - while there's no conservatism sort of baked into your guidance numbers, in that market number there you're not sort of hair cutting it at all.","James Connor","We're chuckling because we always have to put a little bit of conservatism in there. But I would tell you, similar to our rent growth projections for the last several years, you - we're - you're seeing better rent growth in the coastal and the high barrier markets, so I think you'll see those probably in the mid to high single digits, and I think the second tier and smaller markets will probably be in the low to mid single digits and you average them all together and that's pretty consistently about 5%. And if the market holds and we continue to see demand outpace supply like we did in 2018, then we'll probably have a little bit better year than that, like we did in 2018.","Vikram Malhotra","And then just in your aim of sort of diversifying away geographically and getting out of some of the Midwest, can you talk about sort of the appetite to do larger, bigger portfolio transaction entity transactions just sort of get - achieving that goal sooner?","James Connor","We can give you a little color. I'd like to tell you we have the opportunity to look at every deal that's out there in the marketplace. Unfortunately, most of them don't line up like that. There to be more geographically diverse portfolio.","So while we might be accelerating dispositions in some of our markets, we wouldn't be able to put it all back into the Tier 1 high barrier. The only deal that we've found in the last few years which was sizable and allowed us to do that was the Bridge portfolio that that we closed a couple of years ago. And there we were able to put just short of - I don't know, $900 million into New Jersey, South Florida and Southern California.","So that's one of the - only one I think we've seen. And the other comment I guess I would make is real estate is really, really expensive out there. And particularly when you look at entity level, by the time you put a premium on top of that you're putting a pretty hefty price and you'd have to - you'd have to be able to squeeze some pretty significant savings out to be able to demonstrate to the shareholders that you're creating value.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Manny Korchman. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. So, Mark, I wanted to go back to the Rubik's cube, which, granted, as a kid I used to peel off the stickers. So maybe you can help me do that in terms of the same store NOI. So your guidance was 4.6%. You were trade - you were trending at 4.6% at the nine months. So coming at 4.3% means you have about $1.3 million of missed and certainly on a quarterly basis that translates into, call it an almost $5.3 million of annualized NOI, assuming full quarter impact. Your lease roll for 2019 went from 10.1 million square feet down to 7.4 million square feet, so almost 3 million square feet of pull-forward if it's apples to apples. So give us a little bit more detail about what the real drag was, how much free rent was given on a - on the term, how much impact was that? Just so that we can start to put all the colors together on this Rubik's cube.","Mark Denien","Okay. Let me try, Michael. Couple of things. So I think the midpoint of our - revised guidance, you're really focused on 2018 Q4 results, correct?","Michael Bilerman","Yes, I'm looking at - your guidance for '18 had a midpoint of 4.6%, right? It was 4.2% to 4.8%. You're trending that way at the nine months and for the full year 2018 you came out with the results last night at 4.3%, which was towards the low end. You mentioned on the call it was free rent. It is about a $1.3 million of impact, but that's for the full year. Clearly, that would have a much more meaningful impact to 4Q results.","Mark Denien","Yes, so first of all, I think the midpoint was 4.5%, not 4.6%. So I think we missed it by 20 basis points. And it is just - the number one, I would say is, it's a guidance number. You don't always hit the midpoint of your guidance. So I'll start with that. So whatever you have to really look at is 20 basis points.","So there are certainly some extra free rent and I think if you look at our supplemental, you will see an increase in free rent in the quarter. That's the biggest factor. I mentioned bad debt expense. We had virtually zero in 2018. That is true. But everything that we did have was in the fourth quarter. Not that it was significant, but that's another contributing factor. So it's just a lot of little things. There's not one major thing I can point to that adds up to that 20 basis point difference between our result and the midpoint.","Michael Bilerman","But just given how strong fundamentals were going and where you were at the nine months, one was expected to be at or above the midpoint. But if we just put that comment aside, on this pull-forward of leasing, how much square footage, is it 3 million square feet, how much free rent? Have you given like a month's free rent, few months free rent? And then is there a lag into 2019 if some of that free rent hit in the fourth quarter and some of that spills over to January or February?","Mark Denien","No spillover into January, and I would say, on average, it was about half a month.","Michael Bilerman","On that - on the leasing that was done?","Mark Denien","Correct.","Michael Bilerman","And then in terms of the bad debt, that's cash? Or that would have been a GAAP number because we're talking about cash same store NOI, not GAAP same store NOI.","Mark Denien","It's cash. It was cash.","Michael Bilerman","And what amount of bad debt was it? $200,000, $300,000?","Mark Denien","Sorry?","Michael Bilerman","How much - how much was it?","Mark Denien","Yes, about $300,000.","Michael Bilerman","$300,000? So the $300,000, plus the combined of probably $0.5 million to $1 million of extra free rent definitely takes you down to that number.","Mark Denien","Yes.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Thank you for solving it.","Mark Denien","I don't know if we solved it, Michael, but we try.","Michael Bilerman","You came closer.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","So a quick follow-up on the acquisitions. Obviously, you guys already highlighted that you're - you're trying to gain some scale in some of the markets. But can you clarify in the 4% cap rate, are those - are those - those are recently completed buildings, so the leases are relatively fresh, is that right? So that means there is really not that much embedded NOI growth baked into that cap rate.","Mark Denien","That's correct, Eric. They are all newly developed assets. The rents are slightly below market and there's good escalators in those leases.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","James Feldman","I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you guys talk about what you're expecting on the dispositions in terms of a cap rate?","Mark Denien","Yes, the cap rate for 2019?","James Feldman","Yes, what's in the guidance.","Mark Denien","Yes, we - to be consistent with the year we had in 2018.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Sumit Sharma. Please go ahead.","Sumit Sharma","All right, thank you for taking my question. Just wondering about what is your impression of the utilization level across your portfolio? So, one of your peers is actually giving out this number pretty consistently, and I just wanted to get a sense of where you guys stood particularly as you're property profile is different?","James Connor","Yes, Sumit, I would tell you that I think our property utilization is above 90%. A lot of our clients as I - in answering somebody else's question, had expansion needs that quite candidly, we can - we can handle as we're able to build some more - to build some more product that we take them to new build-to-suit. And across the system, we just got very, very few clients that have excess space or space that they still need to grow into.","And we've had a number of clients over the course of the last couple of years say to us in hindsight when we've built, let's say, a 750,000 foot building, they wish they had the courage to build another 100,000 or 200,000 square feet because now they need it and they're going to have to figure out how to - how to handle that expansion. So I think it's - I think it's very high. It's as good as it's ever been.","Sumit Sharma","And if I may ask a follow-up which is completely different, what's - what's the rate? Could you - could you give us color on the rate of financing? So I'm looking for - If you had to put a first mortgage on a warehouse, a group of warehouse, what's the spread to LIBOR that you're seeing or the LTV ask from your friendly banker or lender?","James Connor","Well, I'm not sure we are the best people to ask that question, to be honest, Sumit, because that's not how we finance things. I don't even actually want to speculate because we're strictly an unsecured borrower. But I would say it's - I don't - I'm not even going to say because - ","Mark Denien","Nick, do you have any thoughts based on dispositions? I mean, we're not giving any financing...","James Connor","And even our buyers are cash buyers. So...","Nicholas Anthony","A lot of the buyers now are cash buyers [indiscernible] on the billings we buy it, we're not assuming debt these days. So we just don't see as much. And a lot of times we\u2019re not privy of these debt financing terms on the sales.","Operator","And we have no further questions at the moment.","Ronald Hubbard","I want to thank everyone for joining the call today.

We met or exceeded all of our beginning of the year goals and capped off the year with an excellent fourth quarter.","In light of the suburban office disposition we announced yesterday, today's prepared remarks will focus on the sale along with our 2015 guidance and we'll provide limited highlights of the fourth quarter in 2014.","So, now on to the sale. We just agreed to sell portfolio suburban office properties totalling 6.9 million sq. ft. and 57 acres of undeveloped land. An affiliate of Starwood Capital Group in a joint venture with affiliates of Vanderbilt Parkers and Trinity Capital Advisors agreed to purchase the portfolio for $1.12 billion. The 52 billion portfolio includes all of the company\u2019s wholly owned suburban office assets in Nashville, Rowley, South Florida and St. Louis.","One of the buildings in Rowley is currently under construction. The in-service portfolio is 91.6% lease and the buildings have an average age of 15.5 years. The portfolio is covered by only $40 million of secured debt that will be paid off at closing. Buyer will assume all the leasing and property management responsibilities upon closing.","As far as the transaction, company will provide seller financing of $200 million in the form of a first mortgage and a portion of the underlying properties, which will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.5% and of a maturity date of December 31, 2016. The note will be prepayable without penalty beginning in January of 2016 and will be collateralized by properties with an approximate 75% loaned value.","Closing in a transaction is subject to certain customary conditions and is expected to occur on or about April 1, 2015 except for the one property currently under construction, which is expected to close upon completion late 2015.","This transaction will result in a book and tax gain and is possible that there is special dividend may be required but it is too early in the year to predict with any certainty whether or how much that might be. We will implement various tax planning strategies to minimize the impact of this transaction, but [indiscernible] with a redeployment of this capital.","I would remind everyone that we have about 750 million of dispositions in 2014 with only a 131 million of acquisitions and we still do not have any special dividend requirements. I also want to point out that although this transaction will be added to FFO in the short-term, it has minimal impact on AFFO and after the sale we will be positioned with an improved portfolio in a much stronger balance sheet to enable future growth.","Now, let me quickly recap our outstanding year. We are selling 25 million sq. ft of leases which is very impressive given our all-time high occupancy levels. We improved in-service occupancy to 95.3% from 95.2% at a prior yearend and we grew same property NOI of strong 4.4%. We commenced 563 million and new development starts, acquired over a 131 million of industrial and medical office properties and completed 736 million in dispositions. We issued 300 million of unsecured debt at a yield of 3.9% and we redeemed all of our outstanding preferred stock totalling 448 million, which had a weighted average dividend rate of 6.57% and we raised 289 million of common equity during the year, which we used to fund our development pipeline and significantly improved our overall leverage profile.","We continued our solid execution of asset recycling, we sold 212 million of assets during the fourth quarter, this was comprised of 13 buildings across 10 transactions with a mix of suburban office, older industrial and one of our last remaining retain projects, all primarily located in the Midwest. For the full year proceeds from asset and land sales were 736 million and 37 million respectively, both near the high point of expectations from the year.","Similar to previous years, the proceeds from these dispositions were accretively recycled in the development projects and leverage reduction. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2014th operating results and our capital recycling efforts, which further strengthen our portfolio and balance sheet.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor to give a little more color on our leasing activity and development pipeline. ","Jim Connor","Thanks, Denny. Good afternoon, everybody. As Denny mentioned, we had a solid quarter in leasing with over 4 million square feet executed and we also commenced $144 million of new development starts.","Our overall in-service occupancy ended the year at 95.3% steady from the third quarter and up a 110 basis points year-over-year. These strong fundamentals have contributed to year-over-year net effective rent growth and sign renewals across the entire portfolio of 11% in the fourth quarter and nearly 9% for the entire year.","With respect to leasing our in-service industrial portfolio all of that four of our 22 industrial markets are over 90% leased and 15 are over 95% leased with an overall occupancy level of 96.4%. Our medical office portfolio continues to produce strong results with approximately 460,000 square feet of leases signed during the year, ending the year with overall occupancy at 94.4%, a 60 basis points improvement over a year in 2013.","Turning to development, we started 25 new projects during 2014 totalling $563 million and projected stabilized costs. Solid results, which met our expectations coming into the year. For the fourth quarter we started a $144 million of projects across 7 deals with a big quarter from our medical office, which I will expand on in a moment.","It always started 640,000 square feet in the fourth quarter, with an expected initial stabilized cash yield of 8.2% and a weighted average gap yield of 9.2%. Regarding a few specific development deals we started a 206,000 square foot, 47% pre-leased industrial project in Houston adjacent to the cargo area at the International Airport.","Our medical office platform had a fantastic quarter with four new starts totalling about 200,000 square feet. All four projects are a 100% preleased for 15 years to high quality health system including AMERIS, Centerre, and TriHealth. Looking forward we have a very strong development pipeline for 2015.","Finally, we started a speculative suburban office project in Broward County, Florida, at our Pembroke Point Park totalling 144,000 square feet. There are very limited blocks the class A space available in this market. So, we believe it was a strategic time to monetize part of our office land and create some value with development. Also note, we expect high single-digit to double-digit returns on this project. Including the solid fourth-quarter activity, our development pipeline at year-end is over $498 million, with a weighted average stabilized initial cash yield of 7.4%, and a GAAP yield of 8.1% and is 58% preleased in the aggregate.","I would also like to note that during the fourth quarter of 2014, we conducted a comprehensive review of all of our landholdings. At the conclusion of this review, we recognized $25 million of impairment charges on additional 583 acres with a basis of a $130 million of our land bank that we had previously planned to develop and now plan to sell. The land that was re-designated was office land, but there were a few industrial private parcels in some markets, where were we had to determine we had excess supply.","So, at December 31, 2014, we own 1144 acres of land that we intend to sell with a basis after considering all of the impairment charges of a $185 million. It should be noted that the estimated sale price of a significant portion of this land is higher than its basis, but we are not allowed under accounting rules to write up land to its estimated fair market value.","Our development land inventory, including our share of joint venture land at December 31, 2014, totals 2077 acres with a basis of $384 million. This development land can accommodate over 36 million square feet of primarily industrial development.","Now, let me turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results, capital plans, including the use of proceeds from the proposed $1.1 billion portfolio sale and guidance for the upcoming year.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.30 per share compared to $0.29 per share in the quarter 2013. Core FFO for the quarter was positively impacted by $574 million up 85% preleased development projects that were placed in service during the year, as well as continuing improvements, and virtually all operating metrics in core portfolio. These improvements were somewhat offset by lower income from service operations and an increase in general and administrative expense, both of which were anticipated. We reported Core FFO a $18 per share for the full year, compared to a $10 per share, from 2013.","This 7.3% growth over 2014 is impressive when considering the significant property sales and substantial deleveraging that we accomplish during 2014. I am also pleased to report AFFO of $0.96 per share for the full year and $0.21 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014.","Second-generation capital expenditures were relatively consistent between the two years and growth in AFFO over 2013 was mainly attributable to the same strong operating results that drove the growth in Core FFO.","In summary, we outperformed expectations for all key operating metrics that we established at the beginning of 2014. And we expect continued solid operating fundamentals in 2015.","Now, I will quickly recap the capital activities for the quarter. As previously announced in November, we took advantage of continued low interest rates and issued $300 million of unsecured notes, which had a stated rate of 3.75% and an effective rate of 3.9%. I would note that we issued the stat before we entered into detailed discussions on a suburban office sell we just announced.","During the fourth quarter 2014, we redeemed all remaining amounts of both our 6.5% Series K preferred shares and 6.6% Series L preferred shares for a total redemption of $333 million. These redemptions when coupled with the third quarter redemption about $96 million, up 6.65% Series J preferred shares will result in an ongoing annual reduction to preferred dividends of over $29 million. And we now have no preferred stock outstanding. We ended the year with $106 million outstanding underlying credit.","We expect to pay our line down in early 2015 using the proceeds from near-term dispositions, including the plan of Midwest industrial portfolio that we discussed last quarter. Even without considering the larger suburban office portfolio disposition, our pipeline of dispositions for early 2015 is strong, and we expect to be able to cover our first quarter debt maturities and development needs with the proceeds from these dispositions.","Now, let me touch on some of the assumptions related to the suburban office portfolio disposition that we announce yesterday and its impact on earnings and leverage metrics. I will remind everyone the relevant details of this transaction are included on a separate presentation in the investor relations section of our website.","After consideration of the $200 million of seller financing, net proceeds are expected to be about $900 million. We intend to use the majority of these proceeds to de-lever further through debt repayments as well as to fund our develop pipeline throughout the remainder of the year. We have almost a $177 million of secured debt maturing in 2015 at an average interest rate of 4.2%, and we have $250 million of unsecured debt maturing in February of 2015 and another 600 million of unsecured notes maturing through early 2017, with an average interest rate of 6.1%. There would be prepayment penalties associated with most of this debt, but to accomplish deleveraging it is likely we\u2019d prepay somewhere between $500 million to $700 million of debt. This would still leave us with ample liquidity to cover capital needs for the remainder of the year and also significantly improve our overall leverage profile. We expect that our run rate for fixed charge coverage should be close to 3.0 times by yearend. Our debt to EBITDA should be 6.5 times or lower by year-end and debt to gross asset should be in the low 40% range.","Now I will turn the call back over to Denny.","Denny Oklak","Thanks Mark. Now turning to our 2015 outlook, yesterday we announced a range for 2015 FFO per share of a $12 to a $20 with a midpoint of a $16 per share and AFFO per share of $0.96 to a $4, with a midpoint per share of a $1. This considers the effect of the suburban office portfolio sell we announced.","First from a macro perspective, we expect the economic environment in 2015 to continue at about its current pace, and continued solid real estate fundamentals which are reflected in the guidance. A few specifics and some of the anticipated key performance metrics outlined on the 2015 range of estimates page provided on our website are as follows: Our average in-service portfolio occupancy range for 2015 is expected to be 94.5% to 95.5%, the midpoint of which would be about 20 basis points better than our 2014 results. Lease expirations for 2015 are only 8% of our annual revenues. Same property NOI is projected to grow at a range of 2% to 4%, which is based on a steady occupancy and continued rental rate growth.","On the capital recycling front, we expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and proceeds from land dispositions of $50 million to $80 million. These dispositions include the Midwest industrial portfolio we previously disclosed and the just announced suburban office portfolio sale. The remaining dispositions will be focused primarily on additional on suburban office and the last few retail assets. Acquisitions are projected in the range of 75 million to 100 million. We expect to be pretty selective given today's pricing environment. Development starts are projected in the range of 400 million to 500 million. We expect to fund our development pipeline with proceeds from our building and land dispositions. Service operation should be in the range of 15 million to 20 million, bit below our 2014 run rate due to a few high-margin contracts that were completed in 2014. G&A expense is expected to be in the range of 45 million to 50 million, it should also be noted that our guidance or G&A expense in core FFO oh does not include any charges related to severance that may be incurred as a result of the suburban office disposition.","So in closing, I just like to thank the entire Duke Realty team for their efforts for another great year of executing on operations and capital allocation. Our collective actions are producing reliable, steady cash flow growth for shareholders. I also like to thank everyone involved in bringing this major suburban office sale together very quickly.","We had an excellent 2014 and are we positioned for continued growth in 2015 and beyond. With that we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions], our first question is from the line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Thanks, good afternoon. I guess just focusing on the portfolio sale, can you talk a little bit about the decision to sell those particular markets at this point? It seems like the Sunbelt's doing pretty well, we're seeing corporate relocation activity. I'm just wondering, in your internal debates, how you thought about holding versus selling and why now?","Denny Oklak","Well, I think if you look at just our overall strategy, we have continued to downsize our suburban office portfolio. We set out a goal a number of years ago to get that to 25% and we reached that at the end of last year. And so we've been really, I would say, very selective on what we were trying to sell. And I think when you look at those markets, Jamie, I would agree with you clearly, places like Raleigh and South Florida and Nashville also have held up very well and done very well in comparison to some of the other markets that we've been in the Midwest, some of which we sold out of a couple years ago in the other large sale we did. But we've always kept our options open and knew that if an offer happened to come along for a larger portion of our suburban office assets that we thought was very competitive pricing for us, we would make the move to really downsize that portfolio further and reinvest those proceeds again back into the development pipeline for bulk industrial and MOV.","And it just happened to come along. And as I said, we think the pricing's very competitive right now, so we've made the internal decision after a fair amount of discussion that we thought we should move forward with that for the long-term benefits of the company.","Jamie Feldman","And are you making any kind of call on those markets peaking out here? Or do you think they still have room to run?","Denny Oklak","I would say and then Jim can chime in on this, I mean this is a very good portfolio and 91+% leased so I mean that's fairly high occupancy for suburban office portfolio. And, quite honestly, I think the more of the vacancy was in St. Louis than in those other markets and we think we have, we have done a fair amount of leasing in those properties over the last couple of years, we think the rental rates were pretty strong, so I don\u2019t know if I call it peaking out but I think that portfolio was in excellent shape from a performance point of view and from the evaluation point of view.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And from your presentation it looks like the cap rate on the fourth-quarter run rate is about a 7.2? So how does that compare to where you can put capital to work these days?","Denny Oklak","I think our development pipeline, Jim mentioned those numbers in the prepared remarks and our pipeline now is 8% to on cash yield and below 9% on a GAAP yield and that's really a combination of MOB and industrial so I think we have pretty descent accretion here. ","Jamie Feldman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We request join [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst ","Could you talk about any potential G&A savings, given that you're actually everthing several markets here?","Denny Oklak","What really even is, lot of those cost that will that our overall overhead will go down but a lot of those costs were really in charge the property anyway. So not G&A, people like our manager group or maintenance group are those costs will go way from the company point of view but that really won't affect G&A. Again, we don\u2019t think there will be a significant effect on G&A because as we really try to try manage that number.","Jim Connor","The point is that we are not closing those offices, the personnel there will be right sized to continue operate the portfolio but will still have offices in all the cities to run our remaining industrial portfolios and handle development. So it will importantly go down given the property portfolio size.","Unidentified Analyst","Obviously this was a unique situation, with one buyer, but was there any other potential bidders for this portfolio that you were speaking with? And I'll leave it there for now. ","Denny Oklak","I guess what I would say is this was pretty much unsolicited expression of interest and unsolicited expression of interest turned into an offer when we gave them some information and the answer is yes we have had other unsolicited offers of interest in the portfolio and I will leave with that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And versus your initial expectations of the valuation for these assets, where did that come about? Is it on a one-off basis? If you sold all these assets individually I'm sure you would have gotten a little bit of better pricing. There is obviously pros and cons to that, but how close was it to your initial view of valuation? ","Denny Oklak","We have stated a lot of time looking at I mean all of our assets per valuation, but especially any asset that might be on the same block and I let Nick Anthony share with us today who is chief investment officer and it was really all of the acquisitions and dispositions we have done over the last number of years, so I let him tell you little bit about the process we went through looking at evaluation.","Nick Anthony","We are very active in all of these markets and all of our markets and our capital transaction perspective, just to give you a flavour, since the last time transaction 2011 another billion dollars of office in all these markets. So we feel like we have a very good understanding of a property values in these market. So we spent a lot of time using our existing trades and then other people trade to determine where we can faire pricing areas. I think the other thing that is sort of unique today is that we are able to deliver a portfolio that is putting clear in debt. So the buyer can take advantage of existing debt markets to be able to push pricing in their end.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thank you.","Operator","Question from Michael Bilerman please go ahead","Michael Bilerman","Good afternoon. [indiscernible] is on with me as well. Denny, Mark, I wanted to thank you for the supplemental and pro forming all the schedules as if the assets were sold. It's very helpful to have from a modeling standpoint as well as from an information perspective. I also had a question in terms of just to make sure I got all the ducks in a row in terms of the numbers. You talk about the impact to 2015 FFO and AFFO, but you only provide the 2014 numbers. And I wonder if you can reconcile them a little bit. You talked about 4Q annualized NOI of 77.4%. I assume that's a GAAP number which had trended up a lot over the course of the year as you had occupancy build, so I wasn't sure what that was in 2015 on a GAAP basis. And then on a cash basis, it would appear as though there's a $0.06 delta and you disclosed $15 million of CapEx for 2014, which is about $0.04 which would indicate about $0.02 of straight-line. I'm not sure if CapEx was higher next year in terms of what was projected. Maybe just help reconcile some of the GAAP versus cash cap rate stuff.","Mark Denien","See if I can try to answer that. First of all, the NOI that we disclosed in the fourth quarter is actually a cash number. Now it's actually very close to the GAAP numbers well, but the way we do our son will analyze schedules that are in that analyst package, it is a cash number.","As you look then forward to 2015, obviously, the fourth quarter of 2014 NOI number was a little higher on an annualized basis in the full-year 2014 and that's because of the some leads that we have done in the portfolio during the year. ","So we would've anticipated on a GAAP number that $77 million on a quarter basis to be a little bit higher on an annualized basis for 2015. On top of that, because of that we had done a lot of those leases are earlier in the lease term so there is going to be some more straight-line rent on those, so there will be some straight-line rent in 2015, we would have got, GAAP NOI number a bit higher than the cash NOI number in 2015. Where as they were similar \u201915 so because of that that's why AFFO was not as delusive as FFO because we would not have that as straight line rent would have been added back. And then the last point I would make that you brought up on CapEx, the numbers are what they are, we do our best job of budgeting and projecting out for 2015 but we know that it was $15 million of CapEx in \u201914 that's down from about 20 million in that portfolio in 2013 and I would tell you that our expectations in \u201915 is that it probably would have been closer \u201913 number than \u201914 number.","So I think we would've expected CapEx by the end of the year and \u201915 to be a bit higher than \u201914 run rate. So there are lot of moving pieces there but hopefully that gives you a little bit to help on reconciling between the FFO and FFO dilution.","Michael Bilerman","So, how much more would have, I mean stating about the cap rate, you are effectively saying the cash NOI for \u201915 would've been a lot bit higher than what you would analyze the fourth quarter. I wasn't sure I mean was a big RAM, 71.8 for the full year versus 77.4 for the fourth quarter but I wasn't sure how much of that and had been building up over the course of fourth quarter, was it kind of like $80 million cash number four \u201915 r something more moderate, just as we start thinking about what the effective rate really was.","Denny Oklak","It was more moderate and I think Michael we were not projecting it to be too much higher than that fourth-quarter run rate. I mean if you think about it we have got the portfolio to 91.6% lease on a lease up basis by the end of the year. So it was closer to 7 million number.","Michael Bilerman","Right. $7.2 cash and then basically $20 million of CapEx to drop you down to a $0.06 number?","Denny Oklak","That's in the ballpark.","Michael Bilerman","And in terms of the seller financing, talk us through the dynamics and then negotiation a little bit to your desire to at least have some, talking some capital at a return better than zero and their desire to get financing and how much confidence do you have in terms of what they're going about in terms of being able to pay that down over the next 24 months?","Denny Oklak","I will start with the little bit on our desires and may be Nick can chime a little bit on what we think, may be their strategy is, but from our standpoint, is really two items affecting of Michael which was as you mentioned parking some cash and something better than zero had so rated you know even above our line of credit rate, so there is little bit of benefit, they're just working cash on fairly short-term basis and then the other piece to that is this will allow us to treat a portion of the this sale sand stole [ph] myself losing push some of that in the 2016 that has some positive benefits to us as well for being able to do that.","Nick Anthony","And I think on the sort of financing it was just negotiation or balancing rate and term. I think the buyers will look at take us out of that, at some point 16 and possibly get at forward to then it from their lender that they are using on the rest of portfolio.","Michael Bilerman","And then can you talk a little bit about the debt repayments, the $500 million to $700 million. The footnote says it includes the prepayment penalties and that you're going to target debt with a rate of 5.5% to 6.5%. Clearly if you were to bake in the prepayment penalties into the rate, the yield that you're getting on that debt on the investment is effectively lower. Can you give us at least some range of prepayment penalties that you are sort of thinking about within that $500 million to $700 million so we can think about the all-in effective return on that debt buyback?","Denny Oklak","Sure, Michael. Its a lot of depend on how we finalize the plan. And we still see lot of moving pieces here, but it was likely will do some sort of debt tender offer or something like I mean obviously we won't know the pricing of that until it closes to the extent we don't get enough debt end from that we have some opportunities, you should make also some unsecured and we may take some of the very near term secured debt and go ahead and do prepayment penalties there. So it is a bit a moving target but I would tell rough numbers, it\u2019s probably going into the $40 million to $60 million range, give or take based on our best estimates today.","Michael Bilerman","So pretty much about 60 basis points? If you're buying back the debt at 6, it drops down to low to mid-5% in terms of effective return. And I assume because FASBEE doesn't tell you to treat that as a cost and roll it over the life of any new debt, that effectively from an FFO perspective you are going to get the full benefit of the 6% or rather be out of pocket from the capital prospective.","Denny Oklak","I think that's right, Michael and we are going to really focus on our shorter dated maturities here I mean the way we see it, it's a good way to delever we don't want a prepayment penalties but the reality is the other option is to have sit on the balance sheet for a while and its interest we would have paid anyway over the short-term and, we are going to try to really focus on \u201915 and \u201915 maturities to the extent we can, but I think you're right.","Michael Bilerman","Okay and just last question in terms of the remaining suburban office portfolio, just from an NOI perspective, obviously half of it's sitting where you guys are in ND and then you have the Cincy piece that you've tried to sell and then the stuff in DC which is suffering in the suburbs that everybody else particularly low leased. How should we think about those three pieces going forward which is the bulk of the remaining suburban office?","Jim Connor","I will make couple of comments. The first is, I guess first of all, as we have said, we have some remaining dispositions. We have got either currently in the market or shortly to be in the market, some of the Cincinnati office assess because there are still older assets down there which has been really on our plan before this transaction.","And in DC, you're right, it's been a difficult market, but we do only on 30% of those assets in a joint venture and some of those actually got sold late last year in the part of fourth quarter proceeds our proceeds were smaller to go and disclose our share and then I take the other pieces, we are sitting in one of our Indianapolis office assets right now we like put forward in the Indianapolis. It has performed very well and is that really where we are.","Michael Bilerman","Thank you. ","Jim Connor","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","We have a question from Brendan Maiorana. Please go ahead.","Brendan Maiorana","So, Mark, sources and uses. I know you keep saying that the proceeds from the suburban office sale will be used to fund the development activity this year, but if I look at excluding the suburban office sale, it looks like you've got $400 million to $700 million of dispositions of properties, plus another $50 million to $80 million of land, so let's call that at the midpoint roughly $600 million. Your development starts are 400 to 500 and acquisitions are 75 to 150. Feels like your sources and uses ex the suburban office sale match up pretty well. Is that a fair way to think about it if I wanted to allocate the suburban office proceeds separately?","Jim Connor","I think so Brendan. I mean if we didn\u2019t do the suburban office sale, we would be able to fund our development and acquisitions with the rest of our disposition pipeline but then we wouldn\u2019t be able to cover the current year debenture at least. So I think may be the only missing piece. We are talking about with the suburban office portfolio: pulling forward some payments may be $2,016 as example.","Brendan Maiorana","Understood. I was a little surprised maybe at the debt prepayment commentary that you gave to Michael, just given you've got $250 million that matures, I think that unsecured is in February. And then you've got 175 or so of mortgages that mature, so I would imagine those would be part of the 500 million to 700 million of debt repayments which doesn't leave that much left between 500 million and 700 million total. Maybe that's a couple of hundred million or so. So if you looked at your \u201916 and \u201917 expirations, that would seem like that would be pretty high prepayment penalties for the remainder?","Jim Connor","Well, like I said we don\u2019t know the number yet. But if you pull forward call at 500 million a debt, I think you are going to be in that $40 million $60 million range on the prepayment penalty. ","The thing are, our proceed slide on page six presentation we had on the web, leases with cash. So I don't know what money is fungible right that cap may be what was being used, that could be used for the development rather than the other disposition proceeds.","So I know there are a lot of moving pieces but we really looking at this like we are going to move forward $500 million with the debt early and then some combination of this remaining cash here the other dispositions will pay our normal maturities early 2015, like that $250 million in February.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. That was the missing piece. So that was my misunderstanding. So this $500 million to $700 million is early prepayments; this excludes your existing 2015 maturities that would come before that?","Jim Connor","It definitely excludes the 250 million in February.","Brendan Maiorana","So your guidance of dilution from this sale of $0.07 to $0.09, that includes timing on prepayment -- you're selling the assets April 1, so you've got nine months, nine out of the 12 months of lost NOI from what you're selling. The prepayment of the debt, is that assumed to be in Q1 or Q2 as well or is that programmed for later in the year ","Jim Connor","No it\u2019s like probably mid-Q2. By that time we would get that executed. We can\u2019t mash it up perfect. So it would be called at May timeframe give or take. ","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. If I look at what you then have left, thinking going forward, you've got the $200 million of seller financing where you're only getting L plus 150, so when you get that paid back you can hopefully invest that more accretively? And then you've got another couple hundred million that would be not productive -- not put into work that you could invest as well?","Jim Connor","That's right Brendan. I mean this cash or call it 90 million to 320 million, that's on our slide that's what we will start with after the after we take care of everything else on the slide and really, that cash will set on the book really through the remainder of the 2015 such that by the end \u201915 we should really have fully deployed. But it will trend down, it will start higher and it will trend closer to zero by the end of the year.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay. Question on operations. So same-store guidance is to 2% to 4%. Not sure if you have a breakout of that by property type. But it seems, given that your rent spreads appear to be pretty strong, they were strong last year and I think they -- I would assume that you guys expect to do that again, given that occupancy's pretty full. You've got bumps throughout the majority of your portfolio. And it looks like your occupancy is flat to maybe up a little bit average 2015 versus 2014. I would guess that maybe it would you a little bit higher but I wasn't sure if there was something that we're missing there.","Jim Connor","I will chime in a bit on this, as we just mentioned we have only got 8% of our leases rolling this year from our revenue standpoint. So any bumps on those we are not going to get much benefit from this year and some of those I mean as you saw I would think that it\u2019s likely we will get some pretty descent rent increases on those but it is not going have a huge impact this year. And then I think if you look at the overall blended portfolio of run rate increases in the 1.5% to 2.5% range on the stable portfolio. That's the kind of the run rate that we are look at right now and I think that's still pretty decent increase in same store as we go forward.","Denny Oklak","And the other piece I would say Brendan it\u2019s really difficult that the environment we are in where are recycling a lot of assets, is the target predict what assets are still going to be on the balance sheet at the end of the year to apply that growth. So the population of what gets old factors in and really makes it a bit more difficult to estimate too quite honestly.","Brendan Maiorana","Okay, alright thanks for the time.","Operator","Question from Dave Rodgers please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers","Good afternoon. Jim, maybe I will start with you on development. You talked about a fairly robust pipeline and new development to start the year but the guidance for new starts this year is down from last year. So, I guess three questions around that. The first would be your ability and desire to ramp that range up as the year progresses, I think the second would be could you talk about your shovel ready returns, I thought I heard you quote something and then Denny quoted different numbers, so I might have grabbed two different things. So just to clarify the returns on what the new shovel will be. And then, I guess finally, can you give a little color on how build-to-suit opportunities are may be impacting that versus spec and maybe willingness or reluctance to pursue some spec?","Jim Connor","Okay let me try and take him in the order you put him out there. In terms of ramping up, I would tell you that five to six hundred million dollar range is really kind of the sweet spot. First of all, you know in terms of the construction and the development teams that we had in place that's really what their staffed to do.","We have gotten up a little better about maybe a hundred million about that from time to time but that's really kind of the sweet spot. We are also very focused on managing that percentage pre-released at the development pipeline and we've been focused on keeping that above 50%. So it's a combination of build-to-suit opportunities that are out there in the market as the market have gotten much more healthy","You have seen more spec development that puts pressure on some of the yields there so I think we are being a little bit conservative in terms of our outlook on build-to-suit side. We have done little bit more spec development which is more in \u201914 and \u201913 and I think you'll continue to see us as long as we are able to cover our best on the existing spec, continue to pick and chose some market per some spec opportunity.","So, I don't think we're in a run out and try and increase our development volume but $200 million to $300 million just because when Mark get little extra cash get in the bag, I would be surprised if we could find the number of project particularly on the build-to-suit that will allow us to do that but that doesn\u2019t stop us from looking.","In terms of the returns, I'm not sure which ones Danny and I misquoted, we might have more than a couple of numbers in front of us here but Mark just handed me another piece and I will just review we've got 497 million of stabilized cost in that development pipeline and the initial cash yield 7.4% and the stabilizing gap yield over the lease term is 8.1%.","We have been comfortably running in that range for the last couple years, I think we will continue to see a little bit of downward pressure on the build-to-suit as things get competitive but I don't think we are going to see any serious erosion to that and we are still underwriting very healthy yields on the spec budget that we undertake. So I like that south Florida office, which I am sure got a few people off guard but when you talk about returns, they are stabilized returns in the high single to low double digits, those are very-very accretive development opportunities in what is a very tight, very strong office market.","Denny Oklak","And Dave what may be we mislead on the numbers. Jim just quoted here are the returns on our whole development pipeline, it\u2019s under construction now and I think in our prepared remarks, we quoted the return for starts through the quarter and those returns are a little higher so the start we had in the fourth quarter are even that better return than our overall pipeline and that may have been what we continues here.","And I think the last piece, in terms of our quarter to quarter reporting, they do fluctuate a bit. It is really a function of what the mix is between the products and what the mix is between build-to-suit spec. And we had a great quarter article our healthcare does did a phenomenal job in the fourth quarter with those four projects, fifteen year lease and we getting very-very strong returns but again will see what the mix of projects is for the next quarter. We could have a couple build-to-suit and couple more spec buildings and the numbers can change a little bit quarter to quarter. But I think annualized, I think we're pretty good spot right now.","Dave Rodgers","Jim, is the build-to-suit volume coming out in the pipeline just slowing down? I know it's slower percentage of the total but is it slowing down or are you just seeing greater competition?","Denny Oklak","The opportunities are consistently out there. So I don't think it\u2019s slowing down. There are few people that have the opportunity to look at spec building because there are more spec buildings out there. So I think the combination of that and the competitive nature but you know there is still great demand. If you look at the demand driver today the retailers, the e-commerce guys, the consumer products companies in the demand for brand-new big state-of-the-art buildings, 36\/40 ft clear million-square-foot buildings, those predominant number of those yield end up as build to suit. ","Because of the start alternatives out there. So continue to see a very healthy pipeline and again I can\u2019t I don\u2019t want to underestimate , the opportunities that we see in the medical, the on campus and the off-campus MOB development pipeline is very-very healthy for 2015 and we look to be able make a big impact there.","Dave Rodgers.","Great. Two last ones for Mark. Mark, any land sale gains in the guidance? I know there's land proceeds for the year but any gains?","Mark Denien","Dave, we don't give guidance on games, because in our core FFO we don\u2019t include games I would tell you we expect games. If you look at the profit, the land that we have sold over the last three years, it has been at about 15%. So I would tell you it's probably going to be somewhere in that range but it's a little harder to predict number one and like then like I say number two since it is not part of core FFO or whatever gains we have to exclude anyway, we just don\u2019t really provide guidance on that.","Dave Rodgers.","Last one. You talked about the asset sales you did in 2014, in order to manage your taxable situation, you didn't borrow from the 2015 dividend at all to cover that on a tax basis did you?","Mark Denien","We did not and we had a little bit of excess in fact left over.","Dave Rodgers.","Thank you.","Operator","Question from Paul Adornato please go ahead.","Paul Adornato","Thanks, good afternoon. Switching gears, could you tell us what you're seeing on the ground in the energy patch and what your expectations are if energy prices remain where they are or perhaps even go lower?","Denny Oklak","Sure Paul. Let me give you a couple of comments. Like a lot of us we are conservative about the potential impact, particularly to market\u2019s probably most problem would be Houston. I would tell you that Houston market is in great shape right now. We very strong demand, our existing portfolio is 100% leased with three projects under development, one is 50% pre-release and we have leases out not signed but leases out 87% of the space in those other two buildings so there is very good, strong, robust demand in Houston.","If you look at the spec pipeline it\u2019s actually download a little bit at year-end versus the third quarter, while their percentage per lease is actually up slightly so those are I think positive trends for that market in terms of trying to stay healthy. And then if you really drilled out from our portfolio perspective, the percentage of Tennessee in Houston portfolio, that are oil and gas related is less than life less than one percent and if you look at, even Houston and Dallas, I think it\u2019s less than 0.5?","Ron Hubbard","Yes.","Denny Oklak","So it gives, we have very minimal exposure directly to the oil and gas industry and I think \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a while before any that could possibly trickle down into the industrial markets. I think some of the office guys are little but more literary in terms of the immediate job impact on the office of the industry but we are not and we are seeing very healthy demand on the industrial.","Paul Adornato","Okay great. Okay. Great. And looking at overall breakout between the three property types, what should we expect going forward? Is this the mix that you are comfortable with or should we expect some additional changes from here?","Ron Hubbard","Paul I think you will see that at least initially the sub-urban office percent probably dropped a bit, below that percentage we lay out because I mentioned we had some older assets in Cincinnati that we are planning on marketing and right now we don't a big have a development pipeline on this urban office site. The only one we really have in process that is not part of the sale as the one that Jim mentioned down in south Florida. I think you will see go down a little bit initially and I think it is for the foreseeable which again for us isn\u2019t necessarily that part of [indiscernible] I think it will stay right above can say right about that level.","Paul Adornato ","Okay. And, Mark, you mentioned leverage metrics, I think, or target metrics for the end of 2015. Same question. Are those leverage metrics that we should expect going forward or do you consider the Company underlevered at the end of 2015?","Ron Hubbard","Underlevered! That's the line. No I don\u2019t think we consider ourselves underlevered. Now, I think we expect fixed charge coverage to be right around 3.0 at the end of the year, I guess that EBITDA 6.5 or lower that grow assets in the low forties, more I look in the lever up from there, I can say that. So I think we can be majored in our approach and discipline and is continue to actually drive those matters even better as we had 2016 without any major kind of transaction.","Paul Adornato","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Question from Eric Frankel, please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. I was hoping you could comment on the financing that the buyer is likely to receive from the suburban office portfolio and the environment for that.","Denny Oklak","They are currently working on finalizing on those terms but we don't know all the specifics yet but they have selected a lender and are working through all those. We expect that they will get it will likely be fairly highly levered and pretty lowest interest rate. Because we don't elect terms.","Eric Frankel","Okay. That's to be expected. Jim, can you comment on the composition of the development pipeline that's likely for next year, the percent suburban medical office versus industrial? I'm not sure if you stated that before.","Jim Connor","No, I didn\u2019t. The development pipeline is all in various stages. I will tell you the number of opportunities and the development volume for the medical business is probably, I would 30% over the opportunities that we saw last year. So I think we see good up side but it is, it is a competitive market out there and you know that the healthcare industry somewhat different from the industrial business is a little bit more time intensive business for the these projects to work away through approval process. But we see a very healthy increase there. In terms of the industrial build-to-suits, it\u2019s fairly consistently strong what we saw last year and I think we have seen a huge increase. You could see some big square fluctuations in our pipeline given the size of these deals that we see now with the Wal-Marts and the Amazon to the world that are out there but that that is pretty consistent and then we are just evaluating the local markets in terms of where we want pick and chose spec development and a lot of that is really driven by how quickly we can lease up the existing buildings we have, the existing spec building we have out there in the marketplace and we have got a great activity on the pipeline for leasing the spec in Houston, a project New Jersey are also have a lot of activity and we would hope to be able to reports some good results. And then simply function of the major project that will bring online the first quarter at how much lease we get there, we get down there and they will make some decisions about where we want to build the spec. ","Eric Frankel ","Okay. Perhaps as you might have done in prior quarters, maybe a brief outline on the supply outlook for the US? Industrial? Have you prepared that?","Jim Connor","We get our preliminary supply numbers in. I would tell you that, it would appear that there was a slight increase in the fourth quarter over the third quarter of about ten million square feet of product\u2013 a smaller increase there from the third quarter to the second quarter, which was about 20 million square feet building increases are primarily at Atlanta. Atlanta was probably the last of the tier one markets to fully recover. They have got about 11 million square feet of speculative project now which is up from about four, which on the surface migrates some red flags, but Atlanta had about 18 million square feet of net absorption. So they are, it\u2019s very strong and very robust in Atlanta as well.","A lot of other big markets are really pretty much flat, Chicago had a very modest increase of about 500,000 square ft stand, New Jersey, about the same, Pennsylvania is actually down slightly Houston is actually down slightly, Inland Empire is pretty flat. Pre-leasing percentage on the portfolio that we are looking at is actually up from about 14.5% to 16.5%, so I think on the supply side, I have seen just couple of markets. We think the world is still in pretty good balance.","The other thing I would want to remind everybody and we share these numbers with you from time to time and it is different, the industry meetings 120 million square ft of spec compares to 165 million at the peak back in 2007-2008. So I think were still well under those levels with good percentage pr-released and great positive absorption of the market. So most everybody is pretty bullish on 2015 and the industrial market.","Eric Frankel ","Great. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Vance Edelsen. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelsen","Speaking of the industrial market, in your conversations with tenants, what's the latest tone around lease durations? Is there willingness or even an urgency on their part to lock in for longer as vacancies continue to dwindle? And if you think rents will continue to rise, which sounds likely, are you at all better served by keeping a lid on lease duration for now so that you can take advantage of stronger rents down the road? How is that dynamic playing out?","Jim Connor","I don\u2019t think anybody thinks that there is that much consistent and upside and rent growth in the next few years that we are going to strategically shorten our lease terms. I will tell you most tenants are feel very good about their business, the overall economy and are pretty comfortable making longer lease term commitments, lot of builders since that we that we do are now are in generally the minimum ten years quoting a lot of 12 and 15 year deal. So people are pretty comfortable making commitments ,in terms of lease term activity. The only uncertainty we get is from tenants that are having a hard time deciding how much growth they need and how much additional space they want lock-in so we have had a number of situation situations where we work with some tenants like that on the short term, they are looking at consolidations or looking at build to suit with the more space and it does not quite sure how much more space, whether they're contemplating acquisitions or whatever it depends on case-by-case but nobody is making long lease commence today.","Denny Oklak","The other thing I would report, it is almost all of our industrial market today, we are getting annual rent bump, so that takes out some of the concerns about what are locking in rate today that might go higher next year.","Jim Connor","Let me clarify that. in all of our market, we are getting annual rent bumps and with the occupancies in the market, what things we have really pushing on for the last year with the increase in those annual escalation and industry-standard in \u201913 and going into \u201914 was about 2% of annual escalation. There are a lot of markets given the strength of the polio and where occupancy we have been to push that 2.5%. So what really kind of protecting our long term interest in those buildings.","Operator","Now, I would like to turn the conference back to Ron Hubbard for closing comments.","Ron Hubbard","I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to following up with more view off line and see many of you during the year end conferences as well as open to see regional markets.

[Operator Instructions] Just a brief reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Hubbard.","Ron Hubbard","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2016, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Connor.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone.","I\u2019ll start out with an update on the overall business environment and then cover our second quarter results.","Nationally, the industrial market regained its previous strong momentum after a more modest first quarter with demand outpacing supply by 15 million square feet. Net absorption for the quarter was 58.3 million square feet and completions totaled 43.4 million square feet. The U.S. industrial market vacancy now stands at 4.6%, which is down 40 basis points from a year ago; nationally, rents grew 6.6% compared to a year ago. We\u2019re seeing increased construction across the country. Total supply under construction is now projected at over 200 million square feet and we anticipate that the markets will reach some level of equilibrium by early to mid 2018. I\u2019d remind everyone that our market with supply and demand imbalance at less than 5% vacancy is still a great place to be an industrial owner.","Demand was strongest in Atlanta, the Inland Empire and the Lehigh Valley with a combined 16 million square feet of net absorption for the second quarter. Most markets remain undersupplied with new construction running at less than 2% of the existing inventory. The only notable exceptions would be the Inland Empire, the Lehigh Valley and Louisville markets where construction is running at 4% to 5% of existing inventory. The drivers of this absorption are twofold. First, continue to grow and demand in consumer products, food and beverage and apparel goods, our clients with the ecommerce companies, retailers, consumer products companies and the 3PLs that serve them. Second is the structural change we\u2019re seeing with our clients modernizing their supply chain. They continue to move to larger facilities with greater clear height to better serve today\u2019s omni-channel distribution needs. This month, I\u2019d also point out that consumer confidence hit a 16-year high at 121.1. While consumer spending numbers are up more modestly, this bodes well for consumption and the continued need out on bulk warehousing.","Turning to our owned operating results. We\u2019re seeing similar strength in our owned portfolio with stabilized in-service occupancy at 97.7%. The drop in stabilized occupancy of 100 basis points from the first quarter is due largely in part to the hhgregg bankruptcy, yet overall vacancy remains at a very strong level. But we note, our total in-service occupancy level when we include unstabilized assets dropped to 96% this quarter, primarily due to vacancy from recent acquisitions and recent spec developments placed in service. These unstabilized assets recently placed in service, provide us with substantial future NOI growth opportunities. As we only have 3% of our leases expiring for the remainder of the year, our focus is the lease-up of the spec space and continue to drive rent growth.","During the quarter, we executed 4.6 million square feet of leases which is solid leasing activity, in light of our high occupancy and relatively low lease expirations in the portfolio. The lease activity included notable transactions with customers such as Target, Hewlett Packard, McGraw Hill and HD Supply.","Turning to development for the quarter, we started a $154 million of projects across six markets including two build-to-suits. We also started two projects that were 50% pre-released and two speculative developments. One notable development was the start of the $1 million square-foot speculative facility in the Lehigh Valley at our 33 Logistics Park, a location where we\u2019ve had great success leasing up two other speculative projects in the last 12 months with blue chip customers like Amazon and XPO Logistics. I\u2019ll note, the XPO lease was just signed this week in the same timeframe that the speculative development was placed in service. These second quarter starts are projected to earn on average an initial cash yield of 7.2%.","Our overall development pipeline at quarter end had 26 projects under construction totaling 10.9 million square feet and a projected $774 million of stabilized cost at our share that were 65% pre-leased at the end of the quarter. We expect these projects to create an approximate 24% margin in total and generate stabilized cash yield of 6.6%. Our development outlook is very solid with a pipeline of prospects across the system that is driving our increased guidance for developments, which I\u2019ll cover later.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisition and disposition activity for the quarter.","Nick Anthony","Thanks, Jim.","Big news of course is the closing of the substantial portion of the previously announced $2.955 billion sale of our medical office business at a 4.6% cap rate. During the quarter, we generated $2.45 billion in proceeds from a series of closings with the majority of the remaining closings expected in the third quarter. In addition to the second quarter closings, we earned an additional $20 million of promote income related to the sale of an MOB unconsolidated joint venture.","As previously communicated, the net proceeds, the reinvest after seller financing and debt pay-downs will be redeployed opportunistically into our development pipeline and acquisitions in high barrier Tier 1 markets, balanced with the return of capital to shareholders in the form of the special dividend. Jim will discuss our revised special dividend guidance in a moment.","During the second quarter, our acquisitions team was successful in sourcing two small portfolio acquisitions in South Florida and Chicago totaling $124 million. In aggregate, the acquisitions encompassed five modern bulk industrial buildings totaling 1.2 million square feet, which were on average 43% leased and are expected to earn an initial stabilized cash yield of 5%. I\u2019ll note, as part of the Chicago portfolio transaction, we are also under contract to acquire additional 300,000 square feet spec building currently under construction at the same business park which is expected to close in the third quarter.","Since quarter-end, we\u2019ve also been able to execute on our few other opportunistic acquisitions in Tier markets. In July, we closed three acquisitions, two in Southern California and one in Northern New Jersey for a total of a $150 million. Furthermore, we have approximately $500 million of acquisitions in Southern California, Northern New Jersey and South Florida under contract. These acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions and we expect to close them by year-end. A substantial portion of these recently closed and pending acquisitions, our recently completed speculative development projects that are in the aggregate approximately 65% to 75% leased allowing for future value creation as we execute leases in these high growth markets. As alluded to in last night\u2019s press release, these acquisitions will be accretive to FFO and AFFO upon stabilization as the stabilized returns will be in excess of the 4.6% cap rate achieved on the medical office disposition. Also, due to the high-barrier markets where these acquisitions are located, they should provide better prospects for embedded lease escalations and future market rent growth in our medical office properties previously provided.","I\u2019ll now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and capital transactions.","Mark Denien","Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. We completed an outstanding quarter from a core operating standpoint, resulting in core FFO of $0.32 per share, which is consistent with the first quarter of 2017. Particularly, dilutive impact of selling our medical office properties which sold mostly in June will be fully realized beginning in operations for the third quarter. The sale had a negative $0.01 per share impact on FFO and AFFO for the second quarter and is anticipated to have an approximate $0.05 to $0.06 per share negative impact on FFO for the second half of the year. As we have said many times before, this dilution is temporary. Once all the proceeds have been reinvested in development projects and acquisitions with returns in excess of the cap rate we achieved in the medical office disposition and in assets with better long-term rental rate growth prospects, we should be in a position to realize outsized FFO and AFFO growth rates. We anticipate to have the proceeds fully redeployed and back to pre-transaction leverage levels by mid-2018.","AFFO totaled a $103 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $118 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease from the first quarter was the result of the sale of the medical office properties in addition to an increase in lease related capital expenditures that was driven by the timing of lease commencements.","We utilized a portion of the proceeds from our second quarter sales to reduce indebtedness, paying off over $930 million of debt since March 31st, which included $286 million and 6.5% unsecured notes that were scheduled to mature in 2018, our $250 million variable rate term loan, $237 million that was outstanding on line of credit on March 31, 2017, also including debt payoffs or a $129 million of 6.75% unsecured notes that we repaid in early July that were scheduled to mature in March of 2020.","Of the total sales price from the quarter\u2019s medical office dispositions, $400 million was structured as seller financing which bears interest at 4% and matures over the next three years, while another $796 million was placed in escrow accounts to finance future acquisitions and development. The remaining proceeds were used to fund development activities, $124 million of acquisitions as well as another $150 million of acquisitions completed in July.","To conclude, our operating results remained very strong with the opportunity for significant increases as we reset our unstabilized properties. In addition, our debt levels are low enough that we can fund our future growth for the next 12 months or so without any equity needs and still maintain investing class leverage profile.","I\u2019ll also make one last comment on the equity markets. As announced last week and in fact yesterday morning, Duke Realty was added to the S&P 500 Index, honor to be included in this large cap equity index along with other leading public companies in U.S. We believe the execution of our strategy in the last eight years to simplify the story and have a best in class balance sheet, significantly contributed to our strong shareholder outperformance over this time period and ultimately contributed to the inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. ","Now, I will turn it back over to Jim.","Jim Connor","Thanks, Mark. In reflection of our strong operating performance for the first half of the year which we expect to continue and given the added clarity to our MOB proceeds redeployment, we increased our FFO per share guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint. This increase is reflective of better than expected rent growth and lease-up of development completions, redeployment of sales proceeds in the development and acquisitions at a faster pace than anticipated, and strong overall operating fundamentals in excess of our original expectations.","We narrowed same property NOI growth guidance to 3% to 3.8% from the previous range of 2.5% to 4.3%. This revised guidance includes an approximate 55 basis-point negative impact on the full year results from the hhgregg bankruptcy. On the hhgregg vacancies, I am pleased to report that we have leases out on two of the three vacancies with good activity on the third and smaller space. Both leases are at increased rents and additional term beyond the original hhgregg lease expiration. So, this is obviously positive news. It\u2019s likely we will not realize substantial NOI from these spaces until 2018. The average occupancy guidance we raised to low end and narrowed the range to 96.4% to 97%, up 20 basis points from the previous midpoint.","Given the strong outlook on our development pipeline, we also raised development guidance to $700 million to $900 million, up $200 million from the original midpoint. We continue to expect the pre-leasing level of this pipeline should remain above 50%. The estimate for acquisitions was also increased to a range of $700 million to $1.1 billion from a previous range of a $150 million to $900 million, reflecting the better than anticipated opportunity to redeploy proceeds in the high-barrier markets with leasing upside.","Year-to-date, we have closed on $390 million of acquisitions and have approximately $500 million under contract that we expect to close by year-end. We expect the initial cash yield on these acquisitions, once they are stabilized, to exceed the 4.6% cap rate we achieved in the medical office sale.","Lastly, I\u2019ll highlight, the estimate for special dividend per share was narrowed to a range of $0.70 to a $1.15 from the previous range of $0.70 to $2 a share, primarily reflecting our increased acquisition and development volume expectations as just noted. Revisions to certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","In closing, I think we are very pleased with our team\u2019s execution for the mid-year across operations and development and of course from executing the sale of our medical office platform. As everybody is aware, the medical office sale was executed at much better than expected pricing, generating increase to our NAV of roughly 5% and providing opportunities to further invest in our growth strategy and return capital to the shareholders.","We\u2019ll now open up the lines to our audience and we ask participants to keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions. Of course, you\u2019re welcome to get back in the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes the line of Blaine Heck. Your line is open.","Blaine Heck","Good afternoon. I just wanted to start on the acquisitions, couple of questions there. Are there any large portfolios in that $500 million you have under contract or is it smaller one-off type properties? And then, can you give us any sense of the mix of stabilized properties versus under lease developments in that number?","Jim Connor","Yes. Blaine, it\u2019s Jim. Let me give you the high level comment and Nick can give you a little bit more granular detail. The $500 million is primarily one portfolio of properties that we are buying and in aggregate, it\u2019s about 60% leased and we\u2019ll probably close that in a couple of tranches in fourth quarter. So, some of the buildings are stabilized and some of them have leasing upside.","Nick Anthony","Yes. Blaine, this is Nick Anthony. I would say that about half of the buildings are either 100% leased or close to 100% leased and the others are vacant right now. And the reason for that is that they are currently under development and will be substantially completed probably in the next 30 to 60 days.","Blaine Heck","Great. So, just a quick follow-up on that. Are the under leased developments going to go into the development pipeline as you require them or into the unstabilized in-service portfolio and thus I guess we\u2019d see some downward pressure on occupancy?","Mark Denien","Yes. Blaine, this is Mark. They\u2019ll be completed when we buy them, so they will go right into the in-service population, the unstabilized in-service population.","Blaine Heck","If you do have some downward pressure, is that included in the guidance you guys have?","Mark Denien","That is included in the guidance. We\u2019ve said that -- that\u2019s all part of the whole -- way we look at it, the temporary dilution from the whole MOB transaction. We had $0.01 in the second quarter which is mainly sitting on cash and then $0.05 to $0.06 for the last half of the year. So, we can get the cash and fully leased. So, that downward pressure on occupancy is included in the guidance.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Manny Korchman. Your line is open.","Manny Korchman","As you went out looking for sort of our op properties to buy, how did you get comfortable buying properties that were under leased and sort of even if they were in primary markets, and how you thought about your sort of time to lease up versus the developer\u2019s time to lease up?","Jim Connor","Manny, it\u2019s Jim. I\u2019ll give you my thoughts and Nick can chime in as well. We\u2019ve looked at lot of things. And I think the first thing is, you should know, we have passed on lot of things because as we all know, things are expensive out there. And the other side of it is, we\u2019ve been outbid by some of our peers. So, there is a lot of activity out there. We look at every deal and every portfolio on a case by case basis. But you\u2019ve got to remember, our portfolio is 98% leased at the end of the first quarter. So, we\u2019ve got enough confidence in our local leasing teams with our portfolios in that good of shape. We are comfortable taking on the lease up risk. And we looked at these and thought we could get an appreciate risk adjusted return as opposed to waiting for them to be a 100% stabilized and paying an even higher price to the merchant builders. So, that\u2019s kind of how we look at it. Nick, do you want to add any color?","Nick Anthony","Yes. Manny, this is Nick. We also have been -- there are some markets that we\u2019re looking in and acquiring assets in, are also very highly occupied, some of them are only 1% vacant. So, as you look at that, we feel like the leasing risk is not as great as it would be in some of the other markets around the country.","Mark Denien","And the last thing I would add, Manny, this is Mark, is that we\u2019re taking over leasing of those assets now that we have them under contract. And the last point would be, we\u2019re really looking at these a lot like we would look at spec development because they really are just that, they haven\u2019t even been placed in service yet. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re -- they\u2019ve been struggling out there for a year or 18 months and can\u2019t get them leased up, there has been no product, so.","Manny Korchman","Maybe a follow-up on that, Jim. Can you quantify the amount of that savings on the risk adjusted return that you mentioned?","Jim Connor","Manny, off the top of my head, it\u2019d be pretty hard. I think consistently, we\u2019ve seen around the country, probably somewhere between 20 and maybe 50 basis points. And part of it is depending on whether we\u2019re buying one-off building that\u2019s 50% per-leased or three buildings that are 0% leased. So, there\u2019s what we consider to be a healthy premium there for taking out on that risk. And again, we\u2019ve got people on the ground and teams that have leased their portfolios to 98%. So, I think that\u2019s an acceptable risk for us to take on.","Operator","And next, we have the line of David Rodgers. Your line is open.","David Rogers","Hey, Mark, just a quick follow-up to that, in terms of the accounting of bringing on the vacancy in the assets. I mean, I assume that you\u2019ll expense all the costs as you bring them on and not capitalize that, but I just wanted to verify?","Mark Denien","That\u2019s right, David. Day one, everything starts getting expensed because it\u2019s an acquisition. Yes.","David Rogers","And then, Jim, on the development side, I think you also expanded that, you had said in your comments. When do we see that expansion happen? Do you see any changes in kind of your targets of keeping the portfolio in the development pipeline 50 plus percent leased? I guess how much more aggressive do you get in that part of the business?","Jim Connor","Well, there are two things we can do to keep it above 50% preleased, and that\u2019s keep leasing the specs base that we started and doing build-to-suits. And I think our teams are doing a good combination of that. It fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. In the first quarter, our build-to-suit percentage was significantly higher than in the second quarter. But I think that\u2019s to be expected when our occupancies were as high as they were in the first quarter. So, our focus is on filling that spec space. We\u2019re out trying to make every build-to-suit we can make that we think is accretive to the bottom-line, and it\u2019s competitive out there and we don\u2019t make them all but the ones we make, obviously we like and we\u2019re comfortable with. And as long as we keep leasing up the spec space, you\u2019ll see us be able to continue these kind of levels.","David Rogers","And that ramp will occur immediately or are we going to see that more in 2018?","Jim Connor","Yes, I think you\u2019ll see that immediately in our development numbers in the second -- excuse me, in the third and the fourth quarters, to be able to get to the levels of our increased guidance. And then, in terms of 2018, our perspective is, the markets continue to look pretty good, even if we reach some level of equilibrium in early to mid 2018 on the supply demand side. You got to remember, vacancy is still sub-5%. And I think that\u2019s a pretty good place to be and we\u2019ll continue to fuel a lot of good development opportunities.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Jamie Feldman. Your line is open.","Jamie Feldman","Thank you. So, are you still pursuing more acquisition opportunities? I guess, is there a chance you\u2019ll be able to put more capital to work, pay less of a special distribution, just what are your thoughts on what you found versus what you may still be looking for?","Nick Anthony","We are still looking for acquisitions but we are from a geography perspective, very selective in some markets that we are looking at. And I would tell you that the opportunities are somewhat limited; there is not a lot of deals out there, but we will continue to look at deals, and we have some 1031 money that we could allocate to those deals, if we find the right deals.","Jim Connor","Yes. Jamie, in regards to special dividend, I think we are very comfortable with the guidance we gave and just don\u2019t see any way it\u2019s going to be lower than the low end, I think somewhere in that range is where we are going to end up.","Jamie Feldman","Okay. And then, can you give some just kind of latest thoughts on mark-to-market in the portfolio? And maybe if you look at ahead to your 2018 expirations, kind of what your latest thoughts are on what kind of -- how much that could drive same-store growth, just kind of internal growth prospects?","Mark Denien","Jamie, this is Mark. Looking out over through 2018, which is kind of the time frame we look at, you\u2019ve heard me say it\u2019s about 18 months, give or take. We really think that as we sit here today, you\u2019ll see rental rate growth pretty close to what we\u2019ve been reporting the last couple of quarters, somewhere in that mid to high single digits on a cash basis and somewhere in the mid to high teens, maybe even pushing 20% on a GAAP basis. We are pretty much through with what I would call our trough leases, there is not a lot of that left but we are getting just continued substantial rent growth year-over-year and that\u2019s what really driving that number.","Operator","Next we have the line of Eric Frankel. Your line is open.","Eric Frankel","Thank you. Maybe, Mark, can you maybe comment on your operating guidance, your same-store guidance specifically? Your guidance implies that you\u2019ll have roughly 2.5% same-store NOI growth in the second half of the year, and this is -- hhgregg, what impact is that having on your guidance?","Mark Denien","Yes, Eric, specific to hhgregg, it\u2019s got about 55 basis-point impact on the full-year number and we really collected rents from those guys all the way up until June. So, didn\u2019t have much of an impact at all in the first half of the year and even really in the second quarter. So, if you look at the last half of the year, it\u2019s going to have about an 80 basis-point negative impact in the third and fourth quarter; that assumes no re-leasing rent come, as Jim mentioned on the call on the prepared remarks. We are hopefully close on a couple of those spaces right now but we\u2019re just kind of conservatively estimating that by the time we actually get leases signed and the tenant in, and then paying rent that any rental we get this year will be negligible but it should be a good pickup for us next year. But it\u2019s about 80 basis points for the last half of the year, 55 basis points for the full-year. If it wouldn\u2019t been for that, we\u2019ve been over 4% at the midpoint of our range.","Eric Frankel","Okay. Is there anything to read into the big increase in same-store expenses this quarter?","Mark Denien","No, it was really some expense true-up on real estate tax side. All of those expenses will pass through. So, it\u2019s really an increase on the expense side and revenue, and it was really just some true-ups.","Operator","And next, we have the line of Rich Anderson. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good afternoon. So, Mark, I just want to make sure I understood the timing of this process. You said mid-2018, be fully redeployed and leveraged back to presale levels I think is what you said. When do you get back to -- and maybe same timeframe, but when do you get back to the earnings power of the Company being back to square one assuming that you\u2019re taking on value add acquisitions and developments have to get lease-up and all that sort of stuff. Is that some point further on in the future or is that also mid-2018?","Mark Denien","No, I think you\u2019ll start to see a pickup, Rich, at the beginning of 2018 but we won\u2019t be back to what I\u2019d call a full operating levels to about mid 2018. So, when I said that mid-2018, that\u2019s where I am looking that we\u2019ve redeployed all the proceeds, we\u2019ve got to the extent we\u2019re redeploying an under-leased asset, we\u2019ve got to lease it up because we definitely\u2026","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Mark Denien","Leased up well before mid-2018. And we\u2019ve also grown through raising our leverage back to three transaction level. So, by mid-2018, I think we\u2019ll be full song, so to speak, on an FFO growth.","Rich Anderson","So, to put it differently, you\u2019re becoming a smaller company in theory, right, by paying a special dividend but you\u2019re going to produce more earnings at the end of the day, from a smaller entity; is that the right way to think about this?","Mark Denien","We\u2019ll be smaller by a small amount, I guess, the way I would say it, Rich. Special dividends, we\u2019re looking at $0.70 to a $1.10. But I think we\u2019ll get more than that back in outsized growth because the way we\u2019re looking at it, we\u2019re taking $3 billion that we were earning 4.6 on and we\u2019re going to redeploy much better lease than that when it\u2019s all certain.","Rich Anderson","I mean, that\u2019s great, math, I am not -- I am certainly not putting you down for it. And then, the last follow-up question quickly is on the acquisitions. So, you\u2019re finding a lot of opportunities. I mean, just humor me, I mean, how do you avoid -- or how do you answer the question that you\u2019re not stretching beyond your means to redeploy versus what you would naturally be doing, if not for the fact that you had all these proceeds coming in?","Nick Anthony","I think first of all, we\u2019re losing several deals. So I think that says we\u2019re not overpaying, because we\u2019re not the sole winner on every deal. But, we have deep relationships with markets and we\u2019ve been able to find some unique situations in these markets. There are lot of deals that we won\u2019t look at or there is lot of deals that we will be outbid on by some of our peers.","Operator","Next we have the line of Michael Carroll. Your line is open.","Michael Carroll","Thanks. Nick, can you provide us a breakdown of the acquisition guidance? I am sorry, if you said this I guess early in the call. But, did you give us a percentage of acquisitions that are stabilized assets versus the ones that are that completed spec development projects?","Nick Anthony","No, the acquisitions that we\u2019re acquiring, they are about 65% leased on average. Other ones, we currently haven\u2019t agreed that we haven\u2019t closed, about half of those are fully occupied or substantially occupied and the others are vacant and coming on line.","Jim Connor","Yes, I just think kind of point of clarification, when we\u2019re talking about an aggregate number, that\u2019s the stuff that we\u2019ve closed on and the stuff that we have under contract and anticipate by the end of the year. So, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s certainly not an insurmountable amount of space for us to lease.","Michael Carroll","Okay, great. And then you are selling these projects, are these just developers, and what\u2019s the premium over the cost basis that you are buying on that.","Nick Anthony","Well, it\u2019s a mix of institutional sellers and some private developers around the country.","Michael Carroll","And then, what\u2019s the premium over the cost basis?","Nick Anthony","You mean over replacement costs?","Michael Carroll","Yes, what they\u2019re building for?","Nick Anthony","So, I would say on average, it\u2019s around 15%, which is typical while we receive a little bit better on our development projects. These are new developed assets.","Operator","The next, we have the line of John Guinee. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Okay. John Guinee here. Thank you. First, Jim Connor, I noticed here that your land plus developable land plus strategic land is down below $200 million. Did you guys take a huge impairment charge to get down below $200 million?","Jim Connor","No, John. You know from past experience and you have known us for a long time, there was a time when we were about $0.50 shy of $1 billion worth of land, and that has been a strategic initiative of ours to not only sell that non-strategic land which we have just a small amount left and we have been able to monetize that and make nice gains, but our development machine is so efficient now that even though we are buying land -- we\u2019ve bought $75 million worth of land this year, we have monetize the $100 million of land. So, one of the benefits of where we are in the cycle, is being able to have a very, very low land inventory; and yet when you buy new land, we are putting it into production.","And given where we are from an outlook perspective, now it\u2019s not the time for us to be bulking up on land. I think we will continue to be very disciplined and buy it in smaller pieces that we can put into production fairly quickly. I don\u2019t know what inning we\u2019re in but I think everybody would agree, we are in one of the later innings, and that will give us just a much better balance sheet to compete against in the coming years.","John Guinee","And then next question, and Mark, you may have mentioned this already. But office has now essentially gone, MOB will essentially be gone in the next few months. What\u2019s the outlook for G&A? I would expect that the G&A would be rightsizing itself. Have you given any color on that?","Mark Denien","Yes. John, I think our guidance on G&A is where we expect to be this year which is pretty flat with last year. I think based on our outsized performance in some areas this year, we expect that some of the compensation plans may result in some higher pay and that\u2019s included in that number. So, even with that increase there, we have been able to hold G&A flat. As we look forward, I would think that you may -- the way we look at it, I guess said differently, we won\u2019t have to add any overhead to our current levels and we can probably grow another $2 billion on the industrial side. So G&A ought to be able to stay about where it is and we can continue to grow this Company.","John Guinee","And then last, I can\u2019t remember how many questions I had but special dividend to not pay a $1 special dividend, how much total acquisition volume did you have to have, how does that math work?","Jim Connor","I would say that our original guidance, the high end was $2 and now our revised guidance, high end is $1.15 and that was about probably $600 million of extra volume, not just acquisitions but development because a lot of our developments -- it\u2019s kind of complicated, but a lot of our developments can count for these 1031 exchanges as well. So, it was about $600 million of volumes to lower that.","Operator","Next with the line Sumit Sharma. Your line is open.","Sumit Sharma","Following up on Mr. Guinee\u2019s question, when you are out there looking at acquiring more land or sort of planning out where else to sort of expand your development pipeline, looking into 2018 and 2019, what are the sort of criteria that you look at in terms of -- are you looking at not just the cost of land, which of course is rising but what other factors are you looking at that help you figure out the demand is coming this year, besides this year leasing data or whatever it is? I mean that\u2019s a valid answer too, I\u2019m just find to figure out what are you thinking.","Jim Connor","Well, Sumit, it\u2019s a combination of lot of things, and no particular order. First and foremost, virtually every market has a loose allocation of what we think they should be able to support in terms of vacant land. So, it\u2019s what they already own or if they -- they are completely out of land, how much we think they can afford to buy from an individual business perspective. When you get down to analyzing existing sites, it\u2019s what sub market they are in, how well that sub market\u2019s been performing, how big the site is. One-off site that you can put one building on and have that into production, may be the same quarter that you buy it or the following quarter is a little bit more attractive than a site that you might have to work through any sort of clean-up demolition or entitlement process that in some of the markets we operate could take as much as 18 months. So, you\u2019ve got to factor all of those things in and then make a business decision on what you think the right risk adjusted return for the ultimate development is when you are all done with the project. That\u2019s kind of a long way of explaining all the different factors.","Sumit Sharma","Just holding up on that, how much of inflation in land prices have you seen and by and large would you be able to share that with us?","Jim Connor","Well, it\u2019s an interesting question. I would tell you, I think we\u2019ve probably seen on average, land prices up this year, probably 10% and they were probably up 10% last year. Again, it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. It\u2019s the price for the land, but it is also the cost of entitlement and how many square feet of development we can ultimately get on. And that\u2019s the onsite improvements and the offsite improvements. And as construction costs go up, the costs of those entitlements go up. Given the strength of the marketplace, there is very little incentives to be had, unless you have a very unique development project in hand with the tenants. So, you\u2019ve got to factor all of those things in when you look at the ultimate cost of the land when it goes into the development.","Operator","And next we have the line of Michael Mueller. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","So, for the acquisitions that you just closed, it looks like the in-place cap rate is nothing which is understandable because development and stabilize at about 5%. I guess when you are looking at the other 500 that\u2019s coming on line, do you expect a similar going in yield and a similar stabilized yield? And then over what time frame period do you see taking to stabilize these?","Nick Anthony","Yes. So, on the future one, I think the in-place will be a little bit higher because it\u2019s little bit more leased. And then we expect to get those stabilized within six months. Like we mentioned earlier, we have control over leasing now on those before we actually close on them. So, we expect to make progress on leasing even before we close.","Michael Mueller","And is this stabilized yield going to be similar about that size?","Nick Anthony","It\u2019ll be a little bit lower, but it\u2019ll be similar.","Michael Mueller","And last question on that, should we assume ratably throughout the balance of the year or does it feel like more is going to be at year end or closer to now?","Nick Anthony","Yes, I think it\u2019s going to close in sort of two tranches, late third quarter and then later fourth quarter.","Operator","At this point, we have no further questions here in queue.","Ron Hubbard","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to reconvening with you on our third quarter call tentatively scheduled for October 26.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for this afternoon.

Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference to our host Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead, sir.","Ron Hubbard","Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer.","Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that statements we make today are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our December 31, 2017, 10-K that we have on file with the SEC.","Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.","James Connor","Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon everyone. We filed up a very strong 2017 with a fantastic start to 2018. We had a big quarter of leasing, maintained our high occupancy levels, we grew rents at an all time record high, and we also had a big quarter of development starts. During the quarter, we increased our in-service occupancy by a 130 basis points to 97%. This was driven primarily by strong leasing of recently delivered speculative projects and recently acquired facilities.","Our stabilized in-service portfolio occupancy held firm at 98.5%, our total portfolio occupancy including projects under development increased by 50 basis points to 94.4%. Nationally, net absorption numbers for the quarter in our coming year at a very solid 41 million square feet, which is up about 8 million square feet compared to the first quarter a year ago.","New supply in the first quarter was 35 million square feet which is down from 45 and 50 million square feet range from the first quarters of 2016 and 2017. On a trailing full quarter basis, the overall spread between net absorption and supply remains in the 20 million to 25 million square foot range.","With these favorable supply demand metrics and nationwide vacancies in the 4.5% range, the logistics real estate business remains in the sweets spot. Leading economic indicators has also been very good for the last few months with the GDP outlook for 2018 remaining in that 2.5% to 3% range. All of these drivers indicate continued strong demand for our product and our ability to maintain our high occupancies and continued rent growth.","Turning to our own portfolio as evidenced by our occupancy levels, our team continued this great execution with the completion of over 6.9 million square feet of leasing for the quarter. With this strong leasing, our high occupancy we continue to be able to improve rents. Rent growth for second generation leases averaged 26% on a GAAP basis and 12% on a cash basis.","We are seeing this rent increased growth all across the markets. We renewed 68% of expiring leases during the quarter yet after considering immediate backfills we effectively released 94% of our expirations. We had an exceptional activity in the southeastern part of the country, including a 760,000 square-foot lease signed with [3PL] in Atlanta, which was an immediate backfill of the large expiring space.","In Savannah, we signed six new leases totaling 1.1 million square feet, a majority of which represented immediate backfills from expiring tenants and reflective of the very strong fundamentals of the Port of Savannah. All of these deals resulted in substantial rent growth over the previous leases.","We also executed notable leases on two vacant facilities that were part of the Bridge portfolio acquisition. Overall, the tenant acquired Bridge average assets are now 90% leased with commitments for two of the last three spaces. We would expect these assets to be 97% leased next month, several months ahead of our original underwriting.","This increased occupancy taking place earlier in the year was the basis for increasing our full year occupancy and earnings expectations. Mark will discuss this in just a moment. Leasing momentum is strong in our speculative development pipeline as well which is expected to contribute significant earnings growth and cash flow growth, as we close out 2018 and head into 2019.","We\u2019ve had a great start to the year and new development starts with $226 million of projects in six markets totaling 2.5 million square feet that were 45% preleased in aggregate. Our overall development pipeline at quarter end had 18 projects under construction, totaling 9.6 million square feet at a projected $808 million in stabilized costs for our share. These projects are 57% preleased and our margins on the pipeline are expected to continue in the 20 plus percent range.","Our development opportunities continue to be very strong. In fact, we\u2019ve started three more developments earlier this month, totaling an additional 2 million square feet and a $111 million in projected costs, that are 91% preleased. And our pipeline for prospects for the remainder of the year is strong as well which has led us to increase our development expectations for the year.","Now, let me turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover our acquisition and disposition activity for the quarter.","Nick Anthony","Thank you, Jim. We had an active quarter on the disposition front. Building dispositions totaled a 117 million and included the three data centers in the Washington D.C. market totaling 447,000 square feet. This project was developed on land we had owned for quite a while, part of which included demolition of an obsolete office building for one of the site. This project represented accretive land redevelopment by our DC team and generating significant value creation for our shareholders.","We also disposed the property in Nashville totaling 160,000 square feet. This transaction represented part of a property swap whereby we acquired two facilities in Southern California as part of the tax deferred exchange by the other party. These Southern California properties we acquired were located in the Orange County submarket and total about 120,000 square feet.","Regarding the broader acquisition market, we continue to look at many opportunities as we're aware the market is extremely competitive and thus making a difficult to find appropriate risk adjusted returns. As Jim is noted a few times recently, it will be extremely difficult to replicate an investment like a Bridge portfolio transaction we did last year.","We have experienced 40 to 50 basis points of cap rate compression in the Northern New Jersey market as these types of high quality assets are now selling at sub 4% cap rates. Even so, our team is continued to seek out opportunity that may make economic sense today.","On the positive side, we originally grow stabilized yields in the mid 4% range for the Bridge transaction and expect to outperform those levels to higher rents and quick lease up. Through our outperformance of lease-up timing and loan rate increases along with the cap rate compression, we believe we have already realized 6 to 7 basis points of value creation on that transaction.","I would also like to revisit our prospective Columbus portfolio disposition discussed in the last earnings call. We are in negotiations with prospective buyers and anticipated closing late in the second quarter. Also as you recall from our January call, one of the 4 billion has leased to Bon-Ton representing about 20% at the NOI of the portfolio for sale.","While Bon-Ton is in bankruptcy protection, they\u2019re still current on monthly rent to us. The bankruptcy proceedings are expected to resolve in the liquidation of the Company. The prospective buyers are aware of the situation and we do not expect the Bon-Ton liquidation to be any surprise to expect the closing of this transaction.","I would now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update.","Mark Denien","Thanks Nick. Good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased report the core FFO for the quarter was $0.30 per share consistent with core FFO of $0.30 per share fourth quarter of 2017.","Growth in core FFO from newly acquired or developed properties during the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was offset by increased non-cash G&A expense triggered by the accounting requirements to immediately expense a significant portion of our annual stock-based compensation brand. This higher level of G&A expense in the first quarter is consistent with past years due to this accounting treatment.","We reported FFO is defined by NAREIT of $0.31 per share for the quarter compared to a $0.33 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 with the decrease largely pertaining to changes deferred tax assets and higher gains on land sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2018. AFFO totaled $108 million for the current quarter compared to $84 million for the fourth quarter in 2017. This increase was attributable to significant lease related costs reducing AFFO in the fourth quarter 2017 as well as overall improved operating results and the positive impact of new acquisitions and developments in the first quarter of 2018.","Same property NOI growth was 3.4% on a cash basis. It was about 160 basis points higher than that on a GAAP basis. The two biggest factors closing our GAAP number to be higher than cash is free rent that we had in quarter one of 2018 from all the leases we have signed over the last two quarters along with some bad debt expense on a straight line basis that we had in quarter one of 2017 related to last year's HHGregg bankruptcy. We expect our cash and property numbers to accelerate over the next couple of quarters as this free rent burns off and significant increase in rental rates on these recently signed deals kick in.","We continue to operate with our balance sheet at A level metrics. We plan a leverage capacity and liquidity to fund our business well under 2019 without any equity needs and we will have the opportunity to lower our overall borrowing costs later this year with $227 million of secured loans during interest to7.6% are repayable. From a financial and capital standpoint, we\u2019re progressing according to plan. We are well-positioned to continue to grow our portfolio.","Let me now address revisions to our 2018 expected range of estimates, which is an exhibit at the back of our quarterly supplement and on our website. In the reflection of better-than-expected rent growth and lease up of vacant space and speculative development completions and recent acquisitions adding faster pace than anticipated. We raised guidance from core FFO to a range of a $1.26 to $1.32 per share or $0.02 per share increase at the midpoint. Similarly, we increase the range of growth and adjusted funds from operations on a share adjusted basis to a range of 4.5% to 10% from the previous range of 2.7% to 8.2%.","We increase the range for a stabilized portfolio average percentage lease to 97.5% to 98.5% up 40 basis points from the previous midpoint. We increase the range for total in-service percentage lease to 96% to 97% of 50 basis points from the previous midpoint. We did not make any changes to our same property NOI guidance as we're still comfortable with our original range.","As we've been saying for several quarters and disclosed in our investors slide deck, we have opportunity in our portfolio to grow overall NOI and earnings by substantial amount, but much of this growth would come from properties that are not currently part of our same property pool. Our current quarter results in the guidance changes reflect this.","The estimate for building dispositions was also increased to a range of 370 million to 550 million up $50 million from the previous midpoint, reflecting our ability to take further advantage of the overall significant demand for Class A properties across the U.S and record low cap rates and use these proceeds to fund our growing development pipeline.","Regarding development expectations given the strong start in Q1 and the three additional starts thus far in April and along the strong prospects for the remainder of the year. We increased guidance for development starts to a range of 650 million to 850 million up $150 million at the midpoint.","This should support incremental earnings growth as we get into the next year and generally speaking we expect to continue to drive strong preleasing levels in this pipeline to maintain strong risk-adjusted return profile on our growth plans. We revision the certain other guidance factors can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Jim.","James Connor","Thanks Mark. In closing, the logistics real estate demand drivers remain very strong in both traditional distribution and e-commerce fulfillment. In particularly, the e-commerce sector is creating new customers for us and foreseeing players to modernize their supply chain strategies for delivering goods faster and more efficiently.","We\u2019re very pleased with our team's execution through the first quarter of leasing performance, capital redeployment and development starts and we\u2019re optimistic about our strong performance for the remainder of the year.","We will now open up the lines to the audience and we would ask to keep the dialogue to one question or perhaps two very short questions and you of course are welcome to get back in the queue.","We will now turn it back over to the operator, Greg, for the first call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Manny Korchman. Please go ahead your line is open.","Manny Korchman","Jim, when you spoke about the increased development pipeline or the rents in development pipeline you spoke about an increase in prospects. So I was wondering those are tenant prospects in terms of build-to-suits? Or is that land that has either come to entitlement task or have you found new land opportunities that you can develop on?","James Connor","Well, Manny, I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s a little bit of both. Obviously, we have committed to keep our preleasing percentage at or above that 50% range. So, we are finding more build-to-suits and we are filling the pipeline with additional build-to-suit opportunities that we think look pretty good for the second half of the year. And then secondarily based on our occupancies and the leasing that we've done, we have got ample opportunities to start additional spec projects. All of that requires the land that you've referenced. So, we have either got land that we can put in service or we've acquired land recently that\u2019s now entitled and ready to go. It's all driving the development machine right now pretty well.","Manny Korchman","And a quick one for Nick. You talked about the lack of acquisition opportunities out there mentioning that place would have been hard to find today. What do you have to do to get acquisitions done as it looked for bigger portfolios, smaller portfolios, development assets? How do you solve for that lack of acquisition.","Nick Anthony","Well, I guess the best example was our Southern California acquisition. We were able to provide an exchange property in Nashville that some of our competitors were not able to provide which allowed us to acquire that property we think that\u2019s below market pricing. So, it's just getting creative a natural thing, but I\u2019m not going to kid you it is very competitive out there right now. And get even with the recent rising interest rates, cap rates have compressed.","Operator","And next we turn to line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","Jim, you had commented that the Southeast is particularly strong. Can you give some more color about what you are seeing in that region specifically? And then, are there any regional differences that standout?","James Connor","Yes, I would -- I think our guys, our teams in the Southeast particularly Atlanta and Savannah had a great quarter, backfilling that 760,000 put vacancy right away was really key for us, got us off to a strong performance. And then there is just incredible demand going down at the port of Savannah. We actually met with the port leadership just literally a couple of days ago and it's the fastest growing port on the eastern seaboard and is clearly seeing the benefit of the expansion of the Panama Canal which opened up a couple of years ago. So that\u2019s obviously helping us drive business down there. So as all of our peers have reported in the last week or 10 days, most all of the markets are really pretty good. That that team down there for us had a really good -- did a really good job in the first quarter.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Jeremy Metz. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Jim, in your opening remarks you mentioned the national supply and demand numbers and you talked to supply of I think it was 35 million square feet being down on a relative basis so far this year. Just wondering given the strength in the sector, the attractive development spreads, were you surprised at all by that number? And I mean, if we just look at your own portfolio you ramp starts your peers are doing at, so should we expect to see that supply figure really ramp back up here throughout the year?","James Connor","Yes, Jeremy, I would agree with you. I think we were all very pleasantly surprised by that. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that, that's just a quarter number I think most of us are expecting pretty close to equilibrium this year being plus or minus 200 million of demand and plus or minus 200 million square feet of supply. So, we keep pretty close tabs on all of the markets and the submarkets within their, and while there is a little softness in a couple of submarkets that we've all talked about from time to time. When you are at 4.5% vacancy across the entire country we're in a really good spot right now, and I'm not particularly worried about supply at least for the forcible future.","Jeremy Metz","And no real change in your forecast at this point, right?","James Connor","No, I think we could see those absorptions and supply numbers flip flop next quarter I mean I'm not making the projection but you could. Again at the end of the year, I think most of us are pretty much consensus at or about equilibrium, but as I've been saying for quite some time equilibrium at 4.5% vacancy nationwide is a pretty good place to reach equilibrium.","Jeremy Metz","And just as a follow-up question. In terms of the Bridge portfolio, it sounds like both the timing and the achieve rents there have been ahead of schedule. I think when you originally announced then you talked about underwriting it to just under 5% stabilized yield. So wondering where does that yield pencil out today on a stabilized basis?","Mark Denien","It's Mark. We -- I think when we originally underwrote that we were talking mid four 45 or 46 something like that. Based on what Nick said earlier with the cap rate compression and our better performance and we had underwritten, we think we've got 60 basis points to 70 basis points of value creation. So, you could add another 20 basis points on that original underwriting and that's probably where it's going to stabilize that.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Ki Bin Kim. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Could you just help by the lease spreads and if there is any trends in, was there fairly in market size that were driving it or was it comp broad based?","James Connor","Ki Bin, it was really across the board. I guess probably our best performing markets were the once Jim already commented on. Savannah was very, very strong underwritten growth, but it was really broad-based across the board. They weren't a lot of trophies as it rolled either so it's just substantial at rent growth. The one benefit when you got longer term leases in environment like this the rents you had in place for a little bit lower, but it was pretty much across the country.","Mark Denien","Yes, I think the only color I would add Ki Bin would be, if you discount the immediate backfills, I think we renewed 65% -- 68% which is down a little bit for us. And when we're highly occupied, it really gives our leasing and development professional the ability to go out and push rents because they just don't have that much occupancy. So that's what they've been doing and consequently when you're not renewing a tenant and you're immediately backfill in space with the 298% of everything, it's aspiring, it's a pretty good place to be for a land right now.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay and you have a couple larger assets -- development assets than I think in Allentown, still on lease. I mean given your track record I am not too worried about it, but any kind of color on momentum you\u2019re seeing there from tenants?","James Connor","Yes, we\u2019ve got a lot of activity, I can tell you that any of our exposure that we\u2019ve either got in the portfolio today or that we\u2019re -- that\u2019s in the development pipeline coming at us in the next six months, worries me at all. There\u2019s a lot of activity in the Greater Lehigh Valley right now, shortlisted on budget deal. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to see pretty consistent performance as we did in the last quarter of us ability -- our ability to lease this space as it comes online.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Dick Schiller. Please go ahead.","Dick Schiller","Two quick ones for me. First of all, could you guys clarify the impact on the change in the same store methodology and the detriment to 2018 that you'll see there? And then secondly, the Bon-Ton assets I understand one of the assets is set for sale in Columbus was the asset in Chicago released?","Mark Denien","I\u2019ll cover the same property and I\u2019ll let Nick or Jim cover the second question, Dick. Our same property number for the current quarter, the new methodology was 3.4. If you look at the prior quarter -- I am sorry the sequential prior quarter, so the fourth quarter of 2017 we reported 3.2, if you would have used our current methodology back in that prior quarter that 3.2 would have been 2.5 so a 70 basis points reduction if you will under the new methodology. So the way we look at it quarter-over-quarter, we grew from 2.5 in the fourth quarter to 3.4 this quarter so was about 70 basis point difference. And then, I\u2019ll let Jim or Nick address the second question.","James Connor","Yes, Dick. Nick addressed Bon-Ton in Columbus. So, we think we\u2019re in a pretty good place there. Bon-Ton has been publicly reported is now in the liquidation phase. Our expectation is that they will likely be in through most of the summer. The liquidated that was selected is now in the process of breaking up the building, the business, selling the assets. There are several potential buyers of the business that occupies the space in Chicago, which for us is 270,000 square feet, so 40-foot clear building. So it\u2019s a really nice asset.","In addition, we've actually got to increase from our own portfolio in Chicago looking at the building. So I think, in short order this will be a little bit like the HHGregg. I think it will be short-term pain, long-term gain because I think we\u2019ll backfill that space in fairly short order and we\u2019ll improve the NOI for the space and obviously get a better quality tenant.","Nick Anthony","And I would just clarify on the Columbus facility, it\u2019s one of four assets that are -- we\u2019ve to sell right now and that asset only represents 20% of the overall portfolio.","Operator","And we\u2019ve a question next from the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead your line is now open.","Mark Denien","We like your question best Blaine.","James Connor","Okay, operator, we'll go to next one. Blaine will get back.","Operator","Mr. Heck, your line is open, again, if you would like to give it a try, sir. You might have your phone on mute.","James Connor","Or maybe Blaine is not there. Who is next in the queue?","Operator","Next is John Guinee. Please go ahead. Sir, your line is open.","John Guinee","I\u2019ll ask the question that Blaine was going to ask.","James Connor","Sure, you will John.","John Guinee","So, Nick, you\u2019re selling 4 out of 15 assets in the Columbus. Can you sort of talk about why those 4 relative to the other 11? And how you\u2019re thinking about tightening up various portfolios and places like Columbus?","Nick Anthony","Yes, we\u2019re constantly trying to diversify our portfolio from a geographic perspective. The 4 assets that we\u2019re selling are in West Jefferson, which is the west submarket of Columbus along Interstate 70. That\u2019s a park that we option land over the years and done a lot of build-to-suits on that. And so as we\u2019re trying to right size portfolio as it was made logical sense to go ahead monetize those assets and redeployment other geographies.","John Guinee","Okay. And then that was a softball. Then the other question Blaine was going to ask is, if you look at industrial product, it\u2019s maybe 30% to 40% leased to traditional retailers. And when Jim you brought up the Bon-Ton situation remind me of this. The other issue dropped anytime soon where e-commerce gets so strong that the traditional retailers need less space?","James Connor","Well, John, I think you had to step back and look at. E-commerce represents about 9% or 10% of sales in the U.S. and while everybody expected to grow bricks and mortar sales are still the vast majority of the sales, I think $3.6 trillion. And we spent a lot of time in meetings and on conversations like this. Talking about good retailers and bad retailers and unfortunately, there is a few of the Bon-Ton and HHGregg that tend to get a lot of the headlines and are in tough shape.","And whether their over leverage or they haven\u2019t been able to invest in their business or they haven\u2019t embraced e-commerce, they\u2019re not doing do well and many of them will not survive. But a lot of retailers have in fact made those investors. They've kept their stores up. They\u2019ve been smart about opening new facilities. They\u2019ve invested in their supply chain and they\u2019ve embraced e-commerce. And they continue to grow sales and they continue to grow it through the use of e-commerce.","So, I think it\u2019s a case of the glass half full or the glass half empty. We tend to focus on the strong guys that are doing well. We tend to try and stay away from the guides that are doing so well. And Bon-Ton is unfortunately one of those, but I think we\u2019ve mitigated that risk with the sale of Columbus portfolio and hopefully will be able to have the Chicago assets backfilled by the end of the year. And as we've discussed, we don\u2019t have that much tough retail exposure out there in our portfolio. So, it\u2019s not one of the things that keeps me awake at night.","John Guinee","Now that I will ask Blaine\u2019s question perhaps my question.","James Connor","Sure.","Operator","Okay, we turn to the line of Blaine Heck. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Blaine Heck","And good job John on the question, but couple more for me. In the guidance think it shows that you are focused on acquisitions in Tier 1 markets. Can you give any more specific on where the markets are and maybe what the cap rate on the acquisitions maybe?","Mark Denien","So, on the acquisition side, we\u2019re focused on high day two or one, so Southern California, South Florida and Northeast primarily Northern New Jersey, and then we're also looked to some transition in the East Bay. You know right now, most in those market trades are going off and breaking forecast now in lot of those markets or very low forecast numbers. Fortunately for us, there been more development opportunities to make up for the lack of acquisition opportunities for us.","Blaine Heck","That\u2019s fair. And then just a quick one on the data center sales, you guys have any other opportunities to do similar deals. I think a lot of it to do with the location of the land and infrastructure around, but I wanted to get some color on whether we\u2019ll be seeing any more of that?","James Connor","Yes, Blaine, we actually do have opportunities. I can't tell you that we have a great deal of expertise there and we're now trying to find data center land. Sometimes, it's just better to be lucky than good that we've done a number of those as Nick referenced the once we just sold in. In D.C. at some of the lands that we got there has the potential to go that way. We've also done a number in Chicago in and around the O'Hare market again where we bought really industrial land and it happened to be a viable for data center. So, that business that we\u2019re trying to find that every now and again, we've got a good piece of land that makes lot of sense for the data center guys. And if the pricing is right, we can develop it then we\u2019re more than happy to do that.","Operator","Next we turn the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","I just want to quickly focus on same store results. The operating expense increase, can I assume that that increase has been passed on through tenants?","James Connor","It has Eric and the reason expenses were up so high this quarter over last year was snow. Snow removal expenses were quite high this quarter over last year and it was all passed through.","Eric Frankel","Okay, thank you, and you acquisition and disposition activity this quarter is quite interesting. Actually that property swap is pretty good take study. Nick, want to get your sense, what do you think is the right cap rate spread for buying in Tier 1 market and maybe selling a little bit more assets in the Midwest or England markets?","Nick Anthony","Well for that particular swap, we look at more on the IR basis -- on IRR basis. But I would tell you that we talked about the cap rate in the high barrier Tier 1 a lot and how low they are, but the Midwest cap rates are at record levels too and numbers we have not seen before. So, they're getting very low as well. I think the spread does take two markets between SoCal and Indianapolis is as low as 100 to 125 bps right now.","Eric Frankel","Very interesting, so it would be fair to say that you will be pretty willing to both increase your acquisition and disposition guidance if you found pricing similar to today and assuming cap rates don\u2019t move?","Nick Anthony","No I think that, first of all, our portfolio, we are pretty happy with it right now. So all we are doing is the last little bit of repositioning around the system. We will continue to do that from year to year. But I think to -- I think we would rather redeploy that into development right now because we think that\u2019s much more accretive going forward for us.","James Connor","The other thing I\u2019d mention Eric is we raised our guidance on development. We just still think that\u2019s the best place to put new capital out right now and raise our guidance on dispositions to pay for some of that. We did not touch our acquisition guidance and I think as we see today we would think that\u2019s probably going to trend more towards the lower end on the acquisition side.","Operator","And next we turn to line of Michael Carroll. Please go ahead.","Michael Carroll","Jim, I know you have touched on this earlier on the call, but can you add some color on what you are seeing in the market today with regards to new development starts? Where are these opportunities? And similar to the acquisition strategy are you focused on the Tier 1 markets?","James Connor","Well, Mike, I\u2019d tell you, clearly we are doing more development activity in the Tier 1 markets. I am trying to remember the exact number. We had a board meeting yesterday and I think it's 65% of the development activity in Tier 1 market. So that\u2019s South Florida, Atlanta, New Jersey, the Lehigh Valley, Chicago, Dallas or Southern California for us that would be how we will define that. And that's really where we are trying to really grow our portfolios.","I think you will continue to see us developed in all the other markets that we are in, but there I think you'll see us, as Nick explained in the Columbus portfolio continue to every now and again harvest some gains and right size some of those portfolios. And we would expect some pretty healthy gains coming out of the Columbus sales as we've done I think that\u2019s four build-to-suits that we've done over the last six or seven years and we think we will get some really good pricing out of that. I think you will continue to see us to do that.","Michael Carroll","And what type of deals are you willing to pursue outside of those Tier 1 markets? Are those mostly build-to-suits with existing relationships?","James Connor","Now, it's both build-to-suits in spec but it's on land that we own that we have got a fairly attractive basis. So, we are making really good stabilized returns in those projects. So we continue to do development in the Annapolis and St. Louis, you saw us do a build-to-suit and a spec building in Minneapolis. I think that this just will continue for us.","Operator","And next we turn to the line of Michael Mueller. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","In terms of development leasing and just thinking about activity levels, can you give us some sense as to how many serious proposals, tours, looks are getting from tenants on a typical building that now as shall complete that you are trying to lease up? And how is that level compared to say a year or so ago?","James Connor","Well, let me answer the second question first. It's pretty consistent. When we talk about having good activity across the board, we review every month with our leadership team all the major vacancies. We review all the build-to-suit prospects that we have got. And the activity level, I would tell you, has been consistently good month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter for the last several years. In terms of the individual spaces, our leasing guys have an expression, it only takes one. So you can have four or five different proposals out on the space or you can have one, and it's just takes the one guy that's willing to step up and sign for the right term.","So sitting here today as I answered one of the earlier questions, we've got really good activity across the board. We start following spec developments at the moment we approve them internally so even when they are in just coming out of the ground. And some of those the activities is modest or non-existing at that point, but some of them already have great activity because they are in established parts and it's really good land and in a very competitive environment. So that's a long way of challenges kind of all over the board but month in and month out we got pretty good activity everywhere.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next we turn to line of Jamie Feldman. Please go ahead.","Jamie Feldman","I guess just sticking with the land, can you talk about the land bank and how it lines up with your development opportunities and maybe Tier 1 versus Tier 2 markets?","James Connor","Yes, sure Jamie. Our land bank at the end of the quarter was up to about 270 million hours had gotten down into the low 200s not even touch 200 million, which was really low for us. And we acquired about I want to say 60 million of land in the quarter, and we monetize about the same amount through either minimal land sales but monetize it through development. So over the years, we've told people that we're comfortable as long as you think we are in a healthy economy and a healthy market with the land portfolio or landholdings of 300 to 400 million. So we're currently well below that. Some of the players that were making and some of the high barrier Tier 1 markets are bigger and more expensive.","So I would anticipate that land bank for us is going to kind of stay between the $250 and $300 million mark for the balance of the year. We've talked in past calls about the pricing on land and the difficulty and the challenges that we face every day to get good sites at reasonable prices and then be able to get entitled. And I had spoken before that I think that's one of the governors that is keeping supply and check from the U.S. industrial market. This land is not as plentiful as a lot of people would think. And it\u2019s a very expensive today and the entitlement process is expensive and lengthy and that's keeping the amount of expect development across the country to a reasonable level.","Jamie Feldman","So, how does it line up with your development opportunities in terms of helping up the 270 what's Tier 1 and what's Tier 2?","James Connor","I don\u2019t have a breakdown in front of me I would tell you that and this is the problem that I have every year, I have too much land in some markets and not enough land in other markets and it c changes year-over-year. So we are actively looking for land in markets like New Jersey where we have no vacant land in our inventory because we put the last two sites into production, we're looking for land in the Lehigh Valley because I think we've only got site for one more development right now. Other places we've got more than ample land for the next five or six projects like a market like Atlanta.","So there's a good healthy mix, we don't have that much what we would call surplus land anymore I think our surplus landholdings are down under 20 million of land that\u2019s held for sale right now. So over the last few years we\u2019ve really been able to prune that portfolio get it down to a very nice healthy level and get rid of all the nonstrategic land, and again remember we own residual retail land and residual office land from where we were in those businesses and now all that\u2019s gone and we\u2019re really focusing on the core industry.","Jamie Feldman","And then you mentioned governors, or land of the governor, are you seeing any change in appetite for speculative element from the merchant builders for higher construction costs or higher interest rate?","James Connor","I think construction costs is another one of the governors that\u2019s keeping things in place and as we\u2019ve talked before, financing, financing levels are much more reasonable compared to previous cycles, so you\u2019re still looking at most o the merchant builders having to have institutional equity in order to get financing and move ahead on spec projects, even as good as the market is today, so I think the combination of those things has kept speculative element at a very reasonable level.","Jamie Feldman","So, would you say there\u2019s been a change recently or not really in terms of their appetite?","James Connor","No, I think there's a lot of people in the world that would build more spec today if they could, if they had land at a better price, or they could get entitled sooner, or they could get it financed or construction costs were little more reasonable but the combination of all those things right now makes it a little bit more challenging, it puts that development out into the marketplace and I think the market has been at this kind of level, some 5% vacancy for a couple years now, so I don't think you\u2019re seeing any increased demand to do more spec, I think that's been there pretty consistently, throughout the last few years.","Operator","And we\u2019ve a follow-up from the line of Dick Schiller. Please go ahead.","Dick Schiller","I am good, I don't have a follow-up guys. Thank you.","James Connor","Thanks Dick.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Eric Frankel. Please go ahead.","Eric Frankel","I do have follow up question. Can you describe in your recent leasing activity given that labor is becoming more expensive and less plentiful whether there is more CapEx incurred by the tenants so installed automated operations in the spaces and maybe your new development projects?","James Connor","Sure, Eric. Let me give you two answers to that question. One of the things that we do and I can\u2019t speak to my peers, one of the things that we do is before we buy a major piece of land, we do a labor stay. So we\u2019re not investing how many million dollars in a land site, if we don\u2019t have the answers on the labor study before hand, because we know that such a key criteria for many of our big logistic fulfillment client, so that\u2019s answer number one. We\u2019re comfortable with the labor for every one of the sites that we own and anything that we\u2019re pursuing.","In terms of your second question about CapEx, yes, I think a lot of retailers and e-commerce companies are looking to put more automation, and more material handling into the buildings, to get faster and more efficient. That\u2019s not part of the CapEx for us. So, our CapEx has listened to docks and lights and little bit of office, shipping warehouses, things like that. So those dollars are going up, but that\u2019s not part of the TI package that we\u2019re putting into any of our deals.","Eric Frankel","Right understood. But do you have a sense of how much the tenants are putting and just to get a sense of how your operations are evolving?","James Connor","I think at the high end, Eric, I think it is a, like 10 multiple of our cost of the building or some of these highly sophisticated fulfillment centers with material handling, robotics, multiple levels. And that\u2019s the investment the Company makes before they book $1 of inventory or they higher 1%. And they're hugely, hugely sophisticated buildings. They have the big capability to run 24x7 and these are the companies that are making this kind of investment, that are getting much more efficient. They are in a position to get products to the consumers whether that\u2019s the store, the consumer\u2019s house, faster and more efficiently. And those are the guys that are going to survive.","Jamie Feldman","One, final question. You just spoke quite extensively on the land and entitlement process and why development volumes are probably a little bit less lower than people would normally expect in this part of the cycle. All the just secrete that, it\u2019s particularly hard to build in the Tier 1 market you\u2019re describing. Can you talk about how the entitlement and development process now have changed in some of more your traditional markets in more England and more the England part of U.S.?","James Connor","Yes. I\u2019ll give you a great example, this is very tight and it\u2019s Huston, Texas. So in Houston, they have just passed ordinances that have made it particularly restrictive and difficult to develop industrial on a site that is in the 500-year floodplain. And there is a lot of industrial that is in the 500-year floodplain in Houston. We\u2019re not talking about 100-year floodplain. We\u2019re talking to 500-year floodplain. I was with the leader of our Houston office, David Hudson, on Tuesday and Wednesday. And he believed that\u2019s going to take the normal entitlement process for piece of raw land in Houston from -- what would normally have been probably 9 to maybe 10 or 11 months to somewhere between 12 and 18 months.","Jamie Feldman","And you think that, is that probably applicable to other similar markets?","James Connor","Yes. I think that\u2019s an extreme, but I think even some of the most business friendly Midwestern markets that we\u2019ve operated in for a long time are continuing to make the entitlement process and the approval processes that much more challenging. They\u2019re sensitive to cars on the road. They\u2019re sensitive to trucks. Incentives are getting harder and harder to get and it\u2019s just the result of the strength of the economy and the strength of the markets.","Ron Hubbard","I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT Conference in New York in early June. Operator, you may disconnect the line.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect."]}}
