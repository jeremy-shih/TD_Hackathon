Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our results released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release today and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Jim Flores, Red Conger's here, Mark Johnson's here, as well as several other senior members of our team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be focusing today's discussion on how we are positioned in our operations and addressing our balance sheet in the current market environment. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.1 billion, $3.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. As indicated in the press release, where we have a reconciliation, the net loss included charges totaling $4.1 billion or $3.45 per share, primarily for the reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $21 million or $0.02 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter totaled $919 million. We have a reconciliation of that in our slide materials for your reference.","The consolidated copper sales totaled 1.15 billion pounds in the fourth quarter. Our gold sales totaled 338,000 ounces. We sold 20 million pounds of molybdenum and 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalents during the quarter.","Our average realized copper price was $2.18 per pound. That was below 2014's fourth quarter average of $2.95 per pound. Gold prices averaged $1,067per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2015. And our realized price for crude oil was $48.88 per barrel, which included $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts.","We generated operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of $612 million and funded capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion during the quarter. We ended the year with $20.4 billion in debt and consolidated cash was $224 million.","As indicated in the release, since August of 2015, a total of $2 billion of gross proceeds have been raised under FCX's at-the-market equity program, including approximately $1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015. And we ended the year with approximately 1.25 billion common shares outstanding and had no amounts drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility.","I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide materials that are on our website.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. This is going to be a different call than we have \u2013 have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet, and we want to convey that we're addressing this seriously and with a degree of urgency and we're very focused on it.","So let's think about what's changed for us since our last earnings call. On slide 3, we show the obvious, the drop in copper prices, the drop in oil prices. And as we talked about it at the end of the third quarter, we were looking at various scenarios that ranged from a further decline in prices at that time to other more positive scenarios. We're experiencing the worst of those scenarios right now, with copper dropping to $2 and oil dropping to $30. And we're also facing a market of where market sentiment continues to be negative, particularly negative about China, and we have to prepare for that. So the issue is what are we doing? What's Freeport going to do about this right now? And I want to convey to you what we are doing.","And turn to slide 4. We are aggressively managing cost, CapEx, production, cash flow and working for capital raising transactions to address our balance sheet. At the third quarter earning release, we talked about how we had restructured our board of directors. We had gone from 16 previous members to seven. We added two representatives of Carl Icahn, a significant shareholders of ours now. I can tell you, we have a board that's fully engaged and fully supportive of what we need to do and very active. And we're listening to the input of our board members and reviewing our plans as we go forward.","At that time, we had also revised our management structure from the previous Office of the Chairman to go to a different structure, and that structure was further changed in December with Jim Bob stepping down as Executive Chairman of our company. Gerry Ford, our Lead Director, has been elected as a Non-Executive Chairman. And I now have, effective January 1, executive responsibility for our Global Business, including our Oil & Gas business and our business in Indonesia. Jim Bob continues to work as an advisor and he's working very helpfully in dealing with our ongoing discussions with the government in Indonesia.","But we have a clear strategic direction of our company now, and that strategic direction is to create shareholder value out of our copper and minerals business as we go forward. We're going to be looking at our oil and gas assets as a way to generate value to help support that strategy. And we're going to be focused immediately on addressing our balance sheet issues.","And one thing I believe is, that's been lost in the noise of the turmoil in the commodities market business, the issues relating to our over-leverage as a result to the Oil & Gas transaction in 2013, the concerns about credit generally for natural resource companies is the fact that we have a very profitable mining business underlying all this that's going to give us the way forward for the future. We had over $19 million dollars of EBITDA in the fourth quarter \u2013 $900 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015. We've made significant reductions in our capital spending and we're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows. We've deferred our Oil & Gas drilling activities to conserve cash. We're engaged in strategic review about those assets, and we're looking at all alternatives including sales of the business, sales of assets, and how we might manage it going forward because of the market condition we're in.","You'll see that we have reduced our copper and oil unit cost of production significantly. We've also and I want to comment about the success we've had with the Cerro Verde project; a project we wouldn't start today in these market conditions, but that's the nature of mining assets. We actually began to work on this expansion with Cerro Verde in 2010, a $4.6 billion project that we brought in without having a significant cost overrun, the world's largest concentrator facilities at a mine anywhere in the world, and it's come up without cost overrun at all in a very efficient \u2013 effective way and it will be a great long-term asset for our company going forward.","We've taken steps to protect our balance sheet by suspending our dividend. We raised equity proceeds through two ATM initiatives that have generated $2 billion of equity for us. Now we're going to talk about further steps.","As we look at restoring our balance sheet to reflect current market conditions, we're going to focus and manage our cost and capital and continue to generate cash flow in a safe way. We're going to take immediate steps to reduce debt to enhance shareholder value. We are in active discussions with a number of parties on alternatives for asset sales. Besides the review of the oil and gas business, we are looking at transaction involving a wide range of our copper assets that involve alternatives. But we have interested parties. We have great assets that could lead to sales or joint venture arrangements that will be important steps for dealing with our balance sheet.","I mentioned in the oil and gas business, we're engaged in a review for that. Our board has hired Lazard as the board's financial advisor on that. Working together with our traditional banker, JPMorgan, we are canvassing the market to understand what the current market value is in an obviously tough market. And we are engaged with interested parties now who are being provided recent access to our year-end updates of our oil and gas reserve information in our various plants. We expect all of these to achieve progress that we'll be reporting to you as it occurs during the first half of 2016.","Look at slide six to show what we've done with capital. The capital we spent in 2015, which reflected the Cerro Verde project's completion of a project, as I said, that started a number of years ago, but that is now completed. The oil and gas capital spending reflected plans and commitments for our drilling rig equipment and other support facilities that were structured during the time when we were planning on investing for growth in that business. And we're making adjustments that reduce capital spending for 2016 to $3.4 billion, and our plans for 2017 show capital dropping to $2.3 billion.","The $1.5 billion for oil and gas reflects a couple of factors that we'll be carrying over in the early part of the year. We had some cash cost to pay for costs that were actually incurred last year. We are restructuring our drilling rig contracts. We are undertaking a plan to idle all three of the deepwater rigs. And so we will be seeing that spending dropping off markedly after midyear of this year. And you can see that by 2017, the CapEx will be down to $600 million. That excludes idle rig costs that we will be incurring for the commitments we have under these contracts, which we are negotiating how to arrange those with the drilling rig contractors. But excluded from the CapEx plans are $600 million of idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017. These are going to be reflected as expenses in our income statement rather than as capital spending. So major reductions and continued focus on how to continue to restrain capital.","We've adjusted our mine plans. We look at each one of our mines; we talked about this earlier. But we evaluate each of our mines with looking at a $2 copper price and considering sustaining capital. And we have made adjustments that aggregate roughly 350 million pounds, about 9% of our 2015 sales by adjusting production at four of our mines.","We have stress-tested our current operating plans for our copper prices below $2 and developed contingency actions to take if the market weakens further. And we will be monitoring that on a day-by-day basis. Jim's doing a great job to do that.","The facts are that we have such an attractive cost structure that we will generate cash flows \u2013 free cash flows out of our mining business even at much lower prices than $2. And we've taken these actions to preserve our very valuable significant long-term resources but while reducing near-term supply and generating cash flow.","To show the results of these actions as it reflects in our unit cost, we look at slide eight, you can see on the chart that in 2015 our consolidated site production and delivery cost before by-product credits was $1.78. With our new plans, we are reducing our outlook for that for next year by 25% to $1.34. And when you take into account by-product credits, for gold at Grasberg, molybdenum in several of our mines, cobalt in Africa, you get down to a unit net cash cost even at these low commodity prices levels for by-products of $1.10 consolidated for our company going forward.","We're doing this through aggressive cost and equipment fleet management in addition to curtailing high cost production. We get the benefits of scale at Cerro Verde. We have Grasberg's ore grades improving beginning in the second half of this year, as we execute our plan to complete mining in the open pit by the end of 2017, managing working capital, taking advantage of low input cost.","Our oil and gas cash production cost are being reduced by nearly 20% and that reflects the fact that we're having increasing volumes from our gas (17:37) drilling work in the Gulf of Mexico where our unit costs are lower than in California, and also work that our oil and gas team is doing to take advantage of lower costs from contractors and being more efficient in general.","More on our mining unit net cost presented on page nine, you can see this by region, where in the Americas, our before capital expenditure cost level is about $1.50 per pound. And in Indonesia, where costs are lower, reflecting the higher grade volumes that we have coming to us through our mine plan, the average is $1.10.","And then after showing capital expenditures for sustaining capital, you can see that it averages $1.32. The Grasberg number includes the capital we're spending on underground development so that we have the underground mines available to continue Grasberg as a high-volume, low-cost, long-term operation after the completion of the mining of the open pit in 2017.","So much talk about copper market commentary that I'm just going to make a couple of comments about it. Unquestionably, the uncertainty about the global economy is negatively impacting financial market sentiment. China's demand growth is slowing. Our Western demand is not as good as we and others had hoped it would be, but it's still expanding gradually.","I'm not going to debate anyone about the market. The market is what the market is. But the facts are that in the copper business differs from other commodities in that there is not an enormous excess supply in inventories. We just show here the exchange stocks that's developed from the end of 2014 to the current date, similar story when you look at total global inventories. But here we have exchange stocks not rising significantly, remaining low by historical standards, at a time when the copper price has gone from $2.88 to $2 from the end of 2014 to the current date.","It is \u2013 even looking at the decline in prices so dramatically since the third quarter, inventories are not building. The story is fundamentally, in today's world, the business we're seeing is not as negative as the financial markets are reacting to it. We have no particular insight as to what's going to happen in China in the future. We have to prepare ourselves for what the market is and the market is we've got $2 copper and we've got to react to it.","To date, industry wide, there have been reduction in high-cost mines. Wood Mackenzie says 730,000 tons a year, there will be other cuts if prices stay at this level. The supply from new mines like Cerro Verde, like Morenci that began construction years ago are coming to an end now. The current level of balance in the marketplace is not yielding a surplus as high as people had predicted. And all the time, lower-grade ores are coming from existing mines. Mines are depleting. Mines are moving underground. All these things will lead to an ultimate price recovery, in my view, absent just a collapse in the world's economy because today's price is not high enough to incentivize any future development. So we have enormous resources. We're not going to be spending money on developing those resources until the market improves.","And if we were to start today, if the price of copper were to magically jump to $4 a pound, it would be on the order of 10 years before new production could come out of our resources. So we remain confident about the long-term copper markets and dealing with the reality of today's low prices.","Now, looking at just how good our copper business is, we talked about 2015 being a bridge year. Well, we crossed the bridge and now we're looking at a big uphill climb because of the current price. But even at current prices, our mining business at $2 yields $4.2 billion of EBITDA. And you can see that steps up, if we were to have higher prices and our CapEx and our mining business is $1.9 billion. So we have a company \u2013 we have a business that earns profits at low prices. We've cut back capital and we have that providing support for what we're doing.","We have a great set of assets and we have five mines that have the potential of producing 1 billion pounds of copper per year. Three of them are already doing that: the Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg mines. Tenke Fungurume has great growth opportunities, as does our El Abra mine in Chile. So we have a very attractive long-term set of assets to deal with.","Quality assets, which gives us the opportunities to deal with the financing issues we face with our balance sheet. Very large reserves that I'm sure most of you know about. We've got 100 billion pounds of copper at $2 mine plans, adding in another like amount of mineralized material that's already been identified. As I said, that's there for our company for the long run. We're not going to be developing new projects until the market improves.","Grasberg is a great asset. It is a very special asset with a high grade ore and copper and gold combined. And we have been working with the government of Indonesia in a challenging political environment in that country. We have a commitment from the government that was reflected in communication we received on October 7 from the Minister of Energy and Mines about our proposal to extend the primary term of our contract, which primary term of our 1991 contract goes to 2021. It gives us the rights to two 10-year extensions to 2041. We've been working with the government and we received the positive letter from the minister saying the government will grant approval for the contract and will preserve our rights in the same level of legal and fiscal certainty in the existing contract.","We have recent reaffirmation of that commitment from senior government officials. The process going forward has been complicated by recent political developments in the country including the investigations related to the taped conversation with the former Speaker of the Indonesian parliament and the reviews by parliament of that and the investigation with it. But we remain confident and have support from senior government officials that their policy about extending our contract remains in place. The issue is when that happens and how the government deals with the existing regulations for extending contracts.","And consistent with our agreement with the government \u2013 with the government's agreement to extend our contract and that we are advancing plans for the development of new smelting capacity with the government and with the vesting interest in our ownership of PTFI, we submitted recently a valuation in response to the government asking for that of our valuation of PTFI. And it reflected a valuation of approximately $16 billion, which reflects standard market ways of looking at values of mining assets. And we've agreed to offer, over time, 20.64% interest of PTFI to Indonesian ownership, whether that's the government state-owned companies, listing on the stock exchange, or sales to other Indonesian interest at fair market value.","We've had ongoing discussions with the government on renewing our export license. Members \u2013 certain officials within the Ministry of Energy and Mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty that we should make a sizable escrow deposit to support the smelter development. These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government on beginning in mid-2014. And our discussions with the government continue.","I'm here today to tell you that we have full confidence that the government will come up with a favorable decision and issue the export license to ensure the continuity of our mining operations. And in doing so, we'll serve the interest of Indonesia's mining industry in general. So that's the status. We have not, to-date, been given that export license, but we have confidence that we will.","Now, turning to our oil and gas business, I want to reiterate things we've talked about in the past. These are very good assets that have valuable infrastructure and associated resources. We've had successful drilling activities since their acquisition by Freeport in mid-2013. And this successful drilling has de-risked the opportunities around the underutilized production facilities that we acquired in the transaction. We drilled 14 wells with positive results, four wells have been brought on production.","And even though we are deferring drilling for the foreseeable future because of market conditions, the success we've had in past drilling would allow us to connect certain of these discoveries in a way that our near-term production volumes will actually be increasing because of the past drilling successes. Major property that we have an interest in Heidelberg, operated by Anadarko, produced its first oil this month and it will be ramping up as we go into 2016. We will also expect to place six additional wells on production from our own drilling in 2016. This will result, as I mentioned earlier, a reduction in our cash production cost to a consolidated of approximately $15 a barrel that reflects $10 a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico. We are deferring for the foreseeable future our exploration development activities. As I said, all three of our deepwater drilling rigs are being idled. Two are already idled and one is completing in the imminent future, in the immediate future, a completion activity that it's currently working on.","But the business has very long-term production and development potential that will be there for the ultimate recovery in oil prices. There's a big inventory of drilling locations that will be available to create incremental value over the long period of time and that comes about because of our focus area in the deepwater where we have three major underutilized platforms: Marlin, Holstein and Horn Mountain where our recent tieback drilling has been done and where we've identified significant incremental drilling opportunities. We have interest in the Lucius and Heidelberg fields on non-operated basis and interest in the Vito area that has significant long-term development potential.","On slide 18, we show what the EBITDA for this business would be generating and what the CapEx would be, excluding the idle rig cost. You can see that this business is very highly leveraged, of course, to the price of oil and can generate substantial free cash flows in the environment depending on the price of oil.","We are planning our business not with an expectation that price increases will occur, but preserving values for an eventual recovery in prices. We're taking a very hard look at G&A cost as we go forward with this oil and gas review process. I've been working with Jim and his team in Houston. We're targeting a near term 30% reduction in G&A cost. And then, as we complete the oil and gas review process, we will assess the structure of our business at that time if, in fact, we don't sell the entire business. And then, we will organize the business to fit with what comes out of the oil and gas review process.","Throughout our organization and with our team in Houston, I'm encouraged by the very positive and cooperative approach that all of our team is dealing with to deal with this price environment. Jim, do have anything you like to comment on?","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, Richard, more just a continuation of the direction you're going with the call because with the Board of Directors and with Richard's guidance and help working through the process of the 70% drop in crude oil, we brought CapEx 70% when you go 2014 through 2017, as you see pro forma. And we're going to right size to reflect the LOEs to the new environment, lease operating expenses as well G&A, as you mentioned.","And then also, on top of that, as per the Board of Directors instructions, were also fully manned to support the strategic review process as we get third parties to evaluate the assets, and go forward, to give the board a view of \u2013 a clear look at what evaluation is of the oil and gas business currently and, go forward, we make the right decision at FCX.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks a lot, Jim. Let's go to slide 19 and update our outlook for 2016. Copper sales at 5.1 billion pounds. And you can see gold, molybdenum and oil at 57.6 million barrels equivalent, 74% of which is oil. Unit cost, we talked about earlier, at $2 copper that would generate $3.4 billion of operating cash flows including the impact of idle rig cost. We got significant leverage to copper, of course, and we've reviewed capital expenditures.","In looking at our sales profile, going into 2016 and 2017, you can see the level of copper sales, which reflects Cerro Verde, Grasberg's positive results and continued operations at our existing mines, net of our curtailed production. And you can see in 2017, as we complete mining the Grasberg open pit the significant volumes of gold that will be produced.","And looking at the bottom of the slide, with oil and gas sales, even with the suspension of drilling activities, because of our past drilling successes and completing the tieback wells, we're not seeing a falloff in our oil and gas sales profile.","21 shows EBITDA cash flow numbers at various prices. At $2, this is the average of 2016-2017. $5 billion of EBITDA at $2, $3 billion of operating cash flow. And you can see our leverage to higher prices, and I again want to emphasize, we are also stress testing our business to respond to a scenario where prices may go lower.","Looking at our debt levels, this is the focus of what we have to deal with, and we have to deal with it in today's marketplace. We have total debt at the end of December of just over $20 billion. We have adequate liquidity, as we go forward. We have very limited amounts, $200 million of debt maturing in 2016. We have no funds drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. I'm sure you all have followed the rating actions taken on our company and have also followed the rating agency's public comment about their broadly based reviews of credits in the metals and mining and energy sector. We have worked with agencies over the year to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our balance sheet, and we'll continue to do so.","In light of the recent ratings actions and the sentiments by the rating agencies, we have prepared contingency plans to address our financial assurance obligations for our mining properties under a scenario where we're not investment-grade rated. We would develop plans that would allow us to address these in a fashion that would either not require or minimize using letters of credit under our bank credit facilities and we have a number of alternatives for doing that. So, we're working to come up with plans to reduce debt, to get our balance sheet stronger and improve our financial flexibility and protect our liquidity in the short run.","So, we are \u2013 start out telling you we're serious and we are serious and focused to take advantage of our large scale current production base of resources. We've established these long lived reserves that are going to be there for the future of our company, and we have significant underdeveloped resources that will be available for the future.","We're very proud and pleased to represent a global organization of such highly-qualified management, workers and people that we work with, they're first class in every respect. Our mining business, we've shown generates free cash flows at very low prices and we're taking prudent management steps and will continue to do so to respond to these market conditions. We are going to address our asset, our balance sheet debt levels through asset sales, other initiatives to raise capital, and we have the assets to do that. And throughout all of this, throughout all of this, we're going to have a positive outlook for our company based on the long-term global demand and supply fundamentals for the commodities that we produced and given our high-quality asset base.","I know you have a lot of questions and I look forward to responding to them.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Operator, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I just have a couple of quick questions. First of all, on a near-term basis, there's been some chatter lately about the \u2013 in the press, anyway, about the pending export license situation in Indonesia. There's some indication that Indonesia is requiring a deposit towards the smelter construction in order to renew the license for the next six months. And I was wondering if that is correct. And if so, where does that stand?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The press is accurate in reporting that the Director General in Mining has raised that as a potential condition for getting our export license that there'd be a substantial deposit. We have responded that our view that that's inconsistent with the understanding we had with the government that we had made a commitment to progress the smelter project and we fulfilled that commitment to progress it. We have sites developed for it. We're working with our current partner in the Gresik smelter that we developed in the mid-1990s, that Gresik, Mitsubishi who will work with us as we're going forward. We're working with the contractor to do it.","Our position is that we've met our obligations to the government. We developed an engineering procurement contract with Chiyoda, the Japanese engineering firm. And so, we are engaged in discussions with the government about that. And as I said, we have, as Freeport's management, full confidence that we're going to be able to get our export permit extended on mutually agreeable terms with the government.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Okay. I'll leave it at that for now. Just a clarification question on some of the numbers this quarter versus the last quarter. Specifically, the idled rig costs, were the $600 million of expected idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017, were those numbers previously included in the previous oil and gas CapEx or are those new expected cash outflows?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. The cost of the rigs under the plans that we had in place at the third quarter were included in capital expenditures. We are engaged in discussions with the owners of those rigs, the other party to our contracts, in terms of restructuring the terms of the contracts in view of our new plan to idle all three of those rig cost. And what we've included in our estimate of idled rig cost is our expectation as to how these negotiations will be completed. They're not yet completed, but this is our expectation. It involves two things. One, a transfer of the amounts we pay to the drilling contractor under what we believe will be revised terms out of CapEx into idled rig cost. And then, we are taking also out of CapEx the cost of operating those rigs because our plans previously included a continuation of drilling activity. So, we're seeing not new cost, but restructured lower cost as a result of our plan to idle all three of the deepwater rigs.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. So if CapEx in oil and gas went down, versus December, it went down by $300 million but there was $600 million taken out, am I reading it the wrong way that that implies there's a $300 million increase somewhere else in CapEx or is that not how I should be thinking about that?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This all reflects our \u2013 we've restructured our plans, idle the rig cost, completing the wells that we could complete near-term to keep our production off, and most of those costs are early in 2016. So, it reflects our new plan to complete the wells that were available for completion, to suspend, stop drilling for new activities and what you're seeing is the net impact of those revised plans.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. Hey, Richard, in the beginning of the call you mentioned about how you had cut back on your copper output last year in response to market conditions and I'm just wondering, on the oil and gas side, with California and the cost laid out, it seems from someone on the outside that it's EBITDA and cash flow negative. Can you talk about those operations specifically and maybe there are other factors that we're not really taking into consideration for why you're continuing to run it?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're continuing to run it because even with the level of operating cost by constraining capital it is cash flow positive for us and it preserves the asset. Jim, why don't you comment on our strategy and plans for California?","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, Brian. That's a correct assessment when you look on historical cost basis and we look on a cost-forward basis of what we're doing on the LOE cost and fuel going down and so forth that we see a 20%, 25% reduction on LOE cost. Granted, we're not making a lot of money at $30 a barrel but we are not losing money in California on an LOE as-produced basis as we go forward through the year. There'll be a quarter where they'll be a negative. There'll be a quarter it will be a positive. So, we'll continue to maintain production out there if oil stays around $30, just to maintain the price upside option as long as it don't cost FCX any money.","If oil goes to $20 obviously, you know, sustaining and so forth that would be a different ball game. We'll revisit your issue.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Brian, also I want to mention, we have shut in the offshore production in Point Arguello...","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...which we had the ability to do that. And that was high cost. It's not a huge part of our production but it was a high-cost segment of our production.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Okay. Apologies, I'm not, as you know, with the oil and gas business but in the presentation slide it says operating costs in California are $33 per barrel. What's the difference between that and LOE? Are there some non-cash items in there?","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. LOE and operating costs are basically the same thing. But operating costs also captures development activity like workovers and things of that nature which are production-sustaining operations which help build LOE. If you stop working over every well then you just get down to the base LOE, which is your \u2013 all your cost to run the oil fields without any capital investment. So, you drop those development activity and that's before any CapEx.","And then, I'm just strictly on the LOE basis, you continue to cost, you manage your chemicals, you manage your trucking, you manage your employee levels and compensation and so forth to where they make sure the oil field continues to produce at least break even. You don't want to lose money producing oil at this point in time.","And what Richard talked about in the Point Arguello, so forth, that's in the historical numbers. So, we see a reduction now in the low $20s of LOE by $22 to $22.50 a barrel on California going forward. And that's why $30 a barrel it will justify continuing to produce. Say, at $20 a barrel it would be another story so that \u2013 we hope they don't get to that point but you never know.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Essentially, what we have Brian is an operation out there at current levels of oil prices that's close to breakeven. But it is from terms of the value of that asset, it is highly, highly leveraged, of course, to oil prices and relatively small increases in the price of oil results in generating substantial values in that asset. So, it's a great asset for people who have an optimistic view about oil price recoveries, and we're reading more about that in today's marketplace. And so, it's an asset that today we can manage without losing money but preserving that value opportunity either for ourselves and for our buyer of the company.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then just a good question on the potential copper sales. Are there assets that you would consider kind of core and important to FCX's DNA or is it a situation more or like, perhaps, for the right price and you would consider any operation?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We would consider any operation and are considering any operation, every one of our assets are. Our objective is to respond to this market condition, respond to our balance sheet situation and find the place of where we can generate the most value to achieve that objective while preserving a business that's going to be valuable for our shareholders as we go forward.","So, we are considering \u2013 we've talked about Grasberg, where we have this agreement to sell an additional 20% interest in a very valuable asset there, and we're looking at our assets across the board. We're finding that, as I feel, there are people in the marketplace who are taking a longer term view of the copper markets in a positive way. And we're engaged in active discussions with people on a number of alternative overlapping possibilities.","I know everyone would like to be more specific now. I would like to be more specific now. The situation has developed in a negative way very quickly and aggressively, and we're responding to it. And we will report to you at a time when we can be more specific. But today, we can't.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, everyone.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Tony.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","I've got a couple questions here. Richard, my first question is, obviously, you mentioned a big uphill climb and obviously very serious challenges that the company is facing. Is the intention to return FCX to a pure play in copper and gold, ultimately, if you can get out from underneath, all of what you're dealing with right now?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as I said, our strategic focus is around our mining business, so that's going to be the focus. We are looking to see what market opportunities we have available to us with our oil and gas asset to generate value, and we're going to assess how to do that either near term or over time. I mean, we are not going to make irrational decisions based on just current market conditions. But we have a number of interested parties who are anxious to talk with us about how we might go forward with it. But our strategic focus for the company is clear. That was established back in our October timeframe. We talked about restructuring our board. The strategic focus of our company is on our copper and related minerals businesses.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And some follow-up questions here. So, from your comments, I mean, it sounds like you're not averse to selling certain mining assets in their entirety. Is that a fair assessment?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We are going to find the best opportunity to achieve our goals. And if that involves that sale of assets in their entirety, we will do that. Now, it's just where the company is. It's not something \u2013 we don't like selling equity at these prices. We don't like selling assets that we know are going to be valuable in the long run. But we have a big portfolio of assets, a big portfolio of reserves, and that's what's going to give us the chance to deal with this current problem and come out of this as a profitable company that's going to be of long-term values for our shareholders. So, we're going to be measuring how to deal with the balance sheet issues and how to create long-term value from a sized-down business to deal with the near-term problems.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just a question on this is...","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have the assets to do it.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Just a follow up on the offshore rigs, and I think you guys have had contracts with Rowan and Noble, and those contracts have been costing about, maybe $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion a year, I believe that's been the case. And I think that was going into what I think the middle of 2017, if I recall correctly. But you are now including \u2013 you are telling us that you are assuming now that you'll have a successful outcome with those two companies regarding those contracts. Is that correct?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We still have the contracts, and we're going to live up to our contractual obligations, okay. Now, what we're doing is, when you operate these deepwater rigs, you have to pay the drilling contractor and those have been in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 a day, and then you incur, in past times, a similar amount in operating them.","So, our plan now, eliminate the cost of operating them as the rigs will be idled, and we're negotiating with the drilling rig companies to reduce our near-term financial obligations in some mutually-accepted way that recognizes the value the contractors have in the contract and they're working with us to be responsive to our desires to reduce near-term cash requirements.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","But Tony, the numbers \u2013 this is Kathleen. The numbers that you were using included the spread and that's what's being removed. So, even though we're having to pay and satisfy these contractual obligations, we are reducing our overall cost by idling the rigs and not incurring additional cost to other contractors. And so, that's the objective here is to conserve cash. And as we've talked about, we benefit from having an inventory of wells already drilled. And so, we don't have to continue drilling and incurring the additional costs. And so, what we solve for is how do we get the best cash flow answer in this environment.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. I'm sorry...","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Tony, these are tough...","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, Richard. Sorry.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","These are tough decisions.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Absolutely.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean these are the best drilling rigs in the world. We've got attractive prospects to drill and because of market conditions and our company's financial position, we're having to take these really tough decision to idle these, just like we're having to make really tough decisions about selling interest in our mining properties. I mean, we are where we are. We can't wish the market away. We can't wish this debt away. We've got to deal with it, and that's the hard decisions that we're making.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. Just \u2013 I want to go back to Indonesia. Obviously, it's very critical to your success overall in getting those costs down to the $1.10 level. And I'm wondering \u2013 it's hard for us on this side of the world and all the statements that come out of the press and what may be factual, what may not be factual, but it makes it very, very difficult and the uncertainty as you expressed. And I'm wondering, with all of these stuff that's going on, I mean is there any risk to these numbers which are back-end loaded in 2016 because it is a critical part of the success for the mining company going forward? How would you \u2013 and you're spending, what, about $800 million, $900 million a year there right now?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On that order, yeah. I mean, it's really important to us. Indonesia has been a interesting, complicated country to work in over the 40 years that we've been there. And we've been through lots of changes, about as many changes as you can imagine with a country. And we have successfully managed our way through those changes over 40 years. It's important to us, but please remember, this is important to Indonesia. I mean, where we operate in Papua, which is a challenging political, socio-economic region of Indonesia that's important to the country strategically, in our area where we employ over 30,000 workers, we represent, in the province we work in, over 90% of their economy.","The taxes, the employment, the exports that we generate for the country of Indonesia is important to the country as a whole. Like all countries around the world and all developing countries in Asia, Indonesia is being challenged by the downturn in China and the global economy, and so we're important to them as they are important to us. And Indonesia, today, is a true democracy where there's a freedom of the press and political figures are free to comment on it. That's a good thing. And some of the comments reflect, as we see around the world and to a significant degree here in the United States, a feeling of nationalism. Witness (01:00:41) comments that are made about free trade here in the United States.","And so what you're reading is the functioning of a democratic system where people have views about nationalism. Underlying that is a company that's been a long-term investor in Indonesia that has plans to make significant investments in developing the underground resources that we have there that provides employment and economic benefits to a province that is in very much of need of development as Papua and as a country that's in need of this.","And so we have a mutual need for each other. It's a mutual need and that's what's going to lead us to finding a resolution of these issues that's mutually acceptable to both sides. And we're doing this in a positive way.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Richard, assuming you're able to go on that path and get that resolution you need, which obviously is required, can you give us comfort that looking out beyond 2017 -- I know you've not really talked about that a whole lot, but you've presented it in your slide deck where the production does come off as you are involved in the transition to underground. Can you give us further comfort about that transition and might it be a less steep drop-off post 2017 at this point in time?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Tony, you've been working with us for so many years. You will recall that, you go back a number of years and that drop-off was much more steep then than it is now, we've had great success in expanding our ore bodies there. In the third quarter, we began producing from the deep MLZ mine, which is an extension of our underground block-caving operations that started in the early 1980s. This is the most recent significant extension to it. It's very high grades of copper and gold, a very long life. That mine has come up to speed very efficiently. We are progressing with our underground development for the Grasberg underground ore to the block cave mine plants that we have. We're stockpiling ore to produce beyond 2017.","This is where we are currently with our plans is what you see, as you say, in the slide deck. And Mark Johnson and his team, with our team at jobsite, is working every day to see how we can minimize the impact of that transition. But it is a reality. It is a reality that there will be a transition because we can't begin mining the Grasberg underground ore body until we complete mining the pit, because the pit subsides and the ground falls in on the cave, so you physically can't do it. And yet, we're taking every step we can to mitigate that increase. That was one of our reasons for developing Cerro Verde. That was one of our reasons for developing Tenke and Morenci, was to drive volumes for us during that time period when we were making the transition to Grasberg.","So what you see today is our best estimate of where we are. We're going to work to do our dead level best to improve that. We've had success in the past of doing that. We've got a great team working on it. And that's what we're working on.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But we're very confident technically about our ability to do it. This organization has operated the most complex mine in the world, and I feel comfortable in saying that and I think the rest of the mining industry would agree with it, at 13,000 feet in the middle of Papua where it rains, absent El Ni\u00f1o, 200 inches to 400 inches a year, where we mine the pit, we mine the underground, we can do this. So technically, we're very comfortable and we're confident about working in Indonesia where we've been for over 40 years. It's complicated. I'm not going to underestimate the complications. But you got a team here that can handle it.","Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Richard. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Good luck with everything, too.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Ryan Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. You talked in your prepared remarks and in the press release, I guess, about the physical copper market being close to imbalance. And you guys have certainly taken some proactive steps and you especially did so, I guess, in the financial crisis when you took down production by a decent amount. On one hand, all of your even higher cost operations are still nicely free cash flow positive. On the other hand, you've got the potential ability, I guess, to influence the market. So how do you sort of balance the two, let's say, if copper prices stay around the $2 range where they're currently at?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Jeremy, you're very accurate in pointing out that we generate cash from our business there, and we need this cash. I mean, we need to reduce our debt levels. So we've adjusted it so far to take out the production that's not cash flow positive or marginally cash flow positive at the $2 level. And so with unit cost consolidated average $1.10 that reflects Grasberg, as Tony pointed out, but you look at our other properties in the Americas, that average is about $1.50 a pound, that generates substantial cash, which is something we need. But if this market deteriorates, if the worst predictions for China are true in terms of its economy shrinking and its demand for copper shrinks, then we have the assets that we'll further adjust to that. But at a $2 price level, we're where we need to be.","Jeremy Ryan Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And just real quickly, you talked about evaluating alternatives for the Oil & Gas business. Again, obviously, maybe even a more difficult environment on Oil & Gas. What are several alternatives that you're looking at in the current environment? Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. What we're looking at is reviewing and canvassing the market. We're making data available, we're making our management team available to discuss our assets to parties that might be interested in buying the business or might be interested in buying assets as part of the business.","As you point out, it's a difficult marketplace. And yet, and I was listening to comments coming out of Davos and out of the financial community, this low oil price is ultimately going to have an impact on the level of oil that's being produced globally. It's putting pressure on producers here in the United States, but also producers in countries around the world. So ultimately, low prices will have an impact on supplies. And there are people out there who are making comments about how attractive it is to invest in natural resources at this point in the marketplace.","So we're going to find out what the interests are, and it's a wide range of activities. We're not going to do anything dumb with these assets because we know what their values are and what their leverage to prices are. We're going to manage our balance sheet and, again, approach it in a way that creates long-term value for our shareholders.","Jeremy Ryan Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Hi. Thanks a lot. Just regarding Tony's question about, and what you were saying, Richard, about the $500,000 a day to $600,000 a day of lease cost, to what degree could you just put that back to Noble and the other contractors? Or do you have to spend that $500,000 a day to $600,000 a day even if the rigs are idle and not pumping?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, let me take that in two steps. First of all, what we have signed are standard contracts for the offshore drilling industry. These are contracts that we had entered into that are similar to contracts that all other operators have entered into. And if you read, you can find that there are a number of other operators who are also idling rigs and doing this. So we can't get out of the contracts. I mean, they are what they are. They're standard. They have obligations that we have entered into. These contractors, as a company, we honor our contracts. So we start with that. We can't just get out of \u2013 we can't just...","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...not pay them because we want to.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Now, what we're doing is minimizing the cost, given our contractual obligations. We're doing that, one, by idling the rigs, which involves the spread cost that we incur when the rigs are operating. And two, we're entering into negotiations with the contractor companies to mitigate the near-term cash obligations that we have in ways that we can mutually agree to that's in the benefit of both companies. And we have positive relationships and we want to maintain positive relationships with these contractors. They're very good companies. They're people that are \u2013 whoever operates this business in the long run is going to want to have good relationships with them. They want to have good relationships with us. They have very high quality rigs. And so it gives us a basis for talking with them, which they're doing, to try to achieve our objectives in ways that's consistent with their rights under the contract.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Okay. Okay. So, I guess, that kind of answers my second question, which was \u2013 I mean, in terms of the ability, at one point, if the price of oil does decline more, do you \u2013 can you make the decision to just put the business on care and maintenance, so to speak, the oil and gas business on care and maintenance? What kind of \u2013 like, what's the analysis there in terms of when you can still perhaps maintain the optionality of the business but not burn as much cash?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's what we're doing.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In some respect, that's what we're doing right now. I mean, we're taking these drilling rigs and idling them to save cost. We're preserving this inventory of prospects for future drilling when market conditions warrant. We're maximizing cash that we get out of production by bringing on-stream some successful wells that we've drilled to keep our production levels up. We're cutting lease operating expenses that Jim talked about. We're reducing G&A. So we're doing what you call care and maintenance. And as you see, by 2017, we get our CapEx down to $600 million where it was $3 billion plus. So what you're saying this is what we're doing.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","All right. Okay. And then I was going to say even in extreme scenario where if you can't sell the business, you don't have the ability to place any FCX debt on the oil and gas business and then, say, even declare \u2013 file for bankruptcy for the oil and gas business and then you could get rid of some liabilities potentially and also get rid of these idle rig costs and just have again the mining business, which we had in the past. Because my understanding, again, is that all the liabilities are \u2013 they are obligations of FCX corporate, right? You can't place liabilities \u2013 there are no liabilities that are just on the oil and gas business.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Just think about this, Chris.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Yes.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's absolutely no way you can transfer debt to an entity and then declare a bankruptcy for it.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Right. Right. Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You just can't do that. And we have a business, since oil and gas business has a lot of value.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so \u2013 and that value is now owned by FCX as the owner of those assets. And we need to manage FCX's debt level and preserve the values that have been created. Now, the values are less now than they were two-and-a-half years ago because oil price have gone from over $100 to $30, just like our copper assets. The value that we put on ETFI, which is $16 billion reflecting today's market is a lot less than it was when copper prices were $3 or more.","So we've got to recognize realities, but in the midst of all \u2013 and I said this earlier \u2013 in the midst of all of this noise about negative investor sentiment, about commodities in China and global growth, and in the midst of all the concerns about Freeport because of our debt level in Indonesia, we've got a great set of assets underlying this. And that's going to be our salvation and our opportunity to create a recovery and value for the future. That's why I'm still working here. I'm still invested in FCX stock and all of our team is as well. So that's what we're going to do.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.","Right. Right. No, I would definitely agree that the mining business has a lot of, lot of value. We like the mining assets a lot. Thanks a lot.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Murphy with UBS. Please go ahead.","Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. I have another question on asset sales, an issue people have been consistently asking me about. I agree, on the asset front, there's a lot of value there. But the question is regarding the ability to sell assets as it relates to your bond indentures and any restrictions that might exist on asset sales. Can you provide any thoughts on whether or not that's something you are needing to consider as you evaluate alternatives?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The bonds were issued as investment-grade rated company and they don't have restrictions. We recently restructured our bank credit facility so that we've agreed that half of any asset sales we have will be used to reduce debt. Practicality of it is we're going to use proceeds from asset sales to reduce debt. I mean, that's just what \u2013 that's why we're doing it. So there's not any real restriction now. We'll have to deal with our financial situation going forward. But the whole purpose of asset sales is to reduce debt. We're not going to be restoring investment activities until we solve the balance sheet problem and until market conditions improve.","Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And you also mentioned just making tough decisions and including, you said, issuing equity. I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts on whether the board would consider another at-the-market equity program.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're looking at all alternatives. We've completed these last two rounds. It goes without saying, none of us want to issue equity at these levels, none of us want to sell assets in this market, but we have to do what we have to do. And we're looking with our banks at what access to capital market transactions, private market transactions we might have. A lot of this is driven by our progress on our asset sales. And I'm encouraged by the opportunities that are emerging for us. So there's got to be a holistic answer to it, and we have to keep all options open. But at the present time, we're focused on what kind of opportunities we have in the asset sale joint venture arena.","Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","I've got a couple of questions as well. I was wondering if you could quantify what your debt reduction target might be. Or perhaps you can give a range like you're looking to sort of reduce net debt in the sort of $3 billion to $5 billion range or we're just trying to get a sense of how many assets could be sold if the pricing makes sense in this environment.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","$5 billion to $10 billion is our target.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","$5 billion to $10 billion. Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's not something we won't be able to do in one transaction.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Sure.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And it's not going to be something we do. I'm not giving you a specific timeframe on it. We're going to make significant progress, I believe, in the first half of the year, but we need to get our debt down over time into that range.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, $5 billion to $10 billion through multiple transactions would be your target?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And in terms of your exposure, your financial exposure, if your credit is downgraded from investment grade, I know you're looking at alternatives to posting letters of credit. But could you give us a sense of what your maximum cash exposure would be that would potentially eat into your $4 billion credit line availability?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We believe we have opportunities to deal with this in a way that would not eat into our line of credit. And we're working on those structures now and I don't want to go because of the state of analysis and considerations, but we've come up with some creative ideas about how to fulfill our obligations, which we will do. We're going to fulfill our obligations to states and the federal government, but we believe we can do it in a way that will preserve our credit facility, the availability on our credit facility.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Well, could you give us a sense that if for some reason those alternatives did not come to fruition what the financial exposure would be from a liquidity perspective?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. It's not so much a specific amount that gets triggered all at one point in time. Kathleen, you want to comment on this?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. I was going to say, Orest, it's in the $500 million range currently, and it's something that the states review on an ongoing basis along with the company to look at what those ultimate closure obligations are. So it's not a static number, but that's the approximate level currently.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's wonderful, thank you. And then just finally, just changing gears in terms of the assets. Can you give us a sense of if water issues are still impacting Grasberg? I know you had sort of alluded to that coming into the fourth quarter. And sort of how you see that playing out through 2016? And I was also wondering about Cerro Verde, whether you have all the water you need there to ramp up the expansion this year. Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. We'll have Mark Johnson speak about Grasberg. Mark is our executive who's the President of our operations there. So, Mark?","Mark J. Johnson - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Indonesia","Yeah. The El Ni\u00f1o effect that we talked or hear about so much, it affected us definitely in 2015. That started to relax for us as far as daily rainfall in December. And so far in 2016, we haven't had any constraints with the water. We've had normal rainfall return back, like I said, in mid-December and this continued through January. We don't expect that we're going to see, and none of our numbers include, any sort of constraints because of the lack of water.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Red Conger is here who manages our business in the Americas and in Africa, and Red's recently been to Peru, and can talk to you about our water situation there.","Harry \u201cRed\u201d Conger - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining","Yeah, Orest, in the El Ni\u00f1o pattern, that part of the country is drier than it normally is. This is typically the rainy season there now and it hasn't really started raining yet. We've had a storm or two up in the mountains. The water levels right now in the reservoirs are roughly the same as they were last year, so we don't see a shortage yet. But it needs to rain and it hasn't rained yet. We've not been impacted to this point. So we're cautiously optimistic that we'll still get some rain this year. But to this point, we have not.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the water access that we've had for Cerro Verde is coming from this wastewater collection and treatment system that we built for the city of Arequipa. So it's providing a source of water for our expanded operations. The El Ni\u00f1o effect is giving concerns to farmers in the area, and that's caused some, let me say, discussions with us and with the city about our water access. And while we have to deal with that, the long-term solution for water at Cerro Verde has been a very innovative and successful one of working cooperatively with the community in Arequipa.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, at this point, it doesn't sound like you're concerned you're going to be water constrained in either operation this year?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you for all your actions and tough work in the tough time. Concerning the $5 billion to $10 billion asset sale target, does that include the proceeds from selling a 10% or 20% slug of Grasberg?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","And other than Grasberg, are there other mining assets for sale with the asset sales focused more on the Oil & Gas assets that are not as positive cash flow generative?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it does include consideration of potential sales of oil and gas assets whether they're cash flow or not. It considers that. John, the point I was trying to make and I hope I got across is we have a number of alternatives. In fact, we're looking at all of our assets across the company's board to see how can we generate cash to reduce debt and how we can preserve values for long-term shareholders. So every one of our assets are being considered. And we are going to understand the market's interest, we're going to understand where we can find transactions and including potential for capital markets transactions that might involve placements of various types of securities. But we're looking across the board how can we achieve these two goals in the best fashion, how can we deal with our balance sheet, how we can come out of that with a company that can be there with significant cash flows, development opportunities for the long-run business.","I know you would like and I would like to know exactly how we're going to do that, but the market is such that I can't tell you right now. But I can tell you, our commitment to it in our across-the-board consideration of alternatives.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everybody. So...","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","...I wanted to quickly follow up on Indonesia. And in the press release, you've stated, I believe, that the timing of the capital expenditures continue to be reviewed. And I wondered if you could maybe give us an update on what is encompassed in this review and the potential reductions or options that we could be looking at.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We've been working very closely with Mark and his team to defer all the capital we can defer, and we've come up with some adjustments to mine plans and restructuring approaches to the long-term development of the resources, and that's reflected in our current plans. We are continuing with our investments to develop the underground ore bodies, the access to them and to prepare the Grasberg block cave for bringing it on stream beginning in roughly 2018 \u2013 beginning of 2018.","So the review process is that's predicated on our ability to continue to export concentrate. So the current discussions we have about getting an extension for that export is important to those decisions to continue to invest. As I said, we are presently very confident that we are going to get this export permit arranged for us. But if there was any aspects of our work with the Government of Indonesia that would change that, then unfortunately we'd be forced to curtail development activities, curtail employment, take actions to preserve our company. We don't expect that to happen, but those are the sorts of things that were referenced in terms of the comment you saw about reviewing.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then along the same lines, maybe a quick follow-up on the smelter development. Richard, in the past, you've added some details regarding potential partners for the smelter. Could you give us an update on that? What do you expect, at this point in time, to be Freeport's contribution to the smelter?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as this thing is progressing, we're looking at what the capital costs would be, what are the potential sources of outside financing for that, and we're engaged in discussions with banks on that. To get financing, we have to have the contract extension done and we advised the government of that. And then potential partners would include our joint venture partner in Grasberg, it would include the operator of the project as potential. So that is still a work in progress.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Well, good luck and thanks for that color.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.

(Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press is available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. As usual, we have several slides to supplement our comments this morning and we\u2019ll be referring to the slides during the call. They are also accessible using the webcast link on fcx.com.","In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call. And a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is also with us today and Dave Thornton is here as well.","I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook and covering the information in our slide material. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for question.","Today, FCX reported first quarter 2013 net income attributable to common stock of $648 million or $0.68 per share, which compared with $764 million or $0.80 per share for first quarter of 2012.","Our first quarter 2013 net income attributable to common stock included charges totaling $50 million or $0.05 a share associated with debt extinguishment costs for the termination of the acquisition bridge loan facilities following our successful permanent financing and for costs associated with pending transaction \u2013 the oil and gas transaction and the recently completed transaction of \u2013 the acquisitions of cobalt chemical refinery. Our first quarter 2013 interest expense also included $17 million of additional interest related to the new debt that we issued in March, which we\u2019ll discuss in more detail.","First quarter 2013 consolidated copper sales of 954 million pounds were higher than our previous estimate of 940 million pounds, primarily reflecting higher production and sales from Africa, where we have just completed a second phase expansion. Sales were also higher than first quarter sales of 827 million pounds because of higher production from Indonesia and also the higher production from Africa.","Our first quarter 2013 gold sales of 214,000 ounces were slightly lower than the January 2013 estimate of 230,000 ounces that primarily reflected the timing of shipments at quarter end. As expected, gold sales were lower than first quarter 2012 of 288,000 ounces primarily because of anticipated lower grades in Indonesia.","Our first quarter 2013 consolidated molybdenum sales of 25 million pounds were higher than our January 2013 estimate of 23 million pounds in the year ago quarter of 21 million pounds, primarily reflecting some stronger sales volumes in the metallurgical and chemical sectors.","Our realized copper price during the quarter averaged $3.51 per pound compared with a realized price in the year ago quarter of $3.82 per pound. Our gold realization in the first quarter of 2013 was $1,606 per ounce compared to $1,694 per ounce in last year\u2019s first quarter. And molybdenum prices, our realized prices averaged $12.75 per pound in first quarter 2013 compared to $15.34 in the year ago period.","As anticipated, consolidated average unit net cash cost net of by-product credit averaged $1.57 per pound were higher than unit net cash cost of $1.26 per pound in first quarter 2012, primarily reflecting lower by-product credits. We generated operating cash flows during the first quarter of $831 million. That was net of $430 million in working capital uses and capital expenditures during first quarter totaled $805 million.","We ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in debt, total debt. That included $6.5 billion of notes that we issued in March 2013 in connection with the pending acquisition and we ended the quarter with $9.6 billion in consolidated cash.","As previously reported, in December of last year, we announced definitive agreements to acquire Plains Exploration and McMoRan Exploration in separate transactions. The completion of each transaction is subject to receipt of MMR and PXP stockholder approval of their respective transaction. We were advised this morning that the SEC declared the PXP filings to be effective, which will enable the immediate filing and mailing of the proxy to Plains\u2019 stockholders. We are completing the process of responding to comments from the SEC staff on the MMR filings and expect the McMoRan filings to be declared effective shortly. We expect both transactions to close in the second quarter.","In connection with these transactions, we completed $10.5 billion in financings during the first quarter. We sold $6.5 billion of senior notes in four tranches in March and also entered into an agreement for a $4 billion bank term loan which will be funded at closing of the transaction.","The weighted average interest rate of these financings approximates 3.1% and we\u2019ll use the proceeds from the financings to fund the cash portion of the acquisition and also for the repayment of certain indebtedness of Plains and McMoRan.","We ended the quarter; we had no borrowing under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We also entered into an agreement with our banks to increase our credit facility to $3 billion upon the completion of the pending acquisition of Plains. FCX currently has $950 million common shares outstanding.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be discussing our outlook and referring to the slide material.","Richard C. Adkerson","Good morning. Like all of you, we\u2019ve been focused on the markets over the past two weeks. Last week, Red, Kathleen and I met our team down in South America, Santiago at the Annual CESCO meeting. Like the LME in the fall, this is a good opportunity to get together with industry, companies, traders, investors, financial people and take a read on the industry. We have been sensitive to and watching the buildup in inventories, the mood down in CESCO was concerned about global growth and increasing supply. And we have significant drop in copper prices $0.20 over the past 10 days or so. I think it\u2019s important to look back at history and remember that these short-term movements can get accelerated by things like consumer buying patterns, material moving into and out of warehouses for inventories and flows of investor funds. When times are good, they accelerate things on the upside and they can accelerate things on the downside.","As we look at the environment today, we walked away from the meetings in Chile with a lot of confidence in the long-term copper markets based on the fundamentals of the world\u2019s requirements for copper longer term and continuing challenges of maintaining supplies from existing mines and also of developing new sources of supply. So it\u2019s \u2013 we continue to run our business with a lot of confidence about a positive longer term copper markets. But it\u2019s in times like these when we made these phasing weak markets that the real strength of our company I think comes to the forefront.","With our long life reserves, our geographical diversity, our ability to produce large volumes profitably at low-cost and generate cash flows, we\u2019re financially strong and we\u2019ll talk more about this. This is the way we run our business from everything from environmental responsibility to safety issues. We\u2019ve got a great team and a great set of assets that allow us to operate profitably during weak market conditions and then be there with those assets to make a lot of money as markets improve and we have confidence that they will.","The first quarter is again, a reflection of our team running the business in the way that we planned it. We had strong operating performance. We saw productivity improvements at Grasberg over the last year\u2019s first quarter and throughout 2012. By the end of this year, we\u2019ll be entering into higher grades as our mining gets to the lower ranges of the Grasberg open pit and that will give us a run through 2016. That will be very positive with continuous limited waste movement in access the higher grades.","We made good progress with our development projects. We\u2019ve really completed the project at Tenke now. We\u2019re advancing the Morenci mill expansion and we commenced construction at Cerro Verde. During the quarter, we\u2019ve advanced our move towards our oil and gas acquisition that Kathleen mentioned. We completed debt financing and very favorable returns for the acquisition in a structure that allows us to delever and it gives us a broader access to growth opportunities by investing here in the U.S. and adding assets to our portfolio that have complementary growth profiles as well as cash flows generating characteristics.","On slide 6, the details of what Kathleen reviewed to you and the only comment I\u2019ll make is that the margins, we were affected by some shipping issues in the first quarter. You read about the port issues in South America which delayed certain shipments there and of course, we recognized revenues and profits when shipments are made. We also had some equipment issues at Grasberg, which reduced our copper and gold sales out of Grasberg. Our production at Grasberg for gold was actually 235,000 ounces versus sales of 214,000 ounces, of course, that products going to get shipped as we go forward. Our page seven shows our operating cost structure and this is very consistent with what our guidance was going into it.","We will be affected as we go into the rest of the year by the gold credit at Grasberg and the increase of guidance there from $1.35 to $1.45 is strictly that impact, $0.10 a share by reducing the gold price assumption and the gold price will be whatever the gold price will be. Our cost structure is there. Now, of course, if we go into some environment if where global growth gets constrained as we\u2019ve seen in the past, a lot of our costs are correlated to copper prices and if copper prices go lower, we can expect cost to go lower as well.","When we look at the market, China, of course, remains the important demand driver and that was brought home last week when we saw the market react to the Chinese GMP number coming in slightly below expectation. The government of China continues to express confidence in meeting their targeted GMP growth for the year and as we are doing business there, we\u2019re certainly not seeing any diminishment in demand for our copper concentrates that we ship there and our other products. Chinese growth is likely to drop over time, because the growth levels in the past were extraordinarily high and unsustainable. But the economy has grown so much that when you look at the demand for physical copper based on a larger economy, even with slower growth rates in relation to what the industry can produce longer term, it still indicates a very positive outlook for copper longer term.","In the U.S., growth is slow of course, but we are seeing the copper industry benefit by a healthy automobile sector and improvement in construction and wire demand. There our customers are relatively positive about their outlook. Europe remains weak and as I said, we\u2019ve been watching these global inventories; the exchange stocks as well as the bonded warehouses in China and so forth grow.","The market will work. Overtime, the lower price will encourage consumption, the inventories will work off. And so we look at the underlying economic numbers in China and the world, think about the industry\u2019s challenges in producing supplies and feel confident about our long-term strategy.","We do have a business of where we need to as we executed in 2008-2009 and we\u2019re nowhere near that kind of challenges right now. But we do have the ability of managing our capital expenditures, lowering our production of high cost copper elements and being responsive to market conditions.","Our copper development projects are very attractive at even lower copper prices than we have now. The Morenci expansion is proceeding well and we have a very significant sulfide resource beyond this current expansion that we\u2019re learning more about and gives us optimism about future growth, not only at Morenci, but other mines in the U.S.","Cerro Verde, we\u2019ve been successful in working with the local community and the government in a cooperative way of proceeding with our expansion opportunities there. We\u2019ve gotten our major permits. We began groundwork there and it is underway. We have a very significant potential expansion at El Abra that will require some work because of the challenges that all operators in Chile are facing from water and power issues. But it is a great resource. The world is going to need that resource, I believe, at some point and we are progressing from the pre-feasibility stage there.","We are operating effectively in the Congo and have not had disruptions from any of the issues you read about in the paper recently. In some respects, the government seems to be making progress in the eastern provinces with its issues there. We basically completed our expansion and are going forward and we\u2019re proceeding effectively with our underground development at Grasberg, prepare ourselves for the post open-pit era.","These expansions give us highly profitable economic growth prospects that we have clear line of sight visibility to achieving over the next three years, growing our production by billion pounds a year and adding to our capacity in ways that are economic. I mentioned in Morenci mill expansion, we\u2019re on page 11 now. Today, we have spent roughly a third of the capital required there. We have increased our mining rate. We are expanding our mill, adding incremental production on our higher rate of return basis, and as I said, setting ourselves up for the opportunities for future growth there at that great mine.","At Cerro Verde, we\u2019re expanding the mill from 120,000 tons a day to 360,000 tons a day and that would be the largest concentrating mill operation in the world, increasing the mining rate, doing this on a footprint that\u2019s established in an area where we established in operating and we worked well with the government of achieving a mutually supportive way of having water for this, because of the investments we\u2019re making in Arequipa\u2019s waste water system, which gives us water for our project.","So, so far, we\u2019re making great strides with that and look forward to proceeding with it. And I mentioned Tenke, where we\u2019re adding tank house capacity and increasing production. Those of you who follow this know the challenges we faced within our initial development project there, this started in the spring of 2008, while this one has gone on-time and on-budget.","In first quarter, we set operating records for mining and milling rates in copper volumes. our team there is working very effectively and as I said we\u2019ve had peaceful operations in the last couple of days. There has been some pronouncements out of the government about restricting exports of ores, reproduce the finished product of copper, reproduced the product for cobalt there that involves in-country processing. So these restrictions do not apply to us if they are implemented. Because of the level of cobalt production that we\u2019re achieving at Tenke and the prospects of future growth, we kind of follow the model that our Climax molybdenum team has established in the past and executes now under Dave\u2019s leadership of moving to give us downstream presence and we completed this acquisition of this processing facility in Finland. Our partners at Tenke, Lundin, and G\u00e9camines, the state-owned company of the DRC are partners in this operation and we believe that this provides us the ability to maximize the value of our cobalt resource over time by being involved in the market in a more dynamic and substantive way.","The Grasberg underground development has gone very well even during the productivity issues we faced for mining and milling operations resulted from the strike. Our team was able to stay on schedule for the development of the Grasberg Block Cave and the nearby DMLZ mine, which is underneath and adjacent to the DOZ mine.","Development capital is being spent, progress is being made. The DMLZ mine is scheduled to start up in 2015 with full production of 80,000 tons a day in 2021. The Grasberg Block Cave will start up in 2017 with 160,000 tons a day. That\u2019s 240,000 tons a day of production from the underground using Block Cave mining, which we have been experienced with since early 1980s. It\u2019s not new for us. It\u2019s not something that we have technology advancements to make.","We know what we\u2019re doing and feel confident we\u2019ll do it. It would be a very large underground operation. High volumes, low-cost and it would allow us to continue to having Grasberg as a cornerstone asset of our company for years to come.","Our 2013 outlook remains as we have previously reported. I mentioned that this unit net cash cost that we\u2019re showing is really only reflects the fact that we are now using the lower gold price as our estimate for the rest of the year, that will vary and the effects will be that our team constantly reviews ways of reducing cost.","In this business there is always inherent cost increases that you have to deal with and so when you see us be able to maintain these cost levels, you\u2019re showing the effects of a lot of work of our team in finding ways to offset the increasing cost for managing businesses like ours. And I\u2019m really proud of Red and his team and Mark and our whole organization in what they are doing with that.","At the end of the year, we showed $7 billion of operating cash flows at $3.65 billion copper and $3.25 billion copper that is $5.5 billion. No real changes in the underlying numbers there, just the commodity prices. And we continue to be highly leveraged copper prices each $0.10 change is $270 million.","Capital expenditures are essentially the same. We reduced it, our outlook by $200 million for the next year and move that out two years. As we reported at our last call, we are looking to have growing production profile over the next years as these development projects come on stream. You can see that with the increase from \u201812, \u201813, \u201814 and in to \u201815 and \u201816, and that would generate substantial cash flows for us.","Grasberg, you can see the effect that I mentioned earlier as we get into higher grades towards the latter part of 2013. and then we would be at higher gold production 1.8 million ounces for \u201814 and \u201815 and on a very profitable basis.","The molybdenum sales will reflect our expanded capacity at Climax. We are the market leader in this industry with great resources, great cost structure, great downstream presence and the ability to manage our operations to be responsive to the market requirements for molybdenum.","The year 2013 is a year in which we will be having increasing production as we go through the years, I mentioned driven by the increased production at Tenke, but also the access to higher grades and higher volumes at Grasberg and that really kicks in at the fourth quarter as you can see where we would be going from 950 million ounces, 1 million pounds of copper to basically 1.25 billion pounds of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold.","Our annual cash costs, which I\u2019ve already referenced are consistent with our earlier guidance, and the change reflects the lower gold price, you can see at the bottom of the page, the sales, the sales by region. Page 20 shows the impact over time of our growth opportunities. and you can see that we have strong cash flows at $3 copper, our operating cash flows are roughly $5 billion when we get our additional volumes in 2015, 2016 that would increase by 50% and if copper were to go back to $4 a pound that would go from $8 to $17. So you can see that really significant effects of our growth projects coming into play. the sensitivities, so that you can take your own view with respect to these commodity prices and input levels are presented for your use on page 21.","Exploration continues to be a hallmark of our company. You can see our exploration is globally oriented, roughly 50% in the Americas, 25% in Africa and 20% in Indonesia. We do have a global greenfield project that most of our exploration spending is understanding the resources associated with our existing ore bodies.","The ability to expand on a brownfield basis with the significant opportunities that we have, these aren\u2019t just add-ons of a small size, but to do significant expansion projects in areas of where we are already operating really makes it much more efficient, much easier to execute in terms of permitting issues and community, accepting issues and that\u2019s again, the real strength of our company.","Capital expenditures, now we\u2019re looking at $4.4 billion in \u201813 and \u201814. And then as we completed our projects going into 2015, we\u2019re showing a drop to $3.2 billion. We\u2019re continuing to study the next round of expansion opportunities. That takes time and a lot of work and we\u2019ll be reporting the progress on those as we go forward.","Now with our oil and gas transactions, very positive that we were able to get access to roughly $10 billion of financing and average cost of 3%, I mean that just shows the markets that we\u2019re in. We elected to go ahead and put that in place during the first quarter, because markets were good and we get that issue settled. As Kathleen said, we expect to close these transactions in the second quarter and this gives us in addition to all the great opportunities that we have in our mining business and our exposure to the copper in China through that mining business and the incremental opportunity for investment and growth opportunities in the U.S.","The assets that would be acquired through the Plains and McMoRan transaction have strong current cash flows with strong margins, initially the cash flows will be driven by the oil production from the Plains properties and for the next three years, much of that production is protected from a price standpoint by the hedge program, attractive volume growth profile that it\u2019s almost remarkable how it fits in with our mining growth profile, with very significant exploration potential coming flow through the McMoRan ultra deep exploration program in the shallow waters and onshore Gulf Coast region to and its pioneering effort to drill to very large attractive structures that have not been drilled before, but have the potential of achieving the kind of production that the industry is achieving in the deep water, but doing it in a shallow water onshore environment gives great exposure long-term to the U.S. natural gas business.","and then from Plains exploration focused in large part the deep water Gulf of Mexico where they recently acquired some strategic and very attractive assets from BP during 2012. So what this will do is, add assets that are generating cash, which will allow the oil and gas business to fund its capital expenditure and give our company an expanded growth profile with the benefits of having our geographical profile enhanced by more business in United States and in the business that we understand at Freeport, our management team, our board has had long experience in oil and gas business and in a business where economics are complementary to those in the copper business.","Page 25 shows where the producing assets currently are. I mentioned the Gulf of Mexico deep water of Plains has very attractive. Oil production in California that has established production profile and good margins at today\u2019s oil prices and a very long productive life, they have a very attractive position in the oil shale play in South Texas called Eagle Ford. And then long range, along with potential for McMoRan\u2019s exploration program, which is at those depths that is drilling, it\u2019s targeting natural gas formations, Plains has a very attractive position in the Haynesville shale gas play in North Louisiana.","so we\u2019ve got near-term exposure to oil growth and oil revenues, longer-term exposure to exploration and potential for the U.S. natural gas business and that adds an exciting and attractive asset mix to our company. We factor in the oil business to our growth profile on page 26 and you can see that this opportunity to increase our cash flows and cash earnings by 50%, it continues to be reflected with addition of these oil and gas assets and the opportunities to grow beyond that are really significant.","If you look at the center column, operating cash flow number, which is net of cash taxes and cash interest, you see ranging from $3 to $4 of copper prices. Operating cash flows based on today\u2019s level of operations from $8 million to $11 million growing to $12 million to $16 million, roughly a 50% increase based on our current outlook for growth. And beyond 2016, there is very exciting longer-term growth profiles in the oil and gas assets as well as through our very large reserves and resources that are undeveloped in our copper business. So, very complementary combination of assets and company with experienced management team, and exciting future.","Now, we are taking on significant debt, as a result of this, the closing will have roughly $20 billion of debt and we'll have $4 billion of cash, and most of that cash is located at FCX offshore and will be spent upon capital projects during that period of time. Even though, we are adding to our debt, we maintained our investment grade credit rating from all three agencies and we are effectively able to finance this transaction as a investment grade issuer.","Now looking forward, if we look in the periods of 2013 to 2016, recognizing that because of our growth profile, a lot of these excess cash flows are going to be generated in the 2015 and 2016 periods. If copper prices remain at $3, then we\u2019ll use all of our excess cash flows funding today\u2019s capital expenditure, today\u2019s dividend levels, minority distribution levels, we could reduce the $20 billion of debt down to $7.7 billion. And if copper is above $3.50, basically pay it all off and that\u2019s what we used our funds for.","We would plan to \u2013 we would plan to not pay off all of our debt because we believe an appropriate amount of long-term debt on our balance sheet is a good way to lever returns on equity. And so our current thinking is to reduce debt to roughly one-times EBITDA or around the $12 billion level. But I think it\u2019s important as we think about issues relating to near-term weak commodity price levels to look at this slide and think about just what kind of strength we have to deal with that.","And that\u2019s not taking into account our opportunity to manage our business through differing capital, reducing cost and so forth. So we\u2019re very confident about our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position to reduce debt, to invest in projects, to continue our dividend, and in the long-run, to grow our business in ways that we can increase returns to shareholders through higher dividends, perhaps stock buybacks.","On page 29, we kind of take a look back over our shoulder and say what has FCX done over the years? Through our exploration, we found the Grasberg, we developed the Tenke Fungurume project, and DRC when many were very skeptical about our taking on those risks, we resourced the \u2013 we added resources through our exploration program that Jim Bob and Rich Leveille and out exploration team focused on. We\u2019ve had a real long history of being disciplined in the way that we manage our finances. We successfully integrated the Phelps Dodge transaction where Freeport acquired a company two and a half times its size with a different culture, but we\u2019ve all come together with a great team. Over time, we\u2019ve had solid financial performance. And you can see from our record of the way we run our business that we do things in the right way.","So we are very positive about our ability to build shareholder values. Those of you who follow us know that our officers and directors are investors in this company and we run this company with a view towards building shareholder value. So, we are very excited about where we are, where we\u2019re headed, and our ability to manage through the time of commodity price volatility and underlying all that is a long-term confidence in our future.","So with that, Jim Bob is here on the line and he and I, and Kathleen, Red, Dave are here to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Good morning, Sal.","Richard C. Adkerson","Sal?","Operator","One moment please. And Sal, your line is now open.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Kathleen L. Quirk","","Good morning.","Richard C. Adkerson","Good morning Sal.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","I wanted to ask you on the Indonesia, a couple of negotiations you are involved in, one is the negotiations with the government about the extension of COW and the other one is the impending labor contract coming up for renewal in September. I was wondering if, on the government side, if it\u2019s worth negotiating or coming up with conclusion before the election next year, you think it\u2019s better to wait for the new government just in case there is a big change over there?","Richard C. Adkerson","","Well, Sal, we\u2019ve been working hard to advance our discussions with the government to deal with its review of our Contract of Work and to get the process of \u2013 the extension of our contract formally approved by the government. As you know, our contract provides us rights to extend the contract on its existing terms beyond its original term ending in 2021 to 2041. We believe it would be best for all of us, the government of Indonesia, the province, the workforce, and everyone to get these issues resolved as quickly as possible, and we have been working towards that end with that goal.","The government officials have expressed a similar goal and we've had productive discussions, but the process has not been organized in a way that has led to a conclusion yet. We are continuing the discussions. I will tell you we've made progress in finding some mutual acceptable ground on a number of the issues and you\u2019re right, the election is for the President, it is scheduled for next year. At this point, Indonesia is an established country with a democratically elected government. And so there is expected to be a continuity in the way the company operates and deals with investors like ourselves. So we\u2019re going to continue to work to get this done as quickly as possible and recognizing the challenges of getting decisions made as we get closer to the election.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","And how about the labor side, have you started working\u2026","Richard C. Adkerson","","The labor side, okay, excuse me. The labor side is \u2013 the union is now getting organized under Indonesian law. There has to be new CLA agreement, labor agreement every two years. And our current contract expires this fall. The formal process of discussions begins May 1 and the initial process is one of exchanging information and having interaction with the union leadership. And so the union and ourselves are getting prepared for that. Union leaders, community leaders and others are all visioning a goal of awarding a strike this year and that\u2019s certainly our objective and we will begin that process formally on May 1.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Two questions; one, as you look ahead the under pending merger, do you think \u2013 are there any non-core assets in your current portfolio that you perhaps would be open to divest?","","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, we over time always review assets, see what make sense and what doesn\u2019t make sense. At this point, we have not made any decisions to sell the assets. We like the mix that\u2019s there. And so there is nothing that\u2019s been decided yet, the target in any particular sales, but we will be working with our management team and our Board to assess what would make the best structure going forward.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then second and last, on Cerro Verde, could you talk a bit more about your capital spending plans? In other words, what are the major spending years, 2014 or \u201915?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Well, Paretosh, this is Kathleen. The CapEx will be spent \u2013 now that we\u2019re in construction, it will be spent over the next \u201913, \u201914, \u201915 kind of evenly and will complete the project towards the end of \u201915 or early \u201916 to get to the rates. But in terms of what\u2019s left to spent, I think you can assume, it\u2019s split over those years equally.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi, thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone.","Richard C. Adkerson","Good morning, Oscar.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Richard, just wanted to, first, verify the numbers that you provided for the throughput in Grasberg. You said 2015 for the DMLZ (inaudible) Grasberg. What were those numbers again please?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah, in rough terms, it would be a ramp up of DOZ extension and the Deep MLZ, that would end up achieving 80,000 tons per day. Now that\u2019s really the current capacity of the DOZ mine. But we are moving to a resource that\u2019s deeper and adjacent to the DOZ mine and fortunately the initial production from there comes from a section that has very good grades. And so that will help us during the period that we\u2019re transitioning from the open-pit to the Grasberg Block Cave, which lies underneath the open-pit.","We currently expect to complete mining in the open-pit, but at the end of 2016 approximately and then over the next four years or so we would ramp that up to 160,000 tons per day and that actually comes from two headings in the Block Cave. In some ways, it will be like having three mines that are currently comparable to what we're doing in the DOZ.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And also basically, the plan hasn\u2019t changed. Thank you for that. And then getting back to the issues that the Government and DRC put forward requirements that they have, could you just walk us through what they're asking? My understanding is that they want higher value added in the products leaving the country. You guys are producing copper cathode. But you don\u2019t think that the hydroxide that you\u2019re producing in cobalt, that presumably is going to be exported to your new operations, will be affected by these changes. Can you just walk us through\u2026","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay Oscar, one issue that the DRC looks at and this was also an issue in Indonesia, which led to the 2009 mining well. For certain types of minerals and in the DRC applies to some copper, people are exporting ores. They are just mining the ores and sending it to other countries for smelters and sometimes to the small smelters in the DRC. A lot of the ores will go in to Zambia and in Indonesia, you saw nickel and tin ores going to Japan and the countries say we want to see processing facilities in our country.","Now in the DRC, we produce copper cathodes through our FXCW process and that\u2019s a finished product. We produce this intermediate product which is a processed product, cobalt hydroxide and with our move into the processing facilities in Finland, we now have as a partner in that the G\u00e9camines state \u2013 mining company, and so we are very comfortable that we\u2019re not the target of these types of restrictions because of what we're doing there.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, understood. Thanks a lot for the clarification.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks, Oscar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu of Citigroup.","Brian H. Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Great, thanks and good morning. Rich, I think last quarter you guys had mentioned that in Indonesia, you were still finding some issues with the panels. I\u2019m wondering it looks like from your guidance that it's unfolding as planned. I just wanted to confirm that as you guys get deeper in these panels, that there isn\u2019t anything particularly surprising coming up?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah, if you look across all of our metrics when we talk about productivity increase, you can see a higher mine rate in open pit. You can see a higher mine rate in the DOZ underground mine, higher mill rate, higher concentrate production, all those things are heading in the right direction. In the DOZ mine, we are getting to 60,000 to 70,000 tons a day, our capacity is roughly 80,000. So everyday, there\u2019s issues that our guys are dealing with, but there is nothing that\u2019s changing our outlook for continued progress and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in our numbers.","Brian H. Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Okay, great. My second question is, on the site production and delivery costs, guidance is still the same at $1.89. but there\u2019s some material movements across the regions, so for example, South America, site production and delivery costs are coming down quite a bit, while Africa is moving up. I was wondering if you can comment what\u2019s happening maybe in those two that seem to have more material changes in the cost outlook.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Brian, this is Kathleen. You\u2019re right. On a consolidated basis, $1.89 is similar to as what we had previously on a consolidated basis. but there was some movement between the various regions in Africa. Our unit costs are, we\u2019re estimating to be higher for the year. and that\u2019s primarily a function of sulphuric acid costs; purchased sulphuric acid costs are higher than what we had previously modeled. As you are aware, we\u2019re putting a sulphuric acid plant in 2015 that will enable us to reduce our acid cost. So we are modeling higher purchased asset cost than what we had previously.","In South America, the decrease is related to some energy contracts principally where we\u2019ve had modeled some higher energy costs in our plan and have achieved some better results. So that\u2019s a factor in South America. we had some slight increases in North America and Indonesia that offset. But net of all those things, the consolidated numbers, $1.89 is the same. And then really when you cut through with the big change was the gold byproduct credit at Grasberg where we were previously expecting something close to $1.95 of byproduct credits and now we\u2019re down to $1.66, which works out to $0.10 on a consolidated basis.","Brian H. Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson","I just want to say, two weeks ago as we do before, at the end of every quarter, Red had all of the senior operating guys here for a meeting in the Americas, and I really want to compliment Red and his team for this focus they have on really looking at cost. I mean it\u2019s one which is, it\u2019s a real challenge and you see that throughout the industry, particularly at mines age and our mines in the Americas for the large part of our older mines. and so that means issues keep coming up. And this mining is a tough, tough business as we can see by the problems that Bingham Canyon is facing right now. But we\u2019ve got a culture here. Markets are markets and at the end of the day, it drives a lot of our profitability. But we\u2019re a commodities company. And so the culture that we have of really looking for cost in these older mines where it\u2019s not like the Grasberg and if you can just break through these high grades is really something that\u2019s built into everything we do. and Red and his guys did just a great job with it.","Brian H. Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Maybe, Richard, a quick follow-up on that, on the cost side, it seems like we are finding that on mining, maybe less CapEx does seem to decline. At the same time, you\u2019ve just got secular increases in the industry, because of grades and depleting mines. but more on, and maybe the EPCM equipment, are you seeing any kind of cost release coming through as more and more of mining companies start to maybe rationalize projects?","Richard C. Adkerson","You\u2019re seeing availability improved from contractors, from suppliers, from personnel in the industry and that\u2019s going to be a continuing factor as we see all these cutbacks that companies are making in their capital spending and their operations. So the answer is yes, one of the really serious talks we had with our team is to make sure we take advantage of it. And to look for opportunities to pick up people in areas that we\u2019re short in, to use contractors more efficiently and take advantage of supplier costs whenever we can. We had great relationships in the industry. And so we\u2019ll be able to do, achieve those things. Those are all things at the margin, things at the margin on what ends up making a difference. Heard a lot of talk in Chile, I mean, I\u2019m sure you read the things about the competitiveness of mining in Chile right now (inaudible) similar situation in many respects versus mining in the U.S. and so these assets that came through the Phelps Dodge transaction increasingly look attractive.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Next one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","","Congratulations on the rise in the natural gas price. With the rise in the gas price, do you think more U.S. energy acquisitions are still possible? I read the energy stocks fell with other commodity stocks even though gas is higher first question. Second question, would you hedge copper prices? Third question, how far out in the CapEx planning horizon, do you have flexibility to reduce CapEx of copper prices where it keeps falling? Would you look at 2016, 2017 projects as opposed to 2014 spending?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. well, John\u2026","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Forgive me for being interested.","Richard C. Adkerson","I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that. You have good questions, we\u2019re all interested. John, we like the position that we have in the natural gas industry that will come to us with the Plains and McMoRan acquisition. Plains had a position, a significant position in the Haynesville Shale play, which because of its cost structure is a play that\u2019s uneconomic at lower prices, but becomes very attractive as prices rise. and so that is a good position I have. And then with McMoRan, it has a very positive attributes in terms of its access to very large potential production reservoirs that will unfold over time. and we think the timing of the way that the McMoRan story will come into play, plus having the position in the Haynesville gives us a very attractive position in the natural gas business and the ore business.","So initially, we\u2019re going to be focused on executing our financial plan of integrating the companies of managing our debt level to get it down as we go forward. Our management team and our board will have the opportunity to look for investments over a broader set of assets and look to where we can get the best returns. So we\u2019re certainly, as we do in the mining business, we\u2019ll be alert to all potential opportunities.","With respect to hedging copper, we fundamentally believe that we can manage price risk through the way we manage our portfolio of assets, the way we\u2019ve structured it, the way that we have the ability to deal with capital expenditures like you talked about shows the ability to defer capital. If we have to, we could do that again. We also have the ability to manage our margins and our costs by the way we run certain of our operations.","You may recall that at Morenci in third-quarter of 2008, we had unit operating costs that were nearly $2. Within four, five months we had reduced it to $1.20. Now that reflected the lower input cost, which if the copper price does ramp down, input costs are going to be ramping down because of the way that the correlation between the economics between copper prices and input costs. But we basically have a philosophy of managing price risk in the mining business through operating hedges as opposed to financial hedges.","And with CapEx, you\u2019re right. If we have to, we have the ability to defer CapEx going forward. The good thing about our opportunities is that we really have the rights to do that. We\u2019re not compelled by contracts with the government and so forth or other outside parties that force us to spend money at particular points in time. So that gives the flexibility on how to manage cost.","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen Securities","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities","Hi, everyone. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions here. The first one is, how should we think about the Cerro Verde output before the mill expansion comes online in 2016? I know the grades were lower in 2012 and output was down year-on-year. But should we be building in further grade declines as we model the next couple of years?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, Kathleen is taking a look through her book here to answer your question specifically. I will say that that\u2019s all built into our numbers that we give you. I mean, as we give you volumes going out for the next three years, that factors in what we expect to produce at Cerro Verde.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yeah, Tony, it\u2019s Kathleen. We\u2019re showing slightly lower production in 2014 compared with 2013 at Cerro Verde. And then it starts to increase in late 2015 when we get the concentrator in place. So we would have had and I think we have a slide that shows that. We would have had declines at Cerro Verde if we weren\u2019t doing this expansion. We\u2019re still bringing on incremental volumes. But we were facing declines in grades if we didn\u2019t and loss of the oxide deposit as we go forward. So that\u2019s all reflected in our numbers that we\u2019ve given you the outlook on.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities","Thanks, Kathleen. Is that decline would be of a similar magnitude to the decline we saw in 2012 or less than that as you\u2019re modeling right now?","Kathleen L. Quirk","We\u2019re modeling about 10% lower in \u201814.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities","Okay, okay. And then just a follow-up on DRC and appreciate all the commentary there. And I was wondering, I know you\u2019ve also got a labor expiry there as well. is there any potential here that the government may look to try to tie-in something along these lines with the cobalt hydroxide along with labor negotiations there, is that a risk do you think?","Richard C. Adkerson","No, I don\u2019t see that as a risk at all. We have great relationships with the workforce. We haven\u2019t had any sort of really significant issues. When they have issues that are important to us, we respond to them. And the government has been very supportive. That\u2019s a country where people really appreciate jobs and the government appreciates employment. So we haven\u2019t seen any attempts to try to tie-in labor relations with government policy issues. And in fact, Tony, I\u2019m just real pleased with the way we\u2019ve conducted business there. The provincial government, the central government are all very supportive. now having said that, the government is constantly trying to extract money form us in terms of the way they interpret our contract and regulations and that\u2019s an ongoing issue. But that\u2019s just a function of the status of the government. But our relationships with the leadership, its province and the central government have really improved dramatically over the past couple of years.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities","That\u2019s great insight, Richard. I appreciate that, and that\u2019s Kathleen too.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Just following a little bit up on what Tony was talking about. Can I ask the same question on El Abra because first quarter looked really good, you did 90 million pounds, but my understanding was as we transferred over, which is going down to a run rate at 300 million pounds over the next few years. So is it possible just to get the sort of profile on that too?","Kathleen L. Quirk","","Yeah, El Abra, we are expecting in the 350 million pound range for this year and it\u2019s similar next year. 2012 we had sales of 340 million pound, so we are kind of in that range up over the next few years.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","And will that be like sustainable long-term i.e. higher than original, I thought originally when we converted all over sort of more replacing at 300 you used to talk about. Will it be higher than that on a sustainable basis going forward now do you think?","Richard C. Adkerson","We're going to try and hit as much as we can, I mean, that's just the way we are and I think that's what we're reflecting in achieving these higher rates going forward. I think looking beyond that, we ought to just think about it in terms of replacing that 300 million pound level and we'll give you the outlook. Red, do you have any comment on that?","Harry M. Conger","","No, that's the level that we're at those. Those grades are consistent pretty much for the Sulfolix project.","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","","Your final question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets.","Garrett S. Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but I did want to ask about the dividend policy. Can you definitively say that under no circumstance would you cut the $1.25 dividend? And that even if copper and other commodity prices were to decline materially, you'll extend your debt pay down timeline and\/or defer CapEx before you'll trim the dividend. I'm noticing that the stock is yielding about 4.5% right now, which is a tight yield and sometime, which I think is compelling to a lot of current and perspective investors.","Richard C. Adkerson","Garrett, we\u2019ve been working around these commodity business for a very long time and so to say never is not something that I will think about. Never is just too strong a word. Now having said that, we are confident about our ability to maintain that dividend. We recognize that it is attractive to investors. When our board made the decision to set it at that level, it was set at a level that was looked at in contemplation of lower commodity prices than the $4 \u2013 where it was when we set it and lower prices than where we are today.","So we have a commitment to it. I don't think any natural resource company can say definitively that you never do it, because we can all look back in history and see where companies have all had to make adjustments for a difficult scenario. But we do have a confidence in the commitment to it.","Garrett S. Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","","Sure, I mean it seems like the dividend is well covered even at much lower commodity prices.","Richard C. Adkerson","And that\u2019s the way we looked at it when we set it at that level.","Garrett S. Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay, Garrett. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard C. Adkerson","All right. Well listen, we appreciate everybody\u2019s attention. we look forward to executing our business as we go forward and dealing with these markets, however they might turn out. Always with a really optimistic positive view of our business in the longer-term. So thank you for your participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today.

(Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com.","Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. The slides are also available on our website. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. We would like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today are, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board, Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and CEO of FCX; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and we have several other members of our team here with us today.","I will start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will begin reviewing information included in our slide presentation. As usual, after the formal remarks, we will open up the call for questions and answers.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $707 million, or $0.68 per share for the fourth quarter 2013 and $2.7 billion, $2.64 per share for the year 2013, compared with $743 million or $0.78 per share for fourth quarter 2012 and $3 billion or $3.19 per share for the year 2012.","Our net income attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter 2013 included of $166 million or $0.15 per share as detailed in the press release, which included $73 million or $0.07 per share for unrealized losses oil and gas derivative contracts and $49 million or $0.05 per share associated with updated mine plans at Morenci that resulted in a loss in recoverable copper in leach stockpiles.","FCX's fourth quarter results reflect strong operating performance in both, the mining and gas businesses that we will be talking about. Our consolidated sales of over 1.1 billion pounds was 17% above last year's fourth quarter and reflected higher production throughout the global operations, and particularly at Grasberg, where copper sales were a little over 40% above last year's fourth quarter.","OIL and gas sales, 16.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. That was ahead of our forecast. Our fourth quarter average recorded copper price of $3.31 per pound was below the year ago quarterly average of $3.60 per pound and gold prices of $12.20 per ounce was 27% below the year ago quarter. Oil prices were strong in the quarter as Jim will be talking about, with Brent prices averaging $109 per barrel and average realizations by our oil and gas division of $94 per barrel before hedging impacts.","Operating cash flows of $2.3 billion in the quarter exceeded capital expenditures of $1.7 billion. We ended the year with total debt of $20.7 billion and our cash balance was approximately $2.0 billion. We have approximately 1.04 billion common shares currently outstanding.","And I will turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the slides materials on our website.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, everyone and for all of you on the East Coast, we are thinking about you facing that storm up there. I know its difficult. You all stack up some shorts and swimsuits and golf clubs and swim to us in Arizona, enjoy this weather in the 70s.","Looking back on 2013, when we went into the year and as we consummated oil and gas transactions, at first in May you heard us talking about execution and that is what was really the emphasis of our entire organization, it was on operational execution during the year. And the results have been strong. We had 12% increase in copper sales and we had growing volumes in all four regions that we are operating in. We had a positive and significant contribution from the oil and gas business. Jim will be talking about that.","We executed our plans to grow our volumes. We have three major projects that we had identified to increase our copper sales over a three year period by a billion pounds. We completed the second phase expansion at Tenke and that operation has operated very well. The Morenci mill expansion has progressed and nearing completion in 2014. We have initiated construction at the major project at Cerro Verde in Peru and it's progressing on schedule. In addition, the Grasberg underground development activities moved forward this year. despite the interruptions that we had during the year and we are preparing ourselves for the completion of the mining of the Grasberg pit. It's currently scheduled to be completed in 2016.","In the oil and gas area, the Lucius development project is progressing towards production. The understanding of the assets within the deepwater the PXP acquired during 2012, now its part of our portfolio, is progressing and we have got exciting new growth opportunities there. And then, with the renamed ultradeep play, we are calling the Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous opportunity, we have got exciting news there about a well we are currently drilling about what that means for our company going forward.","We continue to be focused on cost savings and discipline in spending capital. We have got our targeted debt reduction that remains in place. We are looking for ways to accelerate that. During the year we have, including the special dividend and our regular dividend and about 10% stock price increase during 2013 and attractive return to shareholders of 17% to $3.3 billion of common stock dividend including special dividend.","Our financial results reflects this strong operating performance virtually across the board. Our volumes and our mining business for copper were slightly above our guidance, well above the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year. Realizations of just over $3.30 are below the fourth quarter of the prior year but going into 2013, there was a lot of skepticism about where copper prices would be and markets appear to be stronger going into 2014 than they did going into 2013.","Our site cost for the fourth quarter, for the company consolidated was $1.16 a pound, reflecting strong volumes of both, copper and gold in Indonesia and that was well below our guidance and well below our recent historical performance.","There was really strong gold production. At Grasberg, we had access to higher grades and it did show what that mine provides to us. Our oil volumes, sales volumes were in line with our guidance and business performed very well.","I mentioned that today copper markets appear to be strengthening from where we were a year ago. During 2013, China went through a government change, a reorientation of its economy towards internal consumption with less emphasis on exports and infrastructure development and major spending on infrastructure continues as evidenced by the recent announcement by state grid to increase its capital spending and that has a major impact on copper consumption there, but consumer demand remains strong. Infrastructure investment in China is a major part of this marketplace.","In the U.S. demand has steadily improved, particularly in key sectors like residential construction, warehousing starts were up. Today's news about mortgage applications being up, we are seeing improvement in non-residential construction and the automobile industry continues to be very strong and important consumer [copper] as we talk to our downstream customers. We are hearing positive comments about the performance in 2013, and a degree of confidence about 2014.","In the copper business, we are seeing some recovery in Europe, the beginnings of it. Worldwide, the copper market remains very tight. Exchange stocks have dropped dramatically during the second half of 2013. Today they are lower than they have been in 15 months and a lack of strike of scrap is driving hard cathode consumption and that is being an important part of the marketplace, so we are seeing relatively positive near-term fundamentals for copper in world that has continuing economic uncertainties, but longer-term fundamentals remain particularly strong because of constraints on supply globally and the demand for copper throughout the world.","Turning to Slide 6, you can see our fourth quarter unit production cost that I referred to earlier. Across the board, we were lower than our plans for the fourth quarter, driven by cost control efforts Red Conger and his team are applying in the Americas.","Our operation in Africa is performing well and then having the higher grades in Indonesia, where our unit cost net of gold credits dropped to $0.21 per pound, resulting in this dollar $1.16 per pound. You can see how our sales from North America, South America, Indonesia and Africa were distributed during the fourth quarter.","We are releasing our preliminary reserve information for our mining business, proven and probable reserves of copper at the end of 2013 were 111 billion pounds of copper 31 million ounces of gold and 3 billion pounds of molybdenum.","Since the Phelps Dodge transaction, we have had very significant additions to reserves all 45 billion pounds of copper for example and continue to have opportunities to add reserves because of our very large resource base and ongoing exploration program. Our reserves or you can see we will distributed between the Americas and Indonesia and growing opportunity in Africa.","Beyond reserves on slide eight, we have, and the reserves are based on mine plans using a $2 copper price. We have mineralized material of significance associated with our existing ore bodies. So looking at our copper price of $2.20, you see well over 100 billion pounds of mineralized material that not yet qualifies as reserves. So it is incremental to our reserves. Half of that is in North America and our work goes on to see about moving the mineral resources into reserves and ultimately into development projects to generate cash flows. Huge asset for our company.","Our mines are distributed around the world. We have our flagship mine in Arizona at Morenci, the Cerro Verde project in Southern Peru, El Abra and Candelaria in South America and Tenke Fungurume, Grasberg that we have in a world with a very limited number world-class mines which we are looking at over billion pounds of copper per year. We have the opportunity of having five mines which is in that group and what's what our goal is, is to reach that.","I want to give you a report on Indonesia. Indonesia, for years, has been focused on looking at increasing processing of minerals within the country. In our 1991 contract of work which is the contract we are currently operating on, there was provisions in that contract which we committed to develop a copper smelter range the development of copper smelter within Indonesia under certain conditions and in response to that we followed through. We arranged with Japanese investors to build Indonesia's first smelter, its only copper smelter and refinery in the country and Mitsubishi operates it. PT Freeport Indonesia owns 25% of the equity and we supply copper concentrates to it. So that smelter is operating in Gresik.","Indonesia also exports in large volumes mineral ores across the national resource space that aren't processed in the country and that includes nickel, aluminum and tin and the country, in 2009, when it adopted a new mining law put five-year period on requiring that ores be processed within the country. Following the adoption of the law, there were a series of implementing regulations that moved forward and that export ban was ultimately extended to copper concentrates. The deadline for the ban was January 12 of this year.","Now our contract of work, which defines our rights and obligations in our relationships with the government has specific languages that gives PT FI the right to export concentrates. It also defines the taxes and other physical terms applicable to our operations and states explicitly that were not subject to tax or duties or fees that are subsequently imposed or approved by the government, expect as provided by the contract. As this deadline of January 12 approached, we were actively involved in discussions with the government as were other miners.","The final regulation that was adopted by the government exempted from the export ban copper concentrates that contained 15% copper which our concentrates will be well above 15% on our life of mine plans. At the same time, the government provided that exemption from the export ban for three years but in a new regulation that we did not anticipate that was a surprise to us that Ministry of Finance of the government imposed a duty on exporting minerals including copper concentrates and there is a progressive duty that's now in places. It's a regulation of the Ministry of Finance which states at 25% in 2014 and grows to 60% by 2016.","This is something that - there was conflict with our contracted work and where we are today is, we were gauged in discussions with representative government to discuss how this new export tax applies. The government is working on regulations, which has not been completed, so there is a degree of uncertainty on exactly what its intentions are for implementing this tax.","We of course so look at our contract and are of the view that it does not apply to us, but we are going to work with the government in a way to reach an agreement on it, to understand their position, make sure they understand ours. I will just point out that we have been operating in Indonesia since the early 1970s, we have never had a violation by either part of the contract and we are confident that we will find a way to [work] that will represent the interest of our shareholders and be responsive to government. That's where we stand. This is new. It just came out weekend before last. Regulations were up here until there is not specific clarity on this issue at this point.","Now, with Grasberg, as we have been dealing with this and as we go with the tragedy of the training facility issue earlier in the year, and as we reached an agreement with our labor union this fall that avoided a strike that was so disruptive to us in 2011 and 2012. We have really a substantial increase in the productivity and performance metrics in conjunction with also having available higher rate award to mine in process.","In the first half of 2013, for example, our mill operated at average of 157,000 tons. Today in the fourth quarter, we were over 200,000. Grades have improved of both copper and gold and that translated into lower unit net cost.","You can see how the performance improved over the year, and then as we look forward between 2013 and 2016, we are expecting the normal operations to complete mining the pit, we will have increasing amounts of both, copper and gold an extraordinary year in 2016 during the final phases of operating into pit.","Currently, we are adjusting our operations to continue in a full fashion, but focusing on maintenance activities in mining material that constraints the level of copper concentrates we are currently producing as we have discussions with the government for this export duty.","I mentioned that our brownfield development projects are progressing. The Tenke Fungurume project is complete. Cerro Verde is going well. We start construction there. Our team with our contractors are working well and at Morenci, we have 60% completed that project and we will be starting up next year to add 25 million pounds of copper all in a very high rate of return project.","We are continuing with our exploration program. Spending will be somewhat less this year and that's more of a nature just where our focus would be and what our plans are serving no less emphasis on exploration, but the slide on '13 shows where we will be spending money.","Our projects will be focused principally on brownfield opportunities and focused on our existing mines, but we do have a couple of exciting greenfield projects that we will also be pursuing.","With that, I will turn over the presentations to Jim Flores to talk about our oil and gas business.","Jim Flores","Thank you, Richard. Good morning, everyone. On Page 14, you have a slide of the Brent from 3 to present always overlaid with LLS or Louisiana Light Suite. The takeaway from this slide is that 90% Freeport copper and gold, oil and gas, revenues are derived from this current pricing of oil and the Brent and LLS.","We will show you where this provided tremendous margin for business, somewhere between $50 and $60 a barrel depending on base differentials and regional markers and that's what's fuelling our oil and gas development of the Gulf of Mexico, the Eagle Ford in California and also on Lower Cretaceous and the Lower Tertiary exploration play.","We see on from January 11, 2013 is that, the range has been $125 to $100 in there. So about $110 average. We have consistently maintained these prices in the oil for various reasons. A lot of oil demand is continuing to increase. The fourth quarter numbers are well over 93 million barrels as oil demand has continued to expand with all the easy money calls and we have had supply disruptions out of MENA area, Middle East and North Africa, and we have got production growth here in North America. So there is lot of misconceptions. The curve, going forward, always has a 20% discount and going forward in (inaudible). I think it has a lot to do with liquidity issues, for instance oil price discovery.","So we continue to maintain our budget process between $100 and $105 a barrel of Brent and going forward. based on the production struggles around the world, grow production from North America and also the aspect of consumption demand expanding around the world on a consistent basis that we continue to see accelerating this year. So we are very excited about our budget going forward based on the strong pricing background, I will mention that about third of our CapEx budget is discretionary. And early in the year, we can move a lot of things around to affect spending if the prices, there will be another way or something happens when our price margin erodes. So we are in a situation of real flexibility. Obviously that flexible erodes during the year but I want to make sure everybody understands that a third of the discretionary is real and something that we keep that flexibility very close in hand.","When we move to page 15, you will see what I talked about for our fourth quarter 2013 cash operating margin of almost $1 billion, $900 million at $56 a barrel. That compares with the third quarter margin of $64 a barrel. We had slightly higher prices but the big thing we had in the fourth quarter that stuck with us in the third quarter was refineries all turn around at the same time in the fourth quarter and we had large basis widening of about $10 a barrel which affected our margins, even though we had higher production.","So that's all been reversed. If you look at those operating margins here in January, we are back where LLS is straight right on top of Brent and you can see that on page 14 right at the end of that graph where LLS and Brent diverged and now with that, those two curves come together, we are looking at a $50 or $60 per Boe margin, going forward. Lou see the contribution in the pie chart being 47% out of the Gulf of Mexico, 30% out of the Eagle Ford and 21% out of California and Haynesville, that's about 2%. We have got (inaudible) in all these areas and we will take you through it as the details on the adjacent slides.","Before we do oil and gas operating summary, the operating margins on a per property basis, California $54 a barrel, Eagle Ford $63, the gas assets in Haynesville about $9.50 and the Gulf of Mexico assets $63.83, $55.95. This fits us in the best in class group of operating margin. I think this is what separates oil and gas business from best to worse, is what the operating margin, how much cash flow they are actually generating on per barrel sold. And we have a heavy gas oriented business. A gas oriented business with the low prices, these margins are much less and obviously with our 90% of our revenues coming from oil, we are in the preferred area of the highest margins in our group. You see our sales by region breakdowns. It is very consistent with the third quarter, California, Eagle Ford, Haynesville and the Gulf of Mexico.","Moving to slide 17. We have announced our preliminary SEC proved reserves of 4604 million barrels as of 12\/31\/13. By category, breakdown of the system this year, we have 34% PUDs, 53% PDPs and 13% PDNPs. By region, with Gulf of Mexico 37%, California with its large resource base again 40%, Eagle Ford 13% and Haynesville, you will notice 10%. And then by commodity ratio at 6:1, which is the old BTU conversion ratio, its not the pricing ratio, the 27:1 or whatever it is now, its 75% oil and 20% gas and 5% NGL.","I will mention here, there is a couple of notable exceptions to our proved reserve base. Our Phobos discovery that we made in the first quarter has not been the delineated to offset, so it does not need the proved reserve test, Lomond well cost structure South of Lucius, in Keathley Canyon, and also this highlander area at Lomond well that we are going to discuss here in a little bit is also (Inaudible) in year- end '13 reserves.","Those were the only two significant exploration wells that we are doing gas business conducted this year for our proved reserves categories of adding reserve. That would change here in 2014 with our exploration, we will expand in the deepwater with the arrival of drill ships and our business will be more normalized for us adding reserve as we (Inaudible).","Our Lucius development project is one of those areas, where as we continue to get closer to production, we are able to add reserve there. We have delineated [reservoir] and have more to do in the deeper Miocene reservoir.","Lucius is on schedule. We have had some pipeline delivery issues that our operator Anadarko has done a job at overcome to keep it on scheduled. It's cost little more money, but on top of that is surrounding area, when we put on the 80,000 barrels a day in the 450 million cubic feet of gas that the facility is going to process for process in the third quarter this year, so fingers crossed on that that the project continues to move along just as planned.","In our deepwater Gulf of Mexico update, a couple of key things here to take away that are going to be impactful to a couple of slides further along annual production. The reason we bought the facilities in Holstein, Marlin and Horn Mountain, were to have major development projects, to achieve the production rates of development projects. We had few platform modification of each one. That's a 60 to 90-day shut-in for each different facility.","In 2014, Marlin is going to be shut-in the third quarter. In 2015, Horn Mountain and Holstein will be shut-in, and when you shut-in 30,000 barrels a day for 90 days, it does affect your annual production rate and so forth. Maintaining the 2014 and 2015, even though we are growing, even though we are expanding our production base as a company, it's being muted by those shut-ins, 2014 with Marlin and 2015 with Holstein and Horn Mountain.","Everything we are finding there geologically are the new seismic imaging seismic we have shot all the new imaging, we are planning heavily resource laying opportunities on our leased on our leased block and so forth and the first area of development obviously is Holstein, where we have a platform, rig, being ready to drill our first in-field sidetrack well to start maximize our production there. Our guys have done a fantastic job of maintaining high production without any drilling activity or well intervention activity at Holstein, Marlin and Horn Mountain.","On the exploration front, like I said, we have exciting year coming up not only potentially Phobos delineation, but our Terra prospects. I think this is a Lucius look-a-like of 300 million to 500 million barrels in Keathley Canyon area where we have been drilling with one of our initial drillship showing up. We will probably prepare that well sometime in the second quarter and our copper project will sometime in the third quarter.","We will just see right about Holstein in the copper project is a project on an exploration opportunity we think is excellent as far as productivity, but we think it's imaged very well of seismic and that is a pure product of our new imaging and showing the real productivity and that was being masked by the old data, so very active year, but it's still ramp up from here in '14, '15, '16, and production rates is 16 when we really start hitting on all.","On Page 20, talking about the inboard lower tertiary, which normally is ultra-deep want to give the geologic number if it's fitting in with the rest of our projects. Our Lomond North well as you in the middle of that circle is the northernmost well that we drilled so far and search for the other good reservoirs here in lower tertiary protection activities.","Here today we found large structures and we found large sands and so forth, but we have got challenging reservoir quality for those sands. Velocities and probabilities in those things on the challenging side, still there is a lot of pressure, so we are in a process of overcoming those with some completions at Davy Jones and the Blackbeard and Lineham Creek later this year or early next year but Lomond is the first well that we drilled where we see excellent reservoir characteristics consistent with ferocities in the 20% range that are more aligned with what we see in Miocene type reservoirs and largely that reservoirs that have excellent flow capabilities and excellent production rates.","It also is very relative to the (inaudible) 50 miles to north of that original Louisiana. So we are 50 miles away to the South and on the northern edge of our area, and we found over 150 feet of pay. We are still in pay and still drilling operations of the well. We have another 1,000 feet to go to get down to TD in the Cretaceous and we are very excited about finally finding a reservoir that all the log indications and our core indications meets the criteria of a spectacular commercial well.","We are moving at light speed to get this well production equipment. We will test this well sometime this summer. We are actually going to harvest some equipment from the offshore operations and we have got all that in place. We have got 56,000 acres on the structure at Lomond. It's a very large structures. Its going to have a large reserve potential and we drilled a mid-depth well so there is a lot of up-depth acreage to this well as we pile up these sands in the Cretaceous and also in the Wilcox.","Now with the production test of Davy Jones #2, Lomond North and Blackbeard #2 this year and we have a large test number towards high quality prospects. You will continue to hear more and more on that with the production test at Lomond the rest of this year. Development of the low-cost source of natural gas, but a lot of liquid. So on a margin basis, we think this is somewhere between $20 and $30 barrel margin, significantly higher than what we have in the Haynesville and the Madden area. So it can be competitive with some more projects on returns.","So more on that in the Q&A. Richard, I am going to turn it back over to you to finish and summarizing our activity.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Thanks, Jim. We are going to talk about sales outlook. I want to point that this is our plan with our Indonesian operations operating in a normal fashion. We are currently working through this process of getting export permits and so forth. As we go forward that, if there are revisions to this, we will update you, but this based on a scenario of normal operations.","Our current sales outlook is consistent with our prior outlook of 4.4 billion pounds of copper, 1.7 million ounces of gold and 95 million pounds of molybdenum. We have increase our outlook for oil equivalents from 57 million barrels equivalent to 60.7. At $3.25 for copper this plan would generate in 2014 $9 billion of operating cash flows including working capital changes. We remain highly leveraged to the price copper and since change in copper 2014 means $370 million to us.","Our unit cost would reflect some very driven lower volumes in the first quarter of 2014, is $1.45 per pound and $20 a barrel equivalents for oil that Jim just talked about. Current outlook for capital expenditures is $7.1 billion with just over $4 billion for mining and $3 billion for oil and gas.","We are looking on 22, where we have our quarterly sales outlook. This is the annual sales outlook. You can see going from 4.1 to 4.4 for copper and then moving up as we complete our development projects to 5 billion in 2015 and 5.7 in 2016. where we have the benefit of the expansion projects plus the extraordinary year in Indonesia as we near the ending the mining of the pit. You can see that in gold with a limited amount of gold with 3 million ounces of gold to our interest, that's net of the Rio Tinto participation in the joint venture in that year and you can see the annual oil and gas sales on equivalent basis and as Jim said, that is net of the maintenance tie-in, shut-ins of the deepwater rigs in 2014 and 2015. About 2016, we will be at an average of like over 220 a day and that with these kind of margins it generates very potential cash flows.","On a quarterly basis, as I mentioned on 23, we will be having lower copper sales in first quarter because of the grades in the Indonesia for mine planning purposes and also in South America, principally Candelaria, and you can see our quarterly outlook for all of our commodities in the third quarter is when the (Inaudible) shutdown occurs and that shows the lower oil and gas growing its production.","Page 24 shows our minerals, sales by region and shows increases in North America, which reflects the Morenci start up of this expansion project.","South America affected by some lower grades both, at Europe and Cerro Verde that's just mine sequencing issues and then Grasberg in Africa.","Unit production costs are shown on page 25. In 2014, you can see the continued strong performance affected by volumes across the board, but current plans for consolidated net unit cost, net of byproduct credits is a $1.45.","Page 26 is the models we present each quarter. This is updated to show an average of 2015 and 2016 cash flow and EBITDA generation and that's in the solid section, showing it in comparison with our outlook for 2014.","We can see for example, at 350 copper, we would be just under $9 billion here in 2014, but the average for the next two years would be over $12 billion, so that shows just the effects of our growing volumes and the strong margins in our business and you can see how that would fluctuate between $3 and $4. On the following side, we have our sensitivities to prices and also to certain costs, energy costs and currencies for purposes and investing your analysis.","Our updated capital expenditure slide is shown on Slide 28. We have talked about the $7 billion for 2014, and you can see how the outlook is for 2015, and new information that we are presented for the first time in 2016.","Jim made a point about our oil and gas capital spending. This is the opportunities that we have very positive report market conditions. There is a lot of flexibility as to how we manage that if market conditions change.","There are certain expenditures are discretionary. We also have the ability of bringing in partners, joint ventures and so forth, so we are going to manage as we have indicated over the past year, the oil and as spending to be consistent with the cash flow generated by that business.","The spending today reflects opportunity to increase volumes to pursue some new prospects that we have identified and take advantage of the resources that we have available to us.","We are committed firmly to the strong balance sheet management. We targeted, reducing debt to a level of approximately $12 billion to 2016, running our business with continuation of current commodity prices, because doing nothing else would get us close to that and our objective is going to be to manage our business safely, but to achieve the volumes and cost tartest that we have.","We anticipate the curve our business as we work through achieve the volumes call target we have all we had suspended continuing the curve of current common stock dividend $1.25 a share all and so this debt reduction target is clearly within our reach considering our large resource base in having discipline about the way we run our business and spend our capital.","We are continuing to view divestitures and other options that are available to us through joint ventures and potentially involving fee structures and that work is ongoing. We don't really have anything specific to report to you today on it other than the fact that we are all working very hard to do it and we are all committed to getting this debt to the level that we targeted and that remains a strong focus of our entire organization.","So we are Freeport, maximizing shareholder return and strong execution and management as we had a great track record of doing, focusing on shareholder returns and growth in a disciplined way to provide value for shareholders, protecting our dividend, protecting our balance sheet and paying our shareholders good dividend. That's the story that we been operating under for years and that's what we continue to be focused on as we go forward.","We appreciate your attention, and now we will be available for questions, if you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, Richard Kathleen and Jim. I just wanted to dig deeper on this Indonesian tax situation. Could you quantify what exact export tax rate you are paying currently? What the incremental change would be, assuming that this law is effected on Grasberg, either in sort of gross dollar amount or in cents per pound?","And then could you comment about your drive to continue with the underground CapEx? What would be the point of proceeding with that if in the future you are going to facing progressively higher tax rate?","Richard Adkerson","That's okay. Okay, thank you, Jorge. We pay no export duties on copper concentrate shipments currently and we have never had that as part of operations. So this is a new duty that's in there. Now, we pay 35% income tax, which our contract provides for. Since the contract was signed, income tax rates have dropped in Indonesia and other companies currently pay 25%. We have a 10% tax withholding tax on distributions from PT-FI to FCX. There is payroll taxes. There is royalties under the contract and there is other types of payments. Overall, we have historically been one of Indonesia's largest income tax payers, many years the largest. We would estimate that we pay $15 billion in taxes, royalties, income taxes royalties and other taxes to the government over the life of the contract and under the contract we would be paying very large amounts going forward. So we are a major financial tax payer and contributor to the government of Indonesia, but not in the form of export duties on copper concentrate exports.","The announcement and regulations that have been adopted today, talk about a progressive royalty starting at 25% going to 60%, in steps through 2016 through the middle part of 2016 and then it talks about beyond that there would be a ban on exports. We don't know exactly how that would be applied because the regulations implemented have not been completed and we are waiting to see that, but if you were to apply those rates to the gross value of our concentrate exports, it's a very large amount that would be incremental to the very large payments we are already making to the government. And that is what we are engaged in discussions on with the fact that it's inconsistent with our contract of work and that the amounts would result in a very large amount going to the government. So those we have got to deal with.","On our underground development, based on our confidence that is supported by our track record of operating there over many years and dealing in a country that's gone through tremendous social, political changes and economic changes. We have confidence, we are going to work this out, so we are continuing with our underground development program, in fact, had a year with that 2013, because it's important so that we can make this transition from mining in the pit to mining underground.","That underground development is a extraordinarily attractive development opportunity for our company. When you stack it up against other projects around the world, given the high volumes with demand underground, we are looking at underground mines providing 240,000 tons a of ore to mill, which is just extraordinary. At a very low cost, at cost levels based on today's cost.","That would be comparable to open pit mining. It's just really important to us and with our confidence is being able to work with a government to resolve this matter, we are continuing with our development plans underground.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. If I could just clarify, so what's being talked about? Is this any rough numbers you do $3.3 billion of copper in Indonesia in 2014. The part does not process locally call it roughly half would be about $1.6 billion of revenue and then you pay roughly a 25% export duty. That's what they are asking for. On the copper con, and also would there be similar amounts on the gold as well?","Richard Adkerson","First of all, we are currently processing about 40% of our output from the Grasberg operations of PTFI at the Indonesian smelter, so that 40% will not be subject to any that is export duty acquired through international sales of copper concentrates, so will be 60%. We sell concentrate. It has both, copper and gold in it, so we don't sell copper concentrate and gold concentrate separately there, but we are waiting to see how these regulation would work and then how we can reach an understanding within the Indonesian government about how to reconcile this regulation with our contracted work and was the basis for us to go forward.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with Barclays.","David Gagliano - Barclays","Thanks. Speaking with the Indonesia topic, obviously we know, indication negotiations can take a long time, so I have two questions. My first question is in the immediate term, very near-term, how long will Freeport be willing to go, so the timing without implementing more significant changes at the mine, I think you mentioned that you are using workers to I guess stripping maintenance et, cetera. How long will that last before perhaps more significant changes at the mine. That's my first question.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Dave, it's a good question. The practical issue we face is there is limited amount of opportunities to produce copper concentrate story. Just because of the nature of the product and where we are. We are looking at alternatives for that's very it. There's a limited amount of opportunities. Copper concentrate story. The major project or product where we are were looking at alternatives for that all we are addressing mine plans to reduce concentrate production as we continue to mine.","We are looking at the plans of how to arrange shipments to smelter, we are looking at alternative storage opportunities are but as we go forward we would want to focus operations on continuing to produce from the block cave DOZ.","The nature of black cave were up and preserve the operation, so we will progressively be looking at ways of continuing to produce. There's a mill first on the block cave supplemented by the pit to shift to Grasberg. We will maximize storage opportunities and then if we are not successful in getting this done, we would be forced to scale back operations in the pit and suspend operations now.","Look, we are talking about getting this resolved and that will work to reduce in everyone's interest and so that's the crown communications we are having with the government. We have had a long history of really success upon investment for our shareholders but also Indonesia and that's what we are going to try to build on to resolve this issue.","David Gagliano - Barclays","Okay, thanks. And then my follow-up, which is related in the medium term. If there is no agreement or resolution, f what is Freeport's next medium term steps and what is the preference here? Presumably you know there would be a consideration given for a smelter and if so, could you also when you answer this question maybe give us a sense of some capital costs associated with building a smelter and things like that?","Jim Flores","We built a smelter in the mid-90s. It was on the order of, it was a world-class smelter, 300,000 tons of metal. One of the most efficient smelters in the world. At that time, its cost was in the order of $750 million. Since that time, the replacement cost for that smelter, we have had some third party experts analyzing this in conjunction with working with the government, the cost of building that has roughly tripled since the Gresik smelter was built. At the same time, TCs and RCs haven't risen. They are processing fees that smelters receive because of market dynamics. The expansion of smelter capacity in Asia, principally in China and how that capacity stacks up with available concentrates on a global basis. So you have got a situation where smelter construction cost has tripled and processing fees are in the range where they were back in mid-90s and so that makes the economic of building new smelter a challenge, and that's what we have got to talk with the government about.","David Gagliano - Barclays","Okay, and that's helpful on the smelter cost. Very helpful. And just in terms of the first part of that question, so what are Freeport's next steps? So what should we expect to hear from Freeport, assuming that there is no agreement reached? What will Freeport do next?","Jim Flores","Well, I don't want to speculate because I think we are going to reach an agreement. It obviously, as we have these discussions and particularly given the circumstances within Indonesia, with the upcoming elections and so forth, for us to speculate publicly, it would just be inappropriate right now. So we are going to keep the market informed. We are going to work as we have always done in a positive way. We are engaged everyday and we are going to work to find a solution. You have got to think through those scenarios but I think you can appreciate from my standpoint, it is just not appropriate for us to try to speculate on those sorts of negative outcomes.","David Gagliano - Barclays","Okay, understood. Thanks.","Jim Flores","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon.","Jim Flores","Hi, Sal.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Hi, sorry, good morning t. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on Indonesia. First is, you have increased your CapEx to $900 million a year from $800 million. That's about $500 million more for the next five years. I was just wondering, if there is anything that you are doing, or it is just the cost of escalation?","Jim Flores","A lot of that is surrounding, this is a project which is dynamic and we make adjustments as we go along. We do everything we can to save capital. Some of it is things like labor escalation and things of those nature. But there is nothing fundamentally changed about it.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Okay, and Richard, knowing what you know from your contract of work, and (inaudible) it appears that it does protect you from any kind of changes in the mining law until at least 2020. I am wondering, would you be willing to take it to an international arbitration court if government forces the new law on you?","Richard Adkerson","Let me make two comments about your question, Sal. While the primary term of this contract does end in 2021, the contract itself provides for two tenure extension. Freeport reserves through 2041, on the basis of that contract provision, and the extensions are provided for an extension on the terms of the original contract. Now, I think most of you know that for over two years now we have engaged with the government as a reviewed contracts as a comparatives contract to the 2009 mining law, and we have indicated a willingness to sit down with the government and talk about some revisions that would be responsive to certain of the government's aspirations in a way that would protect the value of our shareholders, so that's the process that we have been going through.","The contract does provide that we do have the rights for international arbitration and that is a protection that we consider to be important for our contract. We have a strong are not to go to international arbitration and that is a feature that's available to us, but it's not something we see as an attractive course of action for this much more attractive course of action would be able to find a mutually agreeable resolution to it with the government.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Michael, your line is open.","Richard Adkerson","Mike, are you there?","Operator","Your line may be on mute.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","I am here. Can you hear me.","Richard Adkerson","Mike, we can hear you.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Richard, how are you? Sorry about that.","Richard Adkerson","No problem.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","\u2026keep on harping on the Indonesian issue, but these respective people who were making these up proclamations of fully aware of the details of your contract award when they come out with these patients.","Richard Adkerson","Mike, Indonesia has changed so much. From the transition from the government in 1998 to the evolution of the country free and open democracy with the prepress and so forth, so like here in other places in the world, you know, there are people I know who are commenting on this who aren't familiar with the full facts and situation.","There are also people made comments for political purposes and that happens everywhere, so the point is we will engage in serious discussions with people. Press articles will be what press articles are and you have to read that with the understanding of the nature of the situation.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","The Indonesian presidential election is in July this year?","Richard Adkerson","Well, no. there is initially a parliamentary election that occurs in the spring and the presidential election does initial around of the election is scheduled for mid-summer to July timeframe. Then if that doesn't decide the president, there would be a subsequent one-off election that would be later in (Inaudible).","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Last question?","Richard Adkerson","The current President you know is not eligible to run because of term on it.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Got it. In terms of the 2021 and 2031 in your expenses that you [same] contract, but with early announcement on the 2021 expansion be basically the only reason why you would give any changes, any financial or operating changes now in your contract?","Richard Adkerson","Well, it would only be in connection with having a successful completion of the contract review process in getting an extension to our contract, so like we have done in other places in Indonesia over the years, as we listen to these things and we have some productive discussions about how could we get a resolution of this process? Get the contract review behind us, get our extensions, end up having some concessions that we would like from contract that the government could feel if they had achieved something of importance in representing the government and the people and we could have a way of successfully having a mutually agreeable outcome to this would but it would be in the context of getting all this behind us.","Jim Bob Moffett","Let me make a couple of comments. This is Jim Bob. Talking about these negotiation with the government. As Richard said, we have got a democratic country. You have the parliament. You have the ministers. You have the president. This announcement we have just made, when I read that and say, we could be (inaudible) billions in taxes. We are interested in getting billions in taxes. The only solution is working smoothly with everybody involved with the smelter. What Richard is saying and what we are all thinking, we just have to look at the most practical. When you talk about why we are taking the 21 to 31, 31 to 41, the reason why that came up is because we would be spending $15 billion underground. Those things spending $15 billion underground without planning for the years that we have to have production and shareholders back. But just look at it this way, right now the parliament, just because of this announcement was just (inaudible) on Monday, they don't have the regulation. They understand the deal, a bit like our congress, honestly like Obama's healthcare. So there is a lot of questions being answered and they perceive these pieces of paper that they haven't even read yet because this was just announced on Monday. So that's why we are trying to be patient and let everybody have a chance to read the darn thing. The people who make stupid decisions, our callers wouldn't shutdown the United States government in that time. They wouldn't dare do that, would they? So just be patient with this. I bet over there it is 1984 and this isn't the first contract and that we are in lots of times we had to sit and wait for people to have a chance to understand things. So there is a resolution here and we have got the best copper mine in the world or mines in the world. We know how to build this project. So (inaudible) and in the new year.","The questions that you are asking are important but the answer is, since we just got this thing on Monday, let's not make an ObamaCare out of this thing. Just let everybody understand it and then we figure out what to do and will they.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Thank you very much,. Jim Bob.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. First of all, I just want to congratulate you guys on meeting your objectives of strong execution in your operations. First question. Just changing the subject a bit and then coming back to Indonesia on the second one. Your oil and gas expectations for 2014 and '15 increased from your previous guidance during the last quarter as well as the expectation for capital expenditures. Can you just provide more color as to where are these increases coming from?","Jim Flores","Oscar, this is Jim. Good morning. There's two components of the increases in production. Number one, we retained the Gulf of Mexico assets. We did not sell them because of some productive events that happened there. We accelerated some of our pipe reserves, or are in the process of doing that in conjunction with Chevron's operation. So the present value changed dramatically and we are going to enjoy those productions. That's number one.","Number two, as we are scheduling work to be done in the Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater is long lead time project. We are finding more efficient ways to do things. We are finding ways to look at the facilities (inaudible) over the long term and the most reserves from our Horn Mountain facility instead of us drilling wells on the facility and then they were up to production and actually having a lower production for 2015.","We are doing subsea-only in the Horn Mountain versus the combination dry trees with a rig on the Horn Mountain structure and subsea. Therefore, we will have minimal supply interruption of the existing production.","At the same point in time, we will go ahead and get all in a high potential subsea tieback. Yes that cost more money initially, but the returns are higher and the production, consistency in growing from the business point of view is more consistent, so I would characterize it as the Gulf of Mexico, and fine-tuning our Gulf of Mexico model from a standpoint.","As I said about a third of this CapEx is discretionary or timing on those types of things, so if we ended up with say $20 erosion and oil prices, we can make a lot of adjustments here over a single-year period, but the share over a two-year period to line things at and we are committed to.","We have got a good margin business. We are committed to fine-tuning that, and while prices are high and demand worldwide, it's continuing to accelerate. We think that's a good opportunity for us to be aggressive with our development plans for our planning purpose, but we are positioned to always have a place change that if the market chose that.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jim. That's very helpful. Now, if I may, just going back to Indonesia, Richard, the existing operations include a smelter, refinery for copper, if not refinery for gold. As I understand the client that comes out of the smelter gets shipped out, so we process elsewhere would be progress back the applicable. If it in fact is applicable to all of the gold chip from Grasberg and then in your (Inaudible) they the replacement cost for the smelter. Are you including a gold refiner in that amount?","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Let me just make sure that the rest of the people on the call understand. Thanks for your comment about our operations in Grasberg.","Would PTFI our other operations that produce concentrates, sells the concentrate to PT Smelting, which is a jointly owned company in which PTFI has a 25% interest. That concentrate includes copper, gold and silver.","The PT Smelting's smelter and refinery, produces copper cathode from that concentrate, which is the basic product of pure copper that then goes to fabricators to produce wire and other copper projects.","There is a residual slime that has gold and silver in it and currently there is not a processing facility in Indonesia to process that and that since the construction of the PT Smelting facility, there has been shift to Japan for further processing.","We are still waiting to see how these regulations come out, but our expectation that that slime will be able to continue to be shipped without export duty at least for the next three years, so we think that that's going to be a restriction on PT Smelting's operations.","The feasibility study that we are working with would including slime processing facility, so we are looking at the cost of a project that would be $2 billion, $2.5 billion, plus working capital that would include a facility to process the slimes and recover the copper and gold in Indonesia.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much, Rick.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you, Oscar.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","Hi. Good morning. Richard, I was wondering if you could just talk about how you are you arriving at the 40 million pounds per month for copper, so was that based on the tonnages associated with the expert licenses that you haven't been able to obtained that have been delayed?","reviewed with you on exploration but you have been able to obtain dividend believe this is just reflects what our mine plan shows. as we move more to do that","Richard Adkerson","It just reflects what our mine plan shows and then we wanted to give since we were giving the disclosures on a basis of not having any impact of this situation on our operations, we want to give you some sense of what we are talking about. So what we are looking at is based on our mine plans a plan of continuing to ship to PT smelting. This would be what would be affected for international shipments out of PT-FI.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","Okay, and then the second question is, looking at your free cash flow guidance for the share after dividends, it's about roughly breakeven in terms of hitting your net debt target of $12 billion by 2016, it seems like some from of asset sales would be needed. Can you just comment on how active the company is at pursuing various","Richard Adkerson","From the start, we have seen this situation because of the capital spending at Cerro Verde and other places that this cash flow from normal operations was going to hit us in 2016. That's mining business adds, our oil and gas adds, considering the platform shut-ins and all of these projects ramping up. So 2016 and the very favorable operations in Indonesia in 2016, all of that adds up to 2016 being a hell of a year. So that's through normal operations were we could reach it.","Now beyond that, as I mentioned, our board challenges, we are challenging ourselves to find ways of advancing that and we are working very actively on the possibility of asset sales, potentially joint venture arrangements, potential transaction involving the MLP market in some way. So all those things are working and we are really focused on trying to advance the time when we get the targeted debt level reach.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","Okay, great. Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","So we understand, and that has been the facts, just about the flow of capital and so forth about 2014, 2015, the cash flows are going to fund these projects that generate the volumes. Not only 2016, but those volumes go forward, way beyond 2016 and then we have additional growth opportunities in those really post-2016 years when the oil and gas growth really kicks in, the capital that Jim was talking about, having the opportunities now enhances that and then we are looking for the next round of expansion projects in the mining business.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","Yes. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Thank you. Just a couple of quick question. Jim Flores, could you just clarify what you said about the Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous play? I think you mentioned there, you experienced some challenging reservoir quality. On which projects did you experience that challenging reservoirs? And then you also mentioned excellent reservoir quality. I think you were talking about one of the Lomond North, just clarify that please?","Jim Flores","No, Joe, our Lomond North well, Highlander has the excellent comparable rocks through traditional South Louisiana production at any depth. To find it at 28,000 feet, 29,000 feet under this pressure is truly spectacular. So we are holding all hulas and so forth toward a production test this summer and we will show you what 20% of rocks can do.","The other reservoirs that we found today have less ferocity but they were all set at a higher pressure that I talked about and they are going to be more challenging to produce. We have been very forthright with all investors and so forth. So we are trying to get to the core of this play. The exploratory drill that we have, eight points of control now and our wells, the latest well, this Lomond well is by far the best reservoir that we found to-date and that trend, I expect, to continue, now that we know what to look for and what to find but Lomond, by itself, will support the entire deep expectations of the play from what we see right now and also be a spectacular return for our royalty trust investors as well.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","So, Jim, are you less optimistic about Davy Jones and Blackbeard than you were before based on reservoir quality?","Jim Flores","There is no optimism here. There is nothing but realism, Joe, and its going to be what its going to be, from a standpoint. But just given the comparison towards what we found and how we are improving the operations, and this is what our shareholders pay us for, is to make sure they were always improving and moving the needle towards higher quality margins, higher quality reservoirs and this has been a quantum leap in this lower tertiary protection play then I think we will be surprise with the people as it unfolds with all the data and the production test this summer.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Then Jim you also mentioned $20 to $30 per barrel cash margin, so we specifically referring to the Lomond North and highlander and could you give me the calculation, quick calculation on that.","Jim Bob Moffett","Well, from a gas standpoint gas condensate, but if you are talking about 20 barrels per (Inaudible) that will get you pretty close when we have talked about LLS prices as the volume we are talking about.","You can get some pretty high margins there. That's kind of traditional gas condensate margins, you are seeing, in the Permian sand and central Oklahoma area and also north Louisiana, when you are talking about condensate-rich play, but you are talking about higher 50-plus million a day wells, you are talking about high volumes and great returns for our shareholders.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Great. Then just give us the update on the Gulf of Mexico asset\u2026","Jim Bob Moffett","We first started and definitely because of the acceleration of a recompletion and higher price reserves at this point in time we are going to keep it going forward.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Adam Duarte with Omega.","Adam Duarte - Omega","Good morning, guys. I have two questions. One is, what are the next steps of Lineham creek? Secondly given your heavy completion schedule in the second half of this year on the ultra-deep stuff. Now, when do you see first distribution to the royalty trust units?","Richard Adkerson","On Lineham Creek, Adam, Chevron is the operator and we are. Chevron is developing its completion plan and we will be coming out with ASCs and so forth, I would expect Lineham Creek, because of Chevron is the first well of this debt with Chevron has completed in this trend taking their time and so forth.","There may be first half of '15 before we had a completion at Lineham Creek. That's why the Lomond North, Davy Jones 2, Blackbeard West completion this year will be more significant to the distribution of the royalty trust and we think we will be able to make distributions four to six months of commercial production.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joan Lappin with Gramercy Capital.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Okay. Plane about to take off to Kennedy, so I will ask my questions as long as I can, so as far as Davy 2, can we get more color. I may have missed some going to security, but I don't I doubt it and what is your timetable for $60,188? Any implications that would have for [Treasure Island]?","Richard Adkerson","We are in the process of completing Davy Jones number 2 right now and the West Blackbeard, while you referenced would be the subsequent on operation on a completion for that.","Assuming the Davy Jones operation goes as planned, we should be completed with Davy Jones in the second quarter be moving along to the West Blackbeard completion, which would be our third quarter completion there.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Okay. Can you give us more color on what exactly you are doing? Why you think this is going to be different than Davy 1. I know, Davy wasn't completely wasn't stayed all the way to the bottom this well is, et, cetera et, cetera, so would you give us more information, so you can send that.","Richard Adkerson","Right. It's hard to more information on what we are doing differently. Now, we hope the reservoir performs differently and the relationship between the drilling fluids and the reservoir as they will become the impediment that we think happened to Davy Jones 1 as well as we are operating at a much better environment with twice the whole size and more standardized equipment.","We have drilled a lot of wells here since we drilled Davy Jones 1, we heard a lot of things. There were some things we still don't know. The one thing on the Davy Jones 2 that it was the deepest wells [stratigraphicly] we drilled today and that was before we had the sophisticated logging tools. We don't have as much diagnostic information as we like here on the Lomond well on cores and logs and so forth, but drilling the Lomond well and having have a lot of closed sands in the Cretaceous and also the well cost itself on most of our completion process. You are going to get our best efforts. There is no guarantees or expectations of change other than we are going to try as hard as we can.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Okay, so the timetable is second quarter, then, for any kind of testing, or what?","Richard Adkerson","If everything goes as planned, that's correct. Its all subject to change in weather and operational challenges.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Okay. Now, as far as what you know so for from Lomond North, do you plan to be buying more or being active again in the next presales or have you got everything on your plate as you want?","Richard Adkerson","We would never comment on that, Joan, as part of strategic reason and so forth and what we are going to do or not do. We are going to react appropriately to create value for you as our shareholder and everyone else and we have a tremendous acreage right here at Lomond that has a lot of drilling to do and a fantastic reservoir. So its getting a lot of attention here early on.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Okay, would it be fair for us to assume that as far as the shallow water is concerned, there will be no drilling in the future and that it will all be onshore?","Richard Adkerson","I wouldn't make that assumption, Joan. I really wouldn't and probably we need to move on to some other questions at this point in time. So stay in touch. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question will comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Thank you for the presentation and good results. On your slide 34, the long term Grasberg profile, in 2017 you forecast 900 million pounds of copper and a million ounces of gold. Presumably, that's after the open pit mining has concluded. Do you expect to produce that from the Block Cave in 2017 or will part of it be from the IOZ separately and from stockpiled open pit ores carrying over? It's quite remarkable that you are avoiding a bigger down dip.","Richard Adkerson","Yes. John, you are remembering past year is where we did show a much bigger down dip. One thing that's happened, our continuing exploration delineation, the IOZ was the older mines. It went to the DOZ, the deep ore zone. All this is a continuation of block caving that started really back in early 80s. We have all an extension of the DOZ, causes the deep MLZ which we are targeting to drill around in 2015 and that mine's early years had some very good grades of copper and gold. So that has really helped us mitigate the impact of the transition from the pit to the Grasberg Block Cave which lies underneath the pit which we can't start mining until we get out of the pit because of substrata. So that will ramp up but won't provide much in the way that 2017 will include DOZ March, even if there is a deep MLZ and some stockpiles from the pit that we will have.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Thank you, and if I can ask you a second question. On the slide 33, the oil and gas hedging, those are puts and swaps. So there is nothing that caps the upside or is there?","Jim Flores","John, the swaps do. That's obviously a fixed contract. But the puts do not.","Kathleen Quirk","And swaps are just on the natural gas.","Jim Flores","The natural gas, John.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Thank you.","Jim Flores","Okay. Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Hi, everyone. A question on the Gresik smelter. What is the maximum amount of copper concentrate that people can send to that smelter? Particularly, is there any rule that limits the amount that your competitor can send to that smelter?","Richard Adkerson","Well, you know the sales of concentrate to that smelter are like they are under the rest of the global industry. They are on the basis of a sales contracts. So the smelter has a capacity of about 1.2 million tons of concentrate. Currently we supply about 90% of that, I believe, and so going forward it depends on how those contracts play out. There is no regulations that govern that. That's strictly commercial negotiations between, PTFI and PT Smelting. We are part owner in PT Smelting and the other Indonesian copper producer has been providing some concentrates there, but there's nothing that legally gives anybody rights or roadblocks providing that. It's strictly driven by the smelter's capacity and its [existing].","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Understood. Have you already informed your customers that you might not be able to supply copper concentrate?","Richard Adkerson","Well, we have active communications with our customers. Several things are going on in the smelting business right now, think about the sound from the storm, so we have always been able to work cooperatively with our with our customers with the timing of shipments and so forth we don't have a real short-term issue of problems to deal with.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. One question for Jim, actually I was hoping you could provide fourth quarter production rate at Marlin, Horn Mountain and Holstein?","Jim Bob Moffett","Fourth quarter production added more than that in Holstein.","Richard Adkerson","I will tell you what, why don't you just follow up with David on that?","Jim Bob Moffett","Yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citi","Thank you. Good morning. I have got a couple of questions. First is, Richards, just for clarification, so in terms of delays in the export, is that having impact now and if not, when could it start impact if you don't get your resolution.","Richard Adkerson","Well, it's having an impact now in essence that because of these new regulation and the fact that the full regulatory team has not been finished and communicated. We are currently not exporting.","We had some ships that loaded early in January that had permit to carry it open 2013, so we have had shipments. On that basis, we have shipments to PT Smelting. We have timed everything to give us some working room here as we deal with this issue, so over time, the ultimate event that would start requiring to do more significant scale backs would be not having space to store the concentrate that we produce.","Brian Yu - Citi","Got it. Second question on different topic is [somewhere] gas business in terms of cost guidance for 2014. You know, it has gone up to $20 per BOE, and I was wondering if you guys would give us a breakdown, maybe by the four regions. Is there any particular one that's for the increase or is this more of the greater output from California inherently is good margins, but also higher costs.","Richard Adkerson","No, Brian. It's a good catch. I mean, I am not to bring that up. Our actual costs are $17 barrel, but when you shut-in Marlin, which is 30,000 a day for 90 days. It has a dramatic effect on the over all. It kicks our overall company-wide cost up to $20 a barrel.","Next year, we think our cost is going to be somewhere in the $18 barrel. Again, that is absorbing shut-in at Holstein, which is about 16,000 barrels a day or Horn Mountain, which is another 14,000 barrels a day, so that gives you the artificial inflation to our cost, the $20 barrel for this year and $18 barrel next year and you will see our cost go down towards $15 a barrel in 2016 just because we won't be suffering those shut-ins. So, there is no movement cost other than those shut-ins. I appreciate you brining that up.","Brian Yu - Citi","Okay. It should be tracking at 17 in the first half and then increase in Fungurume. The (Inaudible). Is that shut-in?","Richard Adkerson","Yes. Then that's going to change as dependent - we are planning a nine day shut-in, if weather goes our way and things happen where we should know it's a couple of weeks earlier, that all has a dramatic there. So we hope that's a number that its an outside number.","Brian Yu - Citi","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Daniel Rohr with Morningstar.","Daniel Rohr - Morningstar","Thanks a lot. Richard, I was hoping you could update us on your current thoughts regarding medium term Chinese copper demand? You touched on briefly in your introductory remarks, the changing composition of Chinese GDP. Curious as to what you think that means for Chinese copper demand growth over the next five years?","Richard Adkerson","So we continue to be very optimistic about China. In the global copper markets are tight, in China you can see that with premiums that are paid with falling exchange stocks around the world, just how dramatically they fall. In China you do have this copper that's in the bonded warehouses that are off-exchanges. So depending on how that goes, depending on how these financing deals go, but when you look at the performance of the economy in China, even though there's some slowdown, the size of the economy is growing to the extent that the somewhat lower percentages still translate into very substantial amounts of copper demand. So we are optimistic about it. We are also realistic to know that there could be changes depending on how the manage the inventories, how these financing transactions work and just how their whole activities go but we are optimistic about it. And as I said, I think in general, that market is much more optimistic about it than they were a year ago.","Daniel Rohr - Morningstar","So do you see the main growth drivers from an end-use perspective shifting over the next several years or is still going to be mainly infrastructure, mainly construction providing that incremental demand?","Richard Adkerson","It's clearly shifting. I mean China's automobile production is way up. I mean, way up. The things for consumers. air conditioners and the like are up. But at the same time, for that, China has going to have to continue to develop infrastructure to deal with the underdeveloped large population they have on the interior. So China has the financial resources to do that. So it will be a combination of increasingly important internal consumer base economy as well as continued infrastructure development.","Daniel Rohr - Morningstar","Thanks for your thoughts on that. I appreciate it.","Jim Bob Moffett","I have few comments on exploration. It's Jim Bob. We hear of some of these increases in our CapEx because we have more opportunities that we have been seeing over deepwater (inaudible) that we acquired. A lot of work has been done on those deepwater platforms. The substrate has not been explored. It hadn't even focused on it. So we are finding prospects on those deepwater platforms that are out there. And the prospects that we see as a result of this will cause cost inflation. Opens up to whole (inaudible), and it won't change the impact to the Lomond well. The Lomond well has been drilled onshore between the Tuscaloosa trend and Baton Rouge and we have wells to drill on the coast. The entire 100 mile square area (inaudible). And when you think about our exploration, in the minerals business, our exploration is all brown field because we have got big ore bodies that have not been drilled and as part of the deal. So when you look at that and we have a few green field (inaudible), intercepts. So our story is so big, based on current production but remember, we have a big production and we also have a big growth story and as we have the best prospects in the minerals business. The best place to find ore is underneath. They are the best cost base in deepwater, the best site to find ore, gas, oil and gas, and that's becoming true. The Lomond well, had (Inaudible) recent trend is right to understand that we saw in deepwater. We are able to (Inaudible) getting started, so that's why I wanted to comment on the flexible grade, but our exploration is doing well. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","All right Thanks, Jim Bob. Thanks to everyone for participating in our call. We will be keeping you informed as all of these things progress. I would just echo what Jim Bob said.","We got a great company, great team here, great assets, great growth opportunities and we look forward to (Inaudible) diligently to create values for you, our shareholders.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. We also have several slides to supplement our comments this morning, and we\u2019ll be referring to the slides during the call. The slides are also accessible using the webcast link on fcx.com.","In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments today, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson; President and Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is here, Mark Johnson and David Thornton have also joined us this morning.","I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing the financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported fourth quarter 2012 net income attributable to common stock of $743 million or $0.78 per share, compared with $640 million or $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter 2012, net income included net credits totaling $40 million or $0.04 a share associated with adjustments to environmental obligations and related litigation reserves, a gain for insurance recoveries, partly offset by charges for new labor agreements in South America, and for costs associated with the pending transactions with Plains Exploration and McMoRan.","Our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated copper sales of 972 million pounds were higher than our estimates of 930 million pounds primarily reflecting higher production from our Americas operations. Fourth quarter 2012 consolidated gold sales of 254,000 ounces and molybdenum sales of 21 million pounds approximated our October 2012 estimates of 255,000 ounces and 20 million pounds of molybdenum.","Our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated copper and gold sales were higher than fourth quarter 2011 sales of 823 million pounds of copper and 133,000 ounces of gold, primarily reflecting the impact in the fourth quarter of 2011 of the labor disruptions at PT Freeport Indonesia. Operations have improved during 2012 at PT Freeport Indonesia. Our sales for the year 2012 of copper totaled 3.65 billion pounds, 1 million ounces of gold, and 83 million pounds of molybdenum that compared to 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold, and 79 million pounds of molybdenum in the 2011 year.","As Richard will be discussing, we have got an outlook for growing production volumes in 2013 and beyond. Our realized copper price for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $3.60 that compared to a realized price of $3.42 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our gold realization averaged $1,681 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $1,656 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the molybdenum price in the fourth quarter of 2012 averaged $12.62 per pound compared with $15.08 per pound in the year ago quarter.","Our consolidated average unit net cash costs for the fourth quarter averaged a $1.54 per pound, it was slightly better than our estimates going into the quarter and lower than last years unit net cash cost of $1.57 per pound.","Our full year average unit net cash cost for 2012 was averaged $1.48 per pound, and again as we grow our production volumes we've got an outlook for declining unit cash costs in 2013 and beyond. The operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, which included net working capital sources of $122 million, and for the year, we generated $3.8 billion of operating cash flows, and that was net of working capital use of $1.4 billion. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $976 million bringing the annual capital expenditures to $3.5 billion in 2012. We ended the year with a cash position of $3.7 billion, which exceeded our total debt, which was $3.5 billion at year end 2012.","We also have included in the release, an update on our transactions that we announced on December 5, whereby FCX announced definitive agreements to acquire Plains Exploration & Production Company and McMoRan Exploration, the Plains per share consideration is equivalent to 0.6531 shares of FCX common stock and $25 in cash that works out to $3.4 billion in cash and 91 million shares of FCX common stock. The MMR per share consideration consist of $14.75 in cash, and 1.15 units of a royalty trust which will hold a 5% overriding royalty interest in future production from McMoRan\u2019s ultra-deep exploration prospects.","The completion of the transaction is subject to receipt of the Plains and McMoRan shareholders\u2019 approval, regulatory approvals, and other customary conditions.","In late December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period with respect to both transactions. We expect that the Plains and McMoRan shareholder meetings will be scheduled upon the effectiveness of the registrations filed with the SEC in late December, and we expect the transactions to close in the second quarter of 2013.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation on our website.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Thanks Kathleen. Good morning to everyone. I am going to start initially by focusing on our global mining business and on copper. 2012 was a year that was abnormal for us, and I want to try to explain why that occurred and what our outlook will be going forward beyond 2012. Later we will cover the transactions that Kathleen referred to that we announced on December 5, and respond to questions about those. After those transactions, I want to point out that 75% of our business will be represented by our global mining business and copper will continue to be the driver of our cash flows and profitability.","Looking at 2012, we executed on our efforts to grow production in North America and Africa, and I am going to come back to that, but we\u2019re having success in executing our growth plans and we have the prospects for very significant growth in copper volumes. By 2015, our plans would result in higher volumes consolidated for our company of greater than 35% than the volumes we had in 2012. 2012 was significantly affected by unusually ore grades in Indonesia and some of that came about as a result of the strike that we had in 2011 and the effect on productivity.","Looking back, these are the lowest grades that we\u2019ve had at Grasberg in 18 years. And we are looking to having higher grades in 2013 beginning near the end of the year, and beyond that, our profitability at Grasberg should be extraordinary. We\u2019re continuing to advance financially attractive Brownfield development projects, the Phase II project at Tenke Fungurume in the Democratic Republic of Congo is substantially complete on time and on budget, which is a significant accomplishment in relation to our initial project.","At our major expansion at Cerro Verde mine in Peru, we\u2019ve received approval of our environmental impact study, and we expect to begin construction in 2013, and we have begun construction of our expansion project at our flagship mine in Arizona, at Morenci. So, we are positioned for multi-year growth in copper volumes of significance.","When we look at the quarter, the quarter was one where we executed our plans. our consolidated volumes were slightly higher than we have given guidance for. Our unit net cash cost was 5% lower than our guidance. We achieved our targets for gold and molybdenum.","The cash cost, if we look at page six, it shows that in North America, we were right on line with what our guidance was going into the quarter. Red Conger, he and his team has done a great job in managing costs, achieving production volumes. Our unit cost were lower in South America, they were actually lower than anticipated in Indonesia, and in Africa, and overall at 154. Consolidated cost this year was lower than our guidance of 162. Our sales in North America, South America, and Africa, were higher than our outlook, as well as in Indonesia. But again, I want to come back to just why this was such an unusual year. And we want to focus on Grasberg as a reason for that.","We had very unusually low metal production in 2012, both compared with historical levels as you can see at the charts at the bottom for copper and gold and that resulted from lower grades in the Grasberg open pit.","This year we were mining at the upper reaches of that pit. We have included in our reference slides, schematics that we have shown for many years that show that. We are now beginning our final push backs for the open pit. We expect the pit to produce through 2016 and as we go forward beginning late in 2013 and 2014, our stripping requirements are going to drop dramatically and our volumes will increase and our profitability will increase.","We were also affected by slower than anticipated ramp-up of our underground DOZ mine, where panel repairs that we had following the inactivity relating to the strike are more extensive. We expect to get back to traditional levels. This mine has a capacity of roughly 80,000 tons per day. The current rate is 50,000 tons per day.","So because of mine sequencing, some adjustments because of geotechnical factors, we just had lower grades this year, and that resulted in having unit costs at Grasberg of $1.24, where we\u2019ve been averaging $0.13. We will have lower costs next year as we move into higher grades by the end of the year. And then going in the period through the remaining life of the open pit, we should be down to where our gold revenues will fully fund \u2013 more than fully fund our operating cost. So that had a lot to do with why 2012 was an abnormal year for us.","Now, looking at copper markets; copper is not currently at its all-time highs that we experienced in 2011, but considering the global economic situation, there is no way to say anything other than current price is very strong. And in today's world, we're seeing in our business, some degree of improvements in markets in the United States, in the Middle East. China shows promise this year for renewed growth, as they spend \u2013 as China spends on infrastructure and take steps to improve its economy. Construction in the U.S. is growing.","Automobiles have been strong, and the outlook is for continued strength. There\u2019s investments being made by power companies to invest in the grid. There's some short-term effect from the damage caused by hurricane Sandy, and overall in the U.S. our business and our customers are talking to us about an environment of not significant, but moderate growth. Europe, of course continues to be very weak. But in China, the market appears to be picking up from renewed investment in infrastructure.","The facts are that there are things that could cause variations in copper prices near-term because of inventory levels in China and there is always speculation about that. But underlying today's world is an improved outlook for the global economy based on where we were several months ago, and that should be good for our business. China of course remains the important demand driver. Global Exchange inventories remain relatively low. And underlying all this marketplace, which is in many ways unique for copper as a commodity is supply challenges.","We have talked for years about the impact on grades of aging mines, impacts on aging mechanical systems at mines developed in the past, the inferior quality of new development projects available to the industry. And around the world today, many companies are reducing capital and deferring projects and that should be supportive of the prices in the long run.","The strength of our company is the reserves and resources that we have available to us. Page 10 gives our report on our year-end reserves at the end of 2012 and we show proved and probable copper reserves based on mine plans at $2 a pound for copper of 116 billion pounds, and then our 3.42 billion pounds of molybdenum and 32.5 ounces for gold.","We\u2019ve had significant increases in our reserves since the acquisition of Phelps Dodge in 2007, over 46 billion pounds of copper. You can see in the chart that our reserves are essentially divided equally between North America, South America and Indonesia, and those reserves give us the opportunity for near-term and longer-term growth.","And beyond the reserves that we have on page 11 is a significant aspect of our company is, mineralized material that contains copper, not yet meeting the standards to be reported as proved and probable reserves, but at $2.20 copper price, this contained copper is over 100 billion pounds of incremental copper. And these resources, half of those are located in North America.","We have these near-term projects that are progressing, that should give us this really significant near-term increase in volumes, but what this provides us is the long-term opportunity for development project beyond those, and we will \u2013 we have not lost our enthusiasm about copper markets or our enthusiasm about developing these resources, and these should create really significant values for our shareholders, because they are not currently valued in our stock, and to the extent, we can create cash flow projects out of them, all of that will come to our shareholders.","Now we did not have reserves this year, but we\u2019ve continued an aggressive exploration program, and we have the potential for significant future increases in reserves. The exploration program is a matter of timing, it involves doing exploration drilling, metallurgical analysis, analysis of economic factors related to landholdings, availability of power and water and we continue to advance those. We have a tremendous opportunity with our El Abra property in Chile, where we have identified over the past five years a very large sulfide resource, and we are working to develop the feasibility of a major mill project there to supplement our current sulfide leaching project, our sulfide leaching projects. Other than that though we have both opportunities in the U.S. and in Africa with our Kisanfu, concession which is separate from Tenke Fungurume. But we are going to continue to target these with a view towards adding reserves, but more importantly we're looking for how we can advance these reserves and resources into projects.","Slide 13, shows the slide that we have been using for many years. It makes a couple of points, one of course Grasberg is there, it\u2019s the mine with the largest copper reserves in the world. It also has more gold reserves than any mine in the world. Its production is down this year typically near the top of the copper production chart, but we know the years when these mines were discovered. A point here is very rare to find a world-class copper mine and mines when they are found produce for decades. You see it in the industry since, over the past 10 years companies have been spending significant money for exploration, it's noteworthy that relatively few successes that have come about through exploration.","Then while we have significant resources, the facts are it takes time to convert those resources into development projects and producing mines, and it\u2019s just a nature of this business, I'll call it a double H short of the copper markets, that's the reason copper prices are high and are likely to remain strong because of that time, but with our company we have the opportunity through our near-term Brownfield development projects to add the significant volumes.","In North America at Morenci and beyond the current mill project that is now underway with construction, we have significant sulfide expansions that gives us a chance to look at our future large mill opportunity at Morenci. I'll mention El Abra, the Cerro Verde expansion is underway expected to begin construction in the next year.","Phase II at Tenke is complete, we have additional growth opportunities there with our oxide resource. There is a very significant mixed ore and sulfide resource for future expansion opportunities that we're doing exploration analysis, metallurgical work, processing work, and logistics work, to see how we could take advantage for and then Grasberg, beyond the open pit era, has decades of life in the underground that will result in it being a high volume low-cost operations for many years going forward.","Slide 15, shows the growth that we have on a consolidated basis, starting with 2012 we're looking for 20% growth in volumes next year, another 15% beyond 2014. And that should be sustainable; you can see that the chart at the top where this growth is coming from, it's from our global business. These Brownfield projects have significantly less risk and projects that are Greenfield in nature. The infrastructure development because you are operating in place already is much less, technology is proven. It results in efficient expenditure of capital, you get the benefits of scale as you expand and you understand the risk factor and they are just less significant. And that gives you higher returns of ground fill projects than other projects.","So again I want to just go back and think about 2012, where we got these kind of growth opportunities going forward for copper. In gold, we expect to have 40% higher gold volumes in 2013 coming out of Grasberg than before. We expect our unit costs and this will be coming into play later in 2013 to be down by 10% next year to go from the 150 level to 135. And then assuming continuation of current cost levels, we\u2019d see unit costs dropping in 2014, by say, another 20% to the $1.15, $1.20 level. That's consolidated basis heading towards \u00a35 billion with that kind of unit cost levels just shows what a great business. And that translates into higher operating cash flows, current prices; we would expect our operating cash flows to increase a third next year and 60% over 2012 by 2014.","The details of our Brownfield expansion projects on the next set of slides beginning with Morenci, where we\u2019re expanding our mill to 115,000 tons per day and our mining rate significantly to 900,000 tons. This is a $1.4 billion project at \u00a3225 million pounds and you can see the historical and perspective outlook from Morenci, which not too long ago was viewed as a end of life debt in asset, and now that generates significant current profits and significant growth going forward. Cerro Verde, we\u2019re going to be tripling the output of our mill there, completion result in this being the largest concentrating million operations in the world, increase mining rates, more capital $4.4 billion, but significant incremental production of \u00a3600 million per year with Moly alone. With that at this stage, we are more than halfway through our engineering work online to commence construction in 2013 and complete it in 2016.","I mentioned the success for our Phase II project at Tenke, where we\u2019re expanding our mill to 14,000 tons per day, increasing our mining rate adding Tenke\u2019s capacity $850 million of capital cost to get a \u00a3150 million of incremental copper, we\u2019re in effect complete with this project now, we have to \u2013 next year we\u2019ll be building our second sulphur burner there to provide sulphur for operations and we\u2019re already thinking about what our next expansion would be.","We\u2019ve announced today an acquisition of a cobalt refinery by the Tenke Fungurume in mining partners. Cobalt is a very small market; we\u2019re going to be producing a lot of cobalt. We were dealing with the issues of how to access that market in an efficient way. We needed to make an investment. We found this opportunity to purchase an existing facility and have acted on it. And this gives us an experienced management team and a direct access to end markets, similar in some ways to what (inaudible) did back many years ago in a way that they approach the molybdenum market with the investments that they made followed by Phelps Dodge, and that gives us an efficient access to downstream markets, and molybdenum this will do it for cobalt.","At Grasberg, we have made significant progress with the underground development and advancing this in an efficient way. It involves a significant amount of capital, but will be spent over a number of years. The Grasberg Block Cave will be prepared to start up in 2017; this is an extension of the current ore body we are mining in the pit. same ore body extending down where we will begin the mining in underground and we are also will be starting up expecting in 2015 an extension of our current DMLZ mine, which will have a capacity of 80,000 tons a day in 2021 and very attractive grade.","You can see that on the underground era that we will be mining an ore body that will give us significant metal volumes in relation to our historical metal volumes for both copper and gold. there\u2019s an interesting reference slide that we\u2019ve shown back in the back that shows our mine plant, and our share of metal production from 2013 to go forward. Let\u2019s see, we don\u2019t have a page number for that, in page 38, then you can see what we expect in 2013. And as we go forward in the years 2014 to 2016, this what attractive levels of copper volumes and gold volumes we will have as we complete mining to open pit with very limited stripping. There is a transition here in 2017, which is not a terrible year. It's much better than historically we were looking for as we will have the benefit of the DMLZ mine, some stockpiling material, and then from beyond that to 2017, 2021 back to metal and copper and gold that's consistent with historical levels for Grasberg.","So our outlook for 2013, on page 21 is 4.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold as I said 40% high year, lower unit cash cost. This will come into play I'll show you a slight in the minute later in the year particularly in the fourth quarter, our unit cost will be higher in the first quarter and this shows you we average down to $1.35, how low they are going to be beyond that at $3.65 copper. Our modeled operating cash flows would be approximately $7 billion and we're looking at capital expenditures of $4.6 billion.","Page 22 shows us growing copper sales production profile. It shows growing gold sales based on the Grasberg mine plant and our molybdenum sales with taking into account our recently restored at Climax mine. Quarterly production that I referred to early is on page 23 showing that the first quarter this is like the old-dated Grasberg and we seem to have this every year, but we have a lower in the first quarter with a really strong second half of the year particularly in the fourth quarter you can see looking at over 500,000 ounces of gold sales in the fourth quarter based on our reaching to higher grade sections of the mine.","Our sales by region are shown on page 24, showing growth in North America, South America, recovery significantly in Indonesia and growth in Africa. And that will result in the unit cost improvement that I refer to earlier, this shows at the bottom of the page 2013 consolidated unit cost going from $1.48 to a projected $1.35, based on $3.65 copper, $1700 gold, $11 molybdenum and $12 cobalt. And as I said this will be very significantly by quarter and this shows a reconciliation of how we go on page 26, from $1.48 to $1.35. It also shows that if we had the 2014 Grasberg volumes, our cost would go down to $1.15 and that\u2019s assuming today's cost levels stay the same.","27 shows the impact of growth on our business, the solid green and gold portions of the chart show what our averages are expected to be for 2013 and 2014 were ranging from $3 to $4 of copper prices are, EBITDA would range from $7 billion to $11 billion and cash flows from $5 billion to $8 billion. As I said roughly $7 billion at current copper prices for that period, then adding in our growth that would occur from our volumes in 2015 to 2016, you can see the very significant increases of roughly 50% with EBITDA ranging from $11 billion to $16 billion and operating cash flows from $8 billion to $11 billion. So the effective growth in the mining business is significant. The sensitivities to prices and certain input cost are included on page 28 for your information. Our exploration spending continues to be aggressive as we show on page 29 with our budget for 2013 of $235 million focusing on Brownfield opportunities around the world. We have some investments in Greenfield and if that\u2019s successful that would be great, but our opportunities are really significant with our Brownfield expansions.","Capital expenditures on page 30 are projected for $4.6 billion for 2013. As we complete our major project during the next three years, those capital expenditures will be dropping. We\u2019re working hard to come up with new projects to supplement those on a going forward basis to take advantage of our reserve and resource position. So that\u2019s the summary of our existing global mining business and our opportunities in copper industry.","We announced on December 5 transactions to acquire Plains Exploration and McMoRan. The board\u2019s decision to invest in these assets is explained in great detail in a filing we made with the SEC on From S4 right at the end of December and I will encourage you to spend some time looking at that document. It describe the process the Board followed in considering the deal and in negotiating the terms of the transaction because of the related party situation involving the three companies FCX at a special committee of independent and unaffiliated directors who consider this transaction and negotiated the terms.","The Boards\u2019 decision was driven by its positive long-term global economic outlook. Our Board is real believers in the outlook for commodities, including the commodities in our mining business and the outlook for the oil and gas business. Board was faced with the situation that I referred to earlier about limited opportunities to invest in copper beyond our Brownfield expansions. Over the years, we\u2019ve been tracking opportunities to invest outside the company in M&A transactions in the mining business and have not found opportunities that were attractive to us, and these transactions were provided with the opportunities to acquire high quality assets in the oil and gas industry, in the industry that our Board and management teams has had experience in, where we understand the risk and opportunities associated with that business. Near term cash flows of these assets are going to be driven by crude oil revenues and crude oil is a commodity that closely correlated to copper. So this is something that\u2019s consistent with our view about the global economic outlook.","The assets have current production that generates strong margins and cash flows. We anticipate following in a disciplined business plan to use the current cash flows of the oil and gas business that we\u2019re acquiring to fund its exploration, development capital expenditures, those assets provide financially attractive near-term and long-term growth opportunities. It provides geographic diversification and exposure to other commodities. It also gives us enhanced exposure to exploration particularly in the McMoRan situation through its ultra-deep gas drilling program, but also with the Plains assets, particularly in the deepwater where they have multiple high-quality exploration targets.","In addition to this exposure to all market through McMoRan\u2019s explorations, Plains position in the Haynesville Shale that will give the company an important position in the U.S. natural gas market for the long-term. It\u2019s not driving current cash flows or economics, but that business potentially has various significant values to our shareholder, and it will give us a chance to achieve long-term returns to shareholders.","The combined companies have the management capabilities to execute a disciplined business plan. We\u2019re going to be \u2013 we took advantage or taking advantage of low-cost debt financing to fund the cash portion of this transaction, and we\u2019re going to be committed to a disciplined approach to delevering the debt that we\u2019ll be taking home.","You can see on slide 32 at the bottom that, we\u2019ll go from a mining company to a company of where mining represents roughly three quarters of our business from an EBITDA standpoint and oil and gas 25%, and we\u2019ll go from a situation of where North America, the U.S. currently represents about 30% of our business to 50% of our business, credit rating agencies consider this positive in terms of maintaining our investment grade credit rating.","Slide 33 shows what our pro forma combined EBITDA and operating cash flows will be. The solid sections of these charts, the green and red sections present the combined 2013, 2014 outlook, and then the growth from both the mining business, and the oil and gas business is represented in the dotted lines above that. You can see this is similar to what we saw with just our mining business on a standalone basis. And one of the attractive things here is looking at the growth opportunities in oil and gas is complementary to the growth that we have in the mining business and gives us a chance to have significant growth.","Now slide 34 presents the way we are going to be focused in running our business. We're going to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit profile. We\u2019ve had a long track record of doing this, generating values for shareholders, of managing our balance sheet in a disciplined way. As we talk, we are in the market right now with our bank deals, and as we talk with the banks and the credit rating agencies, everyone is positive about the way we managed the debt in the Phelps Dodge transaction in 2007 and how we dealt with the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. We're going to continue to do that.","We have developed assets at Grasberg, at Tenke Fungurume, in a very aggressive and disciplined way. We\u2019ve taken advantage of opportunities provided by Phelps Dodge in 2007 to achieve asset in geographical diversity and then taking advantage of markets to develop assets to \u2013 that created significant values for our share holders. These assets will provide us an opportunity to enhance long-term returns for shareholders and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be focused on.","I\u2019ll just point out our executive management teams have significant shareholders in FCX and we\u2019re committed to creating values in those shares, but we\u2019re going to be sensitive to risk, we\u2019re going to do rigorous economic analysis for making investments. We\u2019re going to protect our downside and get leveraged to the upside. We\u2019re going to prioritize and rank opportunities to invest in those with the highest returns as we mange risk and we look at our overall portfolio. We\u2019re going to limit the number of projects we look at. We\u2019re going to be really committed to this deleveraging program.","We\u2019ll begin the process with roughly $20 billion of gross debt, $16 billion of net debt, our plan will not be to come back to zero net debt as we are right now, but to reduce our debt to a targeted level. We\u2019re thinking now of roughly $12 billion. After reaching that we would be back in a position to invest in our growth projects, but given continuation of attractive commodity prices, we would have excess cash that would allow us to return cash to shareholders through higher dividends and potentially stock buybacks.","In the mean time, we\u2019re going to be continuing our current dividend rate at a $1.25 a share, and we\u2019re going to be committed to this long-standing tradition of Freeport of maximizing value for shareholders and managing the risk of our business.","So with that, Jim Bob\u2019s is here with me and our management team to respond to questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning.","Richard C. Adkerson","Hello Sal.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Hi, Sal.","","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just quick question on the \u2013 couple of questions, first on the slide about the 2015 copper production. Does that include Morenci\u2019s full production rate of 600 million pounds in there?","Kathleen L. Quirk","","Yes, it does. Sal, we expect to get to full rates at Morenci in 2014.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. So you expect that to be \u2013 because I think you said that the growth will come in \u2013 by \u2013 the project will finish by 2016, but do you think it will be ready by 2014 in terms of production?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Morenci will be 2014, the Cerro Verde will be\u2026","","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I am sorry, I meant Cerro Verde. I am sorry.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Okay, It\u2019s got some, Cerro Verde in 2015, but it reaches full production in 2016.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And there is modest change in your CapEx outlook in between the major mining projects and other projects, a couple of hundred million dollars, anything particular to note here? The mix is different than what it was in Q3.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yes, it\u2019s slightly different. We had some carryover sustaining projects that we didn\u2019t spend in 2012. Our CapEx in 2012 was slightly below what we thought we carried over some projects into 2013, but no material changes, just some slight timing variations.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Thanks, Sal.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tony with Dahlman Rose.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Hi all.","Richard C. Adkerson","Hi, Tony.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Hi, Richard. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions here. I was wondering if you could update us a little bit with the contract of work review and just the process there and the timing again of the presidential election?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. The presidential election occurs in 2014, and the first round is midyear in 2014. this month begins the process also of electing a new governor in Papua. And so, Tony, 2013 and 2014 -- in 2013, a number of provincial elections will be held in Indonesia and the presidential and parliamentary elections will occur in 2014. We began a process in a formal way, a little over a year ago and talking with the government about getting our extension for our contract for those of you who don\u2019t follow us that closely. We operate under contract of work in Indonesia, and we signed the most recent contract in 1991. It has a 30-year primary term, and the contract itself provides us the right to extend it for two ten-year periods through 2041, and we have to apply for that. The government cannot unreasonably withhold or delay granting that extension. Indonesia passed a new mining law and the country has undertaken review of all contract of works including ours, and what our discussions involved is a discussion around this review of contracts, obtaining the extension for our existing contract, and we are working cooperatively with the government to find ways of being responsive to certain of the aspirations of people and government and the population in Indonesia and protecting the interest of our shareholder by getting our extensions on a way that protects the values of our operations there.","Confident we will be able to get that. The election and political situation in Indonesia requires time to go through the process, and that's what we are doing now, and we have made what I feel is a good progress and I am confident that we will be able to resolve this on a way that our shareholders will be happy with and that the government of Indonesia will also find acceptable.","James R. Moffett","Let me add one thing for Tony. On a normal circumstance, if we didn't have this massive underground project underway, $15 billion project, some in the government would say that we should only ask an extension two years before our contract expires which will be 2019. But with that spending, as you\u2019ve seen from our spending charts, $15 billion over the next number of years to get to full production with the underground. We went with the idea that you have to have certainty and the government agreed, so that's just another wrinkle that caused us to have to deal with this in a business way, and we\u2019re getting support from the government.","But under normal circumstance, some in the government would say, you should wait two years before your contract expires, so that\u2019s just a wrinkle that we need to be sure and point out.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Has it changed in any way the dialog that you guys are having with the government there given the plans to acquire these energy companies?","Richard C. Adkerson","","No, no.","James R. Moffett","I\u2019m not even sure they are aware of it Tony.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","","Okay.","James R. Moffett","","They are focused on our business.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Okay.","Mark J. Johnson","And I\u2019ve had discussions with number of \u2013 they read the news releases in the papers and so forth, but it was like when we acquired Phelps Dodge, they were interested in it. We made the point that that gave us a lot more global resources that we could apply to bear in running our business. Of course, Indonesia is a significant oil producer, but it\u2019s not a factor in our discussion.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","Okay. And the other question I have is one on the copper market, Richard you made some comments that there is always uncertainty surrounding Chinese inventories and I was wondering if you did have any more specific thoughts on the level of bonded warehouse stocks there, and how you think this may potentially impact Chinese imports in 2013. Obviously Chinese imports have been so substantial to the market and just wondering any additional thoughts you may have there.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Well, I wanted to comment on it because it is a factor. And I didn\u2019t \u2013 well we see these emerging more positive views about the markets, and certainly today as I talk to people -- to our commercial people, to others involved in China, the view about China is more positive than it was say at LME week last fall. But well the copper market, Tony, as you know more better than anybody is a really pretty visible global market place, the one aspect that has less visibility is this issue about off-exchange inventories in China, and there are currently different views about the level of those inventories. Our people tend to believe that those inventories are not liquid like exchange inventories, but we have seen instances in the past of where the Chinese have adjusted buying patterns, and that\u2019s the factor that could occur. When that happens, I\u2019ve always looked underneath that to see what\u2019s going on in the fundamental economy, because actions on buying patterns tend to be temporary and the underlying economy is really what\u2019s going to drive the copper price long run, but I felt that I needed to mention that because those inventories are significant, and the question is, the degree of liquidity and how they come into play in affecting imports.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","That\u2019s great; I appreciate it Richard and Jim Bob too for your insight as well.","James R. Moffett","","Tonly, on the double edge sort of copper prices that Rich was talking about, I think it\u2019s important to bring up at this point, the extensive list of projects that are either being delayed or canceled in all of the mine basins, and of course this is because the commodity prices have gone up so rapidly, but unfortunately as these mines are developed, the cost of development whether you are talking about mining equipment, trucks, all the metal that is used to, the greenfield projects actually, all of you are aware that some of these costs have gone up double and triple, and people are just walking away from the projects, delaying them (indiscernible).","Extensive list, 30 to 40 of these, what does that mean? That means that those projects have been put into people\u2019s long-term projections of supply demand for copper. those projects are not going to happen and that\u2019s exactly why our Greenfield projects have been, it\u2019s harder than the Brownfield.","And the Brownfield, as Richard said, we already have the existing infrastructure. so we have a whole way to look at cost, and have an idea of what it\u2019s going to cost to make the expansions, but going into the Greenfield area, new country, new infrastructure maybe of lack of infrastructure. So those projects are not going to get finished that people were counting on for supply demand are going to have a huge impact on the price of Copper. So that\u2019s why we on a long-term view, the copper has been very positive because of lack of new projects coming on will drive the price of copper higher, which benefits our very active program over the last six years since the -- six, seven years since the acquisition of Phelps Dodge.","Anthony Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co.","","Thanks, Jim Bob.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS Securities.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Good morning. I have two questions, just on Grasberg, you\u2019ve talked about getting back to full rates at DOZ later in the year. should we think of operating rate there sort of 200,000 tons per day versus 165,000, is that kind of a ballpark way to think about it or are we going to get all the way back the open-pit to call it 150,000 tons and then get sort of 70,000 tons out of the underground over the year?","Richard C. Adkerson","Brian, I\u2019ll let Mark Johnson who is our Chief Operating Officer for Grasberg talk to you about that.","Mark J. Johnson","","Brian, I think you\u2019re referring to total mill rates and\u2026","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","","Yes.","Mark J. Johnson","","And what we will be doing is what\u2019s been discussed is that DOZ will get back up to 80,000 tons a day by the fourth quarter. We\u2019re going through, as Rich described, a process of repairing some panels that were damaged. Those repairs will be done by the end of the third quarter and DOZ will be back at that 80,000 tons a day.","The total mill rate is variable. It\u2019s very much driven by the material types that we get out of the Grasberg. Some of the material that we would be mining in 2013 is a bit harder. Total mill throughput drops as a result of that. But the mill is running at full production, we\u2019re not cutting back on mill rates. We are essentially milling every ton we can. And we\u2019ll average about 210,000 tons a day in 2013. Towards the end of the year, we will be into the very high-grade stock worth of Grasberg, that material is typically very good milling material also. We\u2019ll get higher throughput, higher recovery, I think can\u2019t grade. So this year things will just continue to get better from the first quarter all the way through the fourth quarter.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","","All right. Thank you, that\u2019s very, very helpful. The other question, I just wanted to check, just for your guidance for cost on Tenke for the year, I mean I see they are coming down, but the copper production is going up. Are those costs before the OMG deal i.e. crediting at the 60% of the cobalt price, or is it post the OMG deal, where I assume you\u2019ll ultimately credit default cobalt price that you realize?","Kathleen L. Quirk","The guidance that we\u2019ve given Brian does not include the benefits of the higher cobalt price that we will receive.","The partnership that is acquiring the assets are the same partners that are in Tenke Fungurume, but Tenke Fungurume is not acquiring, Tenke Fungurume will continue to sell cobalt hydroxide at market, and then this joint venture will actually own the refinery. But in terms of the numbers that you\u2019ve seen that includes continuing to sell cobalt the same way we have been in the past.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","So will have like a new subsection in the financials showing that whole thing like you do for downstream copper, is that the way it is going to come out or is it going to be all embedded in the Tenke subfinancials, if I look at it that way?","Kathleen L. Quirk","","It will probably be separate in terms of because of -- actually the Tenke operation doesn\u2019t own a refinery. But we\u2019ll make it, so that you understand the values that we are getting from the refinery.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hi, guys, two questions on Grasberg. First, I thought the total mill rate in fourth quarter was sequentially down, it\u2019s down also because of the harder or is that Mark just described?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yes.","Richard C. Adkerson","That\u2019 right.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And the second, your labor contract actually both Grasberg and Tenke expire this year, have you had any conversations yet with the labor unions?","Richard C. Adkerson","We have ongoing conversations with the unions, and it\u2019s different situations in kind of all the places that we operate. In Africa, we\u2019ve had very positive relationships and have not had any controversy over union situations. We had a very difficult situation, which was really our first time to encounter this in 2011 with the labor union and PTFI. We\u2019ve made progress in working with the workforce, with the union workers, and non-union workers, staff, which was major problems for us at the beginning of the year and affected our operations and worker productivity.","We still have the issues to deal with, and we are working to achieve that. In our discussions with the union today, both sides have expressed a view of working to avoid a strike, but that is something that we'll have to deal with. In Indonesia, by law, contacts only last for two years. And so that's something that we'll have to deal with the labor issues or have become a issue throughout Indonesia today. And the government is concerned about it and we're working our way through that, but that's something that we\u2019re just going to have to report to you as we go along.","And I'm glad that you asked the question, because as Mark was responding to Brian, I think this is important to keep in mind, that these opportunities are what the ore body gives us, and we're going to have to work to achieve relationship with our unions to be able to take advantage of them in the way that the ore body provides us.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","These are being incremental color. Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Richard C. Adkerson","Good morning, Oscar.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, Richard. So, focusing on Grasberg points one more time, interested in the capital expenditures that you have over the next five years and beyond. On a 100% basis, you\u2019re spending $5.5 billion about half of that for the next five years. When do you spend the balance and which was that? Is that part of the underground development towards 2020 or those at all?","Richard C. Adkerson","Actually it is \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of underground development is that, you have a continuing expenditure of capital as you advance the block caving operation. So unlike a big open pit in mill facilities, you have a one-time finance flow to capital and then you just have maintenance capital as you go forward.","With underground development, there is ongoing expenditures to advance the block cave and that\u2019s going to be part of our capital as we go forward. And I think, Kathleen, you have a comment, she is looking at\u2026","Kathleen L. Quirk","No, I think that\u2019s right. And we\u2019ve given what we expect to average, some years will be higher than the average, some years lower than the average. But as Richard said, it\u2019s a long-term development plan, so it\u2019s not any one-year where you\u2019ve got all the expenditures. It occurs over the course of a long-term development of the asset.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I\u2019m sorry that sustaining capital of about $500 million would be ongoing, that is what I\u2019m trying to get at?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah, that\u2019s right. And what you call a sustaining capital or investing capital is, that\u2019s the nature of underground investment. Jim Bob referred this earlier, this is a big number for Indonesia and particularly for Papua. I mean you\u2019re talking maybe $15 billion investment in a country that\u2019s looking to get investments. We have a workforce of 23,000 people there including employees and contractors. We are more than 90% of the economy of the Mimika region where we are located two and a half and two-thirds of the economy of Papua which is really important to the government of Indonesia. We support businesses and infrastructure development and so forth. So as you think about this labor issues and these contract issues, that\u2019s the context of where we\u2019re operating. It\u2019s important for our shareholders to support for Indonesia.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Absolutely.","James R. Moffett","This is Jim Bob. Let me add a couple of things. There is a standoff here when you go underground. You have to continue to spend these big dollars to advance the underground or you have to remember is, remember the follows that we\u2019ve worked with (inaudible) on those transactions (inaudible) referenced that. When you are in the open pitch of your mining ore, which you\u2019re mining waste transition this year we\u2019re up at the very top of the pit where we actually stream \u2013 platform of the open pit when you go in the underground, because of the Block Caving messages that you don\u2019t deal with the waste. Your ore basically \u2013 it\u2019s been altered by dry gases when the ore body is put in place.","The reason why Block Caving (inaudible) when you are Block Caving, it doesn\u2019t cave or drop. So you go from a huge open pit operation where you expose to the elements for current pit charge operating 24 hours a day. When you go underground or your mining is the ore itself, because that\u2019s why Block Caving weren\u2019t (inaudible) important for people to understand. That\u2019s why your operating cost don\u2019t go up. When you go underground some people have the feeling, Oil Company more especially go underground but you don\u2019t spend on waste. And remember, when you hold this waste you have to separate the waste, and you have to keep repeating it back, because you can\u2019t get the angle of the pit to how you have the pit falls sale on you. So all that waste that we\u2019ve been dealing with since we started the open pit disappears, because you\u2019re underground and your very law changing over. I hope that\u2019s understandable.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Jim Bob. That leads to me nice into second part of my question. So you are expecting cost at Grasberg to decline to about a $1.15 a pound. I was wondering if you can put into context what you expect for 2014, 2015 and as you replete the open pit, because without any stripping and in the higher gold production, because those can\u2019t really low, but then more importantly how did you expect it\u2026?","Richard C. Adkerson","Let me just make sure, I\u2019d say something, that $1.15 was consolidated, not at Grasberg.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson","The $1.15 going from a $1.48, $1.35 to I\u2019d say, $1.15, $1.20 is consolidated. In that context, Grasberg goes back to being as I said, a situation of where \u2013 let\u2019s say beginning in the fourth quarter of next year and through the life of the open pit, where the gold revenues were totally fund and perhaps more than fund the operating costs.","So Grasberg costs will go to zero or below, which is what we\u2019ve had in some years in the past. But for years, we\u2019ve been talking about the situation as we get to the end of the open pit, where you\u2019re stripping drops off dramatically. You\u2019re down in the lower elevations of the pit where the higher grades are. We\u2019ll be retiring equipment and reducing workforce and cost will go down and volumes will go up, and that's a good direction to go in.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And that\u2019s\u2026","James R. Moffett","And that's important to use as the reference slides. If you look at the reference slides that shows where we're going to getting the oil in the year 2013, you see we start up at the very top of the pit, at the extreme limits of the push-backs. By the time we hit to the bottom of the pit, (inaudible) and that's a good indication, because that's basically once you\u2019re going to be mining when you get underground. So if you can take what you have at the end of 2013, and imagine as you go and stay in that ring of gold at the bottom of the pit, which is really \u2013 which are going to be block-cave and once you learn, as averages says it's just a precursor of what's going to come in terms of the gold grades and the copper grades and that's what make the Grasberg, the King of the Mines.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely, I'm sorry Richard, I misspoke, but I\u2019m just interested in hearing you what the cost in Grasberg you expect one of the mine goes completely underground. So you have 2013, $0.68 a pound?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Oscar, as we approach at the end of the life of the pit, we\u2019ll be in a net credit position in terms of, as I said the gold revenues will more than offset the total cost of production, as we get into the underground era and get ramped up. We expect the unit net cash cost net of credit at current gold prices to be below $0.30 a pound.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, well thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","That's based on today\u2019s input cost levels and everything else. So below $0.30 a pound driven by what happens to input cost in \u2013 those are large part correlated to copper prices and gold prices. So it\u2019s still world-class in every respect.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, absolutely. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay, Oscar. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Good morning, everybody. My question was just following up on the update that you have for your resource estimates, what you referred to as your mineralized material, I did notice that you recently upped the cutoff grade for copper prices to be $2.20 per pound, historically you used a quarter about $2 per pound cutoff, but we have not seen an incremental increase in the resource there. And I was just wondering if you could comment as to, is that because you are now expecting slightly higher operating costs for those potential mineralized resources. And at what point do you think we\u2019re going to start seeing additive or conversion of those mineralized materials to actually proven and probable as this has been a theme you\u2019ve been talking about for few years? Thank you.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Jorge, on the first part of the question, we used the same pricing this year that we used last year on our reserves, it was $2 and on the mineralized material $2.20, so that\u2019s consistent with what you have seen in the prior year.","Richard C. Adkerson","And years too, I mean it has been more than just past year.","Kathleen L. Quirk","","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson","And then Jorge, that slide that we showed for the near-term reserve additions potentially can come from with a big element from El Abra and others, that\u2019s doing exactly what you\u2019re talking about, that\u2019s looking at those resources and doing the work that it takes to get it to reserves and essentially what that requires is feasibility study. We have to be able to demonstrate that we can come up. We know the resources are there, they have been identified through our drilling, core drilling, and now the process of converting them to reserves required that you look at the mine plant, access to power, and water which is critical. In Northern Chile of course, this size of processing facilities, the cost, how you deal with metallurgy and processing and all of those factors and those are major things that require time to work on. So that\u2019s really\u2026","James R. Moffett","","It\u2019s Jim Bob. Most important thing in the metallurgical area is that we have scarcity of data, mineralized versus resources means what kind of spacing, do you have on your drilling? And in some of these metallurgical areas it\u2019s just a matter, going out and drilling, increasing our spacing, and we go ahead, we may have drilled those that are a mile apart, and we just have to project what those, what\u2019s in between those, as we go in, start to close in the degree, that\u2019s how you turn mineralized into resources, and then into proved reserves and it\u2019s a vast area. As you might have imagined with the amount of money we spend, last seven years to add this, $43 billion and that\u2019s definitely sensitive mineralized because we just didn\u2019t have the spacing. So that\u2019s a definition, which you need to fill in there as how much drilling do you have to get enough data to really be call it mineralized versus resource.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Sorry, I didn\u2019t misread the difference here. Your mineralized material is at 2.20 cut off and your PNP is at $2. And just another question Richard, maybe on the comment that you made on, earlier in the call about your target for net debt under the combined PXP MMR deal, you said now that you might be targeting to get net debt down to about $12 billion, and at that point, we\u2019ll be in a position to either spend on growth buyback stock and\/or raise dividends. could you just flesh that out a little bit more wide to slightly higher level, is that in response perhaps to shareholder pressure to return cash to shareholders sooner or what\u2019s driving the thought process there?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. You\u2019re right, it is net debt and with the continuation of current commodity prices, we should reach that target level in a relatively near-term, roughly 2.5, 3 years or so. So we should be down to that in a relatively short period of time, assuming continuation of current commodity levels, price levels, and what that allows to do is kind of all three of which, you\u2019ve talked about, continue to invest, have the excess cash to shareholders, kind of be in the situation we\u2019ve been in recent years. We got down to zero debt.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Net debt.","Richard C. Adkerson","Net debt at FCX, not because that was necessarily a financial strategy to get there. It happened in fact when we finished the Phelps Dodge deal, Jorge you may recall that we were talking about having long-term debt of roughly $7 billion at FCX going forward. but after 2008-2009, we had gotten to be very conservative, because of the risk there about managing cash and when the markets came back quicker and stronger than people anticipated. The copper prices start rising by the second quarter of 2009, we used that cash then to reduce debt, and so it was more of a circumstance of those times as opposed to the financial strategy, we like many of our shareholders have expressed to us believe that we should maintain an appropriate amount of leverage to leverage our balance sheet for our equity returnings, $12 billion would be less than one times EBITDA and so that\u2019s kind of that we\u2019re thinking about doing right now. And that said getting down to zero net debt was more of a circumstance of the situation as opposed to a financial objective that we were pursuing.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Got it, thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","And one other thing Jorge, I want to go back to this issue of this $2 and $2.20, I\u2019ll make sure everybody understand, that is not our projection of prices. It\u2019s not our view of any kind of long-term price of copper. It\u2019s what we have to do just to comply with SEC reserve determinations and we\u2019ve used this, it\u2019s not something that easily changeable because you\u2019ll have to \u2013 if you change the price you have to develop new mine plants and so forth, we actually as a company don\u2019t have a long-term price projection. We consider a scenario of different prices when we look at investment opportunities, as I said before we want to manage downside risk, get exposure to what we believe is going to be a very positive future for commodities, and in that way we can make money and protect our down side risk.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Great, thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Tumazos, with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Thank you, I wanted to congratulate you on the good operations at Grasberg and permit in Peru and completing the expansion smoothly at Tenke. Other companies have had tougher times in some of those countries? I'm trying to understand what would be normal in the new Freeport. And I'm trying to not think of it in terms of the old company, because you're adding oil and gas, and I'm not doubling, but significantly increasing the mining. In the current year 2013, you are sustaining capital is a $1.8 billion, and you are saying that that will fall to $1.4 billion next year, and $1 billion in 2015. And in 2015, the total capital before oil and gas would be $3 billion. What's causing the bulge in sustaining capital this year? What will depreciation be when the capital programs are done in 2015? And what will the \u2013 is it possible 2016 will be a down year for CapEx?","Kathleen L. Quirk","John this is Kathleen, we've been spending on sustaining cap to CapEx, something on the order of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, and as we've shown quickly during the '08, '09 financial crisis, we have some flexibility with those projections. The bump in 2013 reflects some of the timing issues that carried over from 2012 to 2013. We are investing an equipment to assure reliability. We're investing in trucks and shovels as we\u2019ll expanding our mining rates, and so we do have some projects that we don't have every single year.","Richard C. Adkerson","And this issue about getting to the end of the mine life at Grasberg where we\u2019re going to be as I said, cutting back on equipment and so forth our sustaining capital at Grasberg will be dropping dramatically as we go forward. So let's see Kathleen is looking at this depreciation number.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yeah, we're expecting depreciation for 2013 to be somewhat higher than 2012 were roughly $1.5 billion in 2013 versus approximately $1.2 billion in 2012. And then as we get these projects online depreciation will get up to roughly $2.2 billion in the 2015 time period, and that's just the business that we have today. Of course, we\u2019ll have pro forma results, which will include, we'll have purchase price allocation associated with those assets. So we'll update our guidance on that as we go forward.","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Will the $3 billion mining CapEx or total CapEx rate you are projecting for 2015 be something that we should think of as normal level given that the depreciation is up to $2.2 billion and there always be some projects?","Richard C. Adkerson","No, no. That\u2019s simply where we are now with our plans. We don\u2019t include CapEx in our outlook unless the projects have been approved. We are going to work hard as we talked about earlier to find new projects in our mining business to spend capital only because we think that is the way they create long-term value for our shareholders.","So it\u2019s a practical matter. It\u2019s going to take time to get these projects to the point of where we can get them authorized. We are going to be responsive to the market conditions as we go forward, but we hope to find ways to spend capital, but this thing that we talked about earlier, they are just constraints on how quickly you can spend it, because we had to do these feasibility studies and other factors. But there is not really a normal aspect to this. We are going to be very return oriented to see where can we spend capital and get strong returns for the shareholders.","Richard C. Adkerson","And John, there is not going to be a \u2013 this is not a question of having an old Freeport and new Freeport. This is going to be the long-term tradition of Freeport going forward in terms of the way we run this business and allocate capital and be disciplined about the way we do things. So this is not any kind of transformation, transaction that\u2019s going to change the traditions that have been part of this company for the long period of time.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Tony Robson with BMO Capital Markets.","Tony Robson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. First question I think to Kathleen, tax rate for the quarter were a bit lower than I had expected, it was about 28%. Any guidance for 2013 tax rates before the oil impact? And the follow-up question is on the oil, I guess to Richard or to Jim Bob. Feedback I\u2019ve had from Freeport shareholders has been that the full acquisition was not controversial. Given the relative size of the deals and that feedback you may have had similar or almost, any thoughts on opening up that sort of \u2013 those mergers to Freeport shareholders to vote? Thank you.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Tony, hi, this is Kathleen. on the first part of your question, regarding taxes, effective rate in this quarter was 29% and for the year, it was 32%. They were some adjustments in the fourth quarter as we looked at the overall average for the year. As we get improved income relative to the size of the company, the improved contribution from Indonesia which has our highest tax rate, we expect tax rates to \u2013 effective rates to increase during 2013. We\u2019ve got some disclosure on that in the back of the press release, but currently projecting 34% to 35% for effective tax rate before the transactions in 2013.","Tony Robson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","All right. Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson","What\u2019s the question?","Kathleen L. Quirk","He asked about the shareholder vote for FCX.","Richard C. Adkerson","For FCX? I\u2019m sorry, Tony, I was looking at something else. You asked about shareholder for FCX. There will be shareholder votes for McMoRan and for Plains. For FCX, there is no shareholder vote. The requirements for shareholders vote are set by the New York Stock Exchange and we operate under Delaware law and the number of shares to be issued in this transaction to Plains is, that doesn\u2019t exceed those levels requiring a shareholder vote and when shareholders votes aren\u2019t required, I\u2019m told by the lawyers virtually never held because buyers would not be willing to accept the condition in terms of agreeing to sell a business generally not in this case on the basis having some sort of voluntary shareholder vote.","Tony Robson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Paul Massoud with Stifel Nicolaus.","Paul Massoud \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my call. My question, I guess my question is about your hedging policy, I mean obviously you guys don\u2019t hedge comparable. Now that oil and gas assets that you\u2019re going to be buying, do you have some hedges and so I was just curious if after the deal closes that you\u2019ll be continuing the hedging policy that\u2019s in place at Plains or if those hedges roll off and sort of purchase the oil and gas the same way you approach copper.","","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay, well, just to comment about it, Paul as you noted, we have had a tradition of not hedging in our mining business. We manage our price risk by the way we structure our portfolio of assets and respond at different pricing market conditions. Many of our input costs in the mining business are highly correlated to the price of copper. So if price goes down the input cost go down, and so forth.","Hedging is more common among in the oil and gas business. We\u2019re independent producers. Plains had made a significant acquisition of assets from BP earlier, well in 2012 and had adopted a business strategy of delevering the debt that it took in connection with that acquisition and the hedges that they put in place were supportive of that deleveraging strategy and that will carry over to our own deleveraging strategy because their production volumes have a strong history of production and now by having prices assured at attractive levels will be able to have degree of assurance for our own policy of reaching these targeted debt levels that I mentioned earlier.","Whoever will go beyond that is something that we\u2019re going to talk about and consider as we go forward. And that will be part of our review of the strategy of how we invest in oil and gas business, but that is not yet\u2026","James R. Moffett","This is Jim Bob. Let me just add, the 21% of our cost as you\u2019ll see from the charts is energy related. So by having the oil and gas hedges that give us good price for oil and gas is the hedge, our energy cost that we have across the board in our mining business.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay, thanks Paul.","Paul Massoud \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Wayne Cooperman with Cobalt Capital.","Wayne M. Cooperman \u2013 Cobalt Capital Management, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Richard C. Adkerson","Hello, Wayne.","Wayne M. Cooperman \u2013 Cobalt Capital Management, Inc.","Hey, sorry if this is repeated, I apologize. Would you guys entertain more energy acquisitions at the right price if you saw stuff you liked and b) I think you said this, but assuming the MMR ends up being very successful and you really prove out the ultra-deep. Could you see separating the oil and gas assets again because they would have a much different cost to capital than the copper and gold company?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, Wayne this investment that we\u2019ll be making in oil and gas business gives us a platform for looking for growth opportunities across a broader range of assets. And so we\u2019re going to be, first of all, I want to say, we are going to be disciplined about it, our business plan of delevering and where we commit capital. But it will give us an opportunity to consider where to invest for the highest returns. There is not a plan to make acquisitions either in the oil and gas business or in the mining business, but we\u2019re going to be cognizant of opportunities across the set of assets that we will have and we will make decisions based on our assessments of those opportunities and the discipline factor. And we are focused on achieving success in the investments in McMoRan, the investments in Plains, where there is significant growth opportunities that complement what we have in our mining business and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on as supposed to any kind of long-term strategy about future restructurings of the company.","Wayne M. Cooperman \u2013 Cobalt Capital Management, Inc.","All right, thanks.","James R. Moffett","","Wait, this is Jim Bob, wait a minute, I will just add to that. When you talk about what we are going to do, I have been Chairman in this company now for over 30 years and CEO for 20 years, Richard have been CEO for 10 years, so you have got 30 years of management that you\u2019re seeing and nothing is going to change about this dialog what we do. What we try to do is to be the best management team and for that matter in the corporate, and we think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job on average and our employees also have a well documented record. So what we\u2019re going to be doing is, to use cash flow and resources that you are saying in the pro forma. And looking at, how do we and does that regionally or globally because with these acquisitions, we\u2019ll now leapfrog, we\u2019re bigger than (inaudible), we\u2019re bigger than (inaudible), we\u2019re bigger than Anadarko, we\u2019re bigger than Apache, (inaudible) is the only company that\u2019s slightly large in here.","So we\u2019ve got a resource even now which is basically a major resource, which you can complete with the majors more or less. But what that means is we want to take this Board and the management, Richard, myself and many of the employees, we are going to be looking at the best opportunity to grow our assets. And what we do with the capital, would have been, the prices of the commodities are, we\u2019re committed to having the size of products that Richard talked about, we\u2019re committed to do Rich, I and the shareholders. So nothing changed about this company obviously. 30 years of management, this guaranteed continued management of the company.","This Board has a solid record. We acquired Phelps Dodge and we\u2019ve shown inside into that and we\u2019re taking a company that was 150 year old company, and tripped in the reserves that they had, the timely acquisition to our exploration expertise. So what everybody needs to remember is, the authority is that you\u2019ve with the management.","Now this is Jim Bob and our great Board of Directors made decisions that yield same kind of returns you\u2019ve had in the past.","Richard C. Adkerson","","All right. well, thanks to everyone for participating in our call and we\u2019re available for follow-up to the extent you would like to follow-up.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today.

Good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. We also have several slides to supplement our comments this morning, and we\u2019ll be referring to the slides during the call. They are also available on our webcast link at fcx.com.","In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments today, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that our press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today is our Chairman Jim Bob Moffett; our President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Adkerson; Red Conger is here as well as Mark Johnson. I'll briefly summarize the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be going through the slide materials that we've prepared. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for questions.","Today, FCX reported third quarter 2012 net income attributable to common stock of $824 million; that was $0.86 per share, compared with $1.1 billion or $1.10 per share for the third quarter of 2011. Our third quarter 2012 net income included credits for adjustments to Cerro Verde deferred income taxes and to FCX's environmental obligations and related litigation reserves. Those two items totaled $168 million to net income or $0.18 per share. We had net charges in the year ago period for non-recurring items totaling $73 million or $0.07 per share.","We also increased sales during the quarter to intercompany smelters. We deferred recognizing profits on these sales until the final sales occurred to third parties, changes in these deferrals attributable to the variability in intercompany volumes resulted in reductions to our net income during the third quarter of 2012 that amounted to $34 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2012.","Our volumes for copper, our consolidated copper sales of \u00a3922 million, those were higher than our July 2012 estimate of \u00a3885 million. We had higher production from North America and Africa and we also had advanced timing of sales in South America. The third quarter consolidated gold sales of 202,000 ounces were lower than our previous estimate of 225,000 ounces reflecting changes to the mine plans at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia which delayed access to higher grade materials and a slower than expected ramp-up at the underground DOZ mine during the quarter.","Third quarter as anticipated sales were lower than the year ago level of \u00a3947 million of copper and 409,000 ounces of gold primarily reflecting lower ore grades in Indonesia offset partly by increased sales in North America and Africa.","Our molybdenum sales during the third quarter of \u00a321 million were slightly above our prior estimate of \u00a320 million in the third quarter 2011 sales of \u00a319 million.","As we look to the year, we expect our copper sales to total \u00a33.6 billion for the year 2012, 1 million ounces of gold and roughly \u00a382 million of molybdenum. We expect that number to be growing as we look forward to 2013 going to \u00a34.3 billion of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold and \u00a390 million of molybdenum. And if you look beyond 2013, you'll see that we have a stronger outlook for growing volumes.","Our realized copper price in the third quarter was $3.64 per pound that compared to $3.60 per pound in the third quarter of 2011. Our gold price realizations averaged $1,728 per ounce in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $1,693 per ounce in the year ago quarter.","Molybdenum prices were below the year ago levels averaging $13.62 per pound in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $16.34 in the year ago period. Our consolidated average unit net cash cost net of by-product credits of $1.62 per pound in third quarter of 2012 were in line with our previous estimates, but higher than unit net cash costs of $0.80 per pound in the third quarter of 2011, primarily because of lower volumes in Indonesia. As you\u2019ll see and as Richard will be talking about, we expect our unit net cash costs to improve as we access parked ore grades in the second half of 2013 in Indonesia and we get the benefit of additional growth outside of Indonesia.","Our operating cash flows during the quarter, which were net of $765 million in working capital uses, totaled $526 million and capital expenditures for the quarter, which included spending on our major projects that are underway, totaled $971 million for the third quarter of 2012. We ended in a strong financial position with consolidated cash of $3.7 billion, which exceeded our total debt of roughly $3.5 billion. The common stock currently outstanding totals 949 million shares.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call to Richard who will be referring to the slide presentation material.","Richard C. Adkerson ","Thanks Kathleen and good morning everyone. The third quarter of this year was a good quarter for our company when we look at our global operations. As Kathleen mentioned, we are achieving higher production growth in North America and Africa. We'll talk about that with our future growth opportunities. Our expansion at Tenke Fungurume in Africa is going very well, on time, on budget, and it was a quarter in which we set a number of operating records for our current operations. Our situation at Grasberg continues to progress and improve and I'll be talking about how to put this year in perspective for our longer term operations because it is an unusual year for Grasberg.","We are advancing our Brownfield development projects. That's a focus of our company. As I mentioned, the project at Tenke Fungurume is going well and it's virtually complete, engineering construction with the mill expansion and mine rate expansion at Morenci is progressing and we are making positive permitting progress for our big project for the Cerro Verde project. So we have \u2013 we are on track for our strong outlook for growing production profile.","The financial highlights that Kathleen mentioned to you, reviewed with you, I think when you look at it overall, we see this quarter as one basically where we achieved our outlook that we have planned to achieve during the quarter. We had a situation at Grasberg where we did have to change our mine plan for the pit and that resulted in this mining lower grade material out of the pit that had an impact on gold, and combined with the issue of ramping up DOZ resulted in us having 10% lower gold sales for the third quarter than we had anticipated. This is gold that we'll make up as we go forward and you'll see that in our forward-looking numbers. Our cost situation is in line with what our expectations were. We are incurring additional cost in North America as we ramp up and in South America we're having some higher energy cost, but actually our unit cost on a consolidated basis for the third quarter was really exactly in line with the guidance that we had going into the quarter. So, overall the quarter was an excellent quarter for us operationally.","Looking at our cost situation, our consolidated cost for the quarter at $1.62 as I said was in line with guidance. It reflects the unusual situation at PT-FI Grasberg where we had unit cost of $1.65 this year, that's slightly higher \u2013 that's quarter slightly higher than last quarter, but looking forward we return to more normal levels.","The markets today are complicated globally. No question about it with the focus in our markets being on China because it does remain such an important demand driver for our business. I just returned from London at LME WEEK last week and there's lot of skepticism about Chinese growth rates at 7.5% or slightly above that. The Chinese government is taking steps to stabilize their economy to provide incentives for our consumers and to invest in infrastructure. Their inflation rates have been brought down and in many ways it appears that the situation is stable there. The government appears committed to dealing with these issues and certainly has the financial resources of doing it.","With respect to our business, we are continuing to see a positive situation in China with the rest of our customers, very strong competitive demand for our copper concentrates and our copper cathodes. In the U.S., U.S. copper demand is being helped significantly by the automobile industry. Housing data has been more positive. And while growth in the U.S. today is certainly lower than the business community expected a year ago, we're seeing some positive aspects to copper demand in the marketplace.","In the context, global inventories of copper remain low. Inventories of our customers are low, and the industry is supported by ongoing supply challenges of production from existing mines as well as the challenges in developing the relatively scarce number of major new project that the industry has available to it around the world.","A number of companies are announcing cutbacks in capital expending and being more disciplined in where they invest capital, all of that would be supportive for the long-term copper markets and we remain very positive about those markets going forward based on the uses of copper in the global economy and the challenges from a supply standpoint.","Our company\u2019s strategy is focused as you see on Slide 8 on the enormous reserve position we have at $2 copper plans, we have \u00a3120 billion of proved and probable copper reserves and in addition we have incremental resources associated with our existing mines where we've identified \u00a3115 billion of contained copper at $2.25 mine plans. So it\u2019s enormous resource base for us and our focus and challenge is bringing those reserves and resources into development projects and into producing assets, and we are making good progress along those lines.","Slide 9 shows the highly attractive Brownfield development projects. Notably, they are Brownfield projects which \u2013 and while they have challenges, they are certainly less risky in many respects from an execution standpoint, from a permitting standpoint, community acceptance standpoint than Greenfield projects. In North America, we have the project we are currently engaged in at Morenci and potential significant sulfide expansions at Morenci and other mines in North America. The Cerro Verde project in Chile is progressing very well and we have a significant potential opportunity at El Abra where our exploration activities identified a large sulfide resource.","Beyond the current expansion project at Tenke Fungurume, we have other expansion opportunities with our oxide over there and our exploration and metallurgical work continues to give us optimism about potential future sulfide projects. And Grasberg, we are progressing well with the development of our underground infrastructure to enable us to transition effectively from the open pit, which we still expect to be completed roughly in 2016 to continue Grasberg as a large scale, low-cost, very competitive operation for many years to come.","The details of the Morenci's project are on Page 10. They are basically as previously reported. We are expanding the mill, increasing the mining rate, targeting incremental production of \u00a3225 million per year. We've received our major permits, we're progressing engineering and ordering items and we expect full rates in 2014. Ongoing exploration gives us the opportunity which we're now studying for a further future large scale expansions. And this is a 100-year old mine. As you can see in the chart, on Page 10, it has a tremendous amount of future associated with it. We essentially have as much in reserves and mineralized material as the cumulative production has occurred since World War II. So this is far from a short-lived mine. It has got great expansion opportunity which will give us future volumes of significance.","Cerro Verde, I'm very pleased with the way our team has approached this project by working cooperatively with the local community. Peru has been a difficult place to undertake mining projects because of community concerns about competition for water and other factors. Our team there, Red and his team have found a way of working with the City of Arequipa to help them with infrastructure development both in terms of developing clean water supplies and using their wastewater system. We made the community better in conjunction with finding a access for the water resources for our big project there.","We have increased our capital cost estimate for the project from $4 billion to $4.4 billion reflecting some incremental cost of investment in power facilities and in the water projects which give us a greater degree of assurance in these critical areas as we go forward. This will become the world's largest concentrator milling operation and give us significant incremental production of \u00a3600 million per year. A reserve life is significant because of the resources. We\u2019re working effectively with the government. We have a new stability agreement, working on engineering, plan to begin construction next year and completed in 2016, and you can see on the charts what that will mean to our company.","As I mentioned, the current project development, which is our first expansion project at Tenke Fungurume following the initial project is virtually complete. We will be adding a second sulfuric acid plant in 2015, but this is expanding the mill, which has been operating very well to 14,000 tons per day and we\u2019ll increase our mining rate. It is $850 million of capital to get \u00a3150 million of copper per year, and that project and operations in the Congo are going very well.","At Grasberg we have been able to be very effective and continuing our underground development to give us access to the future sources of throughput for our mill after the completion of mining in the pit. This work has gone very well. It is a very significant project with over $6 billion of development capital for the total operation; our share is just over $5 billion of that. And this will be spread over a number of years because of the nature of underground development. Our average capital cost is about $550 million a year, and you can see the timing of the chart bringing in the development of the Deep MLZ mine followed by the Grasberg Block Cave which we will begin to operate once the pit is completed.","The next slide on Grasberg, we gave a lot of thought as to how to put this year in perspective. It was an unusual year following the labor situation that we faced in the second half of 2011 and continuing this year, and we have had a year of unusually low metal production compared with history. Besides the issues associated with the labor disruptions earlier in year, we continue to deal with labor issues, but we are making progress with that. We are preparing for our future CLA negotiation as well as dealing with a number of issues of concern to the employees. But it has been in conjunction with that a year in which our mine plan was one in which we were going to have lower grades in any event, we had to change those mine plans, and as the result, we were only mining this year in the upper reaches of the Grasberg pit.","During the labor disruptions, we ended up with a situation at the DOZ mine of where we had to do panel repairs. Those have taken more time than we expected. We are currently operating the mine, which has a design capacity of roughly 80,000 tons per day. The current rate is 50,000 ton. We are not as far along as we expected. That was high grade material that would've gone into our mill, so that's affected the volumes of copper and gold that we had available to us, but we are on track of getting this back to full production levels, which will occur gradually and reach full levels by the second half of next year.","If you look at the charts at the bottom of the page, you can see the impact of that. For copper this year we're roughly at half the average that we would have for the last 10 years and what we expect for the remaining years in the life of the pit. This is the aggregate Grasberg production and there's a footnote there that shows our share of that net of the Rio Tinto interest. But particularly for gold you can see this year where we have really less than 1 million ounces of gold production where our normal production is over 2 million ounces and as a result because a lot of our cost there are fixed, our unit cost at Grasberg are abnormally large. For 2012, we expect to be at $1.34. For the last five years it's averaged $0.13. In '13 and '14 we expect that to drop to $0.20 and then be a net credit for the years 2013 through 2016.","You can see that, and I'm going to refer just quickly back to some of the supplementary slides that we have. The slides leading up to Slide 36 show where mining has occurred on a quarter-by-quarter basis in the Grasberg open pit. But if you turn to Slide 36 you can see, and this is a familiar slide for those of you who follow us, how the grades are distributed in the Grasberg pit. This is one of the mining industries great ore bodies and is characterized by very high grades of both copper and gold at the core of the pit. As we have developed this pit over time we've had to have sequencing in which we mine the upper reaches to execute our long-term mine plan for our stability and that has resulted over time in years where we have higher or lower production. 2012, we're in the final stages of designing the ultimate pit limits and to executing that, and you can see where we were mining in the third quarter at the upper reaches with relatively low grades. As we go forward into 2013, we will be mining at lower reaches of the pit and that will give us access to higher grade material, and you will see that reflected in our numbers.","2014, going to Slide 38, we get closer in. Then beyond 2014 we\u2019ll essentially see significant drops in our stripping requirements. We will be getting down to the final stages of mining the very high grades at the bottom of the pit in 2014, 2015 and 2016. This 2013, as you can imagine by looking at this, will be a year, and we'll talk more about this as we give our outlook for the year and our fourth quarter earnings release, will be a year in which we\u2019ll be back-end loaded, we\u2019ll be progressively getting to higher grades as we go through the year.","Now we continue to work with the government of Indonesia on our process to get the extension of our contract award beyond its primary terms. The contract has a primary term that goes to 2021 and by its terms we have the rights to two 10-year extensions. We\u2019re also talking to the government about their review of our contract and other companies\u2019 contracts in light of their new mining law. We made a lot of progress during this quarter in these discussions. We are engaged in the process that the government has established to talk with us and we feel very encouraged by the progress we've made this quarter and we are looking forward to completing this process as it works its way through the Indonesian government situation.","On Slide 15, let's turn to the Americas where we've got just a really positive story with the current Morenci expansion. The restart of our Chino mine in New Mexico and the Cerro Verde expansion, we see within a relatively short period of time of increasing our production to \u00a33.5 billion a year, which is roughly what our total company will produce this year. This has been a great story of the Phelps Dodge transaction was this highly profitable, expandable resource that we were pleased to bring into our company as a result of that transaction. Beyond that we are working on the incremental resources to deal with sulfide opportunities in the U.S. and as you can see, this is a significant opportunity together with the sulfide resource we have at El Abra and those will be projects we will continue to review and find ways of executing in years to come.","Slide 16 shows what we've done with Tenke, began production in 2009. We've been able to optimize the first project. The mill performed in excess of our expectations. Now, we are in our first expansion. There's a likely another optimization expansion with oxide materials, which would give us significant additional volumes. And as I mentioned, our exploration drilling and metallurgical work gives us a really positive outlook about the future opportunities with what appears to be a very large mixed ore and sulfide ore opportunity there. Pulling this all together, we've got opportunities to have five mines with a capacity over \u00a31 billion of copper per year. Very few mines in the world can reach that level, but with Grasberg being the cornerstone asset, Morenci and expansion at Tenke Fungurume, Cerro Verde and the opportunity at El Abra, we could well have five mines in that list of global world-class mines.","Turning to our molybdenum business, we completed the construction of the restart of Climax in mid-2012. We began ramp up in March. We're continuing this process and managing the ramp up subject to market conditions. Prices for moly have weakened during the year and we feel good about the long-term markets and we\u2019ve positioned ourselves to take advantage of it with the combination of our byproduct production, our Henderson mine and now Climax will allow us to produce on a profitable basis in varying conditions in the industry and they have significant production and expansion opportunities as we look forward to more positive markets in the longer run.","We're spending significantly on exploration $255 million this year focused on our Brownfield expansion opportunities in terms of both adding reserves and resources, moving resources into reserves and reserves into development projects. Kathleen reviewed our 2012 outlook and the details on that are presented on Slide 20. Consistent with what our guidance was last quarter, our unit cost for the year is now expected to be a $1.50, and I\u2019ll talk about Grasberg\u2019s impact on that. If copper averages $3.70 in the fourth quarter, we would expect to have operating cash flows of $4 billion. Net of $1.4 billion of working capital uses and tax payments, we\u2019d expect those sorts of things to reverse in future years and our capital expenditures primarily based on timing changes are now expected to be $3.6 billion this year versus the previous $4 billion. Like all companies in our industry, we are focused on being disciplined with both capital spending and operating cost spending and along with our primary focus on safety that\u2019s the first thing we talk about at every one of our meetings.","Near-term sales profile is presented on Slide 21. You can see the expected significant increases in 2013 and 2014 as Grasberg returns to more normal levels; our Candelaria mine has been producing at lower levels because of mine sequencing and grade issues. That\u2019s expected to come back as well as our expansion projects kicking in over time. So we\u2019re looking forward to future volume growth. The gold slide you can see on the upper right shows the condition I mentioned earlier of this being an abnormally low year for Grasberg.","Quarterly sales, we were on average for totals had higher volumes in the third quarter than our guidance had been. This was a bit lower at Grasberg because of the factors I mentioned earlier offset by positive performance through the rest of our company, in the Americas and Africa. This resulted in some transfer of volumes from the fourth quarter to third quarter. That's something we'll try to do every quarter. As you know our history we try to move that forward.","Slide 23 shows our unit cost. As I said, our costs are really coming in pretty much as expected. We are incurring additional cost as we ramp-up in America, for example in Morenci, we are doing additional stripping to prepare ourselves for the expansion there, but when we look at net unit cost of $1.50, that's in line with what our expectations have been.","In terms of viewing those unit costs, again, we'd like to point out the abnormal year at Grasberg. Page 24 shows $1.50, how it reconciles with our experience in 2011 and then the impact of the higher expected future volumes near-term at Grasberg bringing our cost level down to more normal levels for our company.","Slide 25 shows the model that we present every quarter of operating cash flows for our business. We've added a little bit to this to show the impact of expansions on that focusing on the $3.50 price level for copper. At that level, with our current operations based on our next two years of operations we would have $9 billion of EBITDA and $6.5 billion of operating cash flows. With the increased volumes looking at the following two years of 2015, 2016 we'd see a roughly 50% increase of $3.50 copper in terms of our EBITDA numbers and operating cash flows. So, these expansion opportunities that we have are really very significant for us.","Our sensitivities, so that you can adjust this for other views about prices and input cost are presented on Page 26, obviously the important one is copper, $0.10 of copper results in $275 million of annual operating cash flow for us. Capital expenditures reflects, on Page 27 reflects our new estimates of reducing this year's projected spending from $4 billion to $3.6 billion with roughly the same levels for next year. We're really focused on our own expansion. We're limiting our efforts and putting our focus on our best project. We're obviously being very prudent about capital spending. The Brownfield expansions that we're pursuing have really good economics even at lower prices than currently and so our big focus is being disciplined and focusing on execution of these projects to get them done in an effective way.","Financial policy continues to be directed towards maintaining a strong balance sheet as an investment grade rated Company, strong liquidity position having that focus on these attractive growth projects in a disciplined way, we pay an attractive current dividend and our Board continues to review financial policy as we go forward.","So as I said, we\u2019re pleased we had a good quarter. We look forward to responding to your questions. Jim Bob is here along with Red Conger, Mark Johnson and Kathleen and I will be happy to hear what your questions are.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Operator, we\u2019ll take questions now.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and Gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Sal Tharani, with Goldman Sachs.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Hi guys. I just wanted to get some more color on the Indonesia. There are quite a bit of news from there and the latest one was the royalty question also. I was wondering \u2013 and obviously you are also spending quite a bit of money over there over the next few years before going underground. I was wondering if your conversation for expansion beyond 2021 incorporates all these issues and expansion and so forth or are these being talked separately and these are separate issues?","Richard C. Adkerson","That all comes together, Sal. I mean the government is very positive about our investing now for volumes to produce beyond 2021. Consistently the discussions have been directed towards \u2013 are continuing to operate. We have reserves now to 2041, and so we were having a lot of support for what we were doing. It's meaningful to the country. We have a workforce of over 20,000 people there. We pay \u2013 taxes are the biggest component of our compensation we pay to the government, but we pay well over $2 billion a year on average for taxes, royalties and dividends and that's meaningful to the country. The issues have been built around this new mining law that was adopted that does not technically apply to us and the aspirations of the people of Indonesia regarding mineral resources. And so, we are engaged in productive discussions to find a way forward that is responsive to those aspirations and protects the interest of our shareholders, but built into this would be a positive response to your question, and that it would give us surety of our situation going forward beyond 2021 and the ability to take advantage of our current reserves and resources.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","There were some rumors about floating Indonesia asset separately, so that to avoid any of the government regulations. Is that on the table also?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, it's not to avoid government regulations. I mean we are subject to our contract of work, which sets the basic parameters of how we operate and what our rights and obligations are, and that contract itself has a status of law. For some time now, we've seen benefits to having PT-FI listed on the Indonesian exchange. The government is very positive about that. We believe it would present the Company in a positive way within the country in terms of the way reports are dissimilated and so forth. And so we are pursuing discussions about that and believe that it would be a very positive step for us and the government will view it as positive as well. ","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","Let me just add that that would be a small percentage of PT-FI. PT-FI is a large asset and so we\u2019re talking about a small percentage listing of that which would be a large transaction for the Indonesian exchange. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Great. Thank you and good morning Richard, Kathleen. With regards to Grasberg, I know you\u2019ve taken the copper shipment estimates down in the next few years and when I was looking at the reference slide, I couldn\u2019t see any real appreciable difference in the mining plan at high level. I was wondering if you could go into that a little bit more detail and then similarly, with the DOZ and the delay in the ramp there. I think you mentioned you have some ongoing labor issues and then panels. Was there just more expensive damage with some of those panels and that\u2019s what\u2019s delaying the ramp? Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson","I\u2019m going to let Mark answer the second part of the question first. And yeah, Mark, why don\u2019t you answer that?","Mark J. Johnson","Yeah. On the panel repair, first of all typically in the DOZ, we\u2019ve experienced over time about 5% to 10% of our drop points are down for some type of repair. During this period of time right now we\u2019re up close to a third of our active drop points are in a repair process. These drop points, a lot of them are the older drop points to begin with. Some of them were built in the weaker area of the mine, the more friable ground. So that\u2019s played a role. The impact of the labor disputes, the pipeline situation that we had last year, also added to our concerns there on the panels and these repairs and a lot of times the panel is in a state where it takes a very intensive repair, a lot of steel sets, a lot of concrete and really we don\u2019t, until we get into those panels and start repairing them, sometimes we\u2019re not completely aware of what might be done, needs to be done. So we\u2019re the process. It takes very experienced miners. It takes a very methodical process to get them repaired. We feel good about our process in getting these open backed up. So we\u2019re working through that. We have five panels right now that are undergoing repair. We get one of those panels back in the fourth quarter of this year and then over the course of 2013 we\u2019ll be bringing these on sequentially.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. And then with respect to the mine plan question, Brian, basically we\u2019re looking at a period for open pit mining now they\u2019ll go from now through 2016 and our total copper and gold during that period of time is essentially the same as our previous plans because of the factor that Mark mentioned and because of some of the delays that were caused with mining rates during the labor situation last year. There\u2019s been some shifting of that from our previous plants back, but it\u2019s really minor and now as we return to normal operations, we will be factoring back as to how we can advance volumes forward again. So it\u2019s not in the bigger picture of things. It\u2019s not major changes from what we were previously talking about. ","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael F. Gambardella with JP Morgan.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Good morning. I have a question going back to slide number 9 with the Brownfield projects. Now everyone in the world is taking on especially Greenfield but also Brownfield projects having cost increase. The Cerro Verde portion is obviously about two thirds of the component here for the total company going forward and it\u2019s still three, four years out. How much confidence do you have in that number of $4.4 billion you recently upgraded? But just how much is locked in and how much variation possibly could we see in the CapEx program?","Richard C. Adkerson","I\u2019ll let Red Conger respond, Mike.","Red Conger","Mike, we now have an estimate based on 30% of the engineering being completed so that gives us a good solid basis for that new forecast. As Richard motioned, a lot of the change has been on things outside of what I would call the outer limits of a normal project \u2013 power, water, those kinds of things that are unique. In this case the mill and processing facility itself, we understand well and have the tailing down. We have good estimates on all of that and as Richard said, we\u2019re all focused on doing it well, doing it right and we\u2019ll keep you posted on that. But right now it\u2019s a very good estimate. And Mike, I just want to make the point again that this is different than even a lot of other Brownfield projects. This is the footprint of where we\u2019ve been operating there. As you may remember the last major expansion was completed in 2006 right before our transaction. A lot of this is not exactly replicating but very similar in nature to what we\u2019ve done before. The big issues as is the case in Northern Chile and Southern Peru is water and power and those are the things where we have seen some escalation on. But some of our investment has done is to give a surety on these things so that in a world of where both water and power are going to be increasingly problematic, we're investing to see that we've got safety in our project. But in terms of the mill processing facilities and so forth, these are essentially things that we've done before. ","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Thanks Richard and Red.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Anthony Rizzuto with Dahlman. ","Anthony Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Co.","Thank you very much. Hi everyone. Hey, I just want to follow-up a little bit just to make sure I understand correctly. When you guys talk about the panels, am I correctly thinking about mine roof bolt systems? Are they similar?","Mark J. Johnson","The panels are essentially our access to the \u2013 it\u2019s the drift where we access the draw points. We have various levels of ground support. Some areas in the very good ground we just put shotcrete, very light roof bolt support. In these areas, as we repair them, it's very extensive. It\u2019s steel sets, essentially re-concreted in. We re-support the ground essentially in a very engineered and structured way. So it does involve roof bolts. There\u2019s a variety of roof support, ground support throughout these deals relative to the ground conditions in the specific area.","Anthony Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Co.","Okay, Mark. And so I guess the situation I think that Richard alluded to, could you elaborate a little bit more about the specific situation? Was it something that was labor related that did occur during the quarter?","Mark J. Johnson","One of the \u2013 with block caving, one of things is is that once you start mining the area, it\u2019s not a mining method that\u2019s easily shot off and restarted. As I had mentioned, some of these draw points that we\u2019re repairing may have needed repair regardless of the labor situation and the pipeline situation that we dealt with last year, but both of those issues exacerbated the potential for damage. And like I said, it\u2019s difficult in a block cave once you start pulling an area, to keep the stresses off of the panels, to keep the ground support intact, you want to keep pulling each area in a very engineered and controlled fashion. We had disruptions last year during all of the issues that we dealt with and it certainly played a role in the situation we\u2019re dealing with today.","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah. Tony, this wasn\u2019t something that occurred this quarter. During the labor issues which began mid-September really last year, we were taking steps to try to mitigate this problem which we knew was there. Then some of those disruptions continued as you recall into early 2012. So this was developing and we had plans as to how we would deal with it, and as we physically get into dealing with it, it's taking us a bit longer than we thought it would when we gave our earlier guidance. So it's more of that situation than some new problem that developed this quarter.","Anthony Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Co.","Understand. Thank you very much. It\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. The first question was about your Africa operations, and I see that a second sulfuric acid plant that you mentioned that is expected to be completed in 2015. Could you give us any sense as to what capacity this can support?","Richard C. Adkerson","I should know that right off the top of my head. I don't, and we'll back to you on that. But it's a similar size plant to what we built at our Safford operation when we expanded that. So we'll have an answer to you before the call is over.","Mark J. Johnson","It's like 600,000 tons a year.","Kathleen L. Quirk","But as we \u2013 the reason why we have the plant is as we go forward we've got \u2013 and as part of our long-term plans, we've got ore that has higher acid consumption. And so as part of the long range planning. We have timed in the addition of an acid plant. We also supplement from time to time purchases of acid. But it's more cost effective for us to actually buy the sulfur and logistically better for us to buy the sulfur and convert it to acid.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Fair enough. And then maybe if I could ask a second probably question for Mark, any specific reason why gold recovery was down in third quarter at Grasberg?","Mark Johnson","Yes. As we work through this lower grade material in the pit, we also experienced lower gold recovery. It's expected. It wasn't a surprise to us actually. We were about 2% better than what we had modeled as far as mill recovery for gold. One of the characteristics of the Grasberg that works out mostly in our favor is that when we're in the very high grade areas, we get the highest grade copper recovery, the highest gold recovery and the best con grades and it was just part of the process to working through this lower grade phase that Richard described earlier.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Understood. Thanks guys.","Richard C. Adkerson","Higher grades make better miners.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning everyone. So you are saying better lucky than good, Richard?","Richard C. Adkerson","I don't think so. But it's great to be lucky and good. Jim Bob's on the line, but one of the first things he told me was luck is when preparation meets opportunity. So it's good we're lucky.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. Exactly. I just was wondering about your tripling agreement with Rio Tinto. As one of the previous callers mentioned the production specific before gold is very backend loaded in the years that you show here, '15, '16. So can you remind me what this tripling agreement for levels for copper and gold for Grasberg are please?","Richard C. Adkerson","It varies year-by-year, Oscar. So it's not something you can just say simply. It's disclosed in our 10-Ks, but that metal strip is the schedule that \u2013 the way we call it, was established back in 1994 when we negotiated the deal with Rio Tinto. And what we did then was we took the reserves that were in place at that point and the productive capacity that was in place at that point and agreed with them on how that would be produced year by year and then to the extent that actual production in any given year exceeds the metal strip, then that\u2019s shared 60-40. So Freeport gets all of the metals stripped plus 60% of the excess. And so it varies year by year extending to 2021. We\u2019ve made a couple of adjustments for force majeure type items and so forth, but we have those details in our documents and Kathleen\u2019s got\u2026","Kathleen L. Quirk","But just on average, Oscar, if you look at the 2013 to 2016 aggregate Grasberg production of 1.4, our share of that would be roughly 1.3, and at gold of 2.1 our share would be roughly 1.9. And as Richard said, it varies year to year, but they get 40% of the increment above what the strip is. And in year when we\u2019re below the strip like this year, we make that up first. But on average we will be getting 1.3 out of the 1.4 and 1.9 out of the 2.1 during this period of time.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks Kathleen. That\u2019s very helpful. That was the next question. So then maybe I get to ask another one. On 2012, your overall CapEx went down from $4 billion to $3.6 billion. Can you talk about the difference? Where was that change, because 2013 the CapEx stayed more or less the same, $4.6 billion now versus $4.5 billion in the previous outlook?","Kathleen L. Quirk","It\u2019s mainly a timing thing, Oscar, as we looked at where we were and look at the outlook for the year, mostly on projects moved into 2013 and some of the 2013 moved into 2014. So it's not a kind of across the board timing. We put together these forecast based on the best estimates, but sometimes these actual spends lie in the quarter or two and that ends up deferring money into next year and then we've got some that\u2019s deferred into 2014. So we are spending about $1.5 billion in sustaining capital and then the balance is in our projects.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","And Oscar, going into the fourth quarter, we'll be doing our companywide planning for our business. And so we'll be able to give you at our next update the results of our detailed planning exercise.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it, Richard. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody. Richard, I guess, my question is just on Indonesia. I guess you've deferred if I understood that correctly going underground by one year just because of the delays partly on the labor issues. But could you talk a little bit about from 2017, what the unit cost would look like out at Grasberg compared to sort of your I guess 2015 guidance which is your last data point there? And also talk about production that would be both in total and attributable to you guys?","Richard C. Adkerson","Jorge, we really haven't deferred the transition to underground. We've been talking about 2016 for a number of years now, so there has been no deferral for it. As a practical matter, as we get closer to that period of time, there will be some decisions made about what we actually do. So that's still before us, but our guidance right now is the same that it's been for years. Now, there is a lot of moving parts to this second question. As we finish mining in the pit and transition to the Grasberg Block Cave, which is directly under the pit, that will have a ramp up period. And one of our strategic challenges that we had for years was how to deal with the drop off production in the pit and then the ramp up of the underground. We've had some success in dealing with that and one of the big successes has been the additional reserves we've discovered in the DOZ, MOZ complex which we've advanced the development of so that that's going to come on stream before 2016 and offset the ramp up to a degree of the Grasberg underground. We've got stock piling plans. We developed the big Garson mine and so there will still be some ramp up effects, but it is not nearly as severe as our long-term plans once indicated. Now looking beyond the open pit area to the underground, Kathleen, you have some information on the unit cost?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Okay. Just in terms of the volumes that Richard was talking about, as we look at the ramp up period going from 2016 into 2025, we're expecting on average aggregate copper price \u2013 I mean copper volumes to be around the lower 1.4 and gold to be 1.8, which would \u2013 our share of that would be roughly 1.1 and 1.4 for copper and gold and then longer term we\u2019re expecting average in the whole underground era have an aggregate production of 1.6 and 1.4. As we look at costs underground, as we\u2019ve talked about on previous calls, we don\u2019t have the stripping to do. It\u2019s essentially all coming out as ore. And so we\u2019re able to \u2013 and these are large scale operations, and so we\u2019re able to have a very efficient cost structure. We\u2019re actually projecting costs in the underground era that will look very much like the type of costs on a net unit cost basis of what we\u2019ve enjoyed during the open pit era and would be significantly less than $0.40 per pound at current gold prices. So we\u2019re going to have a period of time in \u201816, \u201917 and \u201918 as we\u2019re ramping up where as the open pit depletes and we\u2019re not quite up to the 240 rates in undergrounds, we\u2019ll have some lower throughput, but as Richard said, we\u2019ve got high-grade material coming from Deep MLZ and so that transition in terms of metal production is better than what you\u2019ll see through the mill. But as we look forward, these underground projects are very, very attractive. The economics are compelling, some of the best in the company and we had a record during the third quarter in terms of development progress and we\u2019re very optimistic about being able to establish a very large scale low-cost underground operation.","Richard C. Adkerson","The other side of that timeframe is we should have some excellent years leading up to the depletion of the pit, because we'll have very high grades of both copper and particularly gold, we'll have low stripping, we'll be retiring equipment and so forth. So we'll have some \u2013 it should be some, very, very attractive times before the pit is depleted.","Mark J. Johnson","As Kathleen said, as we start up the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave, we start those off in the highest grade portion of the ore bodies. So as we are ramping tons up, we are experiencing some of the better grades available to us in both those deposits.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Thank you. And sorry, if I could follow up as well maybe with Richard. Just on your balance sheet, you are again positing a net cash positive result. Historically you've tended to do a little bit of top-up extraordinary dividend in the fourth quarter. Could you just talk about what your relative preference would be for returning cash to shareholders given that you did not pay an extraordinary last December or declare one? Would you favor now just increasing your base dividend as a way to return cash to shareholders? Or would you see still falling back on that kind of fourth quarter top-up as a way to kind of flare excess cash off?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, that's issues that our Board talks about and they\u2019ll be looking at those things. In the very near term our CapEx are going to basically be absorbing all of our cash flow generation at these prices, because of our CapEx situation. But as I said, financial policy is something that Board looks at, and they will be viewing investment opportunities in relation to available cash and deciding how to manage it. We have a long tradition of returning cash to shareholders as you noted.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Richard Garchitorena with Credit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena - Credit Suisse","Good morning everybody. Just a follow-up on that question. Given the sensitivity that your cash flows and EBITDA have to the expansions, the 50% increase that you highlighted as of 2015, 2016, how should we think about that and how would you think the Board would view that going forward just given the strong generation of cash flows at higher volumes over the next three, four years?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, we smile when we think about it. So it's going to give the Board a lot of opportunities in deciding this balancing of investment opportunities, returns of cash to shareholders. So it's \u2013 as a practical world these are based on models. We live in a complicated world today and so we're going to be focused on achieving these projects, which give us the opportunity to generate these volumes and then the market price of copper and gold, molybdenum and cobalt will determine exactly what those cash flows are. So we've got time now as we work through this and executing our plan and then the Board is going to have a lot of options to it in deciding what to do going forward.","Richard Garchitorena - Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And just one follow-up. On Tenke, obviously the sulfuric acid plant will be completed in 2015. When should we expect to hear an announcement on the next phase? Would it be when this current phase is complete and you're going through the plans for next year and the year after?","Richard C. Adkerson","We will give you a quarterly update of where we stand with our thinking on Tenke. It's not \u2013 we're going to be \u2013 the first thing now that we virtually completed this project is what it\u2019s actually going to do. Are we going to be able to optimize it as we did the initial project? I think our original design capacity for our mill there was 8,000 tons per day. It operated at 12,000 tons, which was a huge upside for us. So we were able to buy some additional mining equipment. That allowed us to expand processing equipment. So now I\u2019ve just got to tell you how proud I am of our team over there and operating in a challenging environment, as I am with the Americas which we\u2019ve done great and Indonesia, our team has met the challenges there in effective way. But the first step will be to see exactly how this system operates in the way you design systems. Your hope is, our experience has been is that you better than design and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see where that happens and then we\u2019ll go from there. In the meantime, we\u2019re going to be continuing to do a lot of drilling and to do a lot of metallurgical work on how long run to deal with this big sulfide next-door opportunity that we had and I would say our work over the past, year, 18 months has been very encouraging about that.","Kathleen L. Quirk","To just to come back to Tenke and the asset plans that Paretosh asked about, the plant that we are planning to come in in the 2015 timeframe would have a capacity of about 1,400 tons per day. The existing plant there has 800 tons per day, but the new plant will be similar size to our Safford acid plant that we put in recent years which has a similar capacity.","Richard Garchitorena - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Congratulations on all the good, hard work. I know all these projects can take a little time. I want to direct a question to Red about the Cerro Verde economics and I understand that 360,000 tons a day would be the biggest one in the world. But the grades at Cerro Verde aren't as good as the grades at Grasberg or Escondido or Chuqui when the big mill was built there or even Northern Dynasty, Pebble in Alaska that proposes a big mill. Why does Cerro Verde justify all your hard work and shareholders' precious capital? If you could explain it a little more fully. On the surface from a distance a cynic might say it's a marginal mine where the costs are going rise, and if don't triple it, you\u2019ll shut it down. You need the economies of scale to justify keeping it open because of the low grades and mining inflation.","Richard C. Adkerson","I will let Red respond to it and Red, just let me make an introductory comment. When we look at our reserves and resources and what we believe is a very positive long range view for copper markets, we want to position our company to take advantage of that and to do that, we need to make long term investment decisions that allows you to have the ability to deliver copper into the marketplace. And the two-edge sword for the industry is that you just can't increase capacity in a short period of time as you mentioned, John, and thank you for your comment. And so you want to position ourselves and that's what we're looking for with our capacity expansions is to position ourselves to deliver large volumes of copper into what we will do with long-term positive marketplace and to manage that we look at our assets on a portfolio basis. We wish every mine could be a Grasberg, but it can't. And the world is increasingly having to look to Cerro Verde type deposits for supplies of copper, and with Greenfield projects with a Cerro Verde type grade you had a big challenge in trying to do it. So we are seeing the investment of this as giving us the opportunity to have the chance to move forward this significant resource, have it available to the marketplace. If we have times as we faced in 2008 and 2009 of where the world turns against us, we have our business organized that we can adjust to that. So it's that balance of positioning yourself to take advantage what we believes the long-term positive market for copper and then manage yourself to deal with the short-term risks that are clearly evident in the world today. So Red I\u2019ll let you \u2013 but the decisions are made on a portfolio basis and not just on a mine-by-mine basis. Red?","Red Conger","John, just on a technical basis, you're absolutely right about the comparative ore grade. What we have going for us at Cerro Verde is a low string ratio compared to lot of other high grade mines we see around the world. And we have hydropower available to us in that part of the world which we \u2013 as part of our new plant we\u2019ve got additional hydropower contracted for the mine going forward. So those are the two big offsetting items that are favorable for us.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Red, what do you project the rates of return to be at $3, $3.50 copper for this $4.4 billion?","Red Conger","I'll let our Chief Financial Officer answer that question.","Kathleen L. Quirk","If we look at the breakeven of the project in terms of getting a 10% after-tax return, the price of copper is about $2.80,$2.85, and then of course as you move up to higher copper prices, at $4 copper, you are approaching 20% returns \u2013 after tax returns. So as we look the projects that we have currently, our Tenke project which is nearly complete is the most attractive on just a breakeven copper price. And then Morenci would be in between Tenke and Cerro Verde.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Thank you. I just want to say that sometimes we might listen to these conference calls and I appreciate the hard work you do. I have an investment in another company where the other shareholders got impatient and changed the Board and one of the guys went ahead and shut the headquarters and fired up most of the people and now the Directors are running it free, trying to do all the detailed work and they made me Chairman and I'm suffering for all my years of wise-ass remarks. So Red, I just want you to you know, I appreciate it, but I'm involved in a company where the shareholders went ahead and fired everybody because the CapEx was too high. Now I\u2019m suffering. ","Red Conger","All right John. Good luck to all of us. Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Could you talk to just more broadly the M&A environment and has recent commodity price volatility changed the landscape at all? And then, just kind of a following question to that, if valuations do become more attractive, how would Freeport weigh closely acquisitions over the organic growth opportunities the company is currently pursuing?","Richard C. Adkerson","Carly, I missed the first part of your question. Could you repeat that?","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs","Sure. So as far as the M&A environment and valuations, has recent commodity price volatility changed the landscape at all regarding valuations?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, the answer is yes. You can just look at share price performance over recent years. It's not just changing valuations, but also the uncertainties in today's world and I think has an impact on company's willingness to invest in projects pursue opportunities for M&A. As a company, we are constantly looking for opportunities. We have internal discussions. We have others proposing ideas. We talk about it with our Board. So, we always have our eyes open for opportunities. The base case for our company is one that's focused on organic growth and that opportunity became much more significant for us than we anticipated after we completed the Phelps Dodge deal. We looked at the economics of that deal on the basis of our positive view of our copper markets and their production profile. We've done a lot of work since then and have added 45 billion, 50 billion pounds of copper reserves that's given us a lot of internal growth opportunities. Lots of times in the M&A world, you can't predict opportunities that are going to come to you. We certainly didn't predict the timing or the opportunity for us to acquire Phelps Dodge. But the stars and moon \u2013 the stars aligned for us, financing market is aligned for us and we were able to do it. So we are always alert to opportunities. We have our base case for our Company that's very attractive and it's one that we are aggressively pursuing.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Wayne Atwell with Global Hunter Securities.","Wayne Atwell - Global Hunter Securities","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. There's been some labor issues in Africa. Can you talk to us about the tone of the labor relationship between you and the union where you currently operate?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah, it's a very difficult situation in South Africa. Other countries have had things. Our situation in the DRC with our labor group has been very positive. We just signed an agreement there. That country is one in which has very difficult financial situation. 65 million people with $12 billion to $14 billion of G&P. It's $200 a person. In the United States it's almost $50,000 a person. So in the community and with workers, people are very appreciative of what we\u2019re doing there. We made the largest investment so far in the history of the country. We\u2019re giving employment right now with construction workers. We have about 9,000 people working there. The vast majority of those are Congolese. We\u2019re doing community development. Government officials from the President to the Mines Minister to the Governor of Katanga are all very positive about what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re being sensitive to workers there, paying them well, providing benefits, and so far we\u2019ve had very good relations with them. This whole issue globally though with workforces is a challenge for the industry and one that\u2019s caused production disruptions, which has led to copper market implications and that\u2019s not likely to go away.","Wayne Atwell - Global Hunter Securities","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, thanks everyone for their attention.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are: Richard Adkerson, Red Conger, Mark Johnson, and Mike Kendrick. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook and will be using the prepared slide materials that are on our website. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $280 million or $0.19 per share for the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter results include net charges of $212 million or $0.15 per share for nonrecurring net charges that are detailed on VII of the press release which include a $188 million charge or $0.13 per share associated with accruals for Peruvian government claims associated with disputed royalty matters and $64 million or $0.04 a share charge for adjustment to environmental reserves.","After adjusting for these net charges, third quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $492 million or $0.34 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation or EBITDA for the quarter totaled $1.6 billion. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation on the last page of our slide deck.","For the third quarter of 2017, we sold consolidated copper sales of 932 million pounds, 355,000 ounces of gold, and 22 million pounds of molybdenum. Our average realized price for the third quarter was $2.94 per pound. That was 34% above the year ago quarter of $2.19 per pound. Our gold price averaged $1,290 per ounce. That was slightly below the year-ago period average of $1,327 per ounce.","Average net unit cash costs for the quarter were $1.21 per pound. Those were slightly higher than the year ago period of $1.14 per pound, primarily reflecting lower copper sales volumes. We generated strong operating cash flows during the quarter, which totaled $1.2 billion and those exceeded our capital expenditures of $308 million during the quarter.","We ended the quarter at September 30 with consolidated cash of $5 billion and consolidated debt totaling $14.8 billion. We had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility at September 30 and a strong liquidity position.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will provide additional details on our results, operations, and outlook.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you all for joining us on our call. Kathleen and I are speaking to you from Jakarta where we've made a series of trips this year to work with the Indonesian government on reaching a resolution of our issues involving our contract.","Our quarterly results I believe clearly show the strength of our company. During the third quarter we had strong cash flows generated by our operations which are characterized by very long lived assets. We have significant growth optionality that I'll be speaking about during our call today. And now we have the ability to consider these in light of our company's improved balance sheet and the improved copper market conditions. This will enable us to consider future actions to build incremental shareholder value. We're going to approach this in a very disciplined way as producers are throughout the industry.","But we have assets within our company that allow us to look forward to a period of future investment and future growth. During the quarter, we continue to advance our key 2017 goals. We're focused on safe and efficient operations, building long-term value through our operation of our business, production of our reserves, and focusing on our attractive portfolio of long-term copper assets. As I mentioned, we are working hard to resolve our long-term rights in Indonesia.","During the quarter, we generated almost $900 million of cash flows from operations in excess of our capital expenditures. And for the nine months to-date in 2017, we have approximately $2 billion of cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures.","We are benefiting from the positive copper market that has resulted in higher prices than many expected. The analysts who were predicting the so-called wall of copper have capitulated. We were always skeptical about this looming supplies but there are just underlying factors in the industry that continue to constrain supplies.","There's continued absence of major new projects, declining production from existing mines, exchange stocks remain historically low. And as we look forward into the future, there are looming significant deficits that will require significant investments to meet, to fulfill the global demand for copper and the prices required to meet that demand are significantly over $3 a pound. What's been a feature of the recent copper market has been positive copper demand globally. Around the world, manufacturing sectors are performing well. Chinese growth is exceeding expectations. And with the recent Congress of the Communist Party in China, the outlook for Chinese growth continues to be positive. Growth is continuing in Europe. And U.S. demand is solid with the prospects for future higher growth as the country addresses its tax situation and other regulatory issues that could unleash continued demand within the United States.","Wood Mackenzie, one of the industry's analysts, estimates 5 million tons of new copper projects are required over the next decade. The top 10 mines in the world today produce less than 5 million tons a year. So that shows the extent of the amount of copper projects that will be required to be developed.","As I mentioned, new mines require sustained copper prices of well over $3 a pound. The lead time for developing new projects which we know all too well is in the range of 7 to 10 years, and there are very few really world-class opportunities available. An emerging factor for demand in our industry is the electrification of automobiles. EVs are copper intensive. They consumer three or more times more copper than traditional petroleum-powered automobiles, and there's very strong potential for this marketplace. The world is now looking for really expanded growth over the next decade.","This will translate into significant incremental copper demand, and the prospects are there because of the economic and environmental benefits of electric vehicles of this evolving much quicker than people are currently estimating. This is clearly on an upward trend and not only automobiles themselves, but the support infrastructure for charging and electrical generation will require copper in significant amounts.","We are presenting a slide that we historically presented. I don't think we've used it quite as often recently. But on slide 6, we show the world's largest mines terms of reserves and in terms of 2017 estimated production. Our company has 2 of the top 10 in terms of reserves, 3 of the top 10 in terms of current production.","But we always point out the \u2013 to note the dates in which these mines were discovered. There simply has not been recent discoveries of world-class mines. And when we look at the opportunities today, they're in the nature of brownfield expansions of existing resources as opposed to looming major new world-class mines being available to the industry. All of this is very positive for market conditions and supports the industry from a supply standpoint in a way that's not typical for commodity producers.","When we look at our company situation, and look at the values that are available to us beyond our existing proved and probable reserves, we have optionality for future development which will be driven by our assessment of value creation in a disciplined way. But these are substantial additional potential from assets that we already own. We're going to remain disciplined, but these are important to looking forward to what the future of our company can be. In the United States, where we benefit from low energy costs, a flexible workforce, an improving regulatory environment, we have a very larger footprint for our large undeveloped sulfide resources.","These opportunities are supported by existing infrastructure, which would allow us to make expansions at a series of our mines in a low-risk, high-return environment. In South America, our large resource at our El Abra mine allows us to begin planning for a large-scale mill project to develop the significant sulfide resource we've identified over the last decade.","Currently, we're advancing technical studies. And this would be a project that would, in scope, would be similar to our Cerro Verde expansion that we were successfully able to complete and begin production on almost two years ago.","Cerro Verde has a large footprint, which will allow it to continue to produce for many years at high levels and low cost, and this would be true at El Abra. It would be an extensive project because we would need to desalinate seawater and transport it to the altitudes there, but it's a large opportunity for us that's very attractive in light of the future copper projects. It will be some time before we'll be going to our board for formal approval of this project, but we will continue to evaluate it.","We had a discovery in Serbia where we farmed out an upper zone to allow a smaller company to develop it and in connection with that development there continues to be drilling to the lower zone which is a large high-grade early stage opportunity where we have a significant interest and that has the opportunity to develop into a world-class mine.","The Grasberg district in Indonesia, beyond its very large proved and probable reserves, has significant mineralized material that we will continue to evaluate and bring into our mine plans as we go forward as economics justify it.","In Africa where we sold our Tenke Fungurume mine last year, we retained an exploration project that was nearby called Kisanfu. It is we believe the largest undeveloped cobalt deposit in the world. It has been drilled, permitted, and we are considering it either as a stand-alone project or to be built and to process for nearby operations. So, we have this great portfolio.","In the Americas, where we currently operate seven open-pit copper mines in the United States, along with two pure molybdenum mines in Colorado, we have two large-scale mines in South America. This is a really high-quality portfolio of assets. They currently have strong operating performance. We sold 674 million pounds of copper in the third quarter. The Cerro Verde concentrator averaged 379,000 tons per day. It's really amazing volume for this concentrator along with Escondida's concentrator. They're the two largest in the world.","We're continuing to focus on maintaining our cost position and managing CapEx, but as I mentioned, we're advancing studies for future growth and looking at this opportunity that we have with Cerro Verde in Chile. In the third quarter, we had $719 million of cash flows above CapEx in the Americas alone, and as we look forward, and in the nine months it was over $2 billion. And so, as we look at our business overall for the year we expect to have roughly 3.75 million pounds of copper sales and roughly 2.7 million pounds of that will come from our operations in the Americas outside of Indonesia.","So, we've got a great business in Indonesia but if you look at the operation in the Americas beyond Indonesia, you can see a business that has very substantial values in its own right. In the Americas with our Bagdad, our operations in New Mexico, at Chino\/Cobre mines, the El Abra operation in Chile, The Lone Star\/Safford resource that I'll talk about in Arizona, Morenci, Sierrita, this is a very unique portfolio. It's got 60 million pounds of 2P copper reserves \u2013 60 billion pounds of 2p copper reserves that would be developable at $2 copper. And then if you look at the mineralized material at $2.20 copper, you'd have twice that amount and looking at all of the potential that we have at these mines you get to a very large 266 billion pounds of copper.","So, what we have here is a company with very strong current production levels, attractive cost levels, and then built into our portfolio future growth levels. Lone Star, okay. So, Lone Star is a long identified resource that lies adjacent to our Safford mine in Eastern Arizona. It's just across the mountain, 17 miles from Morenci. We have two aspects to this opportunity. The first is a significant oxide project which we are proceeding towards utilizing the development of that oxide resource to use our existing infrastructure at the Safford mine where our oxide resources are being depleted.","We've attained the regulatory permits. This has very low execution risk since we we'll just be mining the oxide near-surface resource, transporting it to Safford where we'll use existing processing infrastructure. The estimated production is 200 million pounds a year. Got a 20-year life.","The capital costs are estimated at $850 million which essentially for mine equipment and preproduction stripping. Estimated unit cost would be $1.75 a pound. When we begin, it will take about three years to get it in production. It has a $2.40 breakeven price with an 8% return and then a value of $1 billion or more at current copper prices.","Now, besides being a good economic project for itself as the oxide resource, if you turn to page 14, you can see this schematic that shows that below the oxide cover, there is a very large potential sulfide. And you can see what our drilling to-date has identified as a defined ore body, but note that we've drilled deeper core holes that continue to find significant mineralization. To date, the resource that we've developed shows a potential for 60 billion pounds of contained copper. And what's happening is is this leach project through the oxides that we'll be processing will serve not only to generate profits by itself, but also serves to strip out the cover material for this sulfide operation and allow us to consider the development of a concentrator mill to take advantage of the chalcocite chalcopyrite sulfide resource that lies underneath the oxide cover, tremendous opportunity.","I mentioned El Abra a couple of times. It's a large, high-quality opportunity. The resource estimate is 2 billion pounds of 0.45% copper. Like Cerro Verde, a very large low-grade deposit that can be developed in a low-risk project. We're advancing technical studies. It would involve a 240,000 ton per day concentrator, which is similar to what we did recently at Cerro Verde. The production would be 750 million pounds a year, 68-year lead time including three to four years of feasibility study and permitting followed by construction.","We are looking at what we did at Cerro Verde, challenging our team to come up with ways of reducing capital of doing this on a very efficient basis. And we'll be keeping you informed as we go forward with these studies. There's a schematic for this ore body that's on page 13. You can see what to date, the drilling has identified as a mineralized material pit shell, reserve shell, but also note we continue to drill at depth and have positive drill results for mineralization that potentially can extend this ore body. Another great opportunity.","So, in Indonesia. At the end of August, after a series of meetings that we've been having during 2017, we, together with the government of Indonesia announced a framework for an agreement to resolve the dispute that we've been discussing for several years with the government.","We are seeking and the government of Indonesia is seeking \u2013 and the President was recently quoted on this \u2013 as finding a win-win solution. We've been engaged in discussions on progressing this framework agreement. Both the government and our company are highly motivated to resolve this, to eliminate the uncertainty and bring long-term stability of our operations which is in both parties' interest.","In the interim, as you'll see, our operations have been going well, much improved over what we've had in recent times and we're generating good cash flow out of existing operations. The framework agreement would involve converting our existing Contract of Work which was signed in 1991 to a special license in accordance with the Indonesian current mining law. This is called an IUPK. But the IUPK that we are negotiating with the government would provide our subsidiary, PT Freeport Indonesia, with long-term operating rights through 2041 and it would provide certainty of fiscal and legal terms during the term of that IUPK.","We have agreed to commit to construct a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of reaching a definitive agreement. This has been an important objective of the government of Indonesia, and we've agreed to meet that objective.","We've also agreed to divest to Indonesian participants 51% of the shares of PT-FI. Again, this was a primary objective of the government and we agreed to meet it, conditioned on our Freeport receiving fair market value for the interests that are divested, and that it be structured in a way that we, Freeport, continues to maintain control over operations.","This is a complex business, the development of the underground resources at Grasberg are of a scale that's never been done in the industry. It's located in a very remote place, in the highlands of New Guinea, in the province of Papua. Managing the operations, the capital project, environmental issues, the social issues associated with this project are complex. And for us to stay involved, Freeport is insisting that we maintain control of operations.","Where we are today is that we're actively engaged in negotiating documentation for this framework. There are complex issues involved in those negotiations, and not all of those have been resolved. But I am convinced that we have a mutual objective of reaching a resolution. The government recently extended our export ability through the end of this year and we are operating under the terms of our contract currently and operating very well, as you can see, in the cash flow chart presented on slide 14.","During the third quarter, we generated almost $600 million of operating cash flows compared with $176 million of CapEx and for the nine months this year, it's almost $1.5 billion of operating cash flows and less than $600 million of CapEx.","So, this is a great asset for the partnership between the government of Indonesia and our company and we are working hard to preserve that. The future of this company is going to be in the underground where we have had significant operations and have operated since early 1980s. The big underground project that we are currently working on is the Block Cave resource that lies directly beneath the Grasberg open pit.","Our plans call for us to complete the pit next year. And from that point forward, all the production would be from the underground. This will \u2013 our current project will allow us to begin block caving this resource in late 2018. We can't begin block caving until the open pit is finished. This will then lead to a ramp up over five or six years to annual production levels of a billion pounds of copper and a million ounces of gold. Truly a world-class operations.","The reserves from the Grasberg Block Cave approach a billion tons of copper at a grade exceeding 1% and with significant gold grades of 0.78. So, this is a tremendous physical project and world class in every respect, including the long life, low cost, and economic returns.","A schematic of the operations is presented on page 16. You can see the Grasberg open pit. The Block Cave is an extension of the resource we've been mining from the pit to levels that can most economically be mined underground. We're approaching this resource vertically to allow us to have access to it and process it.","We have additional resources that are potentially in our future, the Kucing Liar resource that's adjacent to the Grasberg Block Cave; the Big Gossan mine, which is a stoping mine that we've been producing. And then, set apart from the Grasberg complex is an underground resource that we began mining in the early 1980s. We've been continuing to extend this resource at depth, going from the original GBT block cave to the IOZ block cave that we began producing in the 1990s, to the DOZ mine in the 2000s. We started up the DMLZ mine two years ago and it's ramping up. And this will be important supplemental production to the Grasberg Block Cave, which will provide feed for our mill at rates well over 200,000 tons of feed per day, approaching 240,000 tons per day.","So, what does this mean for Indonesia? Despite the current controversy and so forth and some of the issues, operationally and with government regulations in recent years, this has been a very positive historical partnership. Freeport began operating there over 50 years ago. Since the new contract in 1991, we've contributed $60 billion to Indonesia's GDP. We're by far the largest private employer in Papua and we're significant economically to the region. We're well over 90% of the GDP of the Mimika province where we operate, Mimika Regency.","We're one of the largest tax payers in all of Indonesia. Since we began operating, we've generated significant taxes, royalties and dividends. The government of Indonesia on the existing contract has gotten in excess of 60% of those revenues versus the dividends that have been paid to Freeport. This, by the way, is the most favorable deal with the government of any place we operate in the world and arguably the most favorable of any country in the world.","In addition to that, beginning in 1996, to support the local community, we've been contributing 1% of our revenues through a special partnership fund for the local communities and that has accumulated almost $700 million for community health, education and welfare projects.","When we look at the current contract, going forward to its end in 2041, future taxes, royalties and dividends at $3 copper, $1,200 gold would exceed $40 billion. This is a major asset for Freeport, but a major asset for the country of Indonesia. And we all recognize that. And we all recognize the best thing for both parties is to reach an amicable resolution, avoid the necessity of our having to try to enforce our rights through arbitration, which is our fallback alternative that neither of us wants to do. And so, we have great incentive to solve it. We just need to continue to work cooperatively to do that and that is our goal.","Turning to our outlook, and I mentioned we expect to produce 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces, 94 million pounds of molybdenum, this is consistent with our prior outlook. Our site production and delivery costs before byproduct credits at $1,300 gold, $8 molybdenum, would be $1.59. After byproduct credits which are the gold in Grasberg and molybdenum in our Americas business, would be at $1.19, again consistent with previous outlooks, and this would include at $1,300 gold for the fourth quarter net unit costs of less than $1 a pound.","At $3 copper, this would generate $4.3 billion of operating cash flows, each $0.10 change in copper means $80 million to us. Our current capital expectations for the year are $1.5 billion including $900 million for major projects, $700 million for the underground development at Grasberg, and $600 million for other mining Again, all this is roughly consistent with prior guidance.","So, looking at our sales outlook on slide 19, last year, we had 4.65 billion pounds of copper. That included assets we that sold: the Tenke Fungurume mine in Africa; and an additional interest in our Morenci mine to our partner, Sumitomo, in Arizona. Net of those volumes that were included in this number for last year we'd have been at 4.17 billion.","You see our outlook for 2017 is 3.7 billion, 3.9 billion for 2018. The average for the next three years is 3.7 billion. 3.19 billion is a year of transition. It's expected to be below that average, and it would be about 3.5 billion pounds. As we complete mining the open pit, our gold sales will increase 1.6 million this year, 2.4 million next year, and then the three-year average beyond 2018 would be 1.2 million ounces of gold.","Now, that would generate at copper prices varying between $3 and $3.50. As you can see on slide 20, $1,300 gold, $8 moly, EBITDA of $6.4 billion. This is an average of 2018-2019 of $6.4 billion to $8.2 billion over that price range and cash flows of $4.4 billion to $5.7 billion. Strong cash flows and to point out 2018 will be higher than this two-year average.","You can see our capital expenditure management depicted on slide 21. Last year, it was $2.8 billion including $1.2 billion for our discontinued oil and gas business. This year, it's $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.8 billion for 2018 and 2019. This includes roughly $800 million a year for our Grasberg underground development. You will see that other minings increases \u2013 has increased, as we were dealing with the financial issues associated with our high debt levels. Following the one gas deal, we really squeezed stay-in-business type capital expenditures, and we've got some catch up to deal with going forward. And you can see that's increased from $600 million by $500 million to $1.1 billion in 2018.","Now, a slide that I particularly like to see is how we've been successful in delevering our business. We went in to 2016 with over $20 billion of debt. In our fourth quarter earnings call in January of 2016, when the price of copper was roughly $2 a pound and many experts were projecting it to be, to fall below $2 and stay low for a number of years.","We made a \u2013 we set a goal to reduce our debt level by $5 billion to $10 billion over the two years ending at the end of 2017. By the end of 2016 by, through our asset sales and through raising some capital, we have reduced debt to $12 billion at 09\/30 it's less than $10 billion. And you can see by the end of 2017, at $3 copper, it would be approximately $9 billion. And we will continue until we make decisions to do otherwise through capital investments or shareholder returns to apply excess cash to reduce debt. And if we meet our plan, which we have confidence in doing and if copper prices average $3 or $3.25, you can see that by the end of 2018, our debt levels would be returned to very low levels.","And this, as I said, allows our board to consider disciplined reinvestment opportunities and we look forward to returning this company to a position of paying dividends, returning cash to shareholders. We have a very positive long-term outlook for our business. The thing that has sustained us through the concerning period of time when our debt was so high and markets were weak has been a consistent positive long-term outlook for our business, our assets, our people and the copper markets.","And that's what we keep talking with each other about. We have a great morale within our company, great capabilities, great assets. And we are an industry leader in our industry with experienced people, operators and developers. We've got a great long-life geographically diverse portfolio of assets. And now, we're once again financially strong. So, this optimism about our future is nothing but reinforced.","So, thank you for your attention. I know you have questions and we look forward to hearing them.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello, Richard and Kathleen. How are you?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Hey, Mike. We're okay.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Good. A question on Grasberg and the negotiations with Indonesian government. When you guys announced the framework, a lot of the reports coming out from the Indonesian government was that Freeport has agreed to sell down to below 50%. And when you put up the notice and said we're willing to sell down below 50%, obviously, at a fair market value.","And there's been reports from the \u2013 quoting people in the government talking about value shouldn't include reserves. And I'm just thinking about valuation parameters to get real value for Freeport. First of all, it's hard enough to come to a conclusion on what copper price to put in when valuing Grasberg. But how do you deal with a situation where, supposedly, the government is thinking about not including the reserves?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, we \u2013 so, the background for that, Mike, is in Indonesia the government owns the resources. Now, that's true with governments around the world. Around the world, governments own the resources and even in the United States, of course, significant resources are on federal and state lands and all the oil resources in the offshore Gulf of Mexico or offshore anywhere are actually owned by the federal government.","And governments give operators like Freeport in Indonesia the rights to operate and develop and produce those reserves. And so, any valuation that we are talking to the government about would involve the value of our business today including our rights to develop, operate and produce resources that we have identified through our past exploration and development operations.","For example, we have already spent besides the infrastructure that we put in place to enable our operations to continue, in recent years, we've invested $6 billion of capital to develop these underground reserves that will essentially be produced beyond 2021. So, any view of valuation of our business would have to take into account the rights that we have beyond 2021 to 2041. And in our discussions, the government recognizes that.","You mentioned copper prices. We had this same issue of dealing with views of copper prices last year and our negotiations with China Molybdenum on Tenke Fungurume and with Sumitomo on Morenci. That was during the first half of 2016 when the world's view of copper prices were decided more pessimistic than they are today.","But I think many people were surprised that we were able to, in that environment negotiate deals that were positive for our company in terms of the valuations that we recognized. And we are approaching these negotiations in the same way.","Indonesia is a country that has \u2013 it's a democracy now. It has free press. There's opportunities for many people who may be in government or of influence to speak to the press. Often, the comments you see are made by people who are not involved in the negotiations, just like you read comments in the United States on matters and you have to take into account the source of the comments.","But I can tell you that we are working positively and amicably with the representatives of the government. At the same time, we are going to be relentless in representing the interest of our shareholders. And so, we're not in a position of where we have to concede to unreasonable positions, and we are not going to do that.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And assuming you could come to an agreement on value, it would seem that the raw of size of that value to sell to the private sector would be enormous. Would the government buy that position from you directly and then sell it to the private sector over time because it seems like that would be a big chunk to sell to someone in the private sector today?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, there \u2013 we're talking with the government now about not only valuation, but the structure of the process for selling these interests. And that includes the alternative of the Government of Indonesia through potentially a state-owned enterprise of acquiring and holding this interest.","There's also under consideration, the provision of a portion of this interest for the province of Papua. The Indonesian economy has grown, Mike, as you know. And there are substantial private business interests here, who have the financial capability of doing large-scale transactions. It's unclear whether all of this would be done to a single buyer. We have suggested to the government that the first step that should be considered in our view, would be an IPO of the interest on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, which has developed into a large liquid marketplace.","To-date, there's been reluctance on the government to accept our suggestion. My point is there are a number of alternatives to deal with this issue of the structure and timing of divestment and that's one of the issues that we're having these current meetings about.","Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","All right, Mike. Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO. Please go ahead.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions, and first of all, congrats on hitting the targets this quarter as well. Somewhat related to the previous questions. I did want to ask, just a clarification on the wording of the press release and the commentary in Indonesia. It says the parties continue to negotiate documentation on a comprehensive agreement. And obviously, that goal is to complete the required documentation by 2017. So, I just want to clarify, will that documentation by the end of this year include definitive agreements and definitive plans on things like the structure and the timing of the divestment and the construction of the smelter or is that documentation going to be something else?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No. The final documentation would address those issues, all of those. It would be a comprehensive conclusion to the issues that we've talked about with the August framework agreement, and we are working with the government to have a complete resolution of those issues. And the current goal that we're both working under is by the end of the year. So, there's an agreement to take future steps like building the smelter, undertaking the divestment, but it would be a comprehensive and final agreement.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you for clarifying that. And then just somewhat related, can you remind us again, when do the capital spending deferrals\/reduction decisions for the underground development, when do those really need to be made? How much of an impact would those have on the 2018 to 2022 mine plan that's been laid out and when would that start to really cut into that mine plan?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","We have, David \u2013 earlier this year, we have slowed some of the spending \u2013 we cut the spending in the underground by about 25% and you saw the impacts of that earlier this year. We are continuing to spend at a reduced level to prepare the Grasberg Block Cave for startup when the open pit is completed late next year. And, economically, that's what makes the most sense. As you can see from the numbers, the investments that we're making are less than actually the cash flows being generated from the business. So, the business is generating more cash flow than what we're reinvesting currently. But we could make a decision if we reach an impasse to suspend those investments and those would have an impact on our production because the Grasberg Block Cave starts to ramp up during 2019, and as Richard said earlier, if eventually it gets to over a billion pounds of copper a year and over a million ounces of gold. And so that would get pushed out.","So, economically, we're incented to continue to make those investments, but we're not going to make them if we reach an impasse and have to go in another direction. But, at this point, our belief is that we'll get this resolved and be able to continue to proceed with our long-term investment plan.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, would that effectively tie in to that 2017 year-end timeline?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, it's a continual thing, Dave. In other words, if we run into an impasse, which we don't expect before the end of the year, then we would take those actions. Our goal is and the government is supportive of this goal of getting this resolved by end of the year. If we are continuing to make progress and for whatever reason it's not done then, then we'll assess that circumstance when it comes about.","But we've been talking about this so long and I recognize that all you have heard so much about this, but we really see the most positive objective that we've seen by the government in reaching a resolution. And, now, not only do we have a sense of urgency to do that, we're seeing that on the government's side as well.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thanks. That's helpful.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","All right, Dave. Thank you for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. My question is around Grasberg as well. In the framework where you discuss divesting your ownership down, the PT-FI ownership down, I guess, to 49%, how does that work with the Rio Tinto JV, i.e., with their 40% kicking in, I think, around 2023, does that mean you would drop down to an effective 29% stake starting around 2023?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, just for everybody's information, the project out there and the contract itself is actually a joint venture between us and Rio Tinto. It's a complicated joint venture agreement that was negotiated in the mid-1990s. And under that agreement, Rio Tinto has the right to come in now at roughly, say, 2022 for a 40% joint venture interest.","Rio Tinto faces a similar divestiture obligation that PT-FI faces. And PT-FI's interest currently, the government has a 9.36% interest, so PT-FI has roughly over \u2013 FCX has roughly over a 90% interest in PT-FI which would, after Rio Tinto comes in, represent a 90% interest in 60%. And so, after that, if we divest 51%, our interest would be in PT-FI's operations, 49% of 60%.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","49% of 60%.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's where the 29% is coming in. But one thing you should appreciate is the cash flows between now and that timeframe where it dropped to 60%, essentially, close to 100% going to Freeport. So, there's differences between the two interests, and we're generating a substantial amount of free cash flow within that timeframe between now and 2022.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","I see. And with respect to potential funding for the smelter, I don't believe that's in your CapEx guidance moving forward. How much would that add if that smelter was approved, say, for 2018-2019?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The smelter itself is estimated to be \u2013 if we do it on our own \u2013 a $2.5 billion to $3 billion project. Our intention would be \u2013 and this only gets built after we reach a long term agreement with the government. That's one of the issues that we would be dealing with with the government, and it's not something that we can start developing until the long-term agreement is reached.","And so, our framework calls for a five-year period after signing the final agreement. We would structure the ownership interest in the smelter in the way of equity partners contributing equity, and then obtaining financing \u2013 debt financing for a substantial portion of the cost of the capital. So, the amount of capital that would be required to be contributed by PTFI would be reduced by the debt financing that would be negotiated with it and the equity participation of partners. We are in discussions with an Indonesian company called Amman which acquired Newmont's Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and they have plans to develop a smelter and we are in discussions with them about potentially doing a joint venture project for a larger smelter with them, and in that case, they would be a partner in the project as would we and we would have a copper concentrate supply agreement with them, that would have to be appropriately structured.","So, there's a number of moving parts here with how we proceed with the smelter project. Including the size, the location, the potential partnership with Amman that all would be triggered by the completion of our negotiation on the global contract resolution.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. But on a kind of high level basis, if you're divesting your ownership stake and then Rio Tinto's got a 40% JV, is it conceptually correct that Freeport might only have to fund 29% of the total CapEx, like excluding any \u2013 where the funding is coming from?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, it would be PT-FI would be funding it. And if you look through PT-FI to Freeport's net interest in that, you're correct.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Now, one of the conditions that we are \u2013 as part of the global agreement that this is another current point of discussion is while we've agreed to divest 51%, our position is, is that we maintain control over operations and the company. And so, even though we would only own 49%, with that control, we expect that we would continue to consolidate PT-FI in our financial statements.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","I see. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Hi, everybody. Excuse me. Just on \u2013 getting back to that Rio situation relative to Grasberg. I mean, like, the way that I thought about it was that there's a certain net present value that can be attributed to \u2013 for Grasberg that can be attributed to Freeport and a certain net present value of the mine that can be attributed to Rio based on the cash flows that each entity would be receiving during the years in which Freeport owns 90.6% and Rio \u2013 and then during the years in which Freeport has, what, the 50%, whatever percent, based on the current structure. And so, then, like, therefore, if there were a divestiture under the current scenario that it could end up such that Freeport would end up having, at the end of the day, still more than that 30% because, currently, the way that I calculate it is that the net present value of Grasberg is something like 65% to Freeport currently and 35% to Rio. So that if there were \u2013 if there were a divesture now of a certain portion of the value to Indonesian entities that it wouldn't be like if \u2013 that Rio wouldn't get 40% of your 50% kind of thing. You know what I mean?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No no no. Yeah. First of all, we would not agree with your PV analysis.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay. But we're not in a position to disclose that, but I'm just going to comment on that. So, all I'll tell you to do is think again.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And then, you have one contract where you have currently two assignees of interest in that contract. Rio Tinto has an assignment and PT-FI has an interest. We are negotiating on behalf of PT-FI and the Indonesians, as part of our deal, we're agreeing to a divestment. The Indonesians will also be looking at Rio Tinto's interest and expecting a divestment of that interest.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And so, while there is 60\/40 beyond 2022, as Kathleen said, and it will depend on copper prices and so forth, but there's substantial values between now and 2022 that'll be going to PT-FI that will not be going to Rio Tinto.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Rio Tinto has some obligations to contribute capital. They will get some dividends going forward. But the bulk of the dividends would be coming to PT-FI. So, the relative values are affected particularly when you look at the present value calculation.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","By the fact that near-term cash flows are going to PT-FI, longer term, Rio Tinto comes in for a 40% interest, but that's subject to divestiture as well.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","I will tell you this, Rio Tinto has the right, under our joint venture agreement, of approval for any changes we make to the contract.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","We've had an extraordinary positive relationship with Rio Tinto. They've been great partners. We feel an obligation to be good partners to them, and this has been going on now for 20 years. And we will work together to achieve the mutual goal of building values in this asset that would benefit both parties.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It's not a question of competing interest with us versus Rio Tinto.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. So, right. So, it's not \u2013 so, again, I mean, I guess I was thinking about it wrong in that after 2022, the way that you understand it now is that Freeport will own that 29%. But before or through 2022, Freeport will have, under the current scenario, 90.6% of the cash flows from Grasberg.","But after this agreement, will have \u2013 like after this agreement is struck, will have only 49% after its...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, as I mentioned, one of the matters under discussion...","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...is the process and timing for divestitures.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","We're not talking about a divestiture at one point in time, but a series of steps towards that. And we have not yet agreed on that, but it's not likely that you would expect Freeport to retain 90% through 2022. But it's also likely that there would be steps taken along the way to work towards that goal.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. All right. Okay. Thanks. And then, a quick question is in terms of the ability to IPO a portion of Grasberg on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, how much do you think you could \u2013 how much liquidity could the market bear at this point do you think, of Grasberg stock? So, could there be a $1 billion issuance, do you think, or...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes. The exchange has had offerings of that size and slightly more. We were suggesting perhaps a 10% float of an IPO.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And that would be an amount that would be in excess of $1 billion.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","There's one more point that I think is important to build into your analysis, is that as we divest, we are going to be receiving fair market value for the divested interest.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Right. Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And so, while our interest in the participation in Grasberg would be reduced, we would be receiving cash from that interest, which would reduce our exposure to Indonesia. There's positives and negatives to that. But it would provide cash for us to supplement achievement of our financial goals for the rest of our business.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Yeah. That's the idea right, getting the full value or the fair value of the full value is what you've been talking about.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Exactly.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay, great. Well, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Thanks for taking my call.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Hey Chris.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","It seems like the biggest issue regarding Indonesia is just the bid\/ask spread around the majority stake. And back in early 2016, you had said that you valued all of PT-FI at something slightly above $16 billion. There were some reports at the time that Indonesia had said that it was worth about $6.5 billion. I think you had said that that was never a formal response from Indonesia.","And in fact, as far as I know, you've not gotten a formal offer from them yet. Recently though, the Mining Minister of Indonesia said that based on Grasberg being 40% of your profits and based on your $20 billion market cap, that would imply that your ownership stake in Grasberg is worth about $8 billion. And there were some reports as well that he said, we understand that to buy a majority stake, we'd have to pay some premium to that.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay, well, Chris...","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Is that not accurate \u2013 that's just some reports from Indonesia. Just want to get the facts. (1:08:16)","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The press report was accurate. But think about this, and I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with Grasberg being 40% of Freeport's assets. That's just \u2013 that's what he said. But you wouldn't apply the 40% to the equity value. It would be to the enterprise value. So, besides the $20-plus billion of equity value now, we have $10 billion of debt. And so...","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...that 40% would be applied to $30-plus billion. And that represents 90% of PT-FI because the government owns 9.36%.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, you'd have to gross it up for that 10% to get a number that would be comparable to our $16 billion number.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Right. So, your $16 billion is for 100% of PT-FI. Their $8 billion for the 90-plus percent stake, implies $8.8 billion for 100%. Regardless of how they got to that number, I guess...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, before you say that, just remember, that if you're talking about the percent of an asset to an enterprise, it's not logical to look at the equity market value, you need to look at the enterprise market value. So, with the equity plus debt, so it would be $30-plus billion. And following that analysis, you would say 40% of $30-plus billion is over $12 billion, that's 90%. So, you need to gross that up to 100%. So, you'd get to something over $13 billion.","Now, I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with that analysis, but I'm just saying to be a logical analysis, that's the process you'd have to go through.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","But I guess my point is that...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, the difference between those two is not as great as the press accounts would have shown.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Right. But I guess my question is, regardless of how we got to that number, the point is, he did say $8 billion for the 90-plus percent stake. And then, I think he also said that some premium for a majority ownership might be required. The question really comes down to whether or not that offer is on the table to Freeport. Is that something that they've presented to you? And then...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No. No. And in fact \u2013 well, let's see, now I've got it. That's not what the government would say today...","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...even in talking about it. I mean, they recognized what I've just said about the different in equity value and enterprise value. But we are working with the government. They have indicated fair market value is the right standard, and now we've got to negotiate what that fair market value is just as we had to negotiate with China Moly and with Sumitomo and with others who were trying to look at buying our assets.","So, we've had a lot of experience with this. They're going to get expert financial advice, and we will sit down and find out \u2013 and determine what's a fair value. Again, we believe the best way to do it is to allow us to do an IPO on the exchange. And that way, the market determines it. They so far have been reluctant to do that. So, we will engage in these discussions but it will be on a rational basis for coming up with a fair market value.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Do you think that the $16 billion estimate that you've provided in January or February 2016 is a stale number now that copper markets have improved, and you've invested more in the asset. In other words, in your mind, is $16 billion too low now?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, the $16 billion number, just like in our 2016 transaction, was not a number that was based on the then-existing copper price. It was based on what people like Wood Mackenzie, sell-side guys like yourself what your outlook for copper prices were. So since that time, we have updated that valuation. It's part of private discussions with the government. You'd have to take into account we've produced a year-and-a-half of those values in our current operations and received cash for it. We've had some adjustments to our mine plans and the copper prices are what they are. So, we're at a number but in terms of what you're perceiving to be significantly higher, there are some things going in the other direction that affect that number as well.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","And I'm sorry, just one last quick one for me. So, let's assume that an IPO is ultimately not an option, therefore, it's about a negotiation and the bid\/ask spread, it never closes. In other words, you can never come to an agreement. Would Freeport, and this might be too hypothetical to answer, but would Freeport be willing to accept an offer that is below what you deem to be fair market value in order to avoid the potential lose-lose scenario of arbitration. In other words, is there an opportunity cost to not getting it done even if you accept a price lower than you'd like.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Now, Chris, if you were in my shoes, would you answer that question?","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","No. Hypothetical, sorry.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, I'm not going to answer the question. And I'll also point out that the $16 billion number that we disclosed there was 100%, we own 90% of that value. Because the government already owns 9.36%. Okay. That's just a fact.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Thank you for that.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please go ahead.","Andreas Bokkenheuser - UBS Securities LLC","Actually, all of my questions were answered. So, thank you very much. Appreciate the clarity.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay, Andrew (sic) [Andreas], thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes. Good morning, everybody. So, Richard, you drew a couple of parallels to negotiations that took place in 2016 which were all market-driven, in my opinion. So, would you say you have agreed with the government of Indonesia on the set of assumptions that go into fair market value?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Not yet. I mean, we've agreed on a concept of fair market value, but that's been part of the process of getting to where we are now. And so, the next stage is to deal with those parameters.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. And then, here we are kind of at the midpoint between the framework agreement in late August and the end of year. And what progress would you say has been made since the announcement of the framework agreement?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Let's see. Kathleen is going to kick me, but not as much as I'd hoped for. But I think the clarity of the government's desire, and sense of urgency for reaching a deal has \u2013 that was my hope when we announced the framework, and I think that is coming into play.","We've made a good bit of progress on \u2013 and all of these things are incredibly complex, but we've made a good bit of progress on fixing the financial and the fiscal and legal terms for the extension.","We're still having discussions on the form of that. We are working to get that documented in a contractual agreement between us and the government that gives us the ability to defend that and not be subject to future changes in laws and regulations.","So, that's the place where we've made the most specific progress. We still have to firm up the form of that. But the big issues on divestment, the valuation issue we've made progress in dealing with this issue that was raised earlier about not considering reserves, I think Mike Gambardella raised in the first question the issue about whether it's to 2021 to 2041. All of those things we've made progress with the teams we're taking to with Indonesia.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on the Rio point. So, if the Government of Indonesia were to buy Rio's stake hypothetically, would that satisfy your portion of the local ownership rules?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, there's kind of two aspects to that. I mean, there is a possibility that Rio could stay involved. In other words, they could continue to own 49% of their interest. They publicly commented on questioning whether they would do that or not and if they do decide to exit we would work with them to achieve their objectives and then work with the government to see how that would fit in to our overall divestment situation.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. Great. And then.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","I can't say more than that but that's part of the discussions.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And then I have a quick operational question as well. Last quarter, you mentioned some seismic activity in the DMLZ zone and I don't think it was mentioned at all this time, could you give us a quick update on where that stands?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Sure. We did alter our plans last quarter, as we mentioned, and this is one of the things, going back to Chris's question, about how this affects value. But we altered our plans and the effect of which was to slow down some of the near-term production in the Deep MLZ. And we have followed those plans, feel good about the progress we're making in terms of the plans and the ultimate resolution of that. But the reason is not highlighted in our report is that we've operated according to plan that we set out going into third quarter. And Mark Johnson, you're on the call. I think that summarized it but if you have anything to add, feel free to.","Hey, Mark. Are you there?","Operator","Mark's line is on mute. Mark, could you unmute your phone? Okay. I opened your line.","Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay. Yes. Richard, you're right. After the June event in Deep MLZ, we came out with a revised plan that had two months of undercutting, a focus on the undercutting. We're nearing the end of that undercutting activity. The mine's performed well. We haven't had any unexpected seismic activity. We expect in mid-November after we continue to assess the situation that we would initiate a period of production. So we're feeling confident that the changes that we made to the plan, that the mine's reacting well, and we're on schedule.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Great. Well, thank you, everybody, and good luck.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Richard and Kathleen and thanks for taking the time to do the call from Indonesia. Just a quick follow-up on Grasberg. I think at some point we had seen a local media article that had suggested that Freeport might give up the right to international arbitration as part of the new framework. That seems very unlikely given your previous very clear comments on that issue. But could you just quickly comment on that? Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No. That's part of our position when we use the term legal certainty in talking about the extension with fiscal and legal certainty that means defining taxes royalty in fiscal terms and legal enforceability which would include international arbitration.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just turning elsewhere, with copper back above $3 a pound, is there any \u2013 been given any consideration to resuming full mining rates at El Abra and what would be the cost of doing that? Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, at El Abra, it's really not really a significant cost in doing it. I mean, we have reduced mining rates, so there would be some incremental cost, but it's not significant. What's really factoring into that is the planning we're doing about the major project and when that might be commenced. We haven't \u2013 as I keep emphasizing, we haven't made that decision. We have a lot of work to do before we do that. But part of the mine rate decision is more coordinating that with the potential commencement of the major expansion project.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And, Alex, as you remember, we had cut back production at El Abra and also at Sierrita. We've been gradually bringing some of that back on and again doing it in a manner that would allow us to continue to preserve our operating cost position. And, also, part of the reason why we cut back was to defer capital spending. So, we are bringing some of it back on line, but we're doing it in a very careful manner so that we don't alter in any significant way our cost structure or capital spending plans.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, just very quick on Cerro Verde. If I remember right, Cerro Verde hasn't been paying a dividend to its shareholders for a while, given the expansion and the spending there. Is there any timing on when Cerro Verde is expected to resume paying cash dividends to shareholders? Thanks.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That is under consideration. As you've seen, you know we did complete the expansion and we refinanced the loan at the Cerro Verde level, which allowed us to repay shareholder loans that were made from the shareholders to advance into Cerro Verde to fund some of that project. And so, we do believe we will be in a position to resume dividends at Cerro Verde, and that's under consideration as we review the outlook, you've probably seen in the press release the royalty matter which has created some uncertainty in terms of the timing of when any payments would have to be made in connection with that. But even after the royalty matter, we do believe we'll have flexibility to resume dividend payments at Cerro Verde. And so, we're currently assessing the timeframe and the extent of those dividends.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just on the royalty, I think in the slides, you said you paid $135 million so far. Is that against the total amount or against your net amount?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's of the gross amount. So, that's the amount at Cerro Verde that's been paid.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And that's an accrual.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","But we have been paying \u2013 we've paid $135 million under the installment method towards that.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Kathleen and Richard. Thank you again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Hi. I'm thinking about dividends as I ask the question. In terms of the Kisanfu exploration project, the Serbian deep stuff, smelter in Indonesia, the heap leach at Lone Star, the sulfide mill at Lone Star or the sulfide mill at El Abra. Are all of those things likely to be 2020 or later outlays that really don't influence the decision as to how much of a dividend to pay in 2018? And could you just talk to the question of dividends. Happy days are here again.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, the answer is yes to your first question. Those are 2020 projects and beyond. The big issue on dividends rest with our success in reaching a resolution on this Indonesian question. And so, as we go forward, with success on that and with copper to markets which we believe will be positive, we'll be looking at debt levels with potential for capital spending. And we will be, what can I say, I'm confident our board will be very positive about paying dividends when the stars align.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","So, the bond rating agencies might be, in a way, pleased if a quarter or two is going to go where you just put all the cash to reducing debt while you're settling those affairs.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, I can tell you that the bond rating agencies are extraordinarily pleased with what we've done over the past almost two years now and in seeing where we are and the cash we're generating. And like you say, if we continue to reduce cash, we get Indonesia settled, we will be in good shape with the rating agencies even with beginning to pay a dividend.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay, John. Thanks for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from me. Just in terms of the export license that you've renewed until the end of 2017. Just curious on that, normally it's a six-month renewal, I think going back over the last couple of years. Was that your call or the government's call to try to just lock that in, and I assume that's to try to push the agenda along on settling this dispute. Is that how we rate it or how did that come about?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's exactly right, and it was a mutual decision.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then, you've touched on the Grasberg CapEx what you're spending now and then going forward only a couple of questions earlier. And it doesn't look like you've changed the guidance at all for that. But based on the 2Q presentation and the 3Q, there's a small adjustment down in 2019. It's only minor from 0.8 billion pounds down to 0.7 billion. Is that just around the edges or has there been any change, I guess, in the last three months to what you're actually spending on the underground or it is still like Kathleen said, about 25% down on the start of the year what you're expecting?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, we go through a process every quarter. We don't \u2013 here at Freeport, we don't have an annual planning process. We have a detailed review of capital allocation, capital spending every quarter. We meet with all of our mine managers and review results and outlooks. And we challenge people on capital spending, and we defer wherever we can.","So, particularly in Indonesia, we want to \u2013 we're making efforts to reduce capital spending to the maximum level we can while achieving our objectives of moving forward these projects so that we could begin caving at the end of next year.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","But the production change you're talking about is just that. It's around the edges, rounding numbers change in 2019 and over the five-year period, there really wasn't a significant change in the overall copper or gold production or a significant change in spending.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Understood. I recognize that moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter and I think it's done that in the past. So, I was just trying to check whether the last, say, three months anything has moved on the underground. And then the last question I had just on Lone Star, the $850 million CapEx, do we think about that as being mainly spent in 2019, 2020 or into 2021 or what's the profile on that?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well it depends on when we start it. But it's roughly three-plus years. And the bulk of it is for mining equipment and to start the pre-production and stripping. But you could spend roughly $800 million of the total in 2018, 2019, and 2020 ratably if we were to move forward in the next several months, but it's still under consideration at this point.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's all for me. Thanks. Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Hi, guys. Just in terms of the capital spend that you are deciding, whether Grasberg gets resolved or not, and it's good to see that there's other projects that could surface value within the company. Kathleen just mentioned 2018, 2019, and 2020 for CapEx in Lone Star, is that based on a go ahead or not go ahead decision in Grasberg?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No. No. We're at the point now with our improvement in our debt levels in our balance sheet, that that's an independent decision. So, going forward on Lone Star is not dependent on having success with Grasberg.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then \u2013 I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No. I was just going to say it fits in with the timing of the declines in the Safford and how to best maximize the NPV of the project in connection with the expected production at Safford because what we're doing really is leveraging the existing infrastructure.","And so, as long as that infrastructure is being used for already developed reserves, we're better off deferring the spending at Lone Star. But we're getting to the point now \u2013 and we've gotten the permits, et cetera. We're going to the point now where we can see line of sight in terms of when those two intersections will cross. And so, we are going to be considering with our board the timing of that project.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","According to your 10-K the life in Safford ends in 2024, so you're saying that the new or the greater Lone Star are better than what you're currently mining?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. And it ends in 2024, but it has a \u2013 it will start falling off before then.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. The oxides at Safford are nearing the end of their lives. This would be a whole different project if you had to build all these processing facilities and infrastructure to produce those reserves. But when you have those available to you with excess capacity to deal with it, that's what makes it so attractive. And for 200 million pounds of copper a year, with that kind of cost structure, the payback for this investment is pretty quick.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Yeah. And I think I'm going to manage to ask another question without asking about Indonesia. So, on El Abra, you are holding a six to eight year of expected lead time. If a new government gets elected in Chile, do you think you can accelerate that process? And if so, Codelco has quoted $40 billion in expenditures over the next eight years? I'm assuming El Abra is not part of that.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No. El Abra is not part of Codelco's capital spending there. I think most of you know, they are our 49% partner, but that would be funded within the company itself. The government issue I don't believe will have an impact on the process. While there may be a potentially more favorable outlook for the industry \u2013 like around the world, in Chile environmental concerns are significant and widely held. And so, I believe we'd go through the same permitting process regardless of the government.","And this is a project, being a brownfield expansion in this mining region near Anapagasa (01:36:15), it's the kind of project that Chile will welcome regardless of the government. And regardless of the government, they would want to make sure that the planning and environmental management is handled in the right way.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much and good luck with the approach in Indonesia.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks, Oscar. Good to hear your voice.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.","Good morning. I hate to go back to Indonesia again, but just one of the points you make all the time is how much benefits the government gets out of this. And on the slide, you talked about $40 billion through to 2041, and I'm just \u2013 there's been talk about changing taxes in Indonesia as part of this or whatever. I was just curious to the extent you can what you actually assume to get to $40 billion. Did you assume the current structure going forward? Is that your share? Does that include Rio, or what actually went in that?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's total for the project, and it includes the current contract tax and royalty provision. We \u2013 as part of our agreement, we are \u2013 we've agreed to increase royalties to the royalty levels that are currently applicable under the new mining law. And then, we're working on new fiscal terms so that the fiscal burden on our business would be equivalent to what it has been under the cap.","Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.","Okay great.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, the government would be receiving more benefits which has been one of their objectives. Those incremental benefits would come from higher royalties, but we're working together to reshuffle the cards somewhat on the taxes and other fees. But the objective would be that the burden for our business would be equivalent to what it has been.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And Brian, we've been paying the higher royalties since 2014. You'll remember that our royalty rates...","Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.","Yeah.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...we're paying more than what's under our CAL today. So, we're not anticipating a material change in the aggregate of our fiscal terms.","Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.","Right. And I assume \u2013 but you assume through to 2022, you sort of worked under the strip and everything the same and then switch to 60-40 there and spending, I mean, roughly, are you just going to kind of make it work it out, so it's neutral?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. Well, the way it works now is PT-FI pays its taxes, Rio Tinto pays its taxes...","Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...for this joint venture. So, I mean \u2013 you know this, but to remind everybody else, we have a 35% income tax rate, whereas the general tax rate in Indonesia is 25% and they're talking about potentially reducing it. We also pay a 10% withholding tax for dividends that are paid from Indonesia to FCX. So, there's a very substantial tax burden already in place on us which, as I said, is the highest of any country that we operate in.","Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.","Great. Thanks very much, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","All right. Good to hear your voice, too.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Virtual (sic) [Vertical] Research. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","That would be Vertical, and I'm sorry I have to \u2013 no Indonesia question here. Just interested, Richard, your thoughts on early part of the cycle. Are you getting some interesting (1:39:48) pressures from your vendors, equipment, labor, contractors? Is that something you've been able to push back? Or is that something we're going to see as we move forward as the cycle strengthens?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, it's just natural that you go from a period of very low levels of activities with vendors to an increased level. There is going to be a price impact with that. We are such a large customer with our vendors that we have a partnership with them, and so we work together to get to fair deals with them. But I see some of the analysts already commenting on some cost increases in the industry, and obviously as prices rise you can expect costs to rise.","There is a correlation. One of the reasons we've never been attracted to hedging is there is a correlation between copper prices and many of our input costs. And so, that's just \u2013 that correlation is going to continue.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","I appreciate that. Thanks, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Then I will just complement, Red, Mark, Mike and their teams for the job that they do to find efficiencies in everything from truck usage to tires to engines, and we've done studies. We've had to do that because we got these low grade mines and our guys have done a great team. We've benchmarked our operations against other mining operations around the world. And when they show that to me, I get very proud of our team. They're just doing a great job.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thank you for all the color thus far. I was wondering if you could give your thoughts on the potential Chinese scrap import ban and if that is affecting or if you guys are seeing that affecting Chinese domestic buying behavior at all? Or any thoughts surrounding that would be greatly helpful.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, there's so many moving parts in China today with the issues related to scrap, with their focus on environmental management with \u2013 they are taking steps to deal with inefficiencies in their industry, and that carries over to the copper-processing industry. And then, their efforts to continue to stimulate their economy and build infrastructures, and now with the One Belt One Road initiative to devote spending to infrastructure development in other countries.","You add all of that up and what you see in China is growth at a much lower absolute level of growth than in the past. But with the size of their economy which, by many measures, it's the largest economy in the world now and even lower growth with absolute levels, you end up with very significant amounts of copper demand.","But what's happening too in our industry is whereas China, for many years, was the source of all the growth, today, growth from year-to-year is now coming from outside China with the recovery of economies in Europe and in the United States. Perhaps half of the growth now is coming from countries outside of China. And so, that's what is fundamentally good about our business. We're so correlated to general economic levels in developed countries. And then, when you have countries like China and other developing countries that are spending money, it creates good demand.","I was counting today the building cranes outside my window near the hotel in Jakarta, and I counted 18 high-rise building cranes going up. And that's just one instance of growth in a Southeastern Asia economy and the demand for copper that that creates.","Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And then just one follow-up. Going back to slide 22 with respect to leverage, I just wanted to see longer term, what's your goal or what do you have in mind for maybe a long-term average kind of debt-to-EBITDA level that you'd be comfortable with, just so we can get a sense of kind of how things could trend and what type of bandwidth you might have for future investments?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, we've never managed our business to have any kind of target of debt-to-EBITDA. We do a series of long-term forward cash flow analysis using different scenarios of copper prices and then we match capital spending to go with that and we manage our debt levels to be comfortable with that. I mean, we're at a debt level now that we would be comfortable with, living with for the long term. But because we're not prepared to commit to long-term capital right now and we have this overhang of the Indonesian situation, we're going to be using cash flows to continue to reduce debt.","You may recall that in 2011, at the time we announced the oil and gas deal, our company had zero debt. And we were paying substantial dividends. So, we don't have a targeted debt level.","It's all based on cash flow analysis and we'll continue to run it on that basis and make disciplined decisions about investing capital when that's warranted.","Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking the question. First one, just want to understand the optionality you have at Grasberg, where you could advance mining of some higher grades in 2018 and 2019. So, can you give us some idea on what's the upside there? And if that could keep the open pit running longer than expected?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, we are going after the highest grades available and all of that is a function of the pit design. We're at the very bottom of this pit right now, and so Mark and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to get the highest grade available consistent with maintaining the integrity of the pit and the safety of the slopes. So, there's not a question of having opportunities to high grade. We're going after the very highest grade that we have.","Now, we are \u2013 as we get to the bottom of this pit, we're looking for opportunities to maximize PV and that's an ongoing mine planning exercise. And so, that may well be that we can find some opportunities for temporarily extending the pit, but that's just going to be something at the margin. We are \u2013 and that would be a trade-off for what we could get through the pit and how much we could get from committing the block caving underground because to the extent we defer that then you're deferring the ramp-up, and so. But it's strictly a safety first exercise and then maximizing NPV for deciding where to access the ore.","Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And that's helpful. And switching gears to El Abra and I realize the project is in its early days. The technical study is a few years out. But just want to check if that's an operation for the world where copper is at $3 or is it maybe a project for a $3.50 or a $4 copper world?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It's more in the range of $3. It's not a $4 project. No. We have reserves at $2, but we're not \u2013 we wouldn't run the mine plan on that, but it would require confidence that you got a $3 copper price to proceed with it.","Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Richard. Thanks for the color.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And by the way, that's the industry we live in. I mean, we always look over all these analyst reports before our earnings call. I mean, Wood Mackenzie's long-term incentive price for copper is $3.30. That's just what it is. I'm not commenting on it one way or another other than saying that's what their analysis shows for the industry as a whole.","Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Now, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, those were good questions.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Q4 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website at www.fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10(k) and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice-Chairman, President and CEO; Jim Flores, Vice-Chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas; with several other of our senior team here today joining the call.","I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will review our recent performance and outlook using the slide materials that are on our website. As usual after our remarks we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $2.9 billion or $2.75 per share for Q4 2014. There are a number of special items in the quarter which are detailed in the press release. ","The net loss attributable to common stock included net charges of $3.1 billion or $3.00 per share in Q4, primarily associated with a reduction in the carrying value of oil & gas properties pursuant to SEC full cost accounting rules; and goodwill impairment charges as further detailed in the press release. These were partly offset by noncash marked to market gains on oil & gas derivatives contracts and a net gain from the sale of the Candelaria and Ojos mining operations which were completed in Q4.","Copper sales totaled 972 million lbs. in the quarter and 3.9 billion lbs. for the full year. Gold sales were 377,000 oz. in Q4 and 1.25 million oz. for the year 2014. Our oil & gas sales totaled 12.1 million barrels of oil equivalents in Q4 and were 56.8 million barrels of oil equivalents for the year.","Our average realized prices for copper during the quarter were $2.95 per lb. - that was below the year-ago period of $3.31 per lb. Gold prices averaged $1193 per oz. below last year\u2019s Q4 of $1220 per oz., and our average realized price for crude oil in Q4 was $78.02 per barrel, which included $7.77 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts.","Operating cash flows for the quarter totaled $1.1 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion. As previously announced we completed the sale of our interest in Candelaria for $1.8 billion in cash during November. We ended the year with total debt of $19 billion and the consolidated cash position totaled $464 million.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning everyone, and we\u2019re thinking about all of you on the East Coast dealing with this snowstorm. It\u2019s even raining here in Phoenix so it\u2019s a strange year in a lot of ways.","We\u2019re going to focus today on our company\u2019s response to the new commodity price environment we\u2019re having to deal with. The situation we face now in some ways is mindful of 2008 when the price of copper dropped 60% in just a quarter and a half. Beginning midyear in 2014 we saw the significant drop in oil prices, and oil dropped about 50% during 2014. Then in Q4 we saw copper prices drop, and copper prices dropped almost 20% in Q4, and then going into this year we\u2019re seeing further drops.","Now, what does this mean to us overall? One thing, we\u2019re having to change our focus from our previously stated debt reduction targets by 2016, because under these commodity prices those targets are unrealistic. We will be seeing higher cash flows from our mining business as we complete projects and add volumes and reduce CAPEX, and we see 2015 as a bridging year to get us to higher cash flows that we have before us - even without increases in commodity prices.","We want to emphasize we\u2019re not backing away from our objectives of reducing leverage, and going forward we\u2019re going to continue to prioritize debt reduction. We have a track record as a company of taking necessary actions and executing plans to maintain financial strength during periods of weak commodity prices, and that\u2019s what we want to talk about today. ","We\u2019re prepared to deal with whatever commodity price environment we have to live with. In many ways there\u2019s a disconnect today, kind of unlike 2008, between the current fundamentals of the marketplace and what we\u2019re seeing with commodity prices. But the market is what the market is and we\u2019re not developing plans that are based on an assumed near term quick recovery in prices. So that\u2019s kind of setting the stage for what we want to talk with you about today and we\u2019ll be prepared to answer any of your questions about it.","Turning to Slide 3, we have made good progress in this moving towards achieving higher volumes from our business. The Morenci expansion is complete following the completion of the Tenke expansion earlier and the Morenci is expected to reach full rates in Q1 this year. The Cerro Verde expansion is physically more than 50% complete. We\u2019ve incurred a lot of the costs and contracted for other costs. We have a substantial construction project going on there. To date it\u2019s going well and we\u2019re targeting a 2016 start date at Cerro Verde.","The Lucius project operated by Anadarko that we\u2019re a significant investor in has achieved its first oil production this month. We had a successful production chest at our Highlander project in south Louisiana that Jim will be talking about and positive drilling results in our deepwater projects at Holstein Deep and Power Nap. ","As we previously reported we completed the sale of our Candelaria project in Chile. We had a successful $3 billion senior note offering which essentially allowed us to repay all of our 2015 maturities and also to retire some higher coupon debt. ","We are today talking about a plan to take aggressive actions in response to these commodity prices. We are cutting our capital expenditures in 2015 by $1.5 billion - that\u2019s over a third decrease in our oil & gas CAPEX. And we engaged in a process to obtain third party funding for some of our Gulf of Mexico development projects - things that this company has done before. And we\u2019ll be talking about how we\u2019ll be using that to mitigate our capital expenditures further.","Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights on Page 4 and I won\u2019t repeat those. Those are there for your purposes. You can see that our unit cash costs are in line with our guidance for the year, about $1.50 per lb.","Turning to Page 5 I mentioned the status of our expansion projects. The three projects that we undertook to substantially increase our volumes are on track. Our capital expenditures will be declining. We\u2019ll have substantial free cash flows beyond 2015.","And in the oil & gas business we\u2019ve had strong operational performance. Our efforts continue to identify substantial resources that will be the basis for future growth with lower risk development opportunities, and we\u2019re reducing spending in response to today\u2019s conditions without eliminating that opportunity for future growth. And you can see in these charts just how significantly, suddenly and recently commodity prices have dropped.","We had roughly two years of copper prices that bounced around between $3.00 and $3.50 before this drop; we had three years of oil prices where Brent was over $100 and then this sudden change, as I said, in many ways appears to be disconnected from the current fundamentals of our business.","Note on the copper chart on the left side of the page our stock price of course directionally follows the movement in copper prices. But I think the global exchange stock is one indication of this disconnect between today\u2019s prices and fundamentals. Historically in weak economic times exchange stocks and inventory sales by consumers will be increasing, and today while we\u2019ve seen a recent growth with a small uptick in global exchange stocks they\u2019re still low by historical perspectives - and certainly not rising to the point that would indicate a drop in prices like we\u2019ve seen.","Page 6 talks about what our current focus is and that\u2019s protecting our balance sheet. We\u2019ve completed $5 billion of asset sales, we\u2019ve reduced CAPEX. We\u2019ve, as I mentioned, did this bond financing to strengthen our liquidity. We are continuing as we speak today to work with our management team and we\u2019ll be working hand-in-glove with our Board on a real time basis as we go forward in 2015 to decide what further actions need to be taken.","We\u2019ll be monitoring the state of commodity prices, the performance of our business, how we\u2019re doing in terms of meeting these plans, completing our project at Cerro Verde for example. We are looking for partners to help provide funding for our CAPEX in the Gulf of Mexico as I mentioned. We\u2019re working with our bank group and holders of our bank term loans about dealing with issues that would further improve our financial flexibility. We\u2019re in good shape now but we want to make sure that we\u2019re taking every step to stay that way as we go forward.","In Indonesia as we work with the government to get our contract of work issue resolved, we just this week signed an extension of the MOU that we had signed last July. And in that MOU we responded to a very strong position of the Indonesian government about the advancement of development of a smelter in Indonesia. And we are working with partners and with site preparation and construction plans to go forward with that, in conjunction with getting a resolution to our contract situation.","As we look forward it\u2019s what we are planning to do - we are presenting a plan for you here today. And that plan involves reduced CAPEX, reduced costs and pursuit of capital expenditures where it\u2019s economically rational for us to do so. The plan we\u2019re presenting to you today includes a continuation of our current cash dividends to our shareholders. We\u2019ll be working with our Board to review all aspects of our financial policy and our financial planning as we go forward. And I think you can judge from our past history that our Board\u2019s going to be prepared to do what\u2019s necessary to protect the liquidity of this company.","Page 7 shows the cost reductions and deferrals that our plan today involves: a significant reduction of $1.5 billion in capital expenditures with $1.2 billion of that coming in the oil & gas business. And we\u2019re taking advantage of every opportunity that we can of achieving cost reductions in all of our global operations. Particularly in our mining business lower oil prices is leading to lower costs, and also lower commodity prices in terms of some of our input costs is also giving us the opportunity to achieve a lower cost structure. And we\u2019re going to take every advantage of that that we have.","The strength of this company, the strength of Freeport-McMoRan lies in our long term assets, and those remain in place. And as a company we remain highly positive about the future outlook of our business even as we deal with the current situation. We have substantial long lived reserves both in our mining business and our oil & gas business. These reserves are in a diverse portfolio of world-scale copper assets and a strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico, taking advantage of existing underutilized and well-placed infrastructure. We have a very large, valuable resource potential.","In copper we have over 100 billion lbs. of proved and probable copper reserves at $2.00 copper, and roughly that same amount of mineralized material at a $2.20 price range, and additional resources beyond that. So we have within our company the resources for long term profitability and growth; and in the same way the oil & gas business, our resource base is very large and gives us a basis to have future growth there.","Now talking about the copper business, you know, I referenced the fact that there\u2019s an apparent disconnect now between the copper price and market fundamentals. Clearly the market is trading on the basis of the oil price decline and the impact generally on commodity prices. Traders are looking at the relative values of metals in relation to oil; they\u2019re looking at the relative value of copper in relation to other metals. And what we\u2019ve seen is a significant decrease in prices, but inventories remain low; the fundamentals of our business in dealing with customers remains relatively strong. ","The market is relatively tight, and from a supply standpoint the consensus expectations of very large surpluses that were expected in 2014 have not materialized. The surplus expected in 2015 appears to be much smaller than anticipated. Supply is coming on slower; disruptions are more frequent. And beyond 2016 the market remains to be uncertain.","All of this reflects the global macroeconomic, political uncertainty that we see around the world. China is in a slower situation but the government is responding with economic stimulus. And in fact there\u2019s a lot of positive things in China. Imports rose by 12% year-on-year in 2014 and set records at the end of the year. Domestic cathode production set new records in November and December. State grids announced an increase of 9% in their spending next year and so even though China\u2019s growth rate is slowing it\u2019s still consuming a lot of copper.","In the US the fundamentals are stable. Despite the price volatility our customers are continuing to have confidence in their business going forward. Supply side issues still significantly underlie this market. As I said, the forecast for large surpluses has not materialized. Exchange stocks are low. New projects are facing delays. As you read Q4 earnings reports and announcements you\u2019ll be struck by the number of production declines that are being announced around the industry. ","Grades are falling; people are constraining CAPEX - all of this will be very supportive of copper prices as we go forward. Lower prices is taking a lot of scrap out of the marketplace and that\u2019s going to be supportive of prices. So we continue to see long term fundamentals. The stronger dollar is an issue for the marketplace and that\u2019s one thing about it.","Now, I want to refer to Page 10 which is a chart I\u2019ve used before, but just to put all this in perspective about what the world is going to need for copper. The top chart is total copper consumption - this includes consumption of directly used scrap in addition to consumption of refined metal. And if you assume a growth of 2.5% over the next ten years, and that embeds a growth rate in China that\u2019s half of the growth rate of the last ten years, the market is going to require another 7.6 million tons of copper. And over this same period existing mines are going to decline. Brook Hunt expects existing mines to decline by over 3 million tons.","So that\u2019s 10.7 million tons shortfall that\u2019s going to need to be made up over the next ten years by expansions, new projects and scrap. To put that number in perspective, in 2014 the top ten mines in the world are estimated to produce less than 5 million tons. So the requirements for the next ten years are twice the annual production of the ten largest mines in the world. We have to get through this current situation but the fundamentals of our market are very positive and we\u2019re very optimistic about it.","Page 11 shows our mining unit production cost experience for Q4 - roughly in line with what we had guided to in our Q3 earnings release. It does reflect the sale of the Candelaria operations in early November and it does reflect in Indonesia some higher royalties and export duties that we have agreed to pay in connection with these MOUs that we signed. But you can see that our cost experience continues to be positive.","Cerro Verde is in the stage of full-blown construction now. We have 12,000 to 14,000 workers there to have a project that will be the world\u2019s largest concentrating facility. The construction is advancing and is expected to be completed late in 2015, and we\u2019ve incurred roughly three-quarters of the cost of the project to date. As we look at constraining capital quickly it was clear that delaying Cerro Verde was not economic for our company because of the stage of the project, the amount of money that\u2019s spent and the coming volumes beginning in 2016 and going forward. We\u2019re going to be focused on managing the completion of that project.","In Indonesia we continue to engage in active discussions with the new government being led by Joko Widodo to amend our contract or to extend our right to operate beyond 2021, the expiration of the existing contract or the initial term of the existing contract. We\u2019ve approached this process with an aim of keeping a positive long term partnership in Indonesia. We\u2019re focused on working with the government for the economic development of Papua and to provide significant benefits to the overall Indonesian economy.","Our existing contract continues in place as we speak and we are focused as we go forward in being responsive to the aspirations of the government, the people of Indonesia; and taking into consideration our need for assurance of legal and physical terms to support the major investments that we\u2019re making. The MOU that we signed last July has been extended until July 2015. We this week got an approval to continue to export. We had a six-month license which needed to be renewed and it has been renewed, and as I mentioned we\u2019re advancing plans for the new smelter project in parallel with our [inaudible] amendment and we\u2019re all focusing on Papuan development during this process.","At Grasberg we\u2019ve completed development of the access to our underground ore bodies and are continuing with the development of the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ mines. So development capital of almost $3.0 billion has been spent to date and in total $2.3 billion from Freeport, and our share of development capital is expected to average $700 million a year over the next five years. This is an important project as this replaces the production coming out of the Grasberg Pit. The Pit is now expected to extend until the end of 2017 roughly - that\u2019s been delayed somewhat by the labor issues we\u2019ve faced in recent times. Just let me say we\u2019re making progress with those now and expect during Q1 to return to normal levels of operations.","While we\u2019re not spending significant capital on further development projects in the mining business we are continuing our studies on the potential for a very large scale expansion at El Abra, for the further expansion of our Tenke Fungurume project in The Congo where operations are going well and we have a resource that provides us optimism about future long-term growth; and in our US mines where we have large sulfide resources in our Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona and the Safford Lone Star mine where we have an enormous resource. All these things are the future for our company and we\u2019re continuing studies without spending current capital on the projects.","Jim, I\u2019ll turn the mic over to you and let you talk about our oil & gas business.","Jim Flores ","Thank you, Richard. Good morning. 2014 was an outstanding year operationally for the oil & gas business, primarily Q4. We successfully rotated out of the low-margin shale project. We had one of the better shale plays out there in Eagleford and now they\u2019re under a lot of pressure obviously with the low prices. In that rotation we were able to increase interest in our high-margin areas like the Gulf of Mexico, mainly increased interest in Lucius and Heidelberg. ","We had excellent revenues during the year of $4.1 billion, cash operating margin of 2.9% and almost 57 million barrels of oil equivalent in production and sales in 2014. The drilling results we had in Q4 were mainly successful - Holstein, Deep Dorado, King and Power Nap were all four significant new development opportunities for our company. They\u2019re also the first three truly development projects adjacent to our world-class infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico that gives us all the operating leverage and the high margins to our business.","The aspect of the long-term play of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas of developing resources in and around our existing infrastructure and driving production and reserves higher, while reducing our costs - because most of our costs there are fixed - is off to a great start. Although we\u2019re obviously going to take action here to reduce our CAPEX exposure because of the low commodity prices, operationally the plant\u2019s working just perfectly.","On the ILT, Inboard Lower Tertiary crustaceous, our significant discovery in Highlander - we were able to float test the Highlander well at 43.5 million cubic feet of gas per day, the first production below 29,000 feet on the Gulf Coast onshore. And we were able to prove that we have a large gas reserve there in Highlander, and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about that going forward. In California we had excellent execution, drilled over 107 wells with over a 100% success ratio as expected.","So all in all we were rolling out of \u201914 looking forward with a lot of optimism to \u201915 until Page 17, the price of oil fell out of bed and the market\u2019s gone down 50%, 60%. This was unexpected from a lot of people\u2019s standpoint. We thought oil would get a little soft but we had no idea it would find a mind of its own and create this kind of calamity. The oil & gas market is under severe stress. ","Our business is as healthy as anybody\u2019s out there because of the rotation out of the shales and so we actually have economic projects to go forward on. At the same point in time, with our cash flow impaired and the ability of the company from a standpoint of funding its obligations, we need to raise some capital. And the way we do that is take our development projects and find outside funding, just like we did in 2008. ","You\u2019ll see the drop - in 2008\/2009 we were in the same situation and we took our Lucius project, right after the financial crisis, and we were able to do some project financing there. It\u2019s a nice rate of return for our investors as well as us, and we basically got 75% of the project free of charge going forward. And it just came on production as Richard said in January of this year.","So we\u2019re going to repeat that financing going forward, and the only way we can do that is because of the strength of economics of the project and the operational leverage tied back to our facilities to where investors feel like they have a great shot at buying oil low with good execution, and being part of a great project that\u2019ll enjoy prices at a higher level in the future. So we\u2019re in a unique position to raise that funding, and also having done it before I\u2019ll go over the Lucius case study in a second.","The other operational highlights, the steady production from Point [Inaudible], California - we\u2019ve completed our maintenance at Marlin, we sold 12.1 million barrels of sales in Q4. Cash operating margin was about $0.5 billion and $64.0 million worth of debt hedge realizations with our hedge book that does extend into \u201915, with I think the mark on that is about $500 million in the positive right now.","Responding to market conditions we\u2019ve gone onto a significant capital reduction of 34%, $1.2 billion of announced CAPEX cuts. That\u2019s basically from our previous $3.5 billion budget to $2.3 billion. And when you\u2019re making these budgets based on risks\/success, when you go through a Q4 where every well works you obviously expect your budget to increase the following year. So it\u2019s a direct $1.2 billion discount or reduction in CAPEX, 34%, but in real terms it\u2019s probably much higher than that based on the success and the development that we\u2019ve caused because we obviously at it risked in our budget. It all rolls over into a 43% discount in our capital spending in 2016 of $1.7 billion.","Now the development joint ventures we\u2019re going to be talking about will be in addition to these reductions and we\u2019ll go through that, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll talk about deferring our discretionary spending. We\u2019ll focus on our highest priority projects. Anything marginal, anything discretionary or anything kind of out on the front tier has been shelved. And when you reduce spending this much you slow growth and you preserve the resource value for the future and better prices, when economics are better. It\u2019s just a function of reducing capital and reducing activity, and then lever the past successes therefore for funding arrangements.","And that\u2019s what Page 20, the Lucius case study, is all about. We had discovered Lucius, drilled a couple delineation wells and established a reserve, and we basically project financed it with $450 million of 8% convertible preferred into 20% equity positions. We warranted everything else and it ended up being about 25% at the end of the day, and with a $300 million bank revolver at the subsidiary level. That allowed us to fund all of the development at Lucius. It basically came in on time and on budget. And this is where we had a third party operator, it was right after the financial crisis and at the time we did the funding the moratorium for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was still in place post the Macondo spill.","This situation we have going forward, we have projects that come on in 18 to 24 months, that come on much faster. We\u2019re the operator; we own 100%. We have the equipment in place, the plan in place to execute on so we\u2019re in a much better position physically and operationally and interest rates are much lower to repeat this financing going forward.","We had these thoughts in mind anyway going forward because we had sold our Eagleford production and our cash flow was going to be down in the oil & gas sector of our company, so we just accelerated those plans. We can do this multiple times. We\u2019re going to do it at Holstein and Heidelberg - those are the two developments we\u2019re going out with first. Then we can do King and Marlin and then Power Nap. We can continue every successful resource we establish, we can project finance this. We think it\u2019s at very favorable rates to the company and really highlights the true value of our exploration business to our company rather than just developing reserves on our balance sheet to be able to leverage that part of the business.","Page 21 is the list of these projects we\u2019re talking about. Holstein Deep and Heidelberg, one\u2019s green, one\u2019s blue will be in our initial joint venture. We\u2019ve already done Lucius and then we have in the black Dorado, King and we expect to drill Kilo Oscar and the rest of them in mid-2015. Power Nap is part of our Vito project which is a great validation of our Vito acquisition last year. It\u2019s the first exploratory well out of that strong portfolio that has found some fantastic reservoirs. So we\u2019re off to a great start establishing our inventory for our development joint ventures in the Gulf to drive those high returns to shareholders.","I mentioned earlier about the Inboard Lower Tertiary crustaceous update at Highlander. This is a significant geologic and engineering milestone. It is still producing gas below $3.00 so economically challenged, therefore we\u2019re idling most if not all of this activity this year to see what happens with better gas prices. The Highlander well should be on here in production in Q1 - we\u2019re going to be monitoring that closely and pressures and so forth. But all indications are we have truly validated a significant reservoir in the gas business but we need better economics to go the width. And obviously the best economics, the best cash flow are going to be on the oil side of our business in the Gulf of Mexico.","So a great success to the team. It\u2019s been a long time coming on the flow test and the success, and then we\u2019ll deal with it and develop it when prices are a little bit better. Richard?","Richard Adkerson","Alright, thanks Jim. Now before we get to questions we\u2019ll take a view of our 2015 outlook. On Slide 23 is our sales outlook which is for copper, gold, molybdenum and oil consistent with our previous guidance. Unit costs of $1.53 for copper, $18 a barrel equivalent for oil is also consistent.","Operating cash flows, we\u2019ll show a further analysis of this: at $2.60 copper and $50 oil our plan would provide $4 billion of operating cash flows. Each $0.10 of copper is $350 million variance in that. ","Our current plan for capital expenditures is $6.0 billion. That\u2019s a reduction from $7.5 billion of earlier guidance, and this does not reflect the participation contributions to be made under these arrangements that we\u2019re currently pursuing that Jim talked to you about, where we\u2019re looking for partners and project-type financing to come in for our developments in the Gulf of Mexico.","Page 24 shows our production outlook and I mentioned earlier the growing volumes that we\u2019ll be seeing in our business beyond 2015. 2015 shows $4.3 billion growing to $5.4 billion. You can see increasing volumes of gold as we get closer to the bottom of the pit, or completing mining at Grasberg; and our volumes for molybdenum and oil & gas sales.","Quarterly sales this year: Q1 is expected to be our weakest quarter from a volume standpoint. That\u2019s just a function of our mine plans and is a ramp up of our labor issues, but by the end of the year we would see increasing growing copper sales throughout the year. ","Our sales by region are shown on Page 26. The growth in North America is primarily Morenci, the decline in South America primarily reflects the sale of Candelaria. And you can see Indonesia growing as results of improved productivity from our labor group.","Our unit costs for 2015 are detailed on Slide 27. Notably we see a decrease in our site production delivery costs on a unit basis from $1.90 to $1.81, but that is offset by higher royalties and export duties in Indonesia - but still at a very attractive rate in the $1.50 range.","Now, EBITDA analysis, cash flow analysis is shown on Page 28. We show a variation, again with oil at $50 and copper varying between $2.50 and $3.50. This is an average of 2016 and 2017. You can see cash flows of $6.4 billion a year average at $2.50 and over $8.00 billion at $3.00.","Sensitivities are on Page 29. Our biggest sensitivity of course - copper price. A $0.10 change is $350 million in cash flow. For oil, $5 is $150 million in cash flow. So those are going to be key factors we\u2019ll be watching as we go forward.","Page 30 shows our declining capital expenditures going from projected $6 billion in 2015 to just over $5 billion in 2016. Again repeating this does not reflect the plans that we\u2019re on right now to have a significant portion of these cash flows in the oil & gas business fund through participation by third parties. So that is our plan.","I mentioned earlier our strong commitment to strong balance sheet management. At year end we had no borrowings under our $4.0 billion bank credit facility. We also have a separate $1.8 billion line of credit at Cerro Verde to help fund that project along with the cash flows that the project is generating from its current operations. We had $425 million drawn under that separate facility at the end of the year but that\u2019s another aspect of our balance sheet management.","We have a strong resource base, strong cash flows and capital discipline. We\u2019re taking the steps already to deal with this current situation and we\u2019re going to be responsive to what we have to deal with. And as I said, this is going to be a real time effort, working hand in glove with our Board to make decisions as we go forward.","In summary we want to protect our balance sheet and liquidity and we\u2019re going to complete our near term mining projects, continue with our oil & gas investments where that makes economic sense; work on these third party investments - with the primary goal, the imperative of preserving this really attractive and large long-term asset base for the future benefit of our company.","So with that we will open the line for questions. And Jim Bob, Jim and I are here with Kathleen to respond to whatever questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions.) Our first question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Gambardella ","Yes, good morning, Richard. In the past, I mean since you made the oil & gas acquisitions a few years back you\u2019ve consistently said that the oil & gas part of your business would be self-funding. And I know you talked a little bit about how you\u2019ve done some of those things in the past, but do you still think you\u2019ll be self-funding for 2015 given what you see right now? And how specifically do you plan to address that?","Jim Flores","Mike, this is Jim. That\u2019s a target. It\u2019s going to be difficult to be totally self-funding with the horrific drop in prices. And our plan was to be self-funding to replace the revenues that we did not have in 2015 due to the sale of the Eagleford. So we\u2019re moving toward additional funding sources and so forth, but it\u2019s going to be a challenge to make it dollar for dollar. Hopefully we can raise about $900 million in this first development joint venture off of the $2.3 billion to get close to it. And I know even though it\u2019s January I\u2019m optimistic we can get another one done as well but we\u2019ll see what the market holds. But we\u2019re going to try to offset as much as we can.","Richard Adkerson","And Mike, I mentioned here in my comments that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re having to deal with this sudden change in the cash flows from just how quickly prices are moving - not for oil & gas but also for copper now. And 2015 is a bridge year. I mean we\u2019re going to have higher volumes in 2016 so the way we\u2019re thinking about this issue for our goals for oil & gas planning and so forth, and managing our balance sheet is really how we deal with this over a two-year period. ","We have the financial flexibility to do it but that\u2019s really the focus of where we\u2019re getting to. And we\u2019re going to be monitoring, see what prices do and so forth but that\u2019s really the way we\u2019re looking at it. That\u2019s our long-term goal. Our long-term goal remains for oil & gas to be self-funding, and as it builds assets along the run with success it\u2019s going to be generating substantial cash flows.","Michael Gambardella ","And could you talk a little bit, just staying on the oil & gas side, how you could turn the growth back on for oil & gas because you\u2019ve cut it pretty dramatically here?","Jim Flores","Well, the outside funding as I said - that turns the growth back on. We share some of that growth so it\u2019ll be muted, but say it\u2019ll be 75% of the growth that we had before once we\u2019re able to secure these financings and show some visibility there. So by year end we could have a couple of these things done and be turning growth back on, but it wouldn\u2019t be as high as it was before because obviously we\u2019re sharing some of that growth with our investors that are putting up the money.","Michael Gambardella ","Right, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Tony Rizzuto ","Thanks very much and yeah, it is good to see the response to these deteriorating market conditions. And just a follow-up to Mike\u2019s, thinking about on the mining side are there other mining assets that you deem to be non-core in nature?","Richard Adkerson","Well Tony, when you look at our mining assets the bulk of those assets are existing producing mines that have significant undeveloped resources that we believe are going to be much more valuable in the future. The reason for selling Candelaria was it was not one of those mines - it was very good operation, good production, fully developed, but it did not have the significant undeveloped resources that we have at El Abra, Peru, Tenke and Cero Verde or in our US assets.","So in that sense those assets, the bulk of our assets would be viewed as core and important for our business. We do have some older mines in New Mexico; we\u2019re mining some at Miami, we\u2019re completing that. But those are really operations that we are mining to manage our reclamation obligations and so forth.","Now we do have in the plans for dealing with our situation in Indonesia plans to divest interest in PTFI over time. We\u2019ve indicated to the government that we would increase the Indonesian ownership in Indonesia to 30.00% - it\u2019s currently 9.36%. Exactly how that will proceed is dependent on our progress with this MOU. The first step is to offer it to the government; we\u2019ve talked about the possibility of listing on the Indonesian exchange but that is one area of divestment.","Interest in our mining assets is strong. We would have the option of selling interest in those assets if that\u2019s what we decided we want to do, but they are core to our future.","Tony Rizzuto ","Okay. And just a follow-up here: how important is maintenance of the dividend at the current level? You talked about the bridge year 2015 in some previous conversations, and you obviously have some flexibility around that but just can you give us a little bit more color on how you view the maintenance of the current level of the dividend?","Richard Adkerson","Well Tony, this is a Board decision, and as I said we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our Board on a real time basis as we go forward. We have developed a plan now that includes the preservation of the dividend. There\u2019s uncertainties about the future of commodity prices and there\u2019s different views about whether prices are going to rebound in the near term, the medium term or you know, there\u2019s talk about oil prices staying low or weakening. ","So all of those things are things we\u2019re going to have to work with our Board and keeping our finger on top of it, and that is going to be a decision that the Board would make. And all I can say is right now we\u2019ve developed a plan that preserves the dividend in this plan, and our expectation is the Board\u2019s going to take steps to preserve our liquidity as we go forward. We all want to keep the dividend and we\u2019re going to work hard to try to do it.","Tony Rizzuto ","Okay, Richard. And just a follow-up on a question for Jim. Jim, it sounds like the plans at least for the first tranche, the first funding might be pretty advanced at this stage. Is that a fair assessment?","Jim Flores","Tony, the success we\u2019ve had in the past we\u2019ve got great partners, we have a lot of interest. And mainly because you think about what oil properties out there in this vast array, just take North America, that actually have economics at these levels. They\u2019re not the shales. And they\u2019ve had so much capital going. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of private equity capital that\u2019s unused out there. I think [inaudible] was telling me as much as $100 billion of unused capital and fresh capital that\u2019s just been raised. ","There\u2019s a lot of mezzanine capital and a lot of counter-cyclical investors that want to do just like we did at Lucius, is buy oil when it\u2019s $50. So the meeting schedule is robust and we\u2019re not ruling out international players, [inaudible] for those types of things but having done this and having the makeup of our properties where we 100% control, operate - they\u2019re actually producing now. Taking away a lot of the operating risk and timing risk with these larger projects is key to attract the financing.","So we\u2019re just going to be arguing about how much we give up as a company and how much the investors need to get their returns, and that\u2019s a good, healthy argument for a good transaction I think. So we are hitting the ground running, and just think about this as a multiple way of financing - and irrespective of where oil prices are it still gives us the best rate of return as a company, of identifying these assets and then financing the development with third parties to drive higher returns for FCX. So we had these thought processes in mind and they sure come in handy when prices do what they just did.","Tony Rizzuto ","Alright, very helpful. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [Sal Virani] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","[Sal Virani]","Thank you. Richard, can you give us an idea of your write down between the gas and oil assets or MMR and PXP? How was it distributed?","Richard Adkerson","We follow full cost accounting, Sal, and under full cost accounting the original acquisition cost of both PXP and McMoRan went into a full cost pool. And then as we go forward all costs of exploration and development of oil & gas reserves go into that single pool. So all the costs are kind of like a MixMaster - they just get all blended together and then they\u2019re subject to a ceiling test that\u2019s prescribed by the SEC that puts a limit on how much of those costs can be capitalized.","And so in our write down there\u2019s two aspects to it. First of all, the cost in excess of this SEC ceiling amount has been written off, and then in addition there was goodwill assigned to the oil & gas assets and all of that goodwill has been written off. So it\u2019s not possible to distinguish it between McMoRan and PXP, and this of course is a function of pricing. Under the SEC rules, they currently require that the prices use for these full-cost ceiling tests be a trailing twelve-month average. ","And so in our ceiling test those costs, the oil price that was used was roughly $90 - it\u2019s $95 actually Kathleen\u2019s telling me. And that\u2019s because that\u2019s a twelve-month average. And as we roll into 2015 as we talk about in the press release and if prices stay low that average is going to come down, and that would be indicative of further full cost write offs going into 2015. All the goodwill is gone so it\u2019s just a question of the ceiling test.","[Sal Virani]","Okay. And also the cost decline on the units, the gross cash costs you have from \u201914 to \u201915 - I\u2019m talking about the site production delivery costs, $1.90 to $1.81. Is that all coming from the lower fuel or is there anything else in there also?","Richard Adkerson","No, lower fuel is a factor but of course lower energy costs rolls into all other costs - you know, logistics and things like that from suppliers. But with commodity prices dropping, some of our costs are related to steel, for example, the steel balls that we use in our grinding processing facilities, you know, component parts for maintenance, truck tires. Across the board this change in the commodity price environment is affecting costs, and one of the things we\u2019re doing is trying to make sure we take full advantage of that.","Kathleen Quirk","Sal, further to that we do forecast here the significant benefit from lower diesel prices. Offsetting some of that is we do have higher consumption as we\u2019re mining higher rates, productivity improving in Indonesia; we\u2019re mining higher rates at Cerro Verde. So we do have some consumption offsets; and then offsetting that we do have some improved volumes. So you net all that together and you see the decline from $1.90 to $1.81.","As Richard talked about we believe there will be some additional benefits from other commodity index-types of costs which we\u2019ve reflected some of that in this plan. But we expect to see, if commodity prices stay low we expect to see additional savings as we go throughout the year.","[Sal Virani]","And lastly, Kathleen, can you give us an idea of your appetite for increased debt and how the rating agencies would look at it you think?","Richard Adkerson","For increased debt?","[Sal Virani]","If you need to. If the commodity prices remain low and you need to borrow some money to care for the shortfall, what is your appetite for that?","Richard Adkerson","Well, our plan is to manage our business so that we don\u2019t increase debt. I mean we\u2019re going to take steps as we can to improve the maturity schedule of our debt. There will be times because of the nature of our business that we\u2019ll have some draws under our bank credit facility, so you know, that\u2019s what our credit facility is for is to give us bridges to deal with short term issues - whether they come up from business risk or so forth. ","But in terms of thinking about substantially increasing our debt level over time, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re focused on. We still, as I started out saying we have plans of reducing our debt level - we\u2019re just not going to be able to do it within the timeframe that we had originally targeted.","Kathleen Quirk","And 2015, Sal, is that bridging year in terms of getting to the point where we see free cash flows, substantial free cash flows coming out of the mining business, and then we\u2019ve got these initiatives underway to offset some of the CAPEX in the oil & gas business. So you might see some increase in \u201915 but that is not our plan. Our plan over time is to take leverage down.","Richard Adkerson","And you\u2019ve all seen that the credit rating agencies are focused, as you would expect them to be, on lower commodity prices. And we\u2019re working with them and we\u2019re working with a plan to do everything we can to preserve our credit ratings.","[Sal Virani]","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano of BMO. Please go ahead.","David Gagliano","Hi. I just have a few quick clarification questions really. First of all, does the oil & gas production targets, do those include an assumption of project financing?","Jim Flores","No they do not. That will be added once we get the financing secured.","Kathleen Quirk","The CAPEX and the production are both aggregate with no partner.","Jim Flores","With no partner at this point, so that\u2019s a baseline and you can build from there as we announce things.","David Gagliano","Okay, great. And then the operating cash flow numbers, are those before or after a minority interest payment?","Kathleen Quirk","Those are before. The minority interest payments will come out of financing.","David Gagliano","Okay, great. Okay, fair enough. And then the last question: does the CAPEX reflect any expectations for expenditures potentially for a smelter in Indonesia?","Richard Adkerson","No, they\u2019re currently not in there. Our plans would be to develop as we did with the smelter that we developed in the mid-1990\u2019s, to do a structured financing for that project which would be based on contracts with TCs and RCs. And it would be a PTFI-type contract for processing fees that would provide the basis for financing. And then the amount of equity that would be required depends on the participation of the partners that we\u2019ve put together with it. But it is not in there at this point.","David Gagliano","Okay, great. Alright, that\u2019s all I had. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.","Brian Yu","Great, thanks. Good morning. I have a couple questions on oil & gas. You\u2019ve taken the CAPEX expense down to about $2.3 billion annually and then at the same time the production outlook\u2019s been dropped to about 56 million, 57 million barrels. The math on that implies $41 per BOE of CAPEX. Is this a reasonable measure of sustaining CAPEX for the business, $41 BOE?","Jim Flores","No, because you\u2019ve got different complexions of what\u2019s being spent and what isn\u2019t because a lot of the wells that are being drilled are being hooked up timely. So you\u2019re getting a muted production number. I would use closer to $30 is probably a reasonable run rate under our non-stressed scenario, and Brian, that\u2019s basically what happens when we bring in third party financing - we drop that number from $30 to $20 and get our costs in line with a $50, $60 oil environment. So that highlights the goal of what we\u2019re trying to do with the financing, but $30 is more representative of a real market.","Brian Yu","Okay, so if you\u2019re spending at the $40 rate then does that imply maybe at this rate in \u201918 and \u201919 we should see a growth in production out of the oil & gas?","Jim Flores","If we didn\u2019t do any joint ventures that\u2019s correct - you\u2019d be growing at a $20 rate because you\u2019d just be completing wells and putting them on instead of drilling any because you\u2019ve drilled them in the first couple years. But our plan is to do the outside financing and take it from a $40 barrel rate, your number, down to $20 and grow the business with our partners say 75\/25.","Brian Yu","Okay. And second was just on the outside financing. If I looked at what happened with Lucius, you sold 20% interest in the project but then the convertible preferreds were backed by the parent company. And if we take that same analogy in a way doesn\u2019t that involve the mining assets again? Or is the plan to just limit any kind of outside financing purely to the energy assets and not involve FCX, the parent company and the mining side?","Jim Flores","Brian, I\u2019m not sure that was guaranteed by the parent company. I think you\u2019re reading through something there.","Kathleen Quirk","It\u2019s at the subsidiary level, Brian, so there\u2019s not a guarantee.","Brian Yu","Okay. Yeah, I thought the party that purchased it, they had some warrants to purchase PXP common stock.","Jim Flores","The warrants were for the subsidiary.","Brian Yu","Okay, got it.","Jim Flores","That\u2019s why I said it\u2019s 20% face but when you look at the full percentage of the subsidiary they got 25%. If I blended that I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s all at the subsidiary level, so about 25%.","Brian Yu","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Oscar Cabrera","Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone. I just want to get back to the question on the dividend. Is there in your lines of credit or debt any covenants that would limit you from paying the dividend if commodity prices stay low and we\u2019re at the low end of your expectations in operating cash flow?","Kathleen Quirk","Oscar, this is Kathleen. There\u2019s not a specific covenant on the dividend. We have maintenance covenants, financial covenants to maintain and that\u2019s all going into our plan. Richard mentioned we are having some discussions about flexibility with the covenants as we bridge through \u201915. But there\u2019s not a specific covenant on the dividend.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay, great. And then the other thing is just getting back into this oil & gas CAPEX - so $1.7 billion in cutbacks or cut cap in 2016. Jim, can you just clarify: you\u2019re expecting to get economics of sharing 25% of I\u2019m assuming cash flow on these wells but you\u2019re expecting to get 50% of the CAPEX. Can you just go over that again please?","Jim Flores","Let me tell you how it works because I couldn\u2019t follow your math, Oscar. Basically the financing, we have $900 million of CAPEX ahead of us at our Holstein Deep and Heidelberg. We\u2019re asking investors to put up 100%, put up $900 million and for that they\u2019d get X amount of return on the capital they put up plus a residual interest, probably in the form of an override. And that would generate above market returns for their capital - somewhere on the low end 10% to 12%, on the high end 16% to 20% depending on what oil prices do. ","And there\u2019s a lot of capital out there that have contacted us who want to do those types of things. We\u2019ll use that capital, and it\u2019s selling a piece of the growth - it\u2019s not selling our existing assets, our existing cash flow, those types of things, but it\u2019s helping us accelerate the growth. Instead of just postponing spending and production performance we\u2019re actually going to be able to in effect accelerate it with the third party capital. That will all be at the subsidiary level, and with the current structured form of equity at that level.","So there won\u2019t be any debt to consolidate or anything to FCX, and it\u2019s a great win-win for both parties. And they get the upside of the oil on the piece they get and we get the upside of the production on oil. And one thing in the oil & gas business, we\u2019ve also affected our operating costs because if you\u2019re not growing production your operating costs are going to stay high or increase. One thing about doing the joint venture, we\u2019re able to have more production go through the same facilities and you\u2019ll see our operating, our LOE costs go down, too.","So the purpose of lowering the CAPEX costs through the joint ventures and also increasing the production and accelerating the development will also lower our operating costs. So we\u2019ll end up getting our operating costs down below $20 from where they are, or in the low-$20s from where they are in the high-$20s now; and then we also have our fixed G&A costs and so forth and then you have our capital costs. ","So we\u2019ve got our capital costs around, in the $20s; we\u2019ve got our operating costs in the $20s. We\u2019re in a $40, $45 cost environment or expanse environment in 2016 - that\u2019s our goal on the oil & gas side. And we can live and prosper in a $60 world. It\u2019s not as fun as $100 but it\u2019s still\u2026 We\u2019ve got to right size our costs and this is the most aggressive and best way to do it.","Kathleen Quirk","And Oscar, one of the things you can think of in terms of this funding is we did it on the mining side several years ago with the expansion at Grasberg where someone came in and funded the development. We added volumes and shared those volumes. So it\u2019s not exactly but it\u2019s just another analog that you can think about.","Jim Flores","Yeah, a lot of different structures, a lot of deals. But the key about having this is having quality projects with good economics where you can do it. That\u2019s the big difference.","Oscar Cabrera","Fair enough - Grasberg 60\/40 with [Real Pinto]. But what would be the attributable production then and the required CAPEX? You were looking at 80 million barrels so are we looking at 70 million now and an additional $1 billion in expenditures? What\u2019s in mind?","Jim Flores","I\u2019ll tell you what, Oscar - sign a CA and I\u2019ll send you a teaser and show you exactly what it is. [laughter] We\u2019re looking for investors. Seriously there\u2019s a three-well development, a five-well development and a ten-well development depending on success but it\u2019s somewhere between, call it net to FCX between 30 million and 70 million barrels depending on the success. I\u2019m sorry - 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day, not million barrels. 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of incremental production over the next three to four years. So they\u2019re big, significant projects and that\u2019s why we want to preserve them and develop them with outside capital for the benefit of FCX shareholders.","Oscar Cabrera","Right, thank you sir.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos ","Thank you. The debt target had been $12 billion net looking forward a couple years. Has that target changed? Should it be lower because you\u2019ve divested some assets, impaired some assets, JV\u2019d some assets and prices changed? Where do you think that target\u2019s going to be for 2016-2018?","Richard Adkerson","Well John, I started out by saying that the change in copper and gold prices has really resulted in us having to shift a focus from reaching any sort of debt target, certainly in the 2016 timeframe, to adjusting our business to be responsive to much lower copper and oil prices. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now. As we go through this process we\u2019ll have a longer term goal of debt reduction and adjusting our balance sheet but we\u2019re going to have to see how the world evolves to say how we\u2019re going to respond to it. And it would just be impossible right now to set any sort of debt targets within timeframes.","We\u2019ll be talking with all of you on a quarter-by-quarter basis and reporting to you how we\u2019re responding to it. We\u2019re not backing away from our debt reduction objectives and having a very strong balance sheet is what we\u2019re going to do - it\u2019s just the realities are we have to deal with the world that\u2019s put before us and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to approach it.","John Tumazos ","Thank you. It\u2019s tough times and we appreciate all your efforts.","Richard Adkerson","Well, I appreciate that, John. As you know better than anybody we\u2019ve been through these several times before and we were always aware that that\u2019s a possibility, and we\u2019ve been preparing ourselves for it and now it\u2019s our job to execute.","John Tumazos ","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Littlewood with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Nathan Littlewood ","Good morning, guys, thanks for the opportunity. I had a few more questions on oil & gas as well. The first was just about the production and decline rates. You\u2019ve given some really useful guidance of what\u2019s required in this business to maintain outputs at that sort of mid-$50s sort of level. But under a [bare] scenario can you talk a little bit about what the un-remediated decline rates look like for each of these oil & gas assets?","Jim Flores","Well, just looking at an average, think about somewhere around 12%, 13% in our business. And remember with the timing of oil & gas coming on, spending, like we have some spending in our Vito project in our budget that doesn\u2019t come on until 2020. It\u2019s not a direct correlation to decline rates, the capital being spent. There\u2019s some different variations. But if you think about a 12% decline rate in the business that\u2019ll get you to kind of where you need to be on a maintenance capital which will be lower than what you\u2019re seeing in our CAPEX.","Nathan Littlewood ","Okay, and would the Gulf of Mexico number be a bit higher than that perhaps?","Jim Flores ","Yeah, use 13% to 14% there and use 4% to 5% in California and that\u2019ll get you kind of there.","Nathan Littlewood ","Gotcha, okay. And just on this whole funding side of things, obviously at current oil prices the underlying assumption here is that the oil & gas business is willing to lever up, to spend the capital that you\u2019ve got planned here. What I\u2019m a little unclear on though is just how much further you\u2019re willing to leverage this business up - I mean how much further the debt, how much more debt is appropriate here for this business to take on before a more drastic change to the production outlook might be required?","Jim Flores","When you\u2019re saying \u201clever up,\u201d Nathan, what are you talking about? Are you talking about CAPEX spend or are you talking about actually balance sheet debt?","Nathan Littlewood ","Well the balance sheet debt. There\u2019s no way that this business can generate anywhere near $2.3 billion in cash flow on $50 oil. So\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","Right. What we\u2019re working to do is to obtain third party funding for some of these capital expenditures - not in the form of debt but in the form of an equity participation by these investors in these projects. So it\u2019s not levering up, it\u2019s sharing the CAPEX with third parties and sharing the economics of the development activities.","Jim Flores","And trying to drive a net neutral goal. As I was trying to be clear it\u2019s going to be difficult to do that in \u201915 but we think we\u2019ll be able to achieve it in \u201916, just timing and capital inflows. So I guess the global answer to your question, Nathan, is that we don\u2019t have much appetite all to leverage up. We\u2019re going to do whatever we can to not do that.","Nathan Littlewood ","Okay.","Richard Adkerson","I think this is an important point to make because we\u2019re talking about joint venture participation - not debt obligations of the consolidated group. We\u2019re obviously giving up some of the equity in these assets at the asset level, but in return because these projects have been put together value has already been created in them, you have people willing - and this kind of gets back to Oscar\u2019s question - to pay more than their proportionate share of the forward costs because they\u2019re compensating our company for all the good work that we\u2019ve done in identifying the assets, developing them to date, presenting the opportunity.","Nathan Littlewood ","Okay. So these equity and JV opportunities, this is sort of independent of the $900 million Holstein and Heidelberg that was mentioned earlier. Is that correct?","Jim Flores","No, that is how we generate the $900 million. That\u2019s $900 million of CAPEX going forward in the Holstein and Heidelberg projects. We\u2019re going to get the development JV to fund that $900 million which will reduce the $2.3 billion.","Nathan Littlewood ","Okay. So you go from $2.3 billion to $1.4 billion. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is at $50 oil there isn\u2019t $1.4 billion of cash flow coming out of that business.","Jim Flores","Then we\u2019re going to do the next one at Marlin and King and keep going. I was trying to make the point I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s all going to line up in the same year, and Richard talked about we\u2019re looking at a two-year type of scenario to make sure that we get to a net neutral position and we [inaudible] what we take. Then on top of that these projects drive such good economics for Freeport, at any oil price they\u2019re good business based on finding discoveries, delineating them and getting somebody to help develop them with us so we can drive higher returns for the shareholders. ","So it\u2019s kind of a continuation of the plan we were discussing. It takes on greater importance now as you highlight because the cash flows are not there to fund our projects right now, and so but it still drives better economics - even in a higher oil price environment.","Kathleen Quirk","And keep in mind for 2015 as you\u2019re thinking about the numbers, we do have the puts in place that really give us a higher realization than $50 for 2015. So we\u2019ve got that $20 of price protection; we\u2019ve got to pay the put premiums of just under $7 a barrel. So our cash flows from oil & gas in 2015 will be higher than what you would expect in the $50 market.","Nathan Littlewood ","Absolutely, that\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. So just one final question, and I guess a higher level one here: your approach or attitude towards diversification of the business is a little bit different to other diversified mining companies. I mean if I look at some of your peers they\u2019ve all demonstrated a willingness in the past to sort of subsidize unprofitable businesses with profitable ones for a period - I guess Rio Tinto with its iron ore and aluminum businesses is a pretty obvious and recent example. ","It sounds like your approach towards these two businesses is as it was in the beginning, which is they\u2019re still sort of two separate buckets - you\u2019ve got a mining or copper bucket and an oil & gas bucket, and the two are sort of not subsidizing one another. I\u2019m just wondering if that is an approach that\u2019s necessarily set in stone going forward? I guess what I\u2019m thinking about is some of the costs of capital that you\u2019re talking about here for external funding of the oil & gas business seem to me to be significantly higher than the cost of capital that the copper business has got access to at the moment. And the copper business is generating some cash so why would you not use some copper earnings to support oil & gas?","Richard Adkerson","Well, it comes back to the company\u2019s overall financial situation. When we announced the acquisition of the oil & gas business, we talked about our entry into that business in two stages. The first stage was going to be one of de-lever - in other words, we incurred significant debt in acquiring the oil & gas assets. At that point we had a clear cut path because of commodity prices and paying that debt off in a reasonable amount of time. And then we said we were going to go forward beyond that point in investing where returns were greatest for our shareholders.","And I think that\u2019s still the way that we would see it, is these significant recent declines in commodity prices are requiring us to take steps to protect our balance sheet currently. We want to work hard to protect our credit ratings - I think that\u2019s important for credit investors as well as equity investors and it has other implications to our business. And so that means we\u2019re going to be focused on looking at alternative sources of capital, and these joint ventures in the oil & gas business provide us a near term way of doing that.","It\u2019s something our organization has been experienced in, the industry\u2019s experienced in. There\u2019s a huge amount of capital as Jim said available to do those sorts of things. So we are having a primary objective of protecting our balance sheet and our liquidity in the current environment. We don\u2019t believe the current environment\u2019s going to be the long term environment. We don\u2019t have any predictions of when it will turn but we believe it\u2019ll turn and then we\u2019ll be in a position of allocating capital in a different way.","Jim Flores","Just from a standpoint of the oil & gas business, it has flexibility to fund itself, fund its projects. But really we\u2019re all about driving higher returns for our shareholders, you know. And if we\u2019re using outside capital on a promoted basis to develop these assets and we can manufacture these assets as we have in the past with great exploration results or exploitation results and we have this huge project in the Gulf of Mexico with tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of development opportunities - maybe at some point in time it makes sense. ","But right now it\u2019s much better to accelerate the PV of that and the reserve life of our Gulf of Mexico business and we need to use outside funding to do it. And we drive higher returns for the FCX shareholders. So it\u2019s a pretty get away from the cost of capital aspect. I mean if copper\u2019s generating $5 billion of excess cash flow a year and so forth then you\u2019d be having to measure oil & gas returns against other shareholder initiatives and so forth. But right now the best initiative for us is to run our business balance like Richard talked about and make sure that we take advantage of the market and the project financing; and accelerate our oil & gas business for the benefit of all the FCX shareholders.","Nathan Littlewood ","Okay, thanks very much guys. I appreciate your time.","Richard Adkerson","And Nathan, I\u2019ll just say one thing that 2008 has taught us and one thing this current environment\u2019s taught us, if you\u2019re in these commodity businesses diversification within commodities is not going to pull you out when these broader scale things happen to you. So we are focused on what are the best assets, what are the best returns for our shareholders; how do we manage our balance sheet to allow us to take advantage of this great asset base. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.","Nathan Littlewood ","Absolutely.","Jim Bob Moffett","This is Jim Bob. I want to make a couple general comments. Earlier someone mentioned the Rio Tinto financing [inaudible]. The reason the financing was so optimistic for us was that there was no production that was taken from the existing reserves. Rio Tinto only participated 60\/40 in the new reserve. With [inaudible], and if you look at Slide 38 with the platforms we have in the deepwater we acquired from BP - BP spent years trying to put those platforms in the right place, that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much oil & gas there. ","What\u2019s easy to understand is the existing wells that we have and existing reserves wouldn\u2019t be earned by the investor that comes in. It\u2019ll only be participation in the additional wells we drill, so that\u2019s exactly like the Grasberg deal that we structured. The reason why the Grasberg deal could be sold on such a promoted basis is because of the great asset that was found out there. For the same reason what you\u2019re seeing with these big [platforms] is they\u2019re [inaudible] throughout the deepwater trench, and I want to emphasize again that all the studies and geological work that went into putting those platforms in the right place. They just didn\u2019t throw darts at the wall.","Secondly we\u2019ve finally got a discovery that we\u2019ve been looking for on [inaudible]. It was a well that was tested in the Tuscaloosa is the second largest well that we\u2019ve ever tested onshore. That rock, which is [100 million a day rate] may be the biggest well for that. But through the deep [sub-soft] structure we finally found a formation that had the right return to give us the entire flow rate. And we control that whole [play] onshore. Dozens of prospects have the same Tuscaloosa formation as their primary target. [Inaudible] is the Tuscaloosa trench to the north and Mobile Bay over to the east, which is a major asset if you get a chance to look at it. ","So we control some huge amounts of reserves that\u2019ll be drilled in the future. So this is not an ordinary portfolio, just like Grasberg wasn\u2019t ordinary. When I first started working on the financing at Grasberg a lot of people in the mining business said \u201cYou can\u2019t promote a mining asset the way you do oil & gas, Jim Bob.\u201d Well, if you\u2019ve got the right asset you can.","We have the right assets and we\u2019ve just got to give them a little time to do what\u2019s necessary - finance them and add the maximum value. ","Nathan Littlewood ","Thanks again, I appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Steve Bristo","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to this $900 million in project financing. You mentioned that if you do that $900 million that\u2019s turning the growth back on. So if you do actually get the $900 million how much does that actually impact the $2.3 billion you\u2019re currently forecasting that doesn\u2019t really have the growth built into it?","Jim Flores","Yeah, you bring up a good point, Steve. It adds a couple hundred million of growth capital back into the $2.3 billion, so it\u2019s probably a net $600 million or $700 million of net reduction in CAPEX because we add $200 million or $300 million back of growth spending that we have to do to execute on that plan.","Steve Bristo","Can you just walk me through again how you went from that $40 per BOE down to $20 for your share of capital spending?","Jim Flores","Well, it\u2019s directionally from the standpoint you have to add additional joint ventures - you can\u2019t just do it with $900 million. You\u2019ve got to continue to do the Marlin King joint venture and then the subsequent joint ventures after that - all in development as we go forward. So basically you take a half to 60% of our CAPEX spending and do it in third-party development, third-party joint ventures for development and you can get to that number. But it\u2019s going to take some more inputs that I\u2019ll have to go through with you at a later date - I can\u2019t go through them all right now.","Steve Bristo","Oh, so the $20 was a target then, okay.","Jim Flores","Yeah, it\u2019s a target because if we get our costs down to $25 and our CAPEX costs, our CAPEX investments down to $20 that\u2019s $45 out of a $50 environment. That\u2019s what it is. So you kind of back into the target and then you have to do what you have to do to get there.","Steve Bristo","And would the $900 million be fully just in 2015 or is there any of that that really impacts 2016?","Jim Flores","That\u2019s in 2015, so it\u2019ll be a net $600 million, $700 million in 2015. Think about it that way.","Steve Bristo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Sussman","Yeah, hello, good morning. Obviously there\u2019s been a lot of discussions about JVs and farming out some of the oil & gas reserves. Can you give us a sense, I think you talked about sort of over a two-year timeframe but it sounds like you\u2019ve had some discussions. I guess when can we maybe expect an update from you guys in terms of obviously the ability to update our numbers in terms of production, etc.?","Jim Flores","Sometime this summer. We\u2019ll be updating as we go.","Richard Adkerson","And we\u2019ll give you a status report at our next quarterly call. We\u2019re coming up on the time of year of metals and mining conferences, so as always we\u2019re going to be transparent and give our investors the current status of things.","Jeremy Sussman","Okay, great. But it sounds like we should have some clarity by the summer on some of this.","Jim Flores","Well, you hope to. It all depends a lot on commodity prices. If commodity prices stay low than you\u2019ll probably have it sooner rather than later because investors will be a little more hungry. Where it\u2019s diverted is they get a little less hungry as oil prices recover, so\u2026","Richard Adkerson","And as Jim talked about this is not like it\u2019s going to be one fell swoop deal. I mean we\u2019re going to make steps; it\u2019s going to be an ongoing process. So it\u2019s just these things happen very quickly as I keep saying over and over, and we\u2019re responding to it and we\u2019ve started this process of talking to potential third-party investors. And we\u2019re going to advance that as quickly as we\u2019re able to.","Jim Flores","And Jeremy, the big deal is it\u2019s maximizing the returns to the FCX stakeholders. That\u2019s the key objective here. And sure, it offsets CAPEX in a low-price environment and everything else, so\u2026","Jim Bob Moffett","This is Jim Bob. I want to be sure to remind everybody that these joint ventures we\u2019re talking about on the platforms that we have, the existing platforms, they will not participate in current production, current reserves. All the additional reserves, the new reserves that were found by the subsequent wells - identically to what we referred to with the Grasberg financing. None of the initial production was included in the Rio Tinto bid; it all would depend upon speculation for finding new reserves that they participate 60\/40 in - importing at 60. ","So remember, we\u2019ve got a lot of investments we\u2019ve put in these major hubs out there. Nobody else has these hubs and for that reason any production that\u2019s found near the hub, they\u2019ve been drilling around on a [inaudible] basis. And we will bring production to you. All these platforms are under capacity, so you have the ability to sell a development well off a promoted basin. And we also have the advent of people drilling discoveries out there that they know they can\u2019t build. They put their own freestanding platform and they\u2019ll be bringing the reserves to you.","Jim Flores","Right, and that\u2019s articulated on Page 41 of the slide presentation where it talks about our reserves and excludes Highlander and Holstein Deep. And the Holstein Deep reserves and growth are what we\u2019re talking about doing in the joint venture. That\u2019ll give you a representation when we talk about net amounts that aren\u2019t in the joint ventures.","Jeremy Sussman","That\u2019s great, thank you. Thank you very much for all the color.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Garrett Nelson","Hi, good morning. Could you remind us what the annual maintenance CAPEX is for the mining business? On the CAPEX guidance slide, is that $1.2 billion number for other mining CAPEX in 2015 a good number to use, or perhaps that $1.2 billion is not entirely maintenance CAPEX?","Kathleen Quirk","That\u2019s a good number to use. It\u2019s in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion but the $1.2 billion that we\u2019ve got in \u201915 is a good kind of run rate to use. We\u2019ve taken steps to defer things when we can but on an ongoing basis it\u2019s in that range.","Garrett Nelson","Okay. And then again on that slide the $2.5 billion of major CAPEX on the mining side for 2015, you footnote that that primarily includes Cerro Verde and Grasberg underground development. Cerro Verde will obviously drop off after this year, but if you would how much CAPEX specifically is budgeted here both for Grasberg underground development and for Cerro Verde in each year 2015, 2016, 2017?","Kathleen Quirk","The Cerro Verde CAPEX is split between \u201915 and \u201916. We had $3.1 billion incurred through \u201914 and most of that difference will be spent in 2015 with some trailing into 2016. We also have the Grasberg underground which as Richard said will average $700 million a year and that\u2019s to our interest. We do have a couple years where it is higher than the $700 million average and some that are lower than the $700 million average, but that\u2019s about what we\u2019re spending on average for the Grasberg underground.","We\u2019ve also got some other projects in 2016. We\u2019ve got, in 2017 we\u2019re expanding the Miami smelter and then as you get into \u201917 we start the development of the extension of the Safford mine. So we\u2019ve got some CAPEX in 2017 for the Safford extension as well as the Miami smelter. But the bulk of the Cerro Verde spending is completed in \u201915.","Richard Adkerson","By far the bulk - I think it\u2019s roughly $500 million left in 2016. But I do want to point out that this is a project that\u2019s scheduled to finish right at the end of the year, so it\u2019s a big construction project. As I said we\u2019ve got 12,000 to 14,000 people there and we\u2019ll update you as we go through the year. There\u2019s a possibility that some of these costs may go over into the next year, but right now things are looking very good.","Garrett Nelson","Okay, thanks a lot, Richard and Kathleen.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard Adkerson","Well, we\u2019ve given you a lot of information today. Someone mentioned it\u2019s a complicated world - indeed it is. We\u2019re going to respond to it as we have historically in a prudent and thoughtful way and we appreciate all of your interest in the company. We\u2019re available to respond to follow-up questions that you may have, and just let David know and we\u2019ll answer your questions as we go forward.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also have Red Conger who heads our Americas business and Mark Johnson, who heads our Indonesian business with us today in the room. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then will turn the call over to Richard, who'll go through our slide presentation. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $228 million, or $0.16 per share for the first quarter of 2017. We had a number of special items that are detailed on VI of the press release. They net to an $8 million gain. After adjusting for these net gains, the first quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $220 million, or $0.15 per share.","Our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, for the first quarter totaled $1.046 billion. We have a reconciliation on the last page of the slide deck, which shows you how we calculate the EBITDA numbers.","We sold 809 million pounds of copper during the quarter, 182,000 ounces of gold, and 24 million pounds of molybdenum. Our sales volumes were impacted by regulatory restrictions on PT Freeport Indonesia's concentrate exports, which began in mid-January, and that resulted in the deferral of approximately 190 million pounds of copper and 280,000 ounces of gold.","As detailed in our press release, we do have approval to resume exports. We've begun to load ships and that commenced last Friday, on the 21 of April.","Our first quarter average realized copper price of $2.67 per pound was over 20% above the year ago period, which averaged $2.18 per pound. Gold prices of $12.29 per ounce approximated the year ago period.","Our consolidated average unit net cash cost for the quarter for our copper mines averaged $1.39 per pound of copper. That was essentially similar to last year's net cash cost of $1.38. We had lower sales volumes quarter-on-quarter and that was partly offset by higher by-product credits.","We continue to focus on generating free cash flows. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flows of $792 million. Those exceeded our capital expenditures of $344 million in the quarter.","At the end of the first quarter, our consolidated debt totaled $15.4 billion and our consolidated cash totaled $4 billion, equating to $11.4 billion of net debt. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.","At the end of March, we had 1.45 billion common shares outstanding.","I'll now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide materials on our website.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I'll refer you first to slide 3, where we have a picture of the cover of this year's annual report, the title is Driven by Value, which highlights our resolve to deliver value to shareholders. Last year, our annual report was entitled Prove Our Mettle, and in 2016 we did successfully address our excessive debt level going into the year and we're in the homestretch of reaching a target that we set at the beginning of 2016, that was a two year target to cut our debt in half. We have a clear path to doing that now, and our focus is now generating long-term shareholder value.","We strengthened our balance sheet and our liquidity. We executed our operating plans. We successfully completed the major development project at Cerro Verde, which was a significant accomplishment for our company and part of this long-term value proposition that we have before us. We refocused our business to be a leader in the global copper industry. We set out with the intent of reducing our debt but leaving ourselves a set of assets that would provide the basis for future profitability and profitable growth. The asset valuations that we were able to achieve in our property sales in a very tough market were attractive. And recent market developments reinforce our optimism about the long-term fundamentals for the copper markets and reinforce our focus on what we're doing.","So we are \u2013 going into this year, we're focused on Indonesia. I'll be talking about that. That's clearly a challenge for us, has been for some time, and I want to make sure I address all of your questions about it and let you know what we're doing about facing that challenge.","With respect to copper markets, page 5, beginning in second half of 2016, we saw copper prices rebound to higher levels and many in the industry and observers of the industry expected. That reflected improved market fundamentals, driven by Chinese demand, improvement in North America and Europe and supply side issues returned to focus. We'd had a period of time before the current period of where supply side disruptions had been less than the historical experiences and we had several situations involving important mines including our Grasberg mine, but also Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, which faced a lengthy labor strike, and these disruptions are a feature of our business and they will be issues that the industry will face going forward.","Underlying that is a real absence now of major new projects for the industry. After the recovery from the 2008, 2009 recession, a number of projects were initiated, most of those have now been completed, and people in the industry, including ourselves, have deferred spending on new projects because of uncertainties in the global marketplace. Adding all of that together, you end up seeing a near-term situations where the market is balanced at best, and over time, without new projects coming on stream, and the falling grades of existing producing mines, a significant require \u2013 for new copper.","Wood Mackenzie estimated that 5 million tons of new projects will be required in the near-term future \u2013 medium-term future at least. These new projects require greater than $3 a pound for copper to make them economic. I'll just note that the top 10 producing mines today only produce 5 million tons a year. So that puts parameters around the extent of this shortfall. Projects require 6, 7 to 10 year lead times. The new greenfield projects are particularly scarce, and so we have a looming significant deficit in this business and the question is the timing for that deficit, which will be dependent on events in China and the global marketplace.","Now, where we are situated is that our company has significant strengths in facing a market that's going to require new copper. We'll talk about our business in two basic segments now. One is our mining operations and resources in the Americas, in North and South America, and we'll address Indonesia separately.","But looking at the Americas, we have a set of mines that have significant current production and long-term growth with long-term established proved and probable reserves and incremental resources of real significance. We have a lot of flexibility in the way we manage our operations and also in the way that we approach future development. All of these mines are operated by our company and that gives us significant synergies in the way we manage the business and develop the resources.","The investment opportunities that we see are competitive in looking at the marketplace. We have a flexible and skilled workforce. In the U.S., we have no unions. We have accesses to abundant sources of energy. Again, energy cost in the U.S. have dropped dramatically in recent years with the shale oil and gas development. We can leverage our existing infrastructure. These future development projects will have a relatively low risk associated with them. So we get strong cash flow generators.","In the U.S., we have a very large $12 billion approximately NOL to shelter us from future income taxes. And so on this chart on page 6, you can see the very significant reserves that we have available to us and also the significant generation of cash flow that we have from our properties with very low capital requirements because our assets today are fully developed.","These opportunities that we have before us are significant sulfide projects that's shown on slide 7. We are doing planning activities. We won't commit capital to these projects until we have clarity on the global economy and direction, but we're preparing ourselves to take steps. They're listed in alphabetical order here. The first project that we will start on is the Lone Star resource that's adjacent to our existing producing Safford mine. We're planning a project to mine an oxide cover over a very significant sulfide resource at Lone Star. That will allow us to extend the production facilities at Safford at the same time we're in effect stripping for the \u2013 to expose the sulfide opportunity which would require significantly more capital. All these are projects that I believe will be required by the industry over time. They're in our inventory, and how we approach them will depend on market conditions.","The next major project is likely to be either Bagdad or El Abra. The Bagdad has the benefits of the factors about the U.S. competitives that I mentioned earlier. El Abra has turned out to be a very significant resource, and we are addressing it with our partner CODELCO. And Chino is a opportunity that we're developing and we're getting more information on as very old mine in New Mexico. And Morenci and Sierrita are long-term projects for us. So we have internal development projects for a very long time horizon in the future.","Now turning to our important asset in Indonesia, the Grasberg mine in Papua, it's been a difficult year for us. In January, the Government of Indonesia issued new mining regulations that have caused us significant concerns. The impact of these mining regulations would be to require us to give up our contract work in return for our right to export. The government through the 2009 mining law and these new regulations say that you could only export if you have a license, a special license called an IUPK. And the regulations said to get the IUPK, you had to give up the contract.","We weren't willing to do that and we advised the government immediately after that gross regulations were issued that we would not be willing to do that, and we entered into a series of discussions trying to find a way to open up a opportunity to have discussions, negotiations with the government to resolve this dispute. By mid-February, we had reached an impasse, and at that point, we began actions to adjust our operations, our capital spending to reflect a business that could only shift domestically. And on February 17, we issued a formal notification under the dispute resolution mechanisms of our contract of a series of actions that the government has taken to breach our Contract of Work. That triggered a 120-day notice period, which extends to mid-June. After June, we as well as the government would have the right to submit this dispute to an arbitration process that's specified by the contract.","We continued discussions with the government and by the end of March, the government through its Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry amended certain of the regulations that were issued in January to enable us to retain our COW to return to exports and to receive a temporary IUPK that would provide through October 10 an ability to have negotiations, continued export and leave our COW in place.","We, last week, signed a memorandum of understanding confirming all of this and exports are now, we're now loading ships to return to exports and we will immediately begin negotiations with the government and each of us, the government as well as our company, have expressed a commitment to reaching agreement on the long-term solution. Those discussions will involve some very important issues. They will involve our objective of getting assurance of our ability to operate beyond 2021 to 2041 as provided by our contract on terms that provide stability and assurance on legal matters and on fiscal matters. The government wants to talk with us about divestment. Their regulations in January provide for divestment of 51%. Our contract has no divestment obligations. We have communicated that any divestment would have to be at fair market value.","We've previously indicated that we would agree to divesting from the current 9.36% up to 30% and so we will have discussions with the government on the divestment percentage, the process, and valuation. In addition, the government regulations require in-country processing of copper concentrates. We developed Indonesia's, with our partners developed Indonesia's only copper smelter in the mid-1990s, the PT Smelting facility at Gresik, a large world-class copper smelter. It currently processes about 40% of our copper concentrate production, the remainder is exported and we will have discussions with the government about developing new smelter facility. So all of these things will be addressed as a package and we will approach this in good faith. I'm convinced the government will too and the objective will be to find a mutual agreement that each others can accept. We call it a win-win objective and that's what we're going into to achieve and that process starts right now.","What we did in the first quarter? We began a reduction in our workforce. We have, going into the quarter, roughly 32,000 workers. That includes employees and contractors. That includes people involved in operations, logistic support and capital projects. To-date, we have reduced that workforce for about 10%. We've implemented efficiency programs for cost and capital spending. We slowed investments in the Grasberg underground by about a third. We're spending currently about $40 million a month on the Grasberg Block Cave. And we're prepared to suspend that if we have to.","Doing that has some long-term consequences that are negative for all of the stakeholders, because it would delay \u2013 the resource remains there, but it would delay the ramp-up period. And that involves cost and economic consequences for everybody. It would affect the workers, because if we totally suspend that, we've got about 5,000 workers that would be out of work. It affects the local Papuan communities, because in the Mimika Regency, we represent over 90% of the GNP. It affects a large number of Indonesian suppliers, not only in Papua, but throughout the country. The government has lost almost $500 million in taxes and royalties for the three months or so that the exports were suspended during the first quarter of 2017. And, of course, it affects Freeport and our partner, Rio Tinto.","With all this going on, though, because of our efforts to constrain spending and capital spending, we generated positive cash flow at PT-FI during the first quarter. So, we have an ability to do that going forward, even if we're suspended from exporting, but it's in all of our interest to get this long-term solution. And as I said, we're approaching it with an objective and with confidence that that will be achieved, but it will be complicated discussions that start right now.","Looking at the Grasberg Block Cave, this is a remarkable opportunity for us. The Grasberg district has been one of the mining industry's great mining discoveries, operations, development in the history of mining. But just focusing on the extension of the resource that we've been mining and are mining from the open pit to its extension at depths where we mine in this massive block-cave operations, it is a tremendous resource. It's got 964 million tons of over 1% copper and with 0.78 grams per ton of gold.","The reserves themselves and the copper metal that we produce, for example, are about 50% larger than out of Morenci and then in addition, you have this enormous gold component. To date, we've spent about $3 billion on the development of the Grasberg Block Cave and the common infrastructure to allow its production. We're just over halfway through the initial development for that resource. This transformation is a state-of-the-art underground development and it's a source of pride not only for our company, but for our workforce and for the country of Indonesia. High-grade, low life, low cost and it's an important part of our future and we are working to find a way to make it, so that all of us benefit from it, including the government.","Under our contract, the government of Indonesia has a very attractive current proposition for participating in the operations. Our company just celebrated the 50th year of its doing business in Indonesia. Since 1992, when we signed \u2013 after signing this current contract, we've contributed $60 billion to the national GNP (sic) [GDP] (24:51). By far the largest private employer in Papua and one of the largest taxpayers in all of Indonesia. We've contributed voluntarily, this is not an obligation, but 1% of our revenues to the local community through our Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development. Over the past 11 years, that's generally almost $700 million of voluntary contributions to the local community.","If we look at the contract, the government receives a majority of the cash benefits from the operations, more than any other government in the world receives from mining operations. Over the last 10 years, the government has got 62% of the direct financial benefits of this business and that doesn't include the multiplier indirect effects on the Indonesian economy. And when we look at the existing contract, future taxes and royalties and dividends through 2041, the term of our contract, are expected to exceed $40 billion. So, this is a big asset not only for our company, but for the government and particularly important for the province of Papua.","So, turning to our outlook, we've adjusted our 2017 projections. We've had to take into account the suspension of exports in Indonesia, it's had an impact. In Peru at Cerro Verde, we've had to face an incredible weather situation. This is one of the driest places in the world and they've had three, four, five times annual rainfall and it's caused a lot of damage, injuries, deaths, and damage to the infrastructure throughout the country and we had a strike, which did not have a material impact on first quarter production, but it affected our mining rate and will have an impact on productions for the year.","So, we've dropped our outlook for 2017 from 4.1 billion to 3.9 billion pounds. The gold reflects the situation in Indonesia at 1.9 million ounces. Molybdenum at 93 million pounds is roughly what we've guided towards previously. Our expected site production and delivery cost at $155 is up slightly. Our after by-product net unit cost at $1.08, it was previously $1.06. Provided we're able to operate throughout the year in a normal fashion in Indonesia at $2.50 copper, we are looking at $4 billion of operating cash flows for the year, each $0.10 would be a delta of $275 million.","Our capital expenditures have been reduced from $1.8 billion to $1.6 billion. And this is $700 million on sustaining capital in the Americas and some in Indonesia, but $900 million on the major projects, including $700 million in Indonesia, which is down $200 million from our previous guidance.","You can see our outlook on slide 13 for 2016, 2017 and 2018, as well as our gold and molybdenum outlook. And on slide 14, we show our EBITDA as an average of 2017 and 2018. At copper prices ranging from $2.50 to $3, EBITDA goes during that period from $5.6 billion to $7.4 billion over that price range, and operating cash flows would vary from $3.4 billion to $4.7 billion, from $2.50 to $3.","Our sensitivities for copper, molybdenum and gold and currencies is shown on page 15 to help you with your modeling. Capital expenditures on page 16 show that what we incurred in 2016, which included $1.2 billion of oil and gas and then looking forward, spending that would be incurred with continued Grasberg underground development and continuation of the current positive market conditions that we have.","The big issue in this is assessing the Grasberg blockade, and it is totally dependent on our progress we make in our discussions with Indonesia. And if we are successful, as we are working to achieve, then we would continue that project, because it's important to all the stakeholders. If not, we have prepared contingency plans to defer that project and that would have a significant impact on capital spending and employment, and also future revenues.","Page 17 shows the progress we made with our balance sheet that I've referred to in my initial comments. The net debt going into 2016 was over $20 billion, going into 2017 it was down to $12 billion, and as we look forward to the end of the year, you can see it drops below $10 billion depending on prices. Our objective is to achieve further debt reduction to get our balance sheet to a position that as market conditions improve in the future, we can then look at resources to invest in growth projects at that time depending on market conditions, and we look forward to the time with this set of assets to be able to return to the Freeport tradition of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks.","Our near-term debt situation is very manageable. You can see we reduced gross debt by $500 million during the year. We have over $4 billion of cash and our maturity schedule is attractive and we have access to capital. So, we're continuing to look to opportunities to improve our long-term liquidity situation by managing our debt schedules.","So, we are very pleased with the progress. We've got a lot of work to do and we're going to prove our mettle again this year by addressing the issues that we have. We went through all this that we've experienced over the last three years. We've maintained an industry-leader copper position, couldn't be more prouder of our team for the way they operate and develop the business. As I've said many times, we can do any copper project anywhere in the world. And we've got this long-lived, geographically diverse portfolio of assets, and we're financially stronger today after what we did last year and we're going to be focused on maintaining financial strength and flexibility as we go forward.","So, with that, Regina, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment please for our first question. The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from my side. Just in terms of the guidance for this year, is it right to assume that in 2Q you basically would sell most of the concentrate that was sitting at port plus what you produced in the quarter? Is that fair for 2Q?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, there is a \u2013 in general, that's true. There is a ramp-up that we have to go through. And we also have to coordinate shipments with our customers who had to make other arrangements for supply when we were shut down from exports. But we do have a series of ships, ones having loading completed as we speak, to \u2013 we had close to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate at our port site and storage facilities. These ships are 20,000 tons, 25,000 tons. And so we'll have a series of ships to reduce that inventory. We're beginning to ramp up. We have plans to ramp up our mine rate and to return our mill to full production.","Now, there is labor issues that we are facing in Indonesia at job site. The leader of the union that represents PT-FI's employees, which is about 12,000 of our 30-plus thousand workforce, our employees, is undergoing a trial for corruption allegations in Timika and there have been demonstrations by workers in support of their leaders. There was an incident with the police in which some rubber bullets were fired and some people were injured in the last three days. That has resulted in absenteeism at our workplace. And then overlying that are concerns by the union of our plans to \u2013 that we put in place to reduce employment, and they're concerned as we are about the long-term impact of that.","And so we are engaged with the union in an effort to get them to return to work and we're getting support from the government and from the local police. During all this quarter, the social situation and security situation at job site, which was a concern when we suspend operations, has been relatively peaceful, but we do have this current unusual situation with the demonstrations and the absenteeism. All of our projections are predicated on getting that resolved and getting people back to work.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Richard. And just in terms of the longer-term profile, it looks like roughly you've delayed some of 2017 into 2018. But then looking at further out, the 2021, 2022 numbers look a little different, particularly 2021. Is that just assumptions around where the underground is at or what's moved those sort of medium to longer-term numbers?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It's really a slowdown of the Grasberg Block Cave compared to our prior assumption. And these are, at this point, assumptions and assume that we continue to slow Grasberg Block Cave throughout 2017. As Richard talked about earlier, the timing of that will depend on the progress we make with the government with respect to our long-term agreement. So what we've assumed here is a slight delay in the development of the Grasberg Block Cave.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So Chris, our long-term plan for several years had been to complete mining the pit in 2016, in early 2016. And now with the issues we faced over the last five years, in terms of the issues with the government and the strikes and so forth, that has been pushed out to 2018. The ramp-up of the Grasberg Block Cave is a six-year plus event.","So the more this thing is delayed, the longer that ramp-up occurs, and that's what I was saying, it's so important that we reach an agreement with the government so that we can move forward, complete mining the resources and the pit. We haven't lost any resources throughout all of these deferrals. But it's an \u2013 economically, the sooner we can begin completing the Grasberg Block Cave development, begin ramping it up, the better off we all are.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And just a last one on the CapEx, just to be clear. The latest number that I had seen for the smelter if you were to go down that route is $2.5 billion. Is that correct? And also in your guidance, there is no CapEx included in future years for that at this stage until you get resolution on the ownership agreement, is that right?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's correct. No CapEx are included. Our plans are to finance this on a project basis. There would be other partners involved in our plans, and we would get project type financing for it, which requires that we have a contract for PT-FI's operations, because that's the source of the plot for the smelter. $2.5 billion, there is working capital requirements and so forth, so it would be somewhere between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, depending on that. We've done a lot of preliminary engineering work with the Japanese construction firm that designed our initial smelter. We've done site studies and site analysis, but we have not entered into contracts on the timing of spending new capital and that's dependent on reaching this long-term agreement with the government.","And the government has agreed on the MoU that we signed in 2014, has recognized that there would have to be certain financial incentives provided by the government because of the poor economics of this investment.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Richard and Kathleen. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Richard, just curious on your statement earlier. What gives you any confidence that the Indonesians are, I guess, willing to negotiate beyond the initial terms that were set out under the new mining laws around Grasberg?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","My direct discussions with senior government officials. I mean, I have been in continual conversation with people and they've made public decision out. The Indonesia is a country that has a democracy, it has freedom of press, and for those of you who read the media in Indonesia, you know that there are a lot of comments made by many different people. Some informed, some less so, but in terms of my direct discussions with the government officials, we have committed with them to approach this in a good fair basis to reach a resolution.","And in fact, we are beginning those discussions immediately and I'll be spending a good bit of time in Jakarta in those engagements. There was a visit to Jakarta last week by Vice President, Michael Pence on his tour of countries in Asia. He met with the President and spoke with him about our situation and it was a positive conversation according to the reports that I've received. We have had tremendous support from others in the U.S. government in the State Department, the Commerce Department and in business groups that deal with Indonesia, U.S. bilateral relationships.","So, it's in everyone's interest at the end of the day. It's been a complicated situation politically in Indonesia, but that's the basis for my comments.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","And does that mean you are holding off pursuing the international arbitration to protect the COW?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, having said all that, we're not underestimating the challenges, because these are issues where we have significant disagreements on. Now, we have triggered the 120-day notice required by the contract and that notice period continues to run. And so after mid-June, we and the government would each have the ability to commence arbitration proceedings. We hope not to do that. And \u2013 but we have that, as a right of ours under the contract, that process requires a significant amount of time, procedurally to put in place. So that is, let me see, some of this running in parallel, it's a fallback that each of us will assess after mid-June to see where we are in the discussions, and whether or not to proceed with arbitration is my hope that we do not have to take that step, but if we have to, we'll be prepared to do it.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","I see. And in your disclosure, you talked about potential significant reduction in capital spending development at Grasberg if there's no resolution. Would we see that impact as early as 2018 or is that something that, really that...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","You potentially could see in 2017.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","I mean, it's a step, the next major step we would have would be to suspend the Grasberg Block Cave spending, which we're spending roughly $40 million a month on, and that involves a set of workers, principally contractors of about 5,000 people. So, we are continuing that. We had plans to suspend it. Those plans were averted by this recent agreement that we reached with the government for this temporary IUPK and so all of that is \u2013 we still have those plans ready to execute if we have to.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Orest, we've taken the number down by about 25% for the Grasberg Block Cave and the number Richard is talking about, $40 million, is the reduced number. We have the ability to take that down to zero. Economically, we prefer not to because of what it does to our production schedule and NPVs, but in terms of how we are progressing with the government, we are assessing that on a week by week, month by month basis and have plans, as Richard said, contingency plans if we need to take that number all the way to zero.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","I see. Just final question if I may. What percent of the 2018, 2019 copper production can be attributed to the Block Cave here?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Very little in that timeframe.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","So it's really later in 2021, 2022?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's right. And as I said, let's say, roughly six-year plus ramp-up. So, we are about just over half way through the initial development. We'd be mining the open pit into 2018. We can't start that ramp-up until mining in the pit is completed because it's directly underneath the pit and you have subsidence, so we have to complete the pit and then begin the ramp-up of production and that goes out for six-plus years from whenever we start. So it's not much impact on production during that timeframe you referenced. There is the capital that would be spent, which we'll have to adjust that capital if we have to live within lower cash flows, but not being able to export.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks. I just have a question that actually continue along the same lines in terms of the longer-term mine plan at PT-FI. I'm looking at the slide on page, I think, it's 26. 2022, it shows no change versus 2021, obviously, down a little bit \u2013 well, anyway 2020, 2021 down versus previous. But my question is 2022, does that include, I don't think it does, Rio Tinto's interest?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","This is all net to PT-FI.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No, this is all net to PT-FI, and let me just \u2013 I think everybody understands this. While we operate broadly with Indonesia under the name PT-FI, the operation is a joint venture between Freeport subsidiary PT-FI and a Rio Tinto subsidiary in Indonesia, and all the numbers that we show financially in our presentation are Freeport's subsidiary numbers, and currently that subsidiary is owned 9.36% by the government with the remainder owned by FCX. So all of that just reflects PT-FI's net interest.","Last year in January, when we filed the valuation of PT-FI with the government that showed a $16 billion valuation at that time. That was strictly PT-FI Freeport's net interest and excluded any values for the Rio Tinto or the values for Rio Tinto's interest in the joint venture.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. So, but \u2013 I guess, I don't know why I'm still confused on this. But, if you go to 2023, 2024 et cetera, the PT-FI mine plan doesn't change, but Freeport's ownership of PT-FI changes, correct?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's correct. Right now that was originally and this was an agreement that was signed in 1995. And it was structured around that all reserves at 12\/31\/94 will be retained by Freeport PT-FI and they were scheduled to be produced by 2021, and Rio Tinto was scheduled to come in for 40% beyond 2021. Well, because of the delays and strikes and export suspensions, that 2021 date now goes out to roughly 2023.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So Rio Tinto's 40% kicks in...","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","2023.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","In 2023, sometime during the year 2023 and, of course, that's going to be dependent on our resolving all these issues.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. Okay. And I guess the reason I'm asking is, because, I guess, I'm still trying to figure out, the economics, can you give us a little more color on the economics associated with continuing the spend, to go underground, continuing to spend and develop obviously the Grasberg Block Cave when \u2013 by the time it actually really ramps up, the ownership really switches over to Rio Tinto. Is there any \u2013 like what's the economics associated with the upfront CapEx?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","I mean, they are very attractive.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Even with the reduced...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The rate of return, and when you say it shifts over, I mean we still own 60% of this business and I mentioned just how large the resource is. So I haven't seen every economic analysis for future development in our industry, but my sense is this is perhaps \u2013 this is probably the most attractive rate of return investment in the mining industry today.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Understood, I appreciate it. Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And, Dave, I understand all this has been a moving target and change and what we would plan to do as we \u2013 when we complete our long-term agreement with the government is have a face-to-face session with analysts and investors and walk through this in some detail so that we make sure that there is a clear understanding of the value of this business. And we haven't done that to date, because we've been so focused on trying to resolve the issue with the government and all of these values are dependent on getting that resolved.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks for your questions, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli. Please go ahead.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Hi. Just a quick question along those lines of the premium with Rio Tinto. Under the current contract, how much would they have to spend on this underground capital development in Grasberg in order to maintain their 40% stake, and have they committed to that, because I've read in the press that they were questioning their commitment to Grasberg at this point?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, Chris, the way this works is, capital expenditures are divided on the basis of whether they're replacement capital or expansion capital. The Grasberg Block Cave is deemed to be replacement capital. And so Rio Tinto share of those costs are relatively small. They pay the same percentage of that, that they would pay as determined by their share of revenues and how much operating costs they pay, and that has been relatively small to date.","The Deep MLZ project is a growth project, and they pay 40% of that. And we years ago entered into an agreement that the common infrastructure that's used to develop both of those resources, and ultimately the Kucing Liar resource is shared 50:50. So they are making some capital commitments, and they've made those consistently all along. The bulk of the capital is funded by Freeport under the current situation. And I will say, we have an excellent working relationship with Rio Tinto, and have had from the start. They're engaged in what we do. We're transparent about everything, they have the input. There is one contract that's shared by Freeport and Rio Tinto and they have the right to approve any changes to that contract that has an adverse impact on their company, so it's important that we are aligned and to date we are aligned. We're all concerned \u2013 we are both concerned about the future and recognize the importance, particularly important for Rio Tinto because without getting this extension, they actually have no value to speak of in the business.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. So, over the next \u2013 sorry.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Chris, I was just going to add that we manage the development of these ore bodies based on the aggregate 100% economics. We do what's best for the overall operation and don't get into trying to say, you're only funding a small part of this and getting 40% or you are funding 40% and only getting a small part. We manage for the overall NPV the aggregate resource and that's worked out over time. It's been pluses and minuses on each side, but it's worked out to be a good long-term partnership.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And the agreement has a kind of do-right provision and over the years each of us have approached it in that standpoint. It's a complicated agreement. Doesn't spend any time, and wish you've done it different way back in the mid-1990s, but we are where we are and they are very good partners. And we feel a very strong responsibility to represent their interest in the right way and we'll do that.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Great. Of the $1 billion that you expect to spend on underground development over the next few years, how much of that per year do you think would be Rio Tinto? I understand it depends on if you are in, I guess, the DMLZ, but do you have a sense as to how much they have to spend?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It'll vary somewhat, but it's roughly $200 million a year.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Got it. Okay, okay. And, okay. And then going to Safford, so it looks like you have around a year left in your reserve life at Safford now under the current reserves and so this Lone Star would essentially extend the life of the Safford mine you said. So would it be able to produce at similar rates around 200 million pounds of copper a year? And I mean, I guess, the question is, what kind of IRR are you expecting from the project, and kind of what can we infer then in terms of what your required IRR would be for future expansion projects or things like that you described earlier?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Red can add to this, but the Safford production goes out to 2021. It declines from here to there, but what we're doing really is essentially bringing in ore from the adjacent Lone Star mine and using the same infrastructure, tank house that we have at Safford. Most of the cost is stripping and so it's an attractive project from the perspective of low capital intensity, but we do have a several-year stripping program that's several hundred million dollars. I don't know, Red, if you want to add anything..","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Red Conger runs our operations in the Americas. Red?","Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, Chris, so we're producing about 60 million pounds a year there right now, and as Kathleen said, that will go out for another eight years. And that gives us plenty of time to get the stripping done and maintain the continuity of the operation. So it's attractive and we're just \u2013 we should have permits here mid-year that would allow us to start developing and getting some of the early mining done. So we're on it.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And that project, to your question about IRR, that project in and of itself is a good project from an IRR standpoint, but what we're really doing here is exposing the longer-term resource at Lone Star which is an enormous resource. And so this \u2013 while this will produce cash flows and a return on investment, it opens up a very long-term 50 billion pound sulfide resource that we can consider for future investment. So it's part of a long-term district play.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. I mean, would we expect \u2013 or could we expect to see feasibility studies on any of the development project that you mentioned, Bagdad, Chino, El Abra, so that we could get some parameters around what the economics would be depending on the metals prices and things like that as you do complete these studies?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes. I mean, what we're doing now is going through the portfolio. We've got a preliminary feasibility study on El Abra, and that's going to be updated, but the rest of the portfolio in the Americas, we're going through it to identify what the project \u2013 defining the project. And what we're challenging our team to do is to find ways to cut capital. We've been focused on keeping operating costs low in the Americas, but what we're challenging the team to do now is how do we develop cheaper mills and how can we get these projects to be more economic because many of the projects require, just like the rest of the industry, $3 copper for them to make sense. That's not the case with Lone Star oxides, but some of the larger projects, because of the high capital costs of a mill, require higher copper prices.","And so what we're doing first before we go prepare feasibility is to challenge our team to find ways to be more creative about how we can develop projects on a lower capital cost basis. And so, these are long-term, Chris, in our portfolio. We're not spending much money now, but we're preparing for the future long term.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And I don't want to drag this out too long, but that's been a strength of our business. I mean, we go back years \u2013 through the years as Phelps Dodge was the leader in SX\/EW, but it was also active in developing mills over time, at Candelaria for example. And PT-FI was a real leader in developing large-scale SAG mills and then high-pressure grinding rolls. And we've taken that experience and brought it forward to the expansion project that we had in Morenci where we had a new mill design, the recent expansion at Cerro Verde with new mill technology. And now we want to keep building on that and working with our suppliers and contractors, as Kathleen said, to have these opportunities with much improved economics and energy efficiency and so forth.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My first question is just coming back to Indonesia. Is your sense at the moment that you're negotiating against a single party there or there's still a lot of divergent viewpoints on the table on the Indonesia side? Thanks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, I'd say yes to both questions. The Minister of Energy and Mines is taking the lead and has been authorized by the President to represent the government. So, he is the point person in these negotiations, and he's a guy with a good business background and we can talk with each other in a very straightforward, candid way. The Minister of Finance is also involved in a significant way. But there's \u2013 in a country like Indonesia, there are divergent views and so our challenge will be to find a way to reach an agreement that is acceptable to the Minister and to the President and works for us.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question. You mentioned that you've entered into an MoU recently in Indonesia. Does that MoU last for \u2013 I guess, is there a tenure on that MoU...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","...or is it indefinite?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No, it's six months. I mean, this temporary IUPK lasts until October and so we need to get a long-term resolution during that timeframe.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then at the end of that period, would your contract award still be valid?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's clear. Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes, and the MoU makes that clear. The issue is, we would then fall back with their regulations, which would restrict our rights to export, but the timeframe \u2013 and this was a \u2013 we had suggested this back in January \u2013 was to give us a period of time to negotiate a long-term solution and during that period allow us to export and allow our contract \u2013 recognize that our contract stays in place, and that's what the MoU does, and this MoU will be filed publicly.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Sorry, just one final question, if I may. Are you \u2013 I think you answered this earlier, but just to clarify, are you still allowed to move to arbitration according to the terms of the MoU, does it restrict your (01:05:47) rights (01:05:48)?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The MoU doesn't address arbitration, but the notice period has been initiated and that will run through the end of June. And under the terms of the contract which remains in place, either party has the right to move to arbitration after mid-June.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the clarification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, Richard, Kathleen. Thanks for the update. More short-term questions on Indonesia on our models. What do you foresee going back to on a 1,000 tons per day basis the operation in the next sort of \u2013 in 2Q and maybe 3Q given the dip this quarter?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Are you talking about mill rate?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Mill rate or...","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, yeah, mill rate, mill rate.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Mill rate.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Hi, Mark.","Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. This is Mark Johnson. Our forecast right now, pending the issues with our workforce, is that we'd be up near 200,000 tons a day again. We'd be producing upwards to 10,000 tons a day of copper (01:07:05) but averaging somewhere around 7,500 tons for the quarter.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then \u2013 and 200,00 in 2Q or is that more throughout 3Q, 4Q?","Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It's really the 2Q and then for the reminder of the year, we'll be at that sort of rate. Just really depending on the hardness of the material, coming out of the mines, but it'd be more or less normal operations as we've seen in the past. The mill has performed over 300,000 tons a day at a peak and it's typically kind of that 200,000 to 220,000 based on material types.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. And we manage our business on the basis of metal output as opposed to mill rates. I mean, and the mill rates will vary, as Mark says, depending on the nature of the rock and we are in really high-grade material now, so we need to.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","But we'll average less than 200,000 in the second quarter.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Because we're just ramping up now, but with Mark's \u2013 we get to by the end of the second quarter, the 200,000.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You get to that rate, Kathleen, yeah. Okay.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Right.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, yeah, you would be \u2013 because you start on the 21st of April. Okay. And then, well, you had pretty good recoveries last quarter in both copper and gold. Do you expect that still to continue going forward?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And that again is the quality of the ore...","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The grade.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...we had over 92% on copper.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And that's very much driven by the high-grade portion of the Grasberg, which we'll be mining consistently to the end of the pit.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So, it's through to 2018. Okay. It's a positive, good. Okay. And then, I mean, it's a bit of a weird one, Richard, but you might laugh at this one, but just for modeling. Your price realized for molybdenum of $8.70 was much higher than we expected. Is there something we're missing there when you look at spot prices on screen (01:09:02)?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","What you have to take into account is that we sell a significant portion of our molybdenum output in a chemical form as opposed to looking the quoted price is for molybdenum metal and the chemical product is a much higher valued product. This is \u2013 we're able to do this as a result of investments that were made over many years. And then we enter into supply contracts to refiners and others who use this chemical-grade molybdenum and its realizations are significantly higher than metallic molybdenum.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks very much guys for taking my question. Bye.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael, you may be on mute.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much. Thank you, Kathleen and Richard. I'll try to keep it brief. Regarding \u2013 if you decide to suspend block-cave investment, can you reverse that in two weeks, or it's like once you get going with that, is that going to be a multi-week, multi-month process? I mean could you just get a sense of when you talk about that, I know it's a very serious decision, but how that would play out? And if you had to change it, how quickly you could get it back into gear?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. It's a really good point and that's what has led us to be reluctant to turn it off, because this is a highly skilled group of workers that are involved in this block-cave development. And if we demobilize that group, then we would be faced with a period of time to remobilize them and get them back to work. And it's not a matter of weeks, but it's a significant operational issue for us to disperse that team and there are other major block-cave operations going on around the world. And then to bring them back together would be a period of time measured in months rather than weeks.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood, I appreciate that thought. And just a follow-up, Richard, as you look out through 2017 in the marketplace and, of course, you've had some labor issues yourselves, do you anticipate we're going to see more difficult negotiations among some of your peers and competitors around the world, as labor starts to feel a little bit better about their positioning?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, I was just down in Chile at the Cesco Group and saw a number of my associates in the industry. And we were all talking about that versus a correlation between copper prices and labor problems. And so, as the copper prices increase, that's heightened the aspirations of labor for better deals, and then I always say that labor problems are contagious disease that once someone experienced one, they tend to happen in other places and we've certainly seen that with Escondida, ours, the Southern Copper situation and unions are talking everywhere about the situation.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. Thank you for your thoughts, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you very much for taking my question. The mine output appeared to fall at each of the copper mines and I tried to adjust for this sale of 13% at Morenci and 56% of Tenke and estimated that the continuing copper output fell about 11% or 89 million pounds. Could you talk about the rebounds to tons and grade at the mines other than Grasberg to meet your 3.9 billion pound forecast for the year?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. There was some impact in Cerro Verde from the weather and the strike situation. The principal impact of that's going to be longer term than I mentioned because we kept our mill basically running during the quarter, but our mine rate was \u2013 in the month of March, we have about half of what it has been in the first two months. Now, we returned that to that level, but that's going to have some ongoing impact. The rest of it, John, is just normal issues you face in running a business like ours.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","But we're not showing \u2013 John, we're showing the first quarter looking pretty similar to the rest of the year on a quarterly basis in the Americas.

I was curious if the Indonesian government has backed off the divestment requirement at replacement costs or if there have been any developments there?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, that was in the \u2013 that was the subject to one of the new regulations that was adopted in January, and that regulation is still in place. And that's going to be one of the issues under discussion as we enter into these negotiations.","Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. Two other quick ones. Can you just comment on Cerro Verde's production profile over the next three years, and maybe the stability that you see there?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, we're expected to be just shy of 1.1 billion pounds at Cerro Verde this year, and it's pretty consistent over the next few years.","Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co.

Thank you.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","In terms of oil and gas, it's down to a very small number, we're producing in the shale for the Gulf of Mexico.

But just from an overall EBITDA standpoint, it's a very small contribution, it was slightly negative in the first quarter.","Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And the more significant issue we're working on to manage is the abandonment costs that we faced as a result of this business. So, that's something that's getting a lot of attention, and we're continuing to unwind some commitments on cost that is a carry-over for certain facilities and office space and so forth, but we've made a lot of progress with that.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Good morning.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, just one more on Grasberg. One of the issues, I guess, key sticking point here is this 51% number that's out there. And I know in the past you seemed fairly reluctant to give up majority ownership of PT-FI. And I just kind of wanted to take your temperature, is that something that you'd be a little bit more open to than you have been in the past and is that really on the table, or is that something that you're going to really push back on hard?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Evan, the worst thing I could do is, get out in front of the negotiations and discussions in answering a question like that. As I mentioned, the issue of divestment is on the table. And that's going to cover the range of issues, including the percentage of the investment, the process for divesting, the valuation for divesting and the carry-on issues related to operatorship and governance of PT-FI.","So, I think, at this point, the only thing I can say is that those are on the table. Our broad objectives, as we go into the negotiations, are going to be to protect the value of this asset for our shareholders and to find a way to reduce the risk that's overhanging the situation now and provide a stability for the long term. And we need to have that stability to warrant these investments. I mean we've been running this business for years and the government has been cooperating with us on it by making investment for production that's to be received beyond 2021. So, we have to get that situation clarified and de-risked. The one thing that we will insist on that any divestment to be made on the basis of the fair value of the assets.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And maybe an easier question to answer, but I know that part of the deal with China Moly included a later negotiation on selling Freeport Cobalt, the Kokkola operation. Is that something that happened and maybe it's just too small to report or is that still underway?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That has not happened and with the dramatic change in the cobalt market, that's occurred since we closed our deal with China Moly. That matter is under discussion, so it is \u2013 let me just leave it at that. It hasn't happened, it's under discussion.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Does that mean that you might be able to keep that or have you committed to sell it at this point?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No, we didn't commit to sell it, we committed to give them an opportunity to negotiate with us for it. But we didn't agree \u2013 it wasn't a price that was agreed to, and there was no firm commitment on either party to close the transaction.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.

Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and in the presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board, Richard Adkerson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Flores, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and we\u2019ve got several others from our senior management team here in the room.","We\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Richard who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we\u2019ll open the call after our remarks for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $552 million, $0.53 per share for third quarter of 2014, compared with $821 million or $0.79 per share for the third quarter of 2013.","There are several special items as you'll note in the press release included in this quarter's result which reduced net income by $115 million or $0.11 per share. These items included a ceiling test write-down on our oil and gas properties which impacted net income by $192 million, a charge of $47 million for an increase in deferred tax accruals associated with recent tax law changes in Chile. These were offset partially by mark-to-market gains on oil and gas derivatives totaling $76 million and $48 million in gains on asset sales and debt redemption transaction.","The operating results, as you'll see reflect strong operating performance throughout the organization. Copper sales totaled 1.08 billion pounds and gold sales totaled 525,000 ounces; those exceeded the year ago quarter. Our oil and gas sales of 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalents exceeded the recent forecast but were below the year ago quarter, reflecting the sale of the Eagle Ford shale properties in June of 2014. Our results also benefited from the resumption of Grasberg concentrate exports in August following regulatory approvals from the Indonesian government late July.","Our third quarter average realized copper price was $3.12 per pound that was below the year ago quarter of $3.28 per pound. Gold prices were also below the year ago at $1,220 per ounce versus $1,329 per ounce in the third quarter of 2013. And Brent crude prices average a $103.50 per barrel compared with the $110 per barrel in the year ago quarter. Our operating cash flows generated during the quarter totaled $1.9 billion and our capital expenditures approximated $1.9 billion as well.","As we previously announced and we\u2019ve got additional information in the press release, we entered into an agreement in October to sell our 80% interest in the Candelaria and Ojos copper mining operations and supporting infrastructure to Lundin Mining Corporation for $1.8 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to $200 million. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter.","During the quarter we redeemed $1.7 billion of Senior Notes with an average interest rate of 6.6% and additionally on October 15th, we redeemed $400 million of aggregate principal amount of our 8.625% Senior Notes. We ended the quarter with $19.7 billion of total debt and the consolidated cash was $658 million.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to materials, the slide presentation materials on our website.","Richard Adkerson","Hey, good morning everyone. And we\u2019ve got a lot to talk about today. And I know this complicated geopolitical world we live in with the market conditions we face, we\u2019ve got some issues to talk about in Indonesia; and we\u2019re going to talk about the things that affect our business like in those areas and answer your questions. But I also want to put the situation in context for our company.","Kathleen just talked about a quarter despite all these things where we had solid performance from our global operations, both in mining and oil and gas. In Indonesia, we resumed concentrate exports in all of this following the export ban that came into play in January and we are working to -- working with the government on our long-term contract situation.","Then when we look at our strategy of growing the volumes of our business, and to do that, we obviously have to focus on making long-term decisions and making long-term investments and being consistent about it. You\u2019re seeing progress made of efforts that began back at the time when the Phelps Dodge Freeport merger in 2007. And the Morenci expansion is expected to reach full rates by the end of this year, the project is essentially complete and it's a major step for us. The Cerro Verde expansion, which is tripling of our output there, project that cost is estimated to be an excessive $4.5 billion is on progress, construction is underway heading for a start up in 2016.","And our oil and gas business, Jim will be talking about the commissioning of Lucius this year and the Hollander project where we're completing the well for testing and production as part of our Inboard Lower Tertiary program, important project in that area.","Beyond that our exploration activities and our planning activities for future expansions in our mining business, our oil and gas business continue to look at our large resource base and position ourselves for future growth over long periods of time.","Kathleen talked about the sales of Candelaria that was a good asset. We found a bar willing to pay reasonable price. And we executed it, should be a good deal for both companies. For us, it\u2019s a step towards meeting our objective of generating cash to reduce our debt. And all of that has gone smoothly and we\u2019ll work in (inaudible) on all the efforts to close the transactions and have an effective transition.","Speaking about copper markets, global macroeconomic situations have been overhanging the market, raising questions about demand. Europe has become a recent matter of global concern about its financial and geopolitical situation. People are concerned about growth rates slowing in China. But when we look at our business and the outlook and then talking with our customers, I mean we -- in our copper business, we sell directly to users of copper, we\u2019re not traders. We have a limited amount of activity with trading companies. And so we have direct cost to copper consumers globally. Here in the U.S., we\u2019re almost just a little less than 50% of the total marketplace for copper we sell around the world.","And copper consumption continues to remain strong. Copper is affected by the economic situations in any particular country, but as we talk with our customers and we were with many of them during LME week, the outlook of the current uncertainty is bolstered by more positive outlook going forward. U.S. continues to grow at a moderate rate.","Then when you step back from the demand side which is going to be affected by what goes on in China and the global economy, the supply side change challenge is which is the underpinning for the current copper price and for our optimistic view about copper going forward is really driven by the supply side issues. The number of projects were started, some of them delayed. The surpluses that were projected are not yet being realized and appeared perhaps the overstated inventories and customers of exchanges remain low and we see examples of new projects being delayed target forward and so the supply side picture remains the same and the positive long-term fundamentals for the copper market which drives our business are intact.","On slide 7, you can see that we managed our business in an efficient way during the quarter and achieved good unit cost results. And you can see that for the quarter, our consolidated unit costs were $1.34 and the improvement in Indonesia with the resumption of exports during the quarter. We have a set of assets that allows us to be responsive to market changes. We showed that clearly in 2008, 2009 and then with assets that can generate profits at today's copper price levels and with the outlook being positive for the longer term improved profits as we go forward.","Production volumes in North America reflect the Morenci ramp up and improvements at our mine in South America we were in lower rate sections of our mine. And you can see that Africa performed well as did Indonesia during the quarter. The strength of our company in the minerals business is our resource base.","At $2 copper plans, we have over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves reported under SEC standards. Beyond that, we have identified mineral resources associated with our existing properties of an incremental contained over 100 billion pounds. And we are working to take this mineral resource base to develop long-term investments. Finding projects to invest in requires time. And after we complete the current round of investments, there is going to be an active period of doing all the work that\u2019s necessary before we begin making significant capital commitments to new projects. But we have to be focused on doing that with the sense of urgency in order to be able to take advantage of these opportunities.","Then beyond this big resource base, there is significant additional potential that\u2019s not included in our mineral resources and much of this has to do with sulfide deposits lying in North America associated with the oxide production that we have but Morenci and Safford with the Lone Star deposit in other properties in North America. At Tenke, we still are doing drilling activities, metallurgical analyses to identify the mixed or sulfide based beyond our existing production that we have there. El Abra has continued opportunities for our resource additions and we\u2019re working with partners in the area to determine the best way to deal with that and we have attractive rebuild project in Serbia. So that is a real strength of our company.","Now where do we stand in this process? Well, this first round of projects that we are now completing, the Morenci project; the Cerro Verde project; we previously completed the Tenke project; we\u2019re designed to add about 20% to our production volumes. We started on these projects in 2010; by 2016 we'll be moving from a sale, annual sales level of roughly 4 billion pounds to 5 billion pounds. I recall with that we completed the initial development of Tenke, we completed a start up of the Climax mine, we had enhanced production from our existing operations. Now, we're seeing where we go from there.","Grasberg through all the issues related to the export ban, the other issues we faced in recent times, we have progressed the development of the underground resource. This is a big project; very attractive long-term economics, because of the high grades of both copper and gold that are available to us. And we're working to establish Grasberg as a long-term asset with high production volumes, low cost. You can see that the schedule we're own, we provide for the commencement of mining from the extension of our existing DOZ mine, The Deep MLZ mine with this high grades that will begin by the end of 2015. And then once we complete mining the Grasberg pit, which will be 2016-2017 timeframe, we will commence mining from the Grasberg Block Cave underlying the pit and that\u2019s what we've been working on for several years and continue to invest in. All of that is part of our long-term plan.","Now to just where we stand in Indonesia, we entered this Memorandum of Understanding in July to allow us resume exports. Export sales have been prohibited since mid-January as a result of a government policy, government laws and regulations designed to encourage in-country investment and downstream processing.","We executed MoU; we agree to pay higher royalties, pay an export duty; we posted a bond to support a commitment to -- for a smelter development; and then we are continuing to operate under our existing cap. Our agreement with the government is that we will work to amend the contract of work provided we\u2019re provided assurances for our ability to operate beyond 2021 through the extension provisions of the cap to 2041 with assurances about our fiscal terms, operating rights and legal rights.","We\u2019ve done work with the government own that; work remains to be done. Last week, there was inauguration of the new government; the President came into office; he is now announced his cabinet; and we\u2019re again working in a transition mode from the prior government officials with these new government officials.","Our goal is to maintain a positive long-term partnership with the Government of Indonesia. We\u2019re confident we can achieve that because it\u2019s one of these things where it\u2019s everyone\u2019s best interest to do it. It\u2019s been a complicated political environment with the elections and we\u2019ve had to work in that environment. But we are confident; we\u2019re going to be able to achieve this because we've done such good things for the country, our employees and the reason and it's important to do country it's the right thing to do and we're going to work to do.","Labor, we have had issues with labors that started two years ago when we had a strike; [rumors] drew a CLA agreement following the strike three years ago with the strike. Last year, we signed a new CLA agreement. We've had safety issues that have been reported. We had a collapse of the underground classroom area last year and then recently we've had two accidents. Union has been -- we're approaching these with a great deal of focus to ensure that our procedures are right and we\u2019ll handle the safety right. Safety programs are strong by international standards. Operations in Indonesia have had very low incident rates. Our standards are very high, but it's because of the tyrant weather and the workforce, when someone makes a mistake, unfortunately the consequences can be tough.","So we're dealing with all of that. It's been -- let me just say an emotional time in Indonesia with the elections not only nationally, but in the region. And as a result of that, that's led to a current issue with parts of our workforce. 75% to 80% of our workforce is in place. But some workers are engaging in protest and demands relating to these recent safety issues where we\u2019re attempting to work with them. Some workers are currently not reporting to work and that\u2019s having some constraints on our mining activities in the pit. We\u2019ve been continuing to operate our mineral, our underground operations and our concentrate delivery systems, but it\u2019s having a current impact. And those discussions are going on right now.","We\u2019re getting support from the local government, the local community and the central government. And we\u2019re in the process of working to resolve this. We\u2019re reaching out with the union leadership to have discussions with them as well. Again this is thing, sorts of things that we\u2019ve worked through in the past and we\u2019ll work through these issues, but that is a situation we\u2019re dealing with currently.","Now stepping back, after we complete these projects where do we go next? We\u2019ve been engaged in Brownfield development studies. We have significant long-term opportunities for growth projects in Chile at our El Abra mine where we have a partnership with Codelco. We\u2019re talking with our partners about how to proceed with a major development project there that requires development of water sources desalinization pipeline project to power and so forth, but the great thing is we\u2019ve got a huge resource.","And so those are issues we\u2019re working on. At our Bagdad mine near Prescott here in Arizona we have a very significant large sulfide resource that has the capacity more than double our mill rates. We\u2019re working on developing the necessary steps with water land to develop pro-tailings areas and so forth to move forward with that.","In Tenke, we have the resource that allows for growth. To take the next step we require development of power resources for the area. And we are working with the government and other companies in Katanga to deal with that. That's a necessary step to allow us for the long-term development at Tenke.","And at the Safford mine in Eastern Arizona with the adjacent Lone Star resource, we have about five years left on our oxide, current oxide production. We're looking at a stepped opportunity there to supplement that oxide ore with ore from the Lone Star deposit. And then at Lone Star and at Safford, we have a significant sulfide resource that will allow for us to deal with that.","So that is kind of a line up before we're going and we'll continue to report for. We have from last \u201813 and \u201814 these, we have these 3D models, models that allow us to say grow hole results and project the geometry of resources and we thought we\u2019d share a couple of those with you at Morenci where we\u2019ve just completed an expansion of our mill. But the opportunity there because of this huge potential resource that\u2019s shown on this slide for a very large scale milling expansion in the future is something that is become increasingly more attractive.","At Lone Star, adjacent to Safford, a deposit that\u2019s been known about for decade now is because of the ability to take advantage of resources and the drilling and exploration analysis we\u2019ve done is showing a huge resource potential. These are in the U.S., today in the U.S., because of the improved energy situation coming from the shale oil and gas; development with attractive energy costs; because of the flexibility of U.S. labor; the support we have near in Arizona from the local government for Brownfield development expansions makes these things very attractive.","Jim Bob, would you want to say a couple of words about the potential projects?","Jim Bob Moffett","(Inaudible) average day two good examples Morenci and Lone Star that shows it is Brownfield and related the property that we acquired from (inaudible) iceberg is in there stat oil is there, tip of the iceberg with a big value of the iceberg down their own surface. Remember, the only different oxide ore (inaudible). So, if you look at this and see the growth have you build and (inaudible) need this (inaudible) a non-potential this would be daily (inaudible) in the year and rest of the world. So if you realize the most stable sign we have find into your projects, we shouldn\u2019t have with the infrastructure and on a year or so potentially Africa, as mentioned earlier 60 kilometer (inaudible).","Richard Adkerson","Great. Thanks Jim Bob. Now, just closing we're really excited about the business. It's tough business. There are challenges we have to face. And over the years, we're confident about our ability to do that and we've got a track record of doing it. Great set of assets, great people, great technology; and then on page 15, you can see where we have right now with insight five mines to be world class mines and those are very, very difficult to find with 400,000 to 500,000 tons of annual production. That's again the world and then all these resources that while we won't be spending capital on, in the near term we'll be very disciplined about that. We're going to be focused on the shareholder returns. It gives us a great deal of excitement about this part of our business. And now Jim shares that excitement about oil and gas business and I\u2019ll let him takeover.","Jim Flores","","Thank you Richard and good morning everyone. As Kathleen articulated in our opening comments, oil and gas business is doing well. Our sales of 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in the third quarter were slightly above the July estimate but it was impacted by our earlier $3.1 billion rationalization of the Eagle Ford Shale assets in the second quarter. We continue to have good steady production performance in California and our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico while higher margin barrel of oil come from.","The cash operating margin was $600 million for the quarter and with the $48 barrel margin, it was impacted by the decent price activity and the Brent pricing, 68% of Gulf of Mexico with the $65 margin and we\u2019ve done a good job over the summer to position the company for future growth out of our key area, which is the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Also our oil hedges that were carried over from the plains days come in handy with this current oil price where we have put to this rocket 90 bucks, they cost us $3 or $4 a barrel and so forth and when you start talking about $80, $85 oil in this type of market, volatility imbalance that there is a fire protection you need to make sure you continue to protect your capital budget, your shareholder returns that we\u2019re all pledged to protect.","On page 17, the reserves and resource potential, we\u2019re trying to articulate here but what the rotation of our business has been from purely production assets that are flat to declining to something that\u2019s going to be impactful for the company with large growth. As you can see California and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico is a great comparison, two excellent oil assets. The cash margin obviously in the Gulf of Mexico much higher because the efficiency of production versus California with 79 versus 53. And the reserve bases are basically about the same 200 million barrels each but the growth potential and the reserve potential in both areas is dramatically different, from 400 million barrels in California to 4.4 billion in the Gulf of Mexico. Still with the same operating leverage, still with the same Brownfield complexion of reserve adds and also the facility and technical leverage that observes your individual project economics was like in the mining business, that's where our strong foot is. So, we're putting a tremendous amount of effort as everyone does in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, positioning our business, we'll talk about that portfolio rotation here in a second.","In the meantime, we do have on the right hand side of the page a very large opportunity in Morocco to drill some (inaudible) plays and some deep structures there offshore that we're excited about. We\u2019ll start drilling those, the first one next year and the second in \u201816.","I have passed over, but not left out our gas business. Our gas business highlight about the Haynesville and Inboard Lower Tertiary with 23 Tcf of gas potential there versus our 8 billion barrels of oil upside. With gas prices where they are, we still continue to put the harness on this. We're drilling a few exploratory wells in Inboard Lower Tertiary on the backs of the Highlander apparent success, even though we haven't put it on production yet.","And as far as trying to delineate where the play goes to and try to make sure that we protect our resources there without going into full development just because of the gas price margin, obviously 285 Mcf or 18 bucks a barrel doesn't compete as well for capital as in deepwater Gulf of Mexico or California International does.","So that gives a look at the 8 billion barrels of potential resource potential we have in the company versus our 430 million barrel reserve base in the additional 23 Tcf. We have a very deep portfolio of opportunities that we point out taking advantage of for many years and decades to come.","Specifically to the third quarter business on page 18, the portfolio optimization comes on the back of the Eagle Ford shale interest sale for $3.1 billion at June of 14th. We reinvested $1.4 billion of deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest on a tax rate exchange for interest and picked up another 5% plus of our Lucius oil development and then Heidelberg oil development we\u2019re watching is just to the west of our Holstein facility in Green Canyon, pick up 12.5% both of those are operated by Anadarko.","And then a new -- our Vito oil discovery that shale in Anadarko and Statoil had drilled a few years ago, it\u2019s a delineated structure that has a lot of development of leases and exploitation and leases around the mini basin that we have a significant interest in. And this will give us an infrastructure hub coming in the basin that will make our offset drilling exploratory and exploitation leases have the Brownfield economics that we enjoy in the rest of our portfolio. And a super high quality projects and high quality operators that we\u2019ll be doing business with either as a [non-IV] partner operating for them as well.","So, this rotation into the Gulf of Mexico projects replaces the Eagle Ford production with extended growth profile starting at 2017, very value created, it was an ongoing -- it was an important ongoing step in our debt reduction plan with $1.2 billion of debt reduction in that after-tax proceeds.","The graphs of the deepwater production reflects on 18 incorporates these assets, as well as in that resource potential comparison. You can see how more important these assets were compared to our outside the Eagle Ford, so about 10 times more potential from the 1.3 billion barrels of oil. And just to remind everybody about our strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico, the size of our assets, the assets are coming. This is our Holstein facility here, reflecting we have Marlin and Horn Mountain as far as these big production facilities are running at about 25% of capacity. And we plan to get into 100% capacity by the end of this decade. The major development projects that are coming on is Lucius, Heidelberg and Vito. Lucius is scheduled to come on here in the fourth quarter of 2014; probably first production that will impact us over the line field would be early \u201815 and our new guidance reflects those small delays at Lucius. Heidelberg is scheduled to come on third quarter of \u201816 and detailed schedule will come on sometime in 2019 right now even though it's unsanctioned.","And then of course our exploration and exploitation opportunities, we're focused primarily with 85% of our dollars on exploitation the next several years and staying with our disciplined operating strategy of filling those existing facilities with high revenue barrels out of Gulf of Mexico. Kind of a global picture of our Gulf of Mexico here and starting from right to left; as I'm a left hander I like going backwards. We have a Marlin area Horn Mountain area and Mississippi Canyon area. And you see our Vito fits in very well between Mississippi Canyon and our Holstein Green Canyon area, the Vito in the lower Mississippi Canyon, Atwater Valley area and we\u2019re again able to keep the Canyon and Lucius. And it also reflects by asset areas where the 4.4 billion barrels of resource potential lie and it's a well balanced area, about 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrels per area and we continue to explore it as we get all of our seismic data in and our geosciences. And we think we have a long, long way to of developing Brownfield and tie back opportunities in these areas.","One we really want to highlight this morning is our Holstein Deep play that we\u2019re drilling on right now which is on page 25. This is a discovery that we drilled a few years ago and after the Holstein purchase, we\u2019re able to pick the leases back up and develop it. And this is the log from our initial well in Green Canyon 643 discovery well and we\u2019re currently drilling well about 1 mile south of it or 1 mile and 1.5 mile south of it, southeast of it. And we\u2019re in the M13 sand right now core and we\u2019ve done M13 A and B sands as well as the D sands and we\u2019re looking at the M13 E sand and coring it and then we\u2019re going to drill down the M18. We think this is a significant discovery at this point in time with the confirmation well and we\u2019re learning a lot about our seismic as we drill more wells here and how much comp as we have gone all the way around the salt feature. It\u2019s a very large resource potential multi-pay in the Miocene and we haven\u2019t got into the lower territory of the Cretaceous at this point in time.","So, this is going to be a dominant production event for us in 2016. At Holstein we have where we have about 100,000 barrels of capacity there, that will be able to bring on a significant portion of that 50,000 or 60,000 barrels a day in 2016 out of this the Holstein Deep drilling as we continue to drill around it that will complement with our Heidelberg and also Lucius ramp ups this year and the 2016 with Heidelberg. ","So we\u2019ve got a lot of production events coming forward that are already in the pipeline, some aggregate and the work done. And we're going to continue to drill the well and report on M18 sands and further the coring activity in our next call.","Lucius and Heidelberg development projects, I gave you the update on those just refresh it by memory. We have 25% work interest there, so it's a very significant; we talk about 80,000 barrels a day and half a million cubic feet of 450 million cubic feet of gas and most of that is third party. And then we have a 12.5% interest right now on Heidelberg going forward. And that as you can see the spot already had the sale away and it's progressing on structure.","And page 23 our Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous activities, we've been very active here. The Highlander project which is our top project at this point in time, we've had ongoing completion operations there. We've had some mechanical or equipment failure; we\u2019ve had to replace equipment that's put us about 30 days to 45 days behind. So we expect the flow test here in the fourth quarter, more oilfield stuff that we manage through. So, we're on track; we're just delayed.","The Davy Jones 2, we're conducting flow test with Wilcox sands. At this point of time, most of the test at this in point has not yielded commercial results of hydrocarbons, but it's given us comp and it's in our flow rates from the deeper sands that we can overflow on lot of water and not much gas, but at least the permeability and pyrolysis there if not the productivity. Same thing on Blackbeard West No. 2, and then on Blackbeard East, we're going to be including a rig later this year to do a Miocene completion there and there is some stands there and we're drilling our Farthest Gate West exploratory well and spud it here in October and it's drilling towards 29,000 feet in South West of Louisiana and we also have our Lineham Creek project that we\u2019ll review and completion operations with the operator Chevron.","So that\u2019s how together in oil and gas side had been active, we\u2019re rotating toward a very busy Gulf of Mexico season and for the next several years with our growth shift and driving production volumes and moving to cash flow production higher. Richard?","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Thanks Jim. Let\u2019s look at the outlook slide, our update to our outlook for the year 2014. Current copper is projected to be 3.9 billion pounds that reflects the sale of Candelaria and some timing issues at Grasberg gold molybdenum and oil this also reflects the most recent information we have from the operative Lucius about the start-up from it, it\u2019s going fine, but it\u2019s starting just a bit later in the fourth quarter and some maintenance that we\u2019re having in our modern platform, some unscheduled maintenance, but that gives our current outlook for our oil production. You can see our unit costs outlook is consistent in a $1.50 range. Operating cash flows at $3 copper would be $5.8 billion for the year and our capital expenditures are consistent with our previous estimates.","On a quarter-by-quarter basis, we have the projected sales volumes on page -- for the annual -- this is the annual, I\u2019m sorry on the slide here to myself. This is the annual sales volumes going from 2013 to 2016. Again copper reflects the adjustment for Candelaria and our most recent outlook for plans at Grasberg. You can see 2016 as we approach the completion of mining from the pit continues to be a big year. Some of that may go into 2017 based on the work that's been done there. And you can see the ramp up in our growth in oil and gas business as well.","Now we get to the quarterly slide that I was talking about earlier, but it shows again the adjustments for the year and gives our quarter-by-quarter projection of our volumes. The site operating cost, union operating cost that we have by region is shown on page 27. It shows good performance at each one of our operating sites, as well as our sales by region. That's information for your reference and doing your models.","And then on page 28, we have the fiction that we traditionally show, showing the cash earning capability of our business. At variant copper prices we now go from $3 to $4 and show operating cash flows ranging from $9 billion a year to $12.5 billion a year. Based on previous estimates, we've lowered the byproduct prices to $1,200 for gold and $10 for moly and $100 for oil and also reflect the sale of Candelaria and the adjustments of Grasberg volumes.","The capital expenditures and how they break out between oil and gas, major mining projects and sustaining capital for mining shows the completion of the Cerro Verde project in 2015 and the drop of -- as a result of that.","We remain committed to balance sheet management. We recognized that our long-term plans for developing our resource base can best be accomplished if we have a strong balance sheet. We\u2019re currently financially strong with an investment grade rating and our recent meetings with the credit rating agencies have been positive. We have acted in response to lower commodity prices to sell assets. We had a positive transaction with our Eagle Ford sale and now we\u2019ve sold Candelaria and we\u2019re continuing to look at other types of transactions to generate cash for balance sheet management. With lower commodity prices and with the situation in the non-investment grade credit markets is kind of the transactions are currently more challenging. But we\u2019re going to be creative, we\u2019re going to find ways of looking at the timing of our spending, we\u2019re going to -- we are looking at partnership arrangements that may give us the chance to share cost with others on attractive basis and we\u2019re looking at the potential for selling assets in a creative way.","We\u2019ve got a long history of adjusting our business to varying markets and we\u2019re prepared to do this now. We\u2019re looking at our balance sheet and how best structure is for the long-term. So this is still work in progress. What we want to communicate today to our shareholders is that as a management team and as a Board, we remain committed to this process of reaching a strong balance sheet to support the long-term development of our resource base and the attractive businesses that we\u2019re in.","So, that is our update of where we stand right now. We know you have a lot of questions; and Jim Bob, Jim and I, Kathleen and her team is here prepared to respond.","Kathleen Quirk","Operator, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","Hi, good morning.","Richard Adkerson","Hey Curt.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","I just wanted to drill down more into this capital allocation for the company going forward; obviously this year there has been pretty significant shifts both in terms of monetizing some of oil assets and then reinvestment in the deepwater. So, could you just comment on, do you continue to expect to pursue more bolt-on acquisitions in the deepwater and does the recent decline in the oil price change any thinking regarding exploration spending and\/or potential to what you would want to do with California?","Jim Flores","Okay. Curt, this is Jim. The aspect of spending, we\u2019re spending a minimal amount of exploration spending in the Gulf of Mexico, most of this development and exploitation spending around our facilities. So, as far as exploration and we'll be willing to change, there has not much of it been done. We are obligated to drill one well in Morocco on the exploration front, that's on the international side to go and call that the deepwater aspect.","The bolt-on acquisitions and so forth, the market -- I think it's going to continue to be there from the seller\u2019s perspective. Our needs, when you look at our portfolio on page 20; we have a tremendous portfolio; sure we\u2019ll buy a few leases when the [March] lease sale coming up. I don\u2019t forecast as active a year as we had this year. Even though there will be opportunity, we just don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t have the need.","As far as California and thinking about that, it\u2019s a monetization asset because of the flat production curve and growth. I think it kind of falls in the area where Richard talked about with the creativity and so forth; we still have partnership concepts and ways to do that. It\u2019s a tremendous asset to finance. And we\u2019re working on something as a project like that with partners to see obviously the market volatility. We\u2019re not rushing out to price something in this type of market; we want to see what things stabilize.","And we have probably a little more constructive outlook on commodity prices than the banks at this point in time. They\u2019ve been calling for $80 oil for three years and so they finally got it; now they call it for $70 oil. So, we see demand around the world, we have a pretty good look at it is continuing to be healthy. There is a lot of financial noise in the markets right now and all this will calm down and we\u2019ll get back to business usual, maybe early as first half of next year and maybe take a little longer, but we don\u2019t think so.","So we continue to have that I guess error and aquiver and we\u2019re talking about something that works that\u2019s very smart and value creative for the FCX stakeholders. And so that\u2019s more of a dry powder, but as far as rotating more Gulf of Mexico assets, we\u2019re probably developing those with the drill bit on our properties versus third-parties at this point in time.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","Okay. That's great. And then just a follow-up on the sulfide projects, Richard, can you give a sense for how the capital costs curve for say pounded capacity would look compared to some of the recent Brownfield expansions that you've been doing?","Richard Adkerson","You know, Curt that I'm always reluctant to use averages because we are assessing these projects based on the individual economics of each property. The nature of the properties are similar though. And that the available sulfide projects that we have to work with are these large low grade deposits. And we are looking at the individual aspects of what it takes to develop them. In other words, if we compare an El Abra with our Bagdad mine and when we look longer range at Morenci and Lone Star, all of those things have attributes for development, permitting water access, power that vary significantly.","So, if we match those up, we eliminate projects that don't fit in the portfolio, don't have good rates of return or ones that are not impactful or ones that we consider in a way we manage variations and prices overtime. So, with the real detail dynamic study of what to do and then we look at execution risk, which ones can be approached and achieved with the least amount of risk in terms of engineering design, tailings management it\u2019s a very dynamic kind of project.","So, we can give you averages, but that\u2019s not really the way we look at. You look at the Morenci project that we just completed that we\u2019re ramping up now. Here we added our modern hot pressure grinding roll mill, goes along a 1940s area mill. We\u2019re taking material that we were wasting and now we\u2019re finding a way to economically process it. It\u2019s a lot different situation than at Cerro Verde where we\u2019re basically tripling where we had an existing site.","We developed an innovative approach with a waste water system for the (inaudible) water. We had about a straight forward of building size you can have in this industry in terms -- and we have technology that we\u2019ve just put in place when we started the project and so we\u2019re tripling that and that gave us the opportunity to go for that.","So, as I said, what I\u2019m looking forward to is having a day where we can bring a group of investors here in and go into some detail, this is the process we go through in analyzing this thing. The issue is -- and this is the reason that the outlook for copper price is so good in situations that we have where we have the resource we have the ability to do it, we want to do it as fast as we can, we\u2019re talking 10 years plus or minus. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so supportive of prices.","Now if you\u2019re talking about a Greenfield project, you can just see -- might watch those that are going on around the world. And that\u2019s why I say when we\u2019re looking at market, that\u2019s really supportive of copper price. And grades are falling; mines are having to go underground to help those having to deal with these social issues. So, we think it's great business.","Curt Woodworth - Nomura","No question. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Thank you operator. Good morning everyone.","Richard Adkerson","Hi Oscar.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Hi guys. I\u2019d like to get started with the $12 billion in net debt target that you had set for 2016, would the presumption that the California sale at current oil prices doesn't make sense. Would you be willing to be flexible with that, because 2016 appears to be a pretty good year for production from your projects? And in addition to that, I noticed that you have been continuing to buy back high cost debt which makes absolute sense to me. So, could you just provide more color around that?","Richard Adkerson","Well, when we set the $12 billion target, it was just following the announcement of the acquisition of the oil and gas business. And we have faced some headwinds since that initial analysis with lower commodity prices, with the interruption of production in Indonesia and that's led us to find ways of selling assets and establishing our business. We're going to continue to do that. We are looking at capital spending, one of the attractive things in the oil and gas business it is; it is a business that has great more financial flexibilities than the mining business. Once we start spending on a mine like Cerro Verde, it\u2019s very difficult to pull the plug.","So it gives opportunity for partner arrangements that could help us for timing and spending for selling partial interest. And so we\u2019re going through all of our business, looking at all of our capital spending seeing what we can differ, how we can deal with it, how we can generate cash. And we are going to be committed to reaching the strong balance sheet target. All of you run your models and many of you said Richard my model shows it\u2019s going to be tough for you to get 12 billion by 2016, you\u2019re right by the way.","Does that mean, we\u2019re going to change our focus from getting to a strong balance sheet, none of us know what commodity prices are going to be in 2015, 2016. We have a great set of flexible assets, we\u2019re all very confident, we\u2019re going to reach the goal of having the kind of balance sheet that you -- most of you as investors are encouraging us to get to and we\u2019re going to work diligently to try to get there. While, we work to keep our production volumes up, execute deal with our issues in Indonesia, deal with our long-term growth plans to be disciplined about how we spend capital over the long range, we\u2019re going to deal with it.","Jim Flores","And Richard, just to add one thing; Oscar this is Jim. You mentioned only California sale. Remember, we have a very strong hedge book on the oil from the standpoint; I\u2019m looking from where commodity prices are now and what the current financial community\u2019s outlook for it is through \u201815. So that gives us a bridge to still be strongly considering a transaction evolved in California that has -- that is like I said accretive to the stakeholder report.","So we\u2019re in a unique position there to carry over some of those hedges on floors. So, I would not take that off the table at this point in time as part of our flexibility and bullets toward getting to the goals that Richard outlined because we're all committed across the board to making sure because we're talking about a business that lasts as Richard said for decades and 100 years, stock reserves. So the quicker we get to a balance sheet that we're proud of that we feel like it's going to give us the flexibility to accelerate the growth, the faster we'll all be happy right here. So if that helps you?","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch","No, that's great. From my perspective, you already have a strong balance sheet. Then if I may, second question with regards to Grasberg. COW would notice the agreement that Vale reach in their Indonesian nickel operations ahead of the President taking office. And I understand it's a difficult situation but I was just wondering if you could just compare and contrast your situation with that of Vale because it seemed that they've got an extension to the contract of work that they've been happy for and in addition to that, it seems just based on the press released that they can go directly to the Indonesian Stock Exchange to this dispose off 20% of the stake they need to do.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Well Oscar, let me say first of all, it's going to be a limit amount that I want to say about another company. You need to -- Vale will explain their situation but a key thing to remember for all of you looking at our situation in Indonesia, is that all of these contracts are different. They were signed at different times. Vale\u2019s operations like three forth go back; ours go back to the 70s, theirs go back at least to the 80s.","And so where they ended up where we ended up with was contracts that have historical legacy and that have significantly different terms going into this process. For whatever reason, for some reason the Indonesian government has elected to treat nickel and copper differently. Valley produces an intermediate project called nickel matte, which represents 80% of the value of refined nickel. That product is allowed to be exported under Indonesian regulations without any restrictions without any duty. We produce a product called copper concentrate that is worth 90% plus 90% to 95% of value of refined copper and yet it\u2019s treated essentially as an ore and we\u2019re subject to these restrictions.","I don\u2019t have any answer for that. But Valley\u2019s contract according to their press reports did not have legally the same degree of assurance in the contract authorized to extend. Legally our contract work has very strong provision that gives us the right for extensions from 2021 to 2041. Valley\u2019s contract extended to 2025 and did not have the same kinds of legal provisions. They\u2019ve breached some agreement with Indonesian government, we\u2019re not sure the details, but allows them to continue operate under a business license approach. And typically under a business license you have the right to operate, but you\u2019re subject to prevailing laws and regulations that can be changed.","We\u2019re working with the government and it was acknowledged in our MoU with the need for us to have assurance about the terms of our operations beyond 2021 about our rise to operate physical terms legal enforceability because we're spending so much capital now between now and 2021 that won't be produced until after 2021. 75% of our reserves are produced after 2021.","So, we have to be in a position of saying we'll spend this money, we've agreed to work with them on our smelter, but provided we have assurance of terms beyond 2021. Valley\u2019s situation is different and I don't know enough about it really to give you a detailed comparison in any event I don't want to talk about another company. But our situation is just what I described.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch","No that was great Richard. That\u2019s the sentiment I was looking for. Thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you, Oscar.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ash Lazenby with HSBC. Please go ahead.","Ash Lazenby - HSBC","Yes. Good morning all, just a couple of questions. Just if you could possibly expand a bit more you commented about the hedge book on to next year. If you do give us an idea of how significant the volumes are and sort of prices and to the extent that you can disclose that?","And then secondly, just a point of clarification in terms of the CapEx and on oil, the $3.5 billion to $4 billion, how can we think about that in terms of flexibility? For example, if the oil price wasn't recover from these sorts of level, how much sort of flexibility do you have within those CapEx figures where you could potentially bring in some of that and free up some more and then boost the free cash flow generation. And what would that be In terms of the reduction of any of sort of production that you've currently got in the profile? Thank you.","Jim Flores","Ash, it\u2019s a two part. On page 35 in our presentation and I need Kathleen to take it a later bit. 35 has got a detail on all our volumes. And we have 83 million barrels a day that\u2019s a hedge profile talked about in 2014 or 107 in 2015. So significant portion, all of our California volumes decided to do a transaction, so page 35 will help you there. As far as flexibility in CapEx, there is couple of different ways to do it, right, there is -- you can just reduce activity, but in spite of flexibility that oil and gas business has, we do have significant relationships in contracts with drill ships and the Gulf of Mexico, you have to plan your business much further ahead due to the regulations today and go through all that regulatory process and permitting that causes a little lengthier situation.","I think the easiest or the best way to do it, start looking at the longer dated projects and develop joint venture relationships and basically bring in partners to share the spending. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been active in doing for the past several months and going to be continue to have those discussions, mainly out of solicitations from investors to us versus us really reaching out to other investors. So we\u2019re ramping up those activities to make sure that we continue to maintain that. Our front end loaded development activity versus doing too much drilling for the future while, even though it\u2019s development, during any kind of period of constraint commodity prices. So we\u2019re looking at building that flexibility. And I think you\u2019ll see the realization of it in the second half of 2015, if we\u2019re able to be successful there. I think in the first half of 2015, you would look at rationalization of assets like California; in the second half, you look at the realization of joint ventures reducing CapEx and we're going to proceed to have a flexibility in our program irrespective of where our prices are if it makes sense.","Ash Lazenby - HSBC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I was taking a look at the commodity prices on December 5, 2012 when you announced the oil and gas acquisitions versus yesterday. It implies about 2.8 billion a year less after-tax cash flow. It would seem as though some of the CapEx is more, things like smelter in Indonesia came up small. And some of the CapEx that's a large project in midstream is hard to change like the Cerro Verde Mill ones you've started. Given the decline in cash flow, what are the levers of spending that you can turn off? And would it be less damaging to just omit the dividend as opposed to cutting off these oil and gas projects when they're permitted or the Peruvian CapEx in midstream and you've got probably some regulatory CapEx for [provision] control? And I know it's very complicated, it\u2019s a terrible question but the realities of markets in the markets.","Richard Adkerson","Right. Well John, you\u2019re exactly right and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing with. I mean we have as this situation has unfolded with the lowering of commodity prices, with the interruption we had in Indonesia, we\u2019ve been taking steps all along. In our mining business we scrutinized spending to differ delay spending all along and we\u2019ve done that in oil and gas and we\u2019re going to continue to do it.","We are not in a 2008 crisis mode. Oscar made the point, thank you Oscar for saying that at the end of his -- as we answered his questions; we\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet. I mean we\u2019re an investment grade rated company right now. We\u2019ve had very positive discussions with the agencies. And so the issue of having to take the draconian steps that we took in the fall of 2008 where I came back from LME; we called our team together and said we\u2019re stopping spending right then. I mean we stopped Climax; we stopped the spending on Cerro Verde which was an earlier stage on Morenci. We just stopped all the projects; we cut the dividend; we even raised a little capital if you recall. We\u2019re not like that now. We don\u2019t have to go through that kind of analysis. But what we want our shareholders to understand is we\u2019ve got this commitment to work to strengthen our balance sheet in a rational way. We\u2019re not going to fire sale assets, we don\u2019t have to. We\u2019re going to find ways; we\u2019re going to look at all of our capital spending, see if things can be deferred with that of where we\u2019re honoring our contracts to spend where we\u2019re doing what we need to do.","This is not something we're bringing our hands about here. We can manage our way through this and preserve our long-term growth. We're not having any discussions about cutting the dividend. We are just talking about managing our business. And we got the assets, the balance sheet and the way to do it. And we're going to do it in a way that John you're going to be happy with and we're going to be happy with.","Jim Flores","Yes. John this is Jim. There is no well that support enough to drill before paying the dividend on the oil and gas side. They can be drilled later or that type of things just because of structure of our business as Richard talked about on the mining aspect. They are very co-relative of both sides. And I think what's impacted is trying to impress everybody about this company is that we're not only trying to put our business in great shape for the future, now we're in great shape for the present. At the same point in time, increase our flexibility about paying that debt all at the same time. That it is that hard to do, yes, we\u2019ve all acknowledge that. But that's the kind of goals and realizations that our Board expects and we're proud of the flexibility of our business to be able to even -- to discuss a proposal. And we've made some progress this year with Candelaria and the Eagle Ford sale and we've got more progress to do.","So, we're all in the same boat and I think it will be beneficial for the shares irrespective where commodity prices go and that's what our job is.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Thank you, I'm a shareholder.","Jim Flores","Thanks John. So are we, John.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Lee Gorin with (inaudible). Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Yes Richard, just two questions. First is that a lot of chatter regarding the copper tied up in financial deals, China has tied down. And I was wondering if you had any comment on that? And second, this is the first time I\u2019ve heard you talk of Serbia. And I\u2019m very curious about where that project lies as far as in your priority of your capital investments and new projects going forward between now and 2020? And a bit to that property, so it\u2019s very interesting.","Richard Adkerson","Yes. I knew you\u2019ve been there, Lee. Great hearing from you, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other. This financing deal in China has always been murky as to what it meant; they had this fraudulent situation developed, but of course that for a period of time really raised everybody\u2019s concern. We\u2019ve talked about over the years at any point in time in China there is always some story about things that could be happening. And I got to tell you, I don\u2019t know all the details of the financing scheme, but when I look at the size of the Chinese economy and the amount of money that\u2019s being spent on development even in this lower gross situation and thinking about all they have to do to meet their development goals for the interior and what\u2019s they grid is pacing this year, next year with over 20 year period in terms of development, how much copper that involves.","So, I got to tell you, I think a lot of these stories about inventories at any point in time, financing deals or slide shows that are probably really meaningful for companies that are traders, companies that have to make short-term statements about what to do with copper stocks and buying and selling. For company like ours, we\u2019re again focused on the longer term situation.","Just like you as investors often have to be more concerned about short-term movement as to how you realign your portfolios, we understand that. But if we ever were to let short-term deals affect the way we run this business, then we're going to miss out on some huge opportunities because of the time it takes to get projects ready to go.","Now Serbia: There is nothing in the natural resource business like Greenfield exploration, I mean nothing. It is idea of making some investments in exploration and finding a new asset and creating huge value. That's the happiest day you can have in a company like ours. And in oil and gas business it happens a lot more frequently than it does in the mining business; and that's again what\u2019s supportive about prices. You go back and you think what are the big success stories during my long career in the mining business from Greenfield exploration, they are few and far between. We have an active program, Rich [Lovell] and Jim Bob worked with and we fund junior mining companies around the world, own exploration concepts that have the potential to be big. We don't look at anything unless it has a potential to be big. So that's why you haven't heard much from us about this program. This does, this has a potential. You've been there. There have been some real exciting core holes that have been drilled. A lot of work needs to be done. It's in an area that's a traditional mining area. The government of Serbia is very anxious to see come in and invest.","The current status is we're not actively drilling now. We're working on partnership arrangements with our partner there. I saw them briefly in London when I was there last week. And we're excited about it but it\u2019s longer term; a lot of work to be done but it is a Greenfield project that if it is successful could add a lot of value to our company.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you Richard very much.","Richard Adkerson","Okay.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joan Lappin with Gramercy Capital. Please go ahead.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Good morning. I have a question about the water bates flowing through on this recent test. I would presume that what you haven\u2019t said straight out is you have solved the problem of how to perforate these wells now and whether we\u2019re getting out hydrocarbons in commercial quantities is less significant in a way then all the problems that we had at Davy 1. So, my question is, am I correct in surmising that that the guns are now working and the ability to perforate at these steps is now perfected? And would that mean that would you ever go back to Davy 1; what this implies for Davy 2 and for -- and can you elaborate a little on whatever the problems were you had at Highlander?","Jim Flores","Joan this is Jim Bob. That\u2019s a possibility, the other possibility is the reservoirs are different and the porosities and permeabilities were better at Davy Jones 2 versus Davy Jones 1. When we\u2019re in the business of producing salt water versus oil and gas, it\u2019s scientific but as far as economic and financial, all eyes are on Highlander, that\u2019s where we have even better porosity and permeability and core evidence and log evidence of having accumulations so that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.","The delays in Highlander were strictly oil field related equipment that failed that we had we retrieved out of the whole and just put us behind schedule. But we think we're getting closer and closer to the development test and we've got a little more work to do out there. And feel like here in the fourth quarter, we'll deal with kind of test of Highlander and put it in the sales very quickly, once it happens. So, that's what we're focused on; we're really just updating everybody over the operational results of those existing wellbores from McMoRan.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Well, I know you are not in a business of producing water. But I'm asking it's more specific question which is\u2026","Jim Flores","And Joan, I'd say that is a possibility but there is also another possibility.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","What's the possibility?","Jim Flores","The possibility is that it was -- it's purely mechanical with the perforating guns. But the other possibility, more likely possibility is just different, reservoir characteristics. So, I know I'm answering your question with two answers and either one a possibility that could be the reservoir characteristics has changed or the mechanical aspects of the guns, I happen to think and I have think it has to be reservoir characteristics, but that guns are an issue. But at the end of day, we're focused on Highlander and perfecting the flow rates of gas and oil there and that's what we're are concentrating.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Okay. So, you will not say that the guns are now working?","Jim Flores","They've always worked.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Well, there is some question about that. But okay, thank you. ","Jim Flores","There you go.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, thanks. I just had a question on your hedging portfolio in oil and gas. And I know you commented on that being an asset possibly in the divestiture of California. Are there any plans to add to that portfolio because it was acquired with the plant\u2019s exploration and since announcing you guys have added to it at all?","Kathleen Quirk","Steve, this is Kathleen. We\u2019ve not added to the positions, PXP had positions going into the deal, which will benefit us during this period of time. We continue to monitor markets and look at how a hedging program might fit in with our overall plans and capital spending. But at this point in time with these markets we\u2019re not looking to add to positions, but it\u2019s something that will continue to evaluate overtime in the future.","Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets","All right. And then\u2026","Richard Adkerson","Steve I just might note too, company situation is different than [plains] and FCX. I mean we have a broader set of assets, stronger balance sheet. We\u2019re also short oil in a lot of our businesses. It\u2019s kind of different to match it all up piece-by-piece, but we\u2019re a big energy user, energy is 20% to 25% of our costs. It\u2019s from a variety of sources in our mining business natural gas, hydro, but all other component of it.","So, when we step back and look at the overall business in terms of what our financing strategy should be, it\u2019s a different circumstance than having an independent oil and gas I think my point was.","Jim Flores","Steve, this is Jim. I will just highlight and it gives us a lot of flexibility during the comparative time that other people do not have when it comes to valuations and financial flexibility of financing deals with California. So that was -- that\u2019s unique to us and unique to our situation.","Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. And then just on the debt target, it came up early about the $12 billion net debt target by 2016, but it sounds like you're sort of shying away from that and then you targeted just a strong balance sheet without a certain number around that. Is that correct in assuming that's where you're sort of leading into?","Richard Adkerson","Look, all I'm acknowledging; let me just say I'm acknowledging is we have a target and we're working to get that, never anything magic about that target. We want it just to be as clear as we could to the marketplace at the time about trying to make it. It would be unrealistic of me to sit here and look at these circumstances and what we're dealing with and say if I got $12 billion, it\u2019s $12 billion. We're going to continue to work towards it. We're going to work to have a strong balance sheet. We're going to look at the time of when we can get there and I'm just being realistic than not being realistic.","Jim Flores","And Steve, that is really the discipline that brings into all the spending, all our business, it sure keeps everybody focused on creating value. So it's been a beak and it\u2019s been endorsed by the board. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on it.","Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets","Perfect. That's it for me. Thanks a lot.","Operator","","Our last question comes from the line of with Wilfredo Ortiz with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Wilfredo Ortiz - Deutsche Bank","Yes, good morning everyone. Just a quick question on your volume guidance for copper for the fourth quarter, does this include any type of impact if like at Grasberg were to take place? And if it does take place, would it impact the whole operation or just partially a portion of the operation? Just wanted to get a sense as to what we're seeing as far as the guidance versus what could potentially happen if the strike doesn\u2019t sue post November 6.","Richard Adkerson","The answer is it does not include any impacts of any kind of potential work disruption strikes or otherwise. And there is no real clear answer to your question. As I said, as we speak now there is a group of workers primarily in the Grasberg open pit who are not reporting to work that\u2019s in violation of our collective labor agreement. The work continues in our DOZ mine, in our underground development, in the mill operations and so forth. So, we\u2019re just going to have to work through this. It\u2019s unclear even if the union were to declare a strike; to what extent will the workforce respond to that. There is a -- it\u2019s a dynamic situation with a lot of interest represented even within the union. And so we\u2019re going to deal with it, could have an impact. That impact is not reflected in any of our numbers and there is one thing you can be sure of Indonesia, you\u2019ve got a real time news flow coming your way because whatever the union does is in the paper every day. And we\u2019re going to be active in our communications efforts to make sure the market is aware of what the circumstance is. ","Wilfredo Ortiz - Deutsche Bank","Understood. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Thank you, Wilfredo.","Operator","Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard Adkerson","We appreciate everybody\u2019s interest and your good questions. We\u2019re going to work hard to achieve all these goals that we have. And we\u2019re very confident we\u2019re going to be successful. So, thanks for your interest in following our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Quirk","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. ","As usual, we have several slides to supplement our comments this morning, and we'll be referring to the slides during the call. The slides are also accessible using the webcast link on fcx.com. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments today, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Johnson is also with us today. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported first quarter 2012 net income attributable to common stock of $764 million or $0.80 per share compared with $1.5 billion or $1.57 per share for first quarter 2011. The first quarter 2012 results included $149 million or $0.16 per share in losses on the early extinguishment of debt in connection with the refinancing of $3 billion in senior notes during the quarter. ","Our first quarter 2012 consolidated sales of 827 million pounds of copper and 288,000 ounces of gold were lower than the January 2012 estimates of 875 million pounds of copper and 425,000 ounces of gold. Our copper sales in the first quarter were higher than the revised March 2012 estimate of 795 million pounds, and gold sales were slightly below the revised estimates of 300,000 ounces. ","As we previously reported, labor-related work interruptions and temporary suspension of operations affected production at PT Freeport Indonesia during the first quarter 2012. This was partly offset by higher sales from North America. ","The estimated impact of the work interruptions at PT Freeport Indonesia during the first quarter totaled about 80 million pounds of copper and 125,000 ounces of gold. Operations and productivity at PT-FI have improved recently, and for the quarter-to-date period, our milling rates averaged approximately 200,000 metric tons of ore per day compared with just under 115,000 metric tons of ore per day in the first quarter. ","Full operations, which are dependent on our ability to maintain security and productivity in the workplace are expected to be restored during the second quarter of 2012. ","Our molybdenum sales in the first quarter of 21 million pounds were slightly higher than our estimate of 20 million pounds and the year-ago level of 20 million pounds. Our realized prices during the first quarter averaged $3.82 per pound. That was lower than last year's first quarter of $4.31 per pound. And for gold, we realized almost $1,700 per ounce in the first quarter 2012, which was higher than last year's $1,400 per ounce in the first quarter of 2011. ","The molybdenum price recorded realization averaged $15.34 per pound in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the year-ago average of $18.10 per pound. As anticipated, our consolidated average unit net cash cost net of byproduct credits of $1.26 per pound of copper in the first quarter of 2012 were higher than the year-ago level of $0.79 per pound, primarily because of lower copper volumes in Indonesia, higher mining and input costs in North and South America and lower byproduct credits. ","Our operating cash flows during the first quarter totaled just above $800 million and that was net of $720 million in working capital requirements. Capital expenditures during the first quarter totaled just over $700 million. That included expenditures to advance our growth projects, which are targeted to increase our annual copper production by over 25% over the next several years. ","We ended the quarter in a strong financial position. Our consolidated cash totaled $4.5 billion, which exceeded our total debt of approximately $3.5 billion. During the quarter, we sold $3 billion of senior notes in 3 tranches with a weighted average interest rate approximating 3%. We used the proceeds to reduce higher cost debt. We redeemed the remaining $3 billion of our 8.375% senior notes and will generate interest cost savings associated with this transaction of $160 million per year. ","In February of 2012, our board authorized an increase in our common stock dividend to an annual rate of $1.25 per share, with the first quarterly dividend at the higher rate to be paid on May 1 to shareholders of record on April 13. ","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the slide materials on our website.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thank you, Kathleen. During the quarter, we published our annual report to shareholders for 2011 and Slide 3 talks about the themes that we spoke to in the annual report about our leadership position in global copper markets, the gold production we have out of our Grasberg mine in Indonesia, our world-leading low-cost molybdenum business, our growing cobalt business and our company, with its very substantial proved and probable reserves of resources -- and of reserves of our products, as well as our significant resources, is particularly well situated to take advantage for the global demand in the future. ","For these products, we are geographically diverse, long-lived reserves. Within our set of assets, our existing assets, we have a very attractive growth profile, both in the intermediate term and the longer term. Our financial position is strong with our recent financing and with our focus earlier in reducing debt and we continue to recognize our responsibilities for environmental, social and sustainable development activities and it\u2019s an important part of what we do. ","In the mid May, we celebrated the 5th year anniversary of the Phelps Dodge deal. When I visited our mines and our team here in mid March -- when I visited with our team at a number of our mines and here in Phoenix and Indonesia, I was just so encouraged by the quality of our people, the very high morale that we have and our focus on creating shareholder value. ","Kathleen reviewed our financial results, and it showed strong performance in the Americas and in Africa, which reflects the geographic diversity impacts of our business. I'm happy to report that we are making continuing progress in restoring normal operations in Grasberg, following the 3-month strike and the issues associated with returning the workforce after the strike and our work with the Indonesian security organization in terms of dealing with the security situation in Papua. ","We are advancing our growth projects. We're targeting increasing sales of copper by 25% over the next 3 to 4 years and that is progressing well. Kathleen mentioned that we took advantage of these favorable credit markets and our company's strong financial position to refinance debt on very attractive terms and our board has increased our common stock dividend. ","The details of the financial results are reflected on Page 5. Now, I just referenced that for your information as Kathleen has just gone over that. ","To give you an update on where we stand with Grasberg, following a 3-month strike, we reached agreement with our basic labor union on a new 2-year labor agreement for PT-FI employees in the mid December. During the first quarter, we continued to face some work interruptions in connection with our reintegration of the labor union workers back into our operations and we had a roughly 3-week suspension of activities as we met with our workforce to resolve certain issues and to undertake a socialization of the new labor agreement. And that had an impact in the first quarter of about 80 million pounds of copper, to 125,000 ounces of gold. ","We are seeing progress in returning to normal operations. Second quarter to date, our mill is operating at over 200,000 tons per day after being limited to 115,000 tons per day in the first quarter. And full operations are online to return to normal levels in the second quarter, of course, depending on our ability to continue the productivity in our work force and a secure workplace. ","Slide 7 shows our first quarter unit production costs. Indonesia was affected by the lower volumes. It was also affected by lower grades that were available to us in our open pit operations. Our costs in our other operations were in line with our plans. It does reflect higher input costs than in the prior year. And also, the fact that as we expand operations, unit costs are higher but our team has done a good job in managing these costs and results in an overall consolidated attractive cost level for our company. ","Markets continue to be very positive this year. For copper, we saw a stronger-than-expected start for our business in the first quarter in the United States. Europe is weak but it is not as weak as some feared going into the second half of 2011. China has taken steps to control growth, and there's a lot of commentary about the outlook for the Chinese economy but China continues to spend money on infrastructure projects, its fundamental economy appears to be strong, and overall, the copper market is very positive, given the uncertainties of the world that we've been living with. ","2012 appears to be another year of a deficit in the copper markets. Gold prices remain at strong levels. Molybdenum prices are relatively stable and these levels supports our expansion plans and our high profitability of our moly business. ","China remains the important demand driver. As I indicated, investments in urbanization and infrastructure support that marketplace. All of those investments require significant amounts of copper. While the government has taken steps to control inflation by limiting growth, it's done so in a very effective way and growth levels, growth percentages, on the increasingly large Chinese economy still results in significant consumption. ","As I mentioned, the first quarter in the U.S. started out strong. Of course, there are uncertainties in our economy that all of you are aware of. But manufacturing, particularly auto sales, have contributed to this positive situation in the U.S. In the U.S. and Europe, we see very low inventory stocks as that's been managed to be low because of the economic uncertainties and on a big picture basis, copper has tended to move more into China than in Europe and the U.S. and the market remains tight there. ","But global inventories overall remain relatively low. The industry continues to face supply constraints from interruptions to existing operations and the challenges of bringing on new production because of a whole variety of issues: technical, cost constraints, environmental constraints and so forth. So the fundamentals of the copper market remain strong. ","Slide 10 gives some comments about our PT-FI contract of work. We signed a contract in 1991 that had a 30-year primary term and provided for 2 10-year extensions through 2041. On the terms of the original contract, applying for those extensions, which we have started that process now, requires government approval but the contract provides that, that approval cannot be withheld unreasonably. ","The contract provides for fixed taxes and royalty rates. After several years of consideration, Indonesia has now passed a new mining law which applies to new projects that are developed within the country. Under our contract of work, we pay a 35% income tax rate. The current statutory rate in Indonesia is 25%. We pay royalties at these prices of 3.5% on copper. The new mining law provides for 4% and 1% on gold while the new mining law has 3.75%. ","We also pay a 10% withholding tax on payments of dividends from PT-FI to FCX. And in total, including the 9-plus percent equity interest that the government has, the government gets more than 50% of the benefits of the cash flow that's generated by Grasberg. Also, our COW payments to the government are higher than prevailing law, and in fact, they are higher than would be made if the laws of any other country were applied that has mining operations. ","There's been a lot of discussions about in-country processing of minerals within Indonesia. We arranged for the construction of Indonesians\u2019 only copper smelter in the 1990s and it is world-class, arguably, among the most efficient copper smelters in the world, processing 280,000 tons of metal per year. We are in compliance with our COW during all of our years of operations since 1972 in Indonesia. We've had 2 COWs during that period. The government has also complied with the COW. We have no issues of noncompliance on either side. ","We have no divestiture obligations under our COW. The new mining law provides for 20% of divestiture obligation but we are under our existing COW, not the new mining law. We have, as we've reported for several years now, voluntarily agreed to offer a 9.36% interest in PT-FI to Indonesia nationals. That's fair market value on a business-to-business basis. ","We have a very positive relationship with the country of Indonesia and with its government officials. The government has undertaken a review of all mining contracts. We are working cooperatively with the government, and I'll say that we will continue to do so to be responsive to issues raised by the government in the context of protecting the values of our contract for our shareholders, and we're very encouraged about the outcome of that process. ","Our financial benefits to Indonesia are large. We contributed over $60 billion to national GDP in Indonesia since 1992. With our development of our underground resources at Grasberg, we have plans to spend $15 billion in new capital. We're by far the largest employer in Papua and one of the largest if not, the largest, income taxpayer in Indonesia. We're 2\/3 to 3\/4 of the GNP in Papua and in the Mimika region, we're roughly 95% of the economy. You can see the very large taxes that we pay under our existing COW, $2 billion in 2011 plus dividends and royalties and we make voluntary contributions to the community. We have a partnership fund for a community development, and we've contributed over $500 million for that fund since 1996 through 2011. ","We do have a diverse set of assets geographically, and we are focused on converting these very large mineral resources that we have to reserves, to evaluate our reserves aggressively, to identify development projects that will lead to production growth and cash flows. When I say large resource reserve base, our recoverable reserves at an average copper price of $2 is 120 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves according to SEC definition requirements. ","In addition to that, based on drilling and exploration analysis we've done to date, we have contained copper at a long-term price of $2.20 of mineralized material that's not included in these reserves of over 100 billion pounds of copper in place. Together, this is an enormous resource that gives us the chance to have growth both in the near term, midterm and long term. And we have that growth without having to make acquisitions with spending capital prudently on projects that make sense from an economic standpoint. We have a greenfield exploration program but we're not dependent on greenfield exploration for growth. ","Slide 13, you can see these resources and reserves summarized and you can see the location. It's noteworthy that over half are located in North America. Not too many years ago, the Southwest copper district was considered to be uneconomic and short-lived. With the demand for copper in the world today, we have plans that will lead us to invest billions of dollars, employs thousands of people in North America as well as growing in South America, Africa and continuing to maintain our profitable long-term, low-cost operations in Indonesia. ","Our near-term projects, copper projects, include as shown on Slide 14, our projects that were deferred during the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. We've restored the Morenci mill, our flagship operation in the U.S. here in Arizona and we've increased our mine rates. We have begun to mine and produce copper from the Miami area, the historical Miami Globe area where we have significant reclamation obligations and we're making money out of that as we fulfill those reclamation operations. ","We restarted the Chino mine in New Mexico and are ramping it up. And in South America, we've completed the Sulfolix project which replaced the depleting oxide production that had been the basis for that El Abra mine for years. All of these projects are going well. ","In Colorado outside Leadville, we have started up the Climax Molybdenum mine. We had invested in this project and deferred it in 2008. Now, we've gone back in and we've spent the capital. Construction is essentially complete. We're ramping up to 20 million pounds of molybdenum a year during 2013 and depending on market conditions, we can increase it to 30 million pounds a year. We'll be responsive to the market. Of course, we produce molybdenum at our Henderson mine in Colorado and it\u2019s a byproduct in a number of our copper mines. ","I mentioned earlier, the very significant investments that we're making underground in Indonesia. The Grasberg pit, which we began to develop in the 1990 timeframe, is -- will reach depletion of the surface mining opportunities in roughly 2016. That's a fluid number depending on our experience between now and then. But we have very significant underground reserves, aggregate reserves total and these are reserves, 37 billion pounds of copper and 32 million ounces of gold. ","Our existing DOZ underground block caving mine has a capacity of 80,000 tons per day. We are developing the Big Gossan mine, which is a high-grade mine with 7,000 tons per day production rate. The Grasberg block cave, which cannot commence until we complete mining in the pit is being prepared to do just that.  ","And then as an extension of the DOZ mine, we have, where we begin mining in this area in the early 1980s, the Deep MLZ mine where we've completed a feasibility study and has a startup in 2015. Our underground production is expected to reach 240,000 tons per day for our mill and our share of development costs will be spread over a number of years. The aggregate is large but expecting to average about $550 million per year over the next 5 years. ","The Grasberg block cave and the Deep MLZ mine will be the source of ore to our mill as we complete mining from the pit. We've completed significant development for access to these orebodies and over recent years, have made very good progress. The development capital is significant but it is spread out over a number of years. ","We're showing at the bottom of this chart, the ramp up of the Deep MLZ as we transition from the DOZ mine to the Deep MLZ mine and when -- and the startup of the Grasberg block cave. Because of very high grades at the Deep MLZ mine and because of our plans to have a significant stockpile of material from the Grasberg open pit, we see that we have been able to offset to a significant extent, the drop-off in production from the open pit and with these higher-than-average ore grades, our share of production is expected to average 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.4 million ounces of gold between 2017 and 2021. This transition is obviously a big focus of our team and will continue to be. ","Beyond the startup projects, we do have very significant investment projects that we are progressing and investing capital in. At Cerro Verde, we are -- have a project to triple its mill throughput. This would be the largest concentrating mill operation in the world, a significant capital at $4 billion. We've filed our Environmental Impact Statement in the fourth quarter, engineering and long lead line procurement -- lead time procurement is progressing and we expect to achieve full rates in 2016. ","We are also investing in a mill expansion at Morenci to take advantage of the resources that our exploration program has identified for us there. And we are involved in our first expansion project at our Tenke Fungurume mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo where operations have progressed in a very reasonable fashion. This project is going much more smoothly than our initial development project because of our experience in that project and in conducting operations there. ","These 3 projects involve $6.3 billion of capital and roughly 1 billion pounds a year in incremental copper. Now, some information on the Morenci mill expansion which is a very high rate of return project is included on Page 19. It involves increasing the mining rate, expanding the mill to 115,000 tons per day, 1.4 billion pounds of capital for 225 million pounds of copper a year. We've completed the feasibility study. Permitting is going well. Engineering and procurement is going well. We expect to achieve full rates in 2014. And as we do this, because of positive exploration results, we're continuing to look for a larger mill expansion to mine sulfide material at Morenci. ","The details of the Cerro Verde project are shown on Page 20. As I mentioned, we will be going to 360,000 tons per day through a mill, basically expanding our existing mill facilities and footprint. All aspects of this project are very favorable for this sort of development. Significant increase in mine rates take advantage of the resources that we have. Our exploration is expected to continue to add to these reserves and resources. This is the same basic technology that we've had with our existing operations, which was -- had its last major expansion that was completed at the end of 2006. ","We've developed a plan for obtaining water for this operation. And water is -- those of you who follow the industry in Peru and also in Chile, anywhere in mining, is really a critical factor. But by working with the local community of Arequipa, we are working to develop the wastewater system, which will be of benefit significantly to the community but also, will provide the water for our project and we believe this will avert any controversy over water for our project. ","At Tenke, the project that we're currently investing in, it would expand the mill to 14,000 tons a day. Our mine rate would increase. We're adding tankhouse capacity. It's about $850 million of capital to give us 150 million pounds incremental copper per year. We are under construction and we're targeting completing at the end of next year. We're continuing to conduct exploration drilling and analysis of this large 600-plus square mile concession, which has additional oxide resources, additional -- significant amounts of sulfide resources are indicated. Some of it's mixed ore but all of the metallurgical work and exploration work we have there are expanding, and we are very optimistic about future expansions at Tenke. ","We also have, beyond these projects, additional significant projects that our team is working actively on. And this includes taking advantage of those U.S.-based resources that I mentioned earlier. Looking at a further large-scale expansion of sulfide processing in Morenci, looking at the Sierrita and the adjacent Twin Buttes property for expansion activities, expanding our Bagdad project, potentially reopening the Ajo project in Southern Arizona, which is a historical mine for our organization. And at Safford, looking at the Lone Star project that would add significant life to the Safford facilities. ","In South America, we've had great success through our exploration program in addition, identifying new sulfide resources at El Abra and we believe we will have the opportunity to consider investing in a concentrator operation there to expand production beyond the Sulfolix project.  And in Africa, there's still opportunities to expand based on our oxide resources and to have a major expansion in the future with what appears to be a very significant attractive sulfide resource. ","23 shows the growth outlook just for the Americas. Our operations in the U.S., Chile and Peru. With that expansion, you can see that we have a very attractive growth profile in the Americas, looking at 3.5 billion pounds of copper per year for a company that's been producing consolidated worldwide, about 4 billion pounds a year. ","And then, the projects that I mentioned beyond the ones that we're investing in currently have additional potential production volumes in a range of 1.5 billion pounds of copper a year incrementally. ","At Tenke, we've got a chart that shows our growth from our original project of 150,000 tons and now, we're moving up with our Phase 2 50,000 pounds -- 150 million pounds to 2014 with 400 million pounds. We see another further expansion with oxides and then, Phase 4 would involve processing the sulfide and there's question marks about that but we think it will be a significant improvement to our existing production. ","We are spending money on exploration, $275 million this year. You can see that's a global spend spread around the world. It's really focused on our existing orebodies in these great brownfield expansion opportunities that we have. ","For 2012, we are currently providing an outlook for 3.7 billion pounds of copper sales, 1.1 million ounces of gold, 81 million pounds of molybdenum. Our current outlook for unit costs adjusted for our experience in Grasberg in the first quarter is $1.43 a pound, which reflect the lower volumes that we've had. Cost in future years at Grasberg are expected to decline to historical levels as we get back to normal levels of operation. ","At those levels of production, at $3.50 copper, we would have $4.2 billion of operating cash flow. We do have some $1.1 billion of working capital used as anticipated this year, a significant leverage to copper prices. Our capital disclosures, capital expenditures disclosures have been increased to reflect the Morenci mill expansion and now $4.3 billion this year. ","Page 27 gives our outlook for copper sales. You can see the growth that occurs. We've added in, in 2014, 200 million pounds for the Morenci expansion, moving towards a 5 billion pound level with our current projects. Gold sales this year at Grasberg are affected by both grades and the situation of low productivity in the first quarter, returning to more normal levels in 2013 and 2014. ","Our quarterly outlook for sales of both copper, gold and molybdenum are presented on Page 28, again, showing the ramp up at Grasberg. Our operating estimates in terms of cash unit costs and sales by region are shown on Page 29. As I mentioned, the consolidated expected net cash cost of $1.43 is impacted significantly by the abnormal year that we're having in Indonesia as a result of the first quarter situation at Grasberg. ","The reconciliation of unit costs are presented on Page 23, showing our $1.01 net unit cost in 2011 reconciled to $1.43. $0.24 of that is resulting from the higher cost of Grasberg because of volumes and work productivity. As I indicated, with a successful ramp up, we would back to normal levels going forward after this year. ","Page 31 is our standard slide that we show, showing average EBITDA numbers and operating cash flow numbers. This is at $1,200 gold, $12 molybdenum and varying copper prices. At $3.50 copper, we would have $9.3 billion of EBITDA and just under $7 billion of operating cash flows and you can see how that varies as prices change. ","And then, for your use in looking at sensitivities to these outlooks, we present on Page 32, the impact of changing commodity prices in certain of our important input costs. ","Capital expenditures, as I mentioned, have been increased in 2012 and 2013 for the Morenci mill expansion, now stand at $4.3 billion this year and roughly, the same level next year. ","Our balance sheet is strong. We've gone from 5 years ago with $17.6 billion of debt, now down to $3.5 billion of debt, with consolidated cash at $4.5 billion and you can see that our credit ratings have improved over time and we took advantage of our investment grade credit rating to do this very attractive debt refinancing, and the details of it are presented on Page 35. ","We issued $3 billion of new notes in mid February, which in hindsight, turned out to be out to be a good time, with varying maturity rates but with an average interest cost of 3%. We used these proceeds to redeem $3 billion of debt that carried a coupon of 8.375% which we issued in connection with the Phelps Dodge transaction. This gives annual significant interest cost savings. We don't get a significant tax cover because of our structure from interest costs, so this is a significant savings for us, and since 2009 through repaying debt and refinancing debt, we've got $420 billion (sic) [million] of annual interest cost savings, which is very significant. ","From a financial policy standpoint, we're committed to a strong balance sheet, strong liquidity. We are investing in attractive growth projects. And I want to emphasize attractive projects. We're going to be disciplined in the way we look at this so that we add to our portfolio of assets, those that provide incremental benefits in positive times but we will have a portfolio that we can manage if we have to adjust it in response to, let me just say, non-attractive times like we did in 2008, 2009. ","We're increasing our common stock dividend. We have increased it. That reflects a long-term Freeport board philosophy of shareholder returns and our board discusses financial policy with us and reviews it on an ongoing basis. ","That is a summary of our current situation and outlook. We'd be happy now, operator, to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a question though on this contract of work in Grasberg. Can you explain to us how the extensions will work in 2021 and 2031? And then the second question is I understand how the contract of work supersedes changes in taxes, changes in the law in Indonesia, and that you're paying actually a much higher tax rate than the current or the proposed mining law suggests. But why is it that government officials seem to come out with statements contrary to the contract of work issue almost on a weekly basis? And I think yesterday, I saw a story on Bloomberg quoting the Director General of Minerals and Coal at the Energy and Mineral Resource Ministry saying that you'd have to stop shipping concentrate by 2004 and specifically saying Freeport.","Richard C. Adkerson","I think you meant 2014.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","2014, sorry.","Richard C. Adkerson","Yes, because that's provided for under the new mining law, which is -- which we're not -- our contract is technically -- has a status, it's called the lex specialis, which means that it was adopted by law and has a status of law there. The situation in Indonesia is -- in terms of resource nationalism, is something that the mining industry is facing globally right now. It comes of course, from the very high levels of commodity prices that we've had in recent years and comments about resource nationalism are popular politically. Indonesia is a country today that's a democracy. It has a free press; that's a different situation than it was during the 1990s. Just like comments we hear in our own political process, there are things that are often said that are changed as the reality of facing a situation comes to bear. We have great respect for the government. For years, people have talked about headline political risk in Indonesia whether it was because of the change of the government in the 1990s and the Asian financial crisis and the number of presidents that have happened since then. It's been a constant feature of our being in Indonesia and yet, what's also been a constant feature is after operating there for 40 years now, the government has honored the contracts. Indonesia as a country has become more prominent in the world from a financial standpoint. They're an active member of the G20 now. Their credit rating has increased, the internal economy has grown. They're actively attracting foreign investments particularly for infrastructure, and we're a big infrastructure investor. So I would just remind you of all the history of press reports and so forth that we've lived through. We're very experienced with this. We're working very positive with the government. We listen to them and we respect them and we want to find ways of working forward that is responsive to the issues in Indonesia but is also in a way that protects our assets for our shareholders. And as we talk to senior government officials, there's a mutual recognition of achieving both those objectives. So there will continue to be press reports, we'll report our progress and you can be assured that -- Jim Bob's had years and years of dealing with this. It has our attention, we're focused on it and we're confident we're going to work this way through that at the end of the day, the government will be happy and our shareholders will be happy.","Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what's the process though to get the extensions?","Richard C. Adkerson","The contract provides that we have the ability to apply for the extensions, and we can apply for both of them at the same time. And we've started that process and we've started the discussions. And so, that is underway. At the same time, the government has separately started a process of reviewing contracts for all mining companies. And so those things are progressing together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rich, I just want to just switch topics a little bit over maybe to the U.S. here. At Morenci, you mentioned that the permitting is underway. I was wondering if you might be able to give us what's embedded in your expectations of when you're going to secure those permits. And then also, just on the cash cost side, how would these incremental pounds compare to your guidance for 2012 here in North America?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yes. We've actually received -- we've already received our air permit for this project. As there's several permits to obtain; that is one of the critical ones. There are controversies in Arizona about new mine development projects. It's a different situation for us because we're expanding an existing mine and you just don't have the same degree of challenges with communities that you have in terms of expanding existing mines than building a new mine. Overall, we're in great shape with permits; we don't see any issues. The community in the county where we're working is supportive. The state government is very supportive. In fact, Arizona's celebrating its 100th year this year, and The Copper Club is going to recognize the state of Arizona as being -- rather than having a Copper Man of the year, we're having a Copper Club event here and I'll be giving recognition to the governor here. So it's a place where we feel we can operate where we are operating well and cooperatively with the community and the governmental authorities. Our cost situation, Kathleen is going to talk about that.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yes, in terms of the incremental cash cost of the expansion at Morenci, it's a very attractive cash cost relative to the current levels. We expect that incrementally, these pounds that we'll be able to process through the mill will be lower than our current average cost at Morenci. So it's an attractive project in that we're able to expand the current mill. We have the footprint to do it there and as Richard said, the permitting for this particular project is pretty straightforward. So we see it as a very attractive project and we own a significant portion of Morenci so it's impactful to the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with Barclays.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a few quick questions. First, you flagged the -- obviously, the 25% company-specific growth and I was wondering if you could comment on your appetite for adding to your growth profile outside of your existing project pipeline and outside of your organic opportunities. That's my first question.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, we're very positive about the outlook for our commodities. We have this growth pipeline that you mentioned. It extends over many years. The challenge, and this is one of the reasons that the copper price is so high, is that it takes time to develop new sources of supply, both from permits and community issues and engineering studies, and construction cost escalation is a huge factor of the industry. It's going back to where we were during the first half of 2008 and that's also an issue. So we are -- we look at opportunities. We have an internal team that monitors the industry and bankers are constantly bringing ideas to us and if we did something, it would be from an opportunistic standpoint because of the attractiveness of a specific investment. We have the capability and the financial resources to do things but the challenge is seeing opportunities that are attractive to us on the basis of their economics after you -- if you were to pay for their values and a premium to those values and how that matches up. We're going to be very disciplined in terms of managing capital allocation.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. My other question, I was wondering if you could just briefly comment on any concerns or lack thereof regarding water accessibility with regards to the Cerro Verde mill expansion?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, let me just say, water accessibility is kind of the major issue for expansions in the Americas. I mean, it is a very significant problem. We're building a desalinization plant now to support our operations in the Copiap\u00f3 valley for Candelaria. As we look at expanding El Abra, water is a huge issue there, and you'll hear other companies talking about it. At Cerro Verde, it has been a major issue. We looked at a number of different alternatives including expanding access to the river through dam construction that we had but this approach that we have about using wastewater for Arequipa is really -- looks to be a really attractive situation for that community as well as for us. And so right now, we're very happy with where we are and the community seems to be very happy.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful and just my very last question...","Richard C. Adkerson","They're getting a better standard of living and we're getting access to water without competing with agricultural sources in the same way you would by developing other sources of water.","David Gagliano - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My last question. Maybe it's a bit of a touchy subject but it does come up in conversation. I was wondering, Richard, if you could comment on succession planning at Freeport.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, we have a great team. We -- one of the things, as we brought the Freeport team together and we did have a team that was focused on essentially a single asset with this Phelps Dodge group that had been involved in global operations but when we put those together, we ended up with just an outstanding team of people with high morale, people who are working together. And s, we have a good team that will provide for potential leadership for this company for years to come. Jim Bob and I are both real happy with what we're doing. We're both focused on this business. It's a dream come true in a lot of ways. And so we're focused with working with our team on the future and we have a great group of people that will be able to sustain it for a long period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani from Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First on Morenci, I see that the cash cost, particularly the site and delivery costs which was 180 pound in first quarter similar to the fourth quarter is rising significantly because you're giving an average of 192 pounds for the year. I'm just wondering what's going to drive that for this year. And also, your CapEx has moved up on that one about $200 million. What was the reason for that?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, the CapEx reflects the new project for the Morenci mill expansion. So I think Sal, as we've talked all along, as we advance these projects, at some point, we get them approved and both the project and the resulting production numbers start getting factored into our numbers. And that's what you're seeing with the CapEx standpoint.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yes. The Morenci project was still in feasibility as of the last update. And so once we completed the feasibility study, we rolled that into our outlook. And then with respect to your question on the cash costs in the balance of the year, we are expecting to see slightly higher unit net cash costs in North America in the balance of the year and that's associated with higher mining rates and some mill maintenance activity that we have scheduled in the balance of this year.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. One more question on Indonesia. Richard, you said that you -- in the end, you will find a solution which will make both government and the shareholders happy. So are you guys looking for some middle ground in this -- all these commencements coming out of the government?","Richard C. Adkerson","We're always looking for a foreign approach that makes the stakeholders happy. And that's the way, historically, that this company has succeeded there and other places. We have a contract. It defines some legal rights. We want to listen to the aspirations of the government and try to find ways to be responsive to that and protect our contracts. So I'll just tell you, our experience has always been it's better to work with people than to work against them. And so -- and governments officials in Indonesia recognize what Freeport means to the country and that's why I feel confident about what we'll be able to do. Jim Bob, do you want to comment on this?","James R. Moffett","Yes, Richard. I was just going to wait and see how the questions about this subject but went on. But let me reiterate what Richard said. The lex specialis on this contract is well understood by the civil servants and the ministries that will have the final say on this. Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Mines and Energy, Ministry of Industry, and they know that we're making this $15 billion capital expenditure to go underground. They also know that the programs in Indonesia that have been announced under this current President, and of course, there\u2019s an election coming up in 2014 that their whole focus is on increasing foreign investment and in creating more opportunity for CapEx. So it's a little bit of an oxymoron to say that we're going to see a lot of changes in contracts. It will make it more difficult to go out and find foreign investors. So that's what the political landscape is today. But when it gets down to it, to reiterate Richard's remarks and substantiate my feelings, the lex specialis is very strong. There's only been one real contest to that, that was back in '98, and it was over a power plant that was going to be built by Mid-America. And there was a confrontation over in the Mid-America, filed for a hearing in the United States and there was about a $276 million award, and it was paid by the government of Indonesia. So the idea that this lex specialis, it says you can't change the contract without mutual agreement between the parties is well known. Now to say that there -- or a middle ground is your last question, what does that mean? That means that there are certain things that are not -- there is no middle ground. The arbitration cost, the International arbitration cost, there\u2019s been middle ground here. We can't give it up. The government knows we can't give it up, and so therefore, that holds the real meaning of the contract together. The things about the contract that Richard and I and the board can think about that won't change in a major way, the value to the shareholders. But we obviously will sit down and make an effort to do that. We have in the past, for instance, we want to increase the mill rate from 200,000 to 300,000 back a number of years ago, and the government had a push back because it was going to create more tailings and the environmental considerations. And in order to do that we, without amending the contract, made an agreement that the royalty would increase on copper and gold if we went up on the rate, if certain price mechanisms were met. And so the government knows that Freeport has done more in Indonesia for the locals. As we were talking about this voluntary community, we came up with in '98 where we spent almost $500 million into the so-called 1% fund is the biggest revenue for the region of Mimika where roads, schools, hospitals, government buildings, community housing have all been built. There's nobody in the country that has contributed as much to the local community. We're the only company in Indonesia that built a smelter. We went out and brought the Japanese to Indonesia and invested and owned a substantial ownership in the smelter. And by the way, that smelter provides currently with our concentrate going to it, all the copper demand that the country of Indonesia uses. So a lot of the things that are in the new mineral law, we've already complied with. So middle ground is a word that's probably too strong. I think Richard's effort to explain it by saying that the government, because of the penalty, impunity nature of the Mid-American settlement back in '98 is well aware that they don't want to get into one of those and neither do we. But at the end of the day, the contract will be honored, the extension will be granted. There are some things that we'll accomplish. Our goal of not giving up the principal issues in the contract that Richard and I, along with the board, will certainly be aware that it is a lot better to not be hardheaded but to realize that extending in this contract from '21 to '41 is a must for the government. It's a must for us and we'll get it done.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie Securities.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","On the Freeport Indonesia situation, are you still operating under a force majeure there? And what are the prospects for you lifting that in the near term?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, we did give notice of force majeure during the course of the strike and we are working very cooperatively with our customers to meet their needs. We have long-term relationships with our customers. We do have a priority of providing concentrate to the PT Smelting smelter in Indonesia. And so we will lift this as we get back to full production and resolve some of the uncertainties that were faced in the first quarter.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","Great. This full production at the mill, is that about 260,000 a day or is it higher than that?","Richard C. Adkerson","No, it's not higher than that. It varies depending on the type of ore that we have. And so full production can range from 220,000 to 240,000, and there will be occasional days that we will go above that or below that depending on the nature of the ore that we process.","Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research","All right. If I could just slip one more in, do you think there's any possibility that the view of concentrate would be considered a processed ore in this whole regulatory discussion in Indonesia?","Richard C. Adkerson","This whole area is one where the government is dealing with the new mining law, it's dealing with a number of different minerals which have different characteristics and it's really -- I wouldn't want to speculate on how these definitions ultimately get put down. But right now, there's not really specific regulations and so forth that deals with questions like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Dahlman Rose.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm sorry to ask another question about Indonesia but I get a lot of questions from clients. And I was wondering if you can give us a sense as to how far along the process of this contract review and\/or extension is at the current time? I just have a quick follow-up on that too.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, we're in substantive discussions. In terms of how to measure where we are in the process, that's really not possible. It is something you know that we're going to engage in discussions directly with the government and not indirectly either in the press or speculation and so forth. But the discussions are going well and we feel we're making great progress, Tony, and we'll just have to see how long this process takes. There is a sense of urgency though of dealing with it on both sides.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim Bob and you Richard, when you were talking about the middle ground in the conversation there, and I know you're working hard to cement the extension, is it likely you'd have to give up something to achieve such as the higher royalties where there is a bit of errands versus the new mining code, if you will, and a possible sale as you indicated before? Is it likely that, that you'd give up a little bit but it sounds like you guys are very, very confident that a lot of the commentary coming out of the government is, as you said, there's a lot of things going on and a lot of things driving that but should we feel comfortable that it likely will be more minor kind of modifications to secure that extension?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, Tony, just -- it wouldn't be appropriate for us to get into the details of our discussion with the government as we're having those discussions. I think I'll go back and just repeat what I said and the essence of what Jim Bob said is we're going to find ways of working cooperatively. I think Jim Bob made a good point when we talked about middle ground. There are certain issues where there may be middle ground, there's certain other issues where we'll have to stick to our guns on. So -- but really, it's something that we will work towards getting to a resolution that the government's happy with, our shareholders are happy with. And at this point, it would not be appropriate to talk about any specific issues that we're considering.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","All right. Perhaps I could just change the subject a little bit to labor front. Obviously, you've got the Grasberg out of the way now in terms of the new contract there, and I think most of the operations in the U.S. are non-union. The operations in South America and Africa, can you give us an idea of any contracts that might be coming up for expiry this year?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. Kathleen has a note on that so I'll let her answer.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Okay. We've got -- we did the Cerro Verde contract and the El Abra contract last year. We've got in South America, Candelaria that comes up next year and we'll likely work to try to renew that late this year in advance of the exploration next year. We also have waged discussions at Tenke Fungurume later in 2012. So really, we're well covered with the agreements that we had last year, and we've got some we'll be working on this year but they're not significant to the overall scheme.","Richard C. Adkerson","And Tony, you're right. Except for one small unit at our Chino mine, New Mexico, we're non-union in the United States. This issue with dealing with unions and contracts is kind of a constant deal. I mean, you get one finished and you're shortly after that planning looking ahead, thinking about how to deal with it. We've had success in the past of often being able to get resolutions in advance of the formal timing for negotiations and that's what we'll work to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm sorry to be asking another question about Grasberg. But regarding the 9% stake there that you own through a subsidy, if a sale of that stake were to take place, any thoughts on how the fair market value might be determined?","Richard C. Adkerson","That 9.36% stake was once owned by Indonesia. Through a series of transactions that's fully reported in our corporate documents, we acquired it. There is no requirement under our contract -- a requirement for us to sell it. But several years ago, the Minister of Mines and Energy and Mines asked us to consider it and we have -- and I've looked at a number of alternatives on it but no transaction has happened. In the past transactions that we had during the 1990s, the sales price was always referenced back to the publicly-traded price of FCX, and that's the basis that we would be looking at in terms of considering what fair market value is. We -- over time and we continue to look for the possibility of actually having a listing of PT-FI shares on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, that would be received very favorably by the government. That exchange has developed over the years to where it's created a liquid market, and that's one step that we see as potentially a positive step in terms of increasing Indonesian exposure to PT-FI.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just one more on your potential phase for expansion in Africa. What kind of additional infrastructure might be required for that, and that would be my final question.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay, any expansion requires infrastructure. I mean, it requires power and -- but the current investments that we made in power and infrastructure with some tweaking, we believe, would allow us to do one additional expansion beyond what we have now. Now to get back into -- and then to go to the major expansion involving sulfide or mixed ores, that would require significantly greater access to power, transportation. We're looking at different types of processing. And so all of that is important factor. We're working cooperatively with the government and looking at long-term infrastructure and with other mining operators in Katanga. Those infrastructure investments, by the way, are very positive for the community, for the government, for the country and so that's a positive for us being there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS Securities.","Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I hate to go back to Indonesia as well. But just -- you made a comment about planning $15 billion in new investments. Is that actually PT-FI share or because obviously Rio Tinto once you go by 2021, will fund stuff if we're going to do KL and everything else. What exactly -- where does that number get you to and what does it get you? Just the Deep MLZ and block cave or does that include KL and everything else?","Richard C. Adkerson","It does include the aggregate cost of our share and Rio Tinto share. The bulk of that is ours but it would include Rio Tinto's participation in those shares, and it would include the development of the deep Grasberg -- full development of the deep Grasberg and full development of all the resources and that involves an investment over a period of time. The point that we need to ensure that people in Indonesia understand, that investments we're making now and will continue to make will generate production volumes and cash flows beyond 2021 throughout the period through 2041, and quite frankly, there's resources there to be produced past 2041. Right now, we cut off reserve determinations at 2041.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Garchitorena with Credit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question again on Grasberg and this labor situation there. Just wondering if you can give us some color in terms of the current tension? How much comfort do you have that they won't flare up again? Has the union been supportive of easing the tension?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yes. We have -- we had an issue in the first quarter of people coming back to work. In some cases, there was not a full understanding of the CLA agreement so we had to go through with the union, a process of socialization, that's a word we use. But it's a question of communicating and getting people to work together. Not surprisingly, there were some tensions between the workers that were striking and our staff workers that did not strike and there were some non-staff workers who did not strike and so that was an issue. There were some implementation matters under the contract CLA that we've worked with. In many respects, the union has been supportive in terms of working with us, and we have a structure set up to consider issues that involve potential strife and to get those resolved. So I can't report that everything is resolved today. But as evidenced by the level of our operations that we're achieving now in the second quarter, we're making progress. And we're looking at this on a long-term basis. We're looking at quality-of-life issues for our workers as this is a remote, harsh area to live in. And so we're looking at working with the workers and the union to deal with those quality-of-life issues to create more harmony within the workforce.","James R. Moffett","Richard, let me talk about the strike just a minute. I wanted to wait \u2018til we've had a series of questions. But let's face it, the reality is that the Grasberg is known as the largest mineral deposit ever found and that's because of the high percentage of copper and gold in the mine. So we start out with sitting on top of the biggest reserve in the history of the mining business. When we found the mine in 1988, copper was selling for less than $1 and gold was selling for less than $400. When you take the copper, it goes up above $3 and hits $4 and you have gold prices go to over $1,500, the value just explodes. So the answer is around, currently, the world, all copper mines -- all mines whether they\u2019re in Mexico, whether in South America, Africa or in Indonesia are in play as far the unions wanting to get a bigger piece of the pie. We're going to make sure that we pay our people and provide, as Richard said, living conditions in a very tough place to provide living conditions. But the fact is that as we all know, if you look at the front cover of Time Magazine, there was no Man of the Year this year. The Man of the Year was the protester. And whether you're talking about a protest against corporate America that's going on in America or whether you're talking about the uprising that started in Tunisia and went through Egypt, went through Libya, continues in Yemen, Syria, this is a political year where people are being urged to speak up and express their viewpoints. So with the new democracy in Indonesia, where the President is now elected by the people and the parliament is elected by the people, we're operating in an interesting environment. But the good news is that as I said before, people know what we've done in a very tough situation and that we spent billions of dollars, which includes billions -- a $500 million coal-fired generator so that we can have power. We built a brand-new city and we built education and hospitals. It's 97% of the Mimika province economy. So suffice it to say that all of these issues about the strike, about the expansion and extension of the contract are going to be under the umbrella of the political mood and everybody around the world knows it\u2019s going on. But know this and that is we found the mine when nobody else could find it. We developed the mine in the middle of a 13,000-foot terrain where there was no infrastructure. We have created not a mine but a culture and the local people know that this is a culture that has improved their standard of living from beyond anybody's imagination before this mine was found. So the answer is all of these issues are going to be prominent but we're going to go on with life out there and we will continue to provide jobs and pay to be one of the biggest contributors to the tax revenues in the economy of Indonesia. And I'd like to just also comment on one other thing. We're talking about brownfield projects, greenfield projects. Remember, we've said repeatedly that one of the things that we've done since the Phelps Dodge merger is to identify the complete orebodies on the Phelps Dodge properties. And remember, because of the price of copper before we took over Phelps Dodge, Phelps Dodge did a wonderful job developing the leaching prospect. The leaching prospect, as you all know, involves the oxide ore. It has to be oxide ore and it involves putting the ore through a leach pad using sulfur gases to basically get the copper out of the ore. And only because the price of copper has gone to the numbers it had, it is the sulfide ore which will require a mill, which was not there to do the leaching. But remember, the fabric of these orebodies and the shape of these orebodies is that the oxide ore is strictly the amount of ore that was exposed to the surface when you could get erosion, if you will, of the copper, the ore body. But we said, if I'm looking at a peach that's buried in the ground, and only the very upper edge of it is exposed to oxidation was mined because the mines had no mill to get the sulfide ore because you couldn't justify milling it and sending it through a smelter. Well, that's all changed. And that's why we have this enormous amount of ore that is still unmined in all of the Phelps Dodge properties. So the price of copper gave us the ability to take in, make a much bigger economic picture on all the orebodies. So you have this cone, we call it at $1 copper, it was a very small cone that included nothing but oxide ore. At $2, $3 and $4 copper, this cone expands the proportion of the ore that can now be mined. And with the infrastructure we have plus the addition of the mill and being able to justify smelting this ore, you have a brand-new set of assets. So our brownfield projects under this oxide ore, this sulfide ore, is bigger in almost every case than any new deposit that would be identified. So we're talking about huge numbers and it's a pipeline of resources that will keep this company busy for many years to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","It's pretty clear from the stock price and many of the questions this morning that the different political events and statements of government officials and power or out-of-power politicians, Indonesia and\/or Congo confused the market and affected the stock price. Over the years, FCX has often bought back its own stock. I remember a soir\u00e9e in New Orleans maybe in the '90s where Jim Bob read the bond rating agency press release and said I mean, where they were downgrading the credit rating because FCX was dedicated to the shareholders and bought back stock. And I think Jim Bob read that with pride and I certainly commend Jim Bob. It sounds like it's the right time to buy back a lot of stock because the market's completely confused by all this rigmarole. And would you be willing to delay a capital program a year or 2 so you could buy back some extra stock while the price is so lousy?","Richard C. Adkerson","John, this issue of the stock buyback and financial policy with dividends are matters that our board discusses constantly and will continue to do so. To date, the board has directed returns to shareholders in recent years, let me just say to dividends and a number of our investors have responded positively to that. We do have a focus on projects and we've built a great momentum on looking at those projects. And the truth is it's difficult to turn these kinds of things just off and on. And we believe that these projects, with their high rates of return, ultimately create the value for shareholders and a lot of these short-term issues that affect the market and over time, there's a number of issues that affect the market. The concerns about Europe, for example, or issues in Japan, this resource nationalism is certainly an issue. But we really are focused on the long term and believe that by just continuing to invest in the kind of projects that we have is the right answer for shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kuni Chen with CRT Capital Group.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research.","Charles A. Bradford - Bradford Research, Inc.","You've talked a few times about water availability. What about labor and mining engineers and geologists? I keep hearing about shortage of skilled people. Are you getting delayed in any of the projects for lack of people?","Richard C. Adkerson","Chuck, that's a very valid point and it's something that's increasingly become an issue in terms of being able to get outside resources to work on our projects. There's a lot of competition for engineering talent and increasing competition for equipment. We, fortunately, because of our relationships, are able to deal with a lot of those. But it does require us to have a focus on the most meaningful projects for our company. We're constantly in the market looking for good people. Others are as well. It's interesting, when we first went to Indonesia, there was very low mining talent. And now, we see Australian companies coming in to Grasberg and hiring Indonesian engineers away. We're using engineering talent in Africa and other places. It's a great opportunity for countries like Indonesia and Peru and Chile because of the experience they're getting. So it is a management problem. We had our Americas operating team here last week, and that was a major topic of what we're talking about. So like a lot of things we have to do, it's a challenge and we've got to be way -- able to find ways to meet it. With our global operations and our ability to use people in different places and give them good career paths, it's a real benefit for our company.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Paul Massoud with Stifel Nicolaus.","Paul A. Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I actually had one quick question on Tenke. I'm -- been a lot of discussions on Indonesia but I was more curious about the cobalt circuit at Tenke right now and one in part, the guidance that you're providing for the credit, is that based on the realized -- that $12 number that you put in there, is that for Freeport's realized price or is that for spot LME quality price?","Kathleen L. Quirk","We're producing an intermediate product called cobalt hydroxide and the price that you see that we talked about, a market price of $12, that's the price of the cobalt metal. And as we sell that to various processors, we receive -- essentially pay charges for them to process the material. So our realization would be reduced from the metal price to reflect the product that we're selling. It's generally in the area of about 70% or so of the metal price.","Paul A. Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I know you mentioned it before but maybe just a quick clarification on the infrastructure required to go, say from the 400 million pound range to the 600 million pound range. Does the infrastructure expansion in that step up include transportation or do you think transportation is something that you don't have to worry about until say, after Phase 3?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, worry about is one thing. Conceivably, we could handle it with the existing system but it's -- there are ways of looking at transportation alternatives that could be very economic for us in terms of reducing costs and bottlenecks. So we are looking at long-term solutions but we're also looking at some short-term alternatives in terms of warehousing, alternative routes, alternative transportation means and that's an ongoing process. We don't see it as being a constraint at that level to produce oxides but there are certainly opportunities for us to make our business much more profitable by dealing with different transportation logistic alternatives.

Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our 2018 Form 10-K.","On the call today, are Richard Adkerson, Red Conger, Mark Johnson, who is dialing in from Indonesia and Mike Kendrick and Mike runs our molybdenum business. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our prepared slide presentations. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net losses attributable to common stock of $131 million or $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2019. After adjusting for net charges of $123 million or $0.08 per share, the adjusted net loss attributable to common stock in the third quarter totaled $8 million or $0.01 per share. Details of the non-recurring items are located on page Roman numeral 7 of our press release.","Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $564 million. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA available on page 28 of our slide deck. The third quarter 2019 copper sales of 795 million pounds were about 4% below the July 2019 estimates of 830 million pounds of copper, primarily because of lower production from Cerro Verde and also the timing of shipments at quarter-end. This was partly offset by higher production and sales from North America.","In the third quarter of 2019, our gold sales of 243,000 ounces were about 6% higher than the July 2019 estimate of 230,000 ounces. The copper and gold production exceeded sales by 59 million pounds and 90,000 ounces [ph] in the third quarter. These volumes were an inventory at September 30th and are expected to be sold in the fourth quarter.","Our average realized copper price was $2.62 per pound, that was below the year-ago average of $2.80 per pound. And the third quarter average -- 2019 average realized gold price of $14.87 per ounce was above the year -ago quarterly average of $11.91 per ounce.","Our net unit cash costs on a consolidated basis, net of by-product credits, averaged $1.59 per pound of copper in the third quarter. That was slightly improved from the July 2019 estimate of $1.53 per pound. As anticipated, our average unit net cash costs were higher in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the year-ago average of $0.93 per pound. That reflects lower sales volume as PT-FI transitions mining from the open pit to underground. We expect that our net unit cash costs will trend lower as this ramp-up is completed.","In the third quarter of 2019, we generated $224 million in operating cash flows and that was net of $146 million in working capital uses. Capital expenditures totaled $666 million in the quarter, which included investments in our underground projects and the new mine in Arizona that will be commissioned next year. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.2 billion and consolidated debt of $9.9 billion at no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you've been provided with.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, everyone and thanks for participating in today's call. I want to share with you the enthusiasm that I personally feel about all we are accomplishing at the current time. Two week ago, I made a trip to Indonesia and went to job site to visit operations there. It was my first trip to job site in three years, as we've been focused on our work with the government. And I was truly impressed by the progress we're making underground and the morale and attitude of our team.","I traveled to Jakarta, and while in Indonesia, met with the senior Ministers that we've been dealing with, with the CEO of our partner, Inalum and spent an hour with President Joko Widodo to fully review our operations. And I was gratified by the warmness of the conversations that we have and how positive everyone is about the arrangement we struck last December and how it's working to-date. And that was good. But I really want to talk to you about what's going on at Grasberg.","This is one of three major initiatives of our Company right now that we're really focused on. The Grasberg underground ramp up is the most important of those and one that's really key to our future. The ramp-up is advancing on schedule. My own personal confidence in achieving success with this transition was enhanced. This will achieve low-cost long-lived production from our underground ore bodies and it will be a source of significant cash flows for the next 20 years plus.","The significant mine development and infrastructure development is really impressive, as I said. Much of this is already completed and I met in detail with our team and observed their strength and the technical competencies, the experience and motivation to execute the plan. And you will see that we have had very positive initial results as we are reporting today in the third quarter and the year-to-date. All of this gives us strong confidence on our -- accomplishing our ramp-up schedule.","The designs of the two minerals zones, the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ are set to world-class standards. We are applying our Company's experience over the past 35 years in block caving in the underground and using new technology to enhance the infrastructure techniques, undercut blasting and cave management. And I'll talk some more about that later.","Second of our three initiatives is the commissioning of the Lone Star project in Arizona. The current project to develop and mine oxide ores within our budget and on schedule for copper production is expected next year. The development is two-thirds complete and there are expansion opportunities that we've already identified in the oxide ore.","The current project envisions using available capacity at the nearby Safford mine. But the need to oxide ore is a resource that is growing as we do exploration drilling and has the likelihood of being a major keystone asset for our Company in the future.","The third initiative is something that's really exciting, and congratulate Red and his team for what they're doing in this innovation-driven productivity improvements. This is a program in which we are using technology tools, machine learning or artificial intelligence, and a coordinated operating structure that's bringing together different capabilities within our Company and applying it to basic operations to create value.","We tested this at our Bagdad mine in Arizona and had remarkable success, and what was so encouraging for me is the enthusiastic way that our team has embraced this technology, which is a kind of a quantum jump from the basic work of mining to using new technology techniques to improve efficiency. What it's allowing us to do is to increase production, decrease cost without making major capital investments.","We are now expanding this to Morenci and our other mines in the Americas, and we have not yet incorporated these in our numbers. We'll do that next year, but we have set an aspirational goal of adding 200 million pounds of copper from these initiatives with very little capital investment. And that would be a major accomplishment for us.","Slide 4 addresses our strategy. And I want to emphasize that our strategy, at this point in time, is well-defined and focused. It is focused on growing our sales profile, being efficient driving cost down, and improving cash flow generation. And we're going to do this with the three initiatives that I spoke of earlier, driven principally by the Grasberg underground conversion.","Success in these would result in a 30% increase in copper, 70% increase in gold, approximately 25% reduction in unit cost and a 100% doubling of our cash flow generation. This is all within our grasp. It's up to us to execute, but that's what our strategy is.","And during this period of time that's built around the Grasberg transition, we are not looking to make major new capital investments, although we have great opportunities for the future. We're not pursuing M&A transactions, but building this, because this will have such a major impact on our Company.","Much of the capital needed to achieve the results have -- has already been spent. These are long-lived assets, and it gives us a strong base for cash flows for the future. I personally believe there is a potential for higher [ph] current prices exist within the time frame of this transition. So if you look at a growing production profile at a time when copper markets may be improving, Freeport would have a very bright future in the near term.","Slide 5 shows -- I'll talk about the Grasberg. Now we are at the final stages of mining the Grasberg open pit. I will tell you, it was almost a spiritual experience for me to be there and see the that you're seeing on the left. I was there more than 30 years ago and took my own picture with the Polaroid camera of the Grasberg exploration shack where the second portable drill hole was -- had just been drilled. There were no mine or anything there.","Then to the -- on the edge of this -- and see what this picture shows. Here we are, after mining over 5 billion tons of material produced at the district, 33 billion pounds of copper and 53 million ounces gold, with a -- roughly a $100 billion of gross revenues and 80% of that's from the pit and then seeing this pit going three kilometers across -- a kilometer quarter deep, as I said, thinking about all of our history was something. But you know, that history, interesting for me, great story, but the future is in the underground and that is equally exciting. This is where our future production is coming from.","Our company is an industry leader in block cave mining with decades of experience as I mentioned earlier. The Grasberg Block Cave represents about 50% of our underground reserves. It's the same ore body that we've been mining from the surface for the past almost 30 years. In block caving, the ore that's there, rather than being stripped and mined from the surface, collapses in the caves under gravity.","So there is no stripping or mine waste. We will only have to mine about a third of the material that we've historically mined and produce more copper than we have in these -- all these years from the surface. Mining 1.1 billion tons of ore will be done without incurring the cost of mining 5.2 billion tons of ore and waste.","The gross revenues from our reserves at the two mineralization areas that we will be mining at $3 copper and $1,500 gold will approximate $150 billion over the long run, and approximately 50% more than what we've already earned from the pit over the past 30 years. We only pull reserves through 2041 because that's when our rights extend to under our arrangements with the government, but resources indicate production will go well beyond 2041.","This is developing these underground resources is not a new project. We have been undertaking underground investment since 2003. Over two-thirds of the underground development meters have already been achieved. We've invested in underground infrastructure, these enormous access to ventilations, large-scale crushers pushing rail transport and a state-of-the-art autonomous underground rail system. Most of the capital cost of the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are behind us.","On slide 6, we list our key performance indicators. I'll refer you first to the chart at the bottom right, the ore extraction. And you can see that we averaged over 20,000 tons from the GBC and Deep MLZ combined in the third quarter. And this exceeded our forecast. The Grasberg Block Cave has met, and in many cases, exceeded expectations, and the cave propagation in its mine advancements is going very well.","The Deep MLZ is where two years ago, we experienced the seismicity issues because of incompetency of the rock. And we have developed systems to monitor that, micro systems that are placed throughout the ore body and that there are procedures to help us understand where these events may be happening.","Earlier in the third quarter, we used this system to temporary suspend some advancement of drawbells and caving in one of the production blocks. But using the hydraulic fracking approach, that's working successfully for us now, we achieved the desired shape of the cave and we resumed undercutting in September.","Now going forward in mining always, but in underground mining, there'll be pluses and minus simply the nature of mining and the planning. But we are now confident that based on our results today, that we have met the challenges this rock situation, the Deep MLZ. Spent a lot of time with our team talking about the hydraulic fracking operations at the Deep MLZ. I observed the operations and equipment that was being used, and I was extremely pleased with the results.","At our wrap-up meeting, I ask our team, could I say that we can now state that we've effectively managed seismic activity going forward, and there was a resounding yes to that question. So this has been an exciting development for us.","The Grasberg Block Cave will be our largest contributor production following the ramp-up. It has reserves of over 1 billion pounds of high-grade copper and gold -- 1 billion tons. The Grasberg Block Cave will have a very large footprint 80 acres at full rate and 180 acres over the life of the mine.","The size of the ore body and the different headings that we will have will give us the ability to produce simultaneously from five production blocks giving a scale flexibility and assurance of continuous and predictable production. It's important to note that when we talk about this underground operation and we talk about these two mineralization zones at Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. We actually have multiple mines within these zones and these mines share the same infrastructure.","Our teams know the rock types from mining the same ore in the open pit for 30 years, mining the ore mineralization that's in the Deep MLZ for 25 years and we've done extensive drilling in the underground to understand ground conditions. We are assessing ore at the Deep MLZ only 300 meters below the surface of the open pit of the Grasberg.\\","As we continue undercutting and adding draw points our expansion is estimated to accelerate to ramp up to 130,000 tons per day in 2023. As I mentioned at Deep MLZ the ongoing hydraulic fracturing operations with continued undercutting and drawbell openings in two active production blocks are expected to enable us to achieve our ramp-up schedule for that mineralized area. We have a large inventory of drawbells already in place in Deep MLZ to support this ramp-up.","At full rates the production from these two ore bodies is projected to average 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 1.3 million ounces of gold per year. Higher ore grades from these deposits will enhance production in the early years. Average net unit costs are expected to average at current cost levels, $0.30 a pound in the first five years of full rate. This is notable and rare for large-scale operations in this industry. And we have the opportunity to deal with cost effectively through technology innovations in the underground as we go forward.","The key to the future is to clean your undercutting to expand the caves, to open up new drawbells to accumulate the ore. We expect to accelerate drawbell construction in 2020 as the cave expands. We are comfortable we are mitigating the inherent risk in underground mine.","Turning to slide 7 and Lone Star. Lone Star is located adjacent to our existing Safford mine which began production at time of the Phelps Dodge deal around 2007 and is -- in the ore that is being depleted, although there is future potential sulfide development at depth there.","But we have available facilities that are allowing us to have a low-risk development with good financial returns at the adjacent Lone Star wholly-owned ore body only 8 miles away from Safford, also 18 miles away across the mountains from Morenci. This is a $850 million initial project, two-thirds complete, estimated annual production of 200 million pounds and will be producing copper next year.","It's oxide ore with low capital intensity with opportunities with low capital -- expansion opportunities with low capital intensive available to us in the oxide. And then our drilling at depth is really exciting, because of the sulfide resource that continues to expand and will be a big part of Freeport's future.","Then to go back to this productivity project that we have been pursuing aggressively in recent months. This is on Slide 8. It's a development project without significant capital. The results of this as we've seen at our Bagdad mine increase production, improves its efficiency simply by doing things better and we do things better by measuring activities, by analyzing them quickly, using artificial intelligent type methods which involves involvement with broad areas of our team, getting data back and changing operations really efficiently. It's working well and it unlocks bottlenecks throughout the operations.","We literally identify through data the best operations can do and instantaneously know when we're not achieving that and make adjustments to get back to the best it can do. And I can't tell you how excited our team is about it and what it's like for me to watch that enthusiasm and how it's spreading through our organization.","Copper markets today are clearly affected by the trade war economic situation. But in my view, they are simply not sustainable. And the reason I say that is that even with the economic effects we're seeing, the demand for copper remains relatively strong throughout the world in China, in the US and elsewhere. Copper inventories are low.","The future is bright because of the fundamental uses and the growing uses for copper in alternative energy generation and the future for our electric vehicles and just the general use of electronics throughout the world. When you hear a mining company talking about measuring things electronically, think about how other businesses are affected by this.","So structurally the copper market remains very supported. It's essential to the global economy and then it's significantly supported by the scarcity of supply. Wood Mackenzie says it takes $3.30 to incentivize significant copper production, economic activity is going to affect demand in the near term. But we remain very positive about the outlook for copper and are prepared to deal with whatever price we have to do in the short term, but believe this is -- that we're in a great industry with great assets.","So I'll close, before turning over to Kathleen, just by looking at the reason there is I started out saying I'm so enthusiastic about our Company. We've got a strategy that our Board, our management team has bowed [ph] into, on our shoulders to execute that. To do that we have a portfolio of high-quality assets.","We look at our track record and our commitment to communities, environmental responsibility our technical capabilities that we've proven with our development project and the way we operate, we are the leader in our industry in terms of size, scale and durability. We operate all the mines that we have interest in.","So we're able to share supply chains, technology, people, resources, we're going to have very significant growing production and cash flow profile within our site to doubling of our cash flow generation. Copper fundamentally is positive and increasingly so and then we have this innovation driving value creation that's going to spread throughout our organization.","So beyond financial results which are affected by this transition issue that we have this has been a great quarter for Freeport. Kathleen?","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you, Richard. I'm going to start on Slide 12 where we summarize the production and sales data for the third quarter by region. And starting at the top North America did better than our forecast and was up about 12% compared with last year's third quarter.","We're seeing improved production performance from our leach stockpiles at Morenci, following initiatives that we've put in place to reduce the particle size of the material placed on leach pads. And we've also had some favorable changes in the chemistry of the ore.","At Bagdad, as Richard was talking about, we're seeing -- we're continuing to see real benefits from the innovation and debottlenecking initiatives and Bagdad has become a real model for this initiative as we drive it across the portfolio. In South America, Cerro Verde as well as other mines in the region were impacted by restricted access to transportation outlets and that was associated with protests regarding the non-affiliated third-party development project.","Our team at Cerro Verde did an outstanding job in managing the situation safely and efficiently in- the circumstances, but production was below the year-ago level and about 10% below our forecast. Because of lower mining rates and changes in mine sequencing we processed a greater portion of stockpile ore which impacted grades and recoveries. The lower mining rate in the third quarter will also impact the fourth quarter, metal production, but this has been offset by better performance in the US than our prior forecast.","We want to note that despite the disruptions, the Cerro Verde concentrator averaged over 380,000 tons per day during the third quarter. That's above nameplate capacity of 360,000 tons per day and the team is optimistic that the AI and innovation initiative will drive further increases in the future.","For Indonesia our sales in the third quarter were generally in line with our guidance. We did a little better on gold and have increased our estimates slightly for the year. We're continuing to mine a small amount of high-grade material from the surface. Our current forecast assumes we will continue this through November. But we also ended September with a higher level of concentrate inventory and we'll be working this down in the fourth quarter.","We show a table at the bottom of Slide 12 which presents our consolidated production for the quarter and that exceeded our sales by 69 million pounds of copper and 90,000 ounces and this relates to timing of shipments of concentrate from Cerro Verde and also from Indonesia where we built some inventory in the quarter. This is simply a timing matter and we expect to sell this inventory in the fourth quarter and get back to normal levels of inventory by year-end.","On slide 13 we're summarizing our consolidated sales outlook for the periods 2019 through 2021. The projections are in line and broadly consistent with our previous estimates. Our copper sales are expected to grow by roughly 200 million pounds in 2020 and 900 million pounds in 2021 compared to 2019. This includes a scheduled ramp-up of production that Richard referred to earlier at Grasberg, and the commissioning of our Lone Star mine next year.","In 2021, about two-thirds of this copper production will be produced from the Americas and the balance from Indonesia. This outlook does not include the opportunities being pursued with technology and innovation that Richard discussed earlier and we're targeting the potential to add 200 million pounds of copper per annum through these initiatives.","We also expect our gold volumes to rise over this period with high grades available to us in Indonesia and recall the district has high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore which makes Grasberg a low-cost valuable operation. Our molybdenum sales are generally flat over this period, but we have significant optionality in our portfolio and can adjust production rates from our primary mines if market conditions warrant.","We refer you to page 14 where we've modeled our EBITDA and cash flows at various prices to give you a range of the cash earnings and cash flow generating capacity of the Company. You will note the significant positive leverage we have to improving market conditions on the slide. At $2.60 copper for 2019 we are in the $2.4 billion range for EBITDA for reference. This is a trough year for us and as you'll see from the mild result we would generate approximately $3.5 billion to over $5 billion in EBITDA in 2020 at prices ranging from $2.75 to $3.25. And this grows to $6.5 billion to $8.5 billion in EBITDA for 2021 and 2022 average.","So you see that our EBITDA is moving from $3.5 billion to $5 billion next year to $6.5 billion to $8.5 billion depending on prices. These added volumes that we're bringing in are expected to come at a low incremental cost and that provides us with solid margin expansion even at low prices, and as we've been emphasizing it's about execution and over the next few quarters achieving our key milestones will continue to derisk the plan. The story is the same for operating cash flows where we're expanding operating cash flow over the next few years and that's net of our cash taxes and interest costs presented on the slide.","Our cash flows grow from less than $2 billion this year in 2019 and would range from $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion in 2020 as we continue the transition. Of the average of 2021 and 2022 looking at $3 copper, it would range from over $5 billion to $6 billion at $3.25 copper for the average of 2021 and 2022.","We show our capital expenditures in -- on slide 15 and these are broadly in line with our prior guidance. It includes sustaining capital of roughly $1 billion per year and then we've got the projects underway, including the underground at Grasberg and Lone Star that average about $1.6 billion per year in 2019 and 2020. As Richard mentioned, we're continuing to manage capital carefully and thoughtfully.","The investments we're making now or at an advanced stage will strengthen our margins at low prices, enhance our long-term asset base and provide leverage to improve markets over time. These amounts do not include the new smelter in Indonesia in which FCX will share 49% of the economics. As indicated in the press release, we're completing engineering studies and we also have -- we're expecting to have the engineered estimates and project schedules in the first part of next year.","We've been working with a group of banks on debt financing for the smelter. We expect to debt finance the capital cost of the smelter at the PT Freeport Indonesia level, and that is expected to be non-recourse to FCX. We are advancing the discussions with the banks and hope to have a facility in place to fund the cash outlays for the smelter.","Currently, we do not expect the dividends out of PT-FI. We will be burdened by smelter development capital as a result during the construction period, and particularly, during the period prior to 2023, when FCX receives 81% of the dividends from PT-FI.","Turning to slide 16, we show the debt maturity profile for our senior notes, which totaled $9 billion over this period of time. During the third quarter, we issued $1.2 billion in new eight and 10-year notes and those are shown in yellow on the graph. And we use the proceeds to redeem debt with near-term maturities and we also redeemed the higher coupon notes.","We were able to extend our average maturity by a year. You can see here on the table where our weighted average maturity is roughly 10 years now, and we reduced our average coupon during this process. Our balance sheet's in good shape and we don't have significant maturities until 2022 and have a strong liquidity position.","In closing, on slide 17, you see our road map to our growth in cash flows to drive shareholder value. Each of these initiatives is advancing well. The momentum that we have in each of these projects is real and we're very focused as a management team on executing these plans effectively and have a clear path in front of us to substantial growth in revenues, margins and free cash flow.","Thanks for your attention, and Regina, we'll now open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Terry","Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one just relates to the grade reconciliation. So I was wondering if you could just talk firstly, on the gold for the full year? You've increased that. Is that just a timing issue or are you getting better reconciliation? And then, for the underground, you talked a lot about the development, but how is the grade -- how are the grades reconciling in copper and gold on the underground development? Thanks.","Kathleen Quirk","With respect to the first question, the increase in gold for 2019 principally relates to the open-pit ore. We've extended the mining of open pit through November, and we're doing this on a limited basis, but it does have high grades. And so, it does impact us. There is a potential that we could extend the pit longer, but our real focus is on getting the underground ramp-up, which is going well.","And we have not had any issues with respect to the grades. We've got good grades, higher than reserve grade coming from Deep MLZ in the early years, and that's part of what drives the metal production. But -- and Mark's on the line. Mark, I don't know if you have anything to add about the grades, but we believe we're in good shape on that front.","Mark Johnson","Yeah, for all of the new major underground mines, Big Gossan, GBC and Deep MLZ, the grades that we've gotten are very much consistent with the reserves. In GBC and Deep MLZ, we're just really starting to touch the bottom of the columns and sampling through some of the drawbell period and some of the initial primary fragmentation is a bit challenging.","We get a lot of big material, but everything we've seen so far is consistent with what we would expect. The ore bodies are very well drilled, like Richard had mentioned earlier. These are not new ore bodies. They are extension of ore bodies that we've been mining for years. So we haven't seen any issues there.","Richard Adkerson","And for those of you who follow the Grasberg open pit for years, you will remember that we always had this high-grade core of gold. That's the way the mine was designed to access that, and that's why we're doing the surgical mining. When I was there, there was only two shovels working at the bottom of this pit.","We mined out the haul road, so it's single-lane haul roads going down and coming up. But the reasons for doing that and trying to extend this is the ore, we are getting such high-grade gold. I mean it's extraordinary grade. And so that's the whole reason we're continuing to do it. We'll do it as long as we can, until the development of the Grasberg Block Cave pit.","Eventually, well geotechnically, require us to get out and we've got procedures to get out very quickly, and we're monitoring with due diligence. But as long as we can get down to that high-grade gold, we're going to do it. And that's what you're seeing, Chris.","Chris Terry","Okay, thanks -- thanks for the color on that. Second question, just on slide 17, when you are stepping through the future of the Company, I just wondered if you could comment, once you get through the ramp-up period of Grasberg and then have more decisions about future projects versus potential capital returns, can you just rank those? Are you trying to do both, is it one over the other? I just wondered if you could talk through what the priorities are for the medium-term investor? Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","I can't wait till we face that. So here's what I think will unfold and it's going to depend on what the economics of the world are and so forth. But we will be generating cash and we will use that cash to manage our debt level on our balance sheet initially and return -- our balance sheet, we're comfortable with it. It's not a question of having to do things, but it will be sort of the situation we were in years past. We will be increasing returns to shareholders. Shareholders will have been patient, they deserve to be rewarded for that, and so we will be focused on the shareholder returns.","With that, we've had a traditional emphasis on dividends, but we will be looking at share price and deciding about share buybacks and dividends. We will also be looking if markets warrant disciplined investments in some of these undeveloped resources of Freeport, which I think is a great asset for our Company. But in any event, if we pursue those and it will be disciplined, those in our industry are investments that are undertaken over time. It's not one-time investments.","We have lots of people we'd like to be partners with us, and we'll make assessments of about that. So, my own view of how this will end up for all is success with the transition in these initiatives that we have, confident of that. I believe copper markets will be better, because I don't think today's price is sustainable and I think the world is geared for a brighter future. That will mean a lot of cash. We will use some of that probably to pay down some debt, shareholder returns and longer-term investments.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks, Richard. The last one from me, maybe for Kathleen. Just on the timing of the sales versus the production, do you expect most of that to be caught up in 4Q or will you still have any imbalance that will head into 2020, if so, i.e. can we expect a really big catch-up in this quarter? Thanks.","Kathleen Quirk","Yes. We are expecting that our inventories will be at normal levels. We do usually have some inventories at site, but generally, our production matches our sales. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to sell more than our production and get inventories back to normal. You always have from time-to-time some shipping, weather type things, but we're not expecting anything out of the ordinary and except most of that to be and it's reflected in our guidance, most of that to be sold in the fourth quarter.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks. That's it from me.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.","Alex Hacking","Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. I just have one question. You mentioned in the slides there have been some seismic activity at DMLZ, that it's slowed some of the undercutting rates and so on. Obviously, underground mining is not necessarily as linear as open-pit mining and there are issues that crop up from time-to-time.","So I guess, my question is, are you comfortable that there is enough production blocks, all at draw points, effectively sort of latency and optionality in that's been engineered into the DMLZ, so that if these geo -- as these geotechnical issues crop up over time, that you won't have significant impacts on production? Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Yeah. So, I've spent a lot of time talking with Mark and the team about this and asking that very question. And the more I get into it -- and I try to emphasize the point that this is multiple mines that we are developing in these mineralization areas with multiple headings. And I was making the comparison with open pit where when we first started open pit, we had a lot of access available because this pit was in high grade ore.","But as we went further down in the pit, the pit widened and we had less options for dealing with changes in open-pit mining. And so in comparison, where we are at the underground, and Mark you jump in on this, but I'll give you my interpretation of meeting with you and your team.","With these different mine headings that we have, is really going to give us a comfort that if we do have -- and it's not necessarily mining into seismic events, but you are going to have wet muck and other things that you encounter.","We're dealing with that with remote mining activities and so forth. But because of these number of accesses that we have, we're going to be able to have confidence in being able to operate regularly and to deal with relatively predictable production now. You make a point there's risk in underground, that's true.","But I want to make the point that we're not just talking about a single underground mine like we have with our smaller Big Gossan mine where an event could affect that. It is not material to overall operations, although it's a great profit generator. But with all these -- the large-scale of the ore bodies, the access to those ore bodies at multiple points, will give us the chance to avoid having the kind of risk that you would have if it was a single mine.","Kathleen Quirk","And Alex, just to clarify, the slowing of the undercutting in one of the production blocks of Deep MLZ during the quarter was not -- was designed to achieve a desired cave shape. We're managing the seismicity issue. It wasn't related to that. It was simply to get the cave shape in a manner that we thought was the right shape and Mark can comment further on that. I just wanted to clarify that it wasn't a seismicity-driven issue.","Mark Johnson","No, what was encouraging about this situation is that, that our team was able to detect a buildup of stored energy before we had any significant seismic event. They were able to determine what was -- what the cause of that was. We had a relatively flat cave angle. We focused on the mucking in this in the cave front area, and within a month we had the cave shape back where we'd like it.","And then we were able to see that some of these indicators were back in line. And we had a process where we got back to the undercutting. So that to me was -- was all very encouraging. It was a very proactive way of looking at the data and adjusting the mining.","Another -- just to comment on your concern about the underground mining. What we do in the underground mine plants that we have now, we use a central estimate where there is upside to the estimate. We also look at the downside events that could cause that. But what we try to do is to develop an estimate for our forecast that has 5% to 10% upside.","And some of the advantages we're going to see in the underground, for instance, in the GBC where we have the manless automated train system is that we feel there may be some upside to our ability to maximize the use of our ore flow system that we haven't been able to do in the previous systems that were based on manned truck systems.","This system will be able to run through shift changes, it will be much more of a continuous operation and also our mills will see a very consistent ore blend day to day. That's not necessarily been the case in the Grasberg Block Cave.","We can confer the Grasberg pit. We can get into a very high-grade phase and then we can get into a low-grade phase and all those swings cause minor disruptions in the processing. I believe, once we get into a very steady state on the ore types and the feed grades, that there will be further enhancements to our ability to more efficiently process the material.","Alex Hacking","Thank you. Thanks everyone. Very, very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B Riley FBR.","Lucas Pipes","Hey, good morning everyone.","Kathleen Quirk","Good morning.","Lucas Pipes","I also wanted to -- I know this has come up a few times, but I also wanted to follow up on the DMLZ. And specifically, what I looked at was the number of drawbells by year-end 2019 and then also year-end 2020. Any long-term conclusions that can be drawn from this slight reduction? Just would appreciate that clarification. Thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","Mark, you want to take that?","Mark Johnson","Yeah, we -- we had about three less drawbells than we planned for the quarter, which is around 3% of our total drawbells. We don't see that as significant, it didn't impact our ramp up. The amount of material that we pull from each draw point in the Deep MLZ is very conservative.","When we had 80 drawbells in the DOZ, for instance, we were producing 30,000 tons a day. So we've been able to pull more per draw points. We continue to see that, that's an upside to where we are right now in our production ramp-up. We have not yet pulled any of the material that has been affected by the hydrofracking, that's just slightly above where we're pulling.","So we're optimistic that, that hydrofracking will also affect the fragmentation as it starts to make its way to the draw point. So it didn't have any impact. It's a relatively minor change. We feel that our production schedules or tons per draw point are very much in line, in fact, well below what we experienced in the DOZ.","Lucas Pipes","That's very helpful, I appreciate that. And then two quick follow-up questions. The first -- the 200 million pounds kind of efficiency-related output potential, when could that be coming through? I would appreciate a sense for the timing on that.","And then secondly, you have a large portfolio of undeveloped assets. Could you speak to the extent those might be candidates for monetization would appreciate your thoughts. Thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","We're just getting rolling out new plants in the first half of next year. With all of our teams are going through now new mine plans to incorporate the debottlenecking in the findings that we're experiencing through this program that Richard was talking about. And so our expectation is that beginning next year we will incorporate those plans and hope to have it in the first part of the year.","In terms of the non-core asset sales, we'll continue to test the market and have dialog where we can add some cash proceeds to our Company at a time during this transition. We have a couple of assets that aren't producing cash flows that we may sell and that's just something we'll consider as we look at what the alternatives are. But that is something that we are -- that we do have. It's not in our plan. We do have a plan announced agreement to sell our refining -- part of the cobalt refining business in Kokkola and we expect that transaction to close in the fourth quarter.","Richard Adkerson","And I'll just say we have substantial interest in the Serbian in the DRC asset, people and we're just assessing -- we understand the values and if we can get to those values we're likely to proceed with those, but there is interest in them.","Lucas Pipes","That's very helpful. I appreciate all the color and continued best of luck.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.","Chris LaFemina","Hi, thank you. Hi, Richard. Hi, Kathleen. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two different questions first relating to Grasberg and second, relating to the Americas. Actually I'd start with North America. So I think one thing that maybe gets a little bit lost in the mix with Freeport, because we're also focused on Indonesia, is very consistent and predictable operational track record in the Americas. In fact, especially in North America and third quarter was no exception, obviously you had very strong production there.","I guess the question around that is unit costs in North America. I mean obviously not paying taxes, that's very helpful, but unit cost despite strong production in the quarter, creeped a little bit higher versus second quarter. How should we think about the cost progression in both North America and South America over a multiyear horizon?","I mean obviously you have the innovation plans, which could lead to some cost reductions. But is the cost creep really just a function of grades? I mean it's -- or is there something else going on that you could -- that could make a material change lower over time? That's the first question.","Kathleen Quirk","That's one of the real benefits of this program that Red is leading is over time, we've done a lot with low grade assets to maintain a competitive cost structure and these are new tools that are going to allow us to improve productivity and that will drop the unit cost. But one thing just to point out, we did have an increase year-over-year with North America. The biggest driver of that was at Morenci where the cash costs were higher year-over-year from an accounting standpoint.","But when you look at the underlying cash, the amount of cash we spent to produce those pounds at Morenci in the quarter, it was actually the same as last year. But we had costs with these stockpiles that were inventoried on our balance sheet and because we drew, I mentioned we're getting better recoveries out of the leach pads we actually had some of those costs that were in inventory on our balance sheet come through the income statement and that's included in our, we call it, cash costs, but that's using the income statement.","So really from a cash standpoint the way we also manage it is to exclude those prior period costs and when you look at it, the net cash costs were around -- were similar to the year-ago period. So -- but the real benefit as we are all talking is to drive those costs lower through productivity and not only do you have a lower unit cost, but that expands the reserve position because these North American assets are limited by economics, we use 250 to do our reserves. But if we can bring down the cash costs that's more reserves that could be brought in to the portfolio. So our focus is to keep stable and drive down the cost in the Americas.","Richard Adkerson","And let me add one other fact that's been kind of part of our situation last couple of years. When we were so focused on debt reduction three years ago in 2016 and that was the time when copper prices were very low, we deferred some things and we've had to catch up with mine rates and that added some volume type cost to our business, which mostly is behind this now.","I think one of the points we're making is we're not seeing significant increases in input cost. Energy costs are what they are, but our energy sources are diversified. The things that are keeping copper prices low are keeping some of our input costs low. So what you're seeing is some of these accounting type issues that Kathleen referred to, some degree of catch-up in employment, mine rates and so forth, but the fundamental cost structure of our business is not changing.","We had the unusual -- you mentioned North America, South America this year had the unusual situation of having these disruptions of protests not related to Cerro Verde but related to other mines, but roads were blocked, we couldn't get equipment in, we had some delays in shipments, we had to take some steps to counter these disruptions that cost some money and that's just part of things that happen.","The good news is the community continued to support our operations. So that's going to be normal variations. But every quarter right before this earnings call we sit down, we go through input cost with our supply team for all of our operations and I'm struck by just how well we are managing that suppliers or are being very responsive to us. Caterpillar is a big supplier of ours and we work well with them to reduce costs. So all of this is -- I guess the point I want to make is, there is not fundamental changes in the cost structure that are driving.","Chris LaFemina","Thanks for that. And then quickly on Grasberg. There's a lot of focus amongst mining investors and our investors in general about ESG issues. Can you just kind of discuss the changes in the environmental impact at Grasberg as you move into the underground? We are moving less material, obviously making less waste. How do we think about the environmental impact from the operations going forward?","Richard Adkerson","I should have mentioned this. I am so glad you asked this question. Besides being thrilled with what I saw with what we're doing with our underground transition, I spent a day taking helicopter tour over our tailings deposition area and then we got into buses and trucks and actually went down on the ground.","There's two aspects to what you just said about waste management. One is the waste material we mined from the pit in placed around the mine. I went to this area called the Wannigen which is one of our major waste dumps where we've literally spent over the years $0.75 billion managing waste at that site.","And again, I was there when it started and to see how effective that is in this way and mixing the waste rock with limestone to control the acid run-off, I mean it's remarkable, the numbers how they decreased. Then you get down the tailings area and this is a point I'm making with the government, I made with the President. This tailing system that we settled down in the mid-1990s was very controversial at the time, because we used a natural river to transport tailings and it was contained within a dike a levy system, within this designated deposition area.","Today in that deposition area, we have a demonstration project of where we're actually growing crops, raising fish, raising cattle, and that's good. But what's more remarkable to me is, throughout this deposition area when the tailings -- when the tailings river moves away from the area, it dries up.","A natural slime develops, natural grasses and trees are growing. And so in the tailings area, you can see over a majority of the area, natural re-vegetation occurring without any assistance from us. And our team estimates that at the conclusion of the mining decades from now, this whole area will return to a natural state and we will only have to do any kind of remediation for like 20% of the area. It's a visual verification of the decision that we and the government made 20 years ago, and that is that this was not only a cost-efficient way, but the proper way of disposing of these tailings, so that they can be restored.","It was impossible to store tailings in the mountains, because of the severity of the terrain, the wetness of the climate and the -- although if not a higher earthquake area, the possibility of earthquakes. And so, we chose this system. And now 20 years later, with all that's going on, we can look back on it and say, this is working as designed and it was the right system. We're not defensive about it and the government is now agreeing with us.","Chris LaFemina","Thank you for that. It's great.","Richard Adkerson","And then you talked about ESG. We learned early on at Grasberg, for us to be successful, we had to work with the local people to be successful because of sensitivities between the province and the central government. Now under President Joko Widodo, there is more sensitivity about the central government improving the situation in Papua. And more of our taxes and royalties that we paid to central government are coming back to Papua.","There will always be an issue with social situation there, but we are working hand-in-hand now. Now that our interest with the government are aligned, we are working hand-in-hand on improving the lives of local community. Freeport can't -- can't succeed unless Papua succeeds. We can't succeed unless Indonesia succeeds.","The government now has a 70% ownership interest in the economics of this project. We have the same 30% we had going into all of these negotiations. But we are working cooperatively on security issues, community issues. There is an ongoing effort. But we are all working together now, and I met with local leaders when I was there and made the same commitment to them to keep working really 40% of our workforce today, our top ones whereas in 1996, it was just a handful.","And one of the most exciting things, I have this picture of Kathleen standing with a group of women underground miners at the surface, operating remote control mining equipment underground at -- from the surface. And to see Papuan women, who came from the backgrounds that they came to, operating the largest underground mining operations ever in the history of this industry and not having to have big, strong men in harm's way underground with using equipment that looks like Game Boy, chairs and things and all the smiles and things, and seeing that, it's just -- it's really gratifying to see.","Chris LaFemina","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays.","Matthew Murphy","Hi. I had a few on just small changes on guidance on Grasberg, one being the CapEx. There is a mention in the release about the four-year period 2019 through 2022, where it looks like CapEx hiked a little bit. And then on slide 15 of the presentation, it doesn't look like Grasberg CapEx is up. So should we assume that 2021 and 2022 CapEx has gone up a bit, and if so, what's driving that?","Kathleen Quirk","When we did the average in last quarter, it rounded. I mean this is a rounding thing, it rounded to $920 million something, and now it is $950 million round. So it's not -- it looks like a difference, but it's not a difference like what you would expect.","But we did have some increases in 2021 and 2022 that were modest related to some mill improvements that we're reporting in. We had some revised engineering estimates on a new SAG that was included in some other minor changes. But they weren't -- the changes weren't significant.","Matthew Murphy","Okay, and then just on 2021 gold, guidance came down a little bit. I get it's a small change. But I think you guys started the year at 1.6 million ounces and it's now 1.45 million ounces. I'm just wondering what -- do we expect to see that in 2022 and it's just a timing thing or is that ore body understanding or what?","Richard Adkerson","Let me just say, these are Kathleen questions and she is going to answer them, but we at Freeport, we don't have an annual planning process. We update our plans every quarter. We step back and we meet and we come out with our best estimate.","So there are going to be changes of this nature plus and minus, there are every quarter. But rather than like in my experience watching other companies, they give kind of constant guidance through the quarter and then they all have this big announcement how their plan and all these things come through.","So those things you're seeing of this nature just reflect a bunch of hard work that goes in. And as you get closer to things, you get more specific planning done and the number change a bit. But...","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. And now just as Richard said, we do update the mine plans every quarter and we had a 25 million -- a 25,000 ounce change in gold in 2021, which could be grades or modest, small changes and that rounded the number differently. So as Richard said, we just -- we keep this update, and we don't want to have any big surprises to keep it updated each quarter.","Matthew Murphy","Yeah, and I appreciate the disclosure. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.","Orest Wowkodaw","Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on unit costs. Obviously, they bounce around quite a bit at Grasberg, depending on the volume, but if we looked at site delivery costs at Grasberg on a dollar basis, it seems to me that they've been trending up this year, averaging about $500 million a quarter or about $2 billion per annum.","Is that a good guide for a run rate moving forward, because that's certainly up from what we've seen in the last couple of years that were more like $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion on for site delivery costs? I'm just curious if there is something going on this year with the transition that's driving that up and it will come back down or whether that's a good run rate from a dollar basis? Thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. No, actually our costs at Grasberg, when you look at it on the basis that you're looking at, is lower this year and that reflects the lower mill rates than what we've had in recent years. But -- and then next year, we're not projecting any significant changes in the cost from this year.","As you'll recall, a lot of it is fixed and then we do have some variable costs associated with the mill rate. But we've got basically a core team that manages the operation. We don't have -- we're not having significant changes in the costs and actually they are actually down from prior year.","So we've been -- one of the things Mark's team is leading out there during this period of time of transition is really trying to drive efficiencies. Grasberg has always had high production and so costs have been less of a focus but his team out there is really focused on dropping aggregate costs and looking at cost and capital together. So we will be happy, Dave and I can call you and review exactly what your question was. But we see that Grasberg costs have been trending lower this year versus previous year.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay. I'm not sure I actually got, but...","Richard Adkerson","On that issue when we're out there but Orest maybe you've got some elements of cost that you're raising the question about rather than the total cost.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay. Yeah, I just looking at your total site delivery cost of $1.5 billion year-to-date versus $1.4 billion last year at Grasberg.","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah, last year total cost, cash production cost at PT-FI was $1.9 billion and we're less than $1.8 billion this year.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay. Maybe we will take it offline. Thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","Okay.","Richard Adkerson","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos","Thank you. Well, the 40 million pounds decline at Cerro Verde in the third quarter, we caught up and would there be 40 million extra pounds delivered in the fourth quarter with blockade of another party being over or were there a few other operational items that might have gotten mixed in and contributed to the decline in addition?","And separately could you give us a flavor of the day-to-day productivity and cost issues you manage? My sense is that you're going to do your best to have a net profit for the year rather than a small loss. And could you talk about whether it's day to day cost per ton, day to day recovery rates, travel expense, exploration expense, bypassing some low-grade areas, maintenance schedules, some stripping that you can postpone, the different things you're trying to do, it's impressive, if you can stay out of the red as the price falls.","Richard Adkerson","So I'm going to ask Red to talk about situation at Cerro Verde. I mean, practically we try to operate all out, and that's our plan. So there is not really capability of makeup, although there was some inventory that's in our numbers that we will make up. But John, we certainly aim to maximize cash flows. That's what we're doing, but we are not driven, I talked about the strategy of our Company and the major initiatives that we are on and that's what we're focused on.","We are not -- we're trying to be efficient every day and cut out unnecessary cost. But in terms of trying to do things that would otherwise be beneficial in deferring them, just so we can affect near term accounting profits is not what we're back up and the bigger picture is this thing is irrelevant to the future of our Company.","Now, I don't want you to think we're not being hard nose on expenses and efficiencies that we are. But to defer some maintenance that could have longer-term consequences just to achieve some near-term results, we're not going to do that. Red, why don't you talk about the Cerro Verde situation?","Red Conger","Yeah, John just quickly going from the issues that Kathleen discussed in the third quarter that we faced. There is going to be some carryover effect from that into the fourth quarter. Our mining lines did not get advanced to the areas that we thought we would in the fourth quarter. So we're going to have to use some additional low grade stockpile material to offset that timing of ore. That ore material is there. It's not lost and will be mined next year. So we've got a small effect in the fourth quarter from that.","Kathleen Quirk","But both production and sales for Cerro Verde are expected to be higher compared to the third quarter for the fourth quarter.","Red Conger","Yeah. I was just referring to our forecast.","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. But compared -- as Red said, compared to the prior forecast we did adjust some Cerro Verde for the current mining situation there. But on a quarter-to-quarter basis sequentially production and sales we're expecting to be higher than the third quarter at Cerro Verde.","Richard Adkerson","And in along the lines of what you talking about. John, one of the things we talked about with Mark and his team who is out there is as we are ramping down mining from the open pit, there is going to be a lot of dismantling of facilities, transfers of equipment we're transferring trucks from Indonesia to North America and the Cerro Verde and so we talked about having a focused team on how to -- and as we are -- the focus of the overall organization is on this underground transitions to put together team of how we can do things like that as efficiently and saving cost in doing some of the less significant, less visible items in an economical way.","But you look back at our, for example, our G&A cost, we've made substantial reduction of G&A costs in recent years on the order of 30%-plus percent, right, Kathleen? And so we are continually going through our organization and challenging personnel cost, travel cost and the things of that nature.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Hey guys, good morning. Just one question from me that I didn't hear anyone asking and I really wanted to get your high-level thoughts on. It seems like there is an uptick in disruptions in Chile lately and some maybe project specific issues in Peru. I just wanted to get your thoughts on is this isolated incident, is this something broader that we should be worried about is country risk picking up in those Latin American regions? Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","So Peru has been a country of where there's been this dichotomy between the government through several presidential administrations since I've been involved there over the past 12 years. There has been consistent recognition by the government for the way for Peru to improve is encourage mining investment and the Central Government has done that directly with us and other miners.","They have seen the historical success in Chile and they made a lot of progress. The challenge in Peru has been and this is not new, but it's been all along, the conflict between local communities and nearby mine developments, often centered around access to water.","But also disruptions in communities and so forth. And this has been a feature of business in Peru, which still and even though the country has made tremendous progress, still has a large income disparity within the country.","And so it's something that we recognized at Cerro Verde early on and I was just with the President of Peru. I've been with other Presidents and they all acknowledge that we've been a shining star of success with community relations in our region with the city of Arequipa where we provided fresh water system as a community support, we developed this innovative use of a wastewater treatment center to get water for our expansion rather than building new dam, improve the river, improve the farmer situation.","But there is ongoing issues related to other mining projects in Peru and it's sort of this inherent conflict between communities and mines and that's been a feature and is likely to continue to be a feature going forward. Although the current President, as I discussed with him, is very committed to encouraging mine development and wanting to do things to help it, but it's an ongoing social problem.","Chile is a country that over the years has had a stable situation. There are labor issues that come about with labor negotiations that cause disruptions from time-to-time. And there've been, in certain parts of the country, weather events and earthquake events, but typically, the civil situation has been relatively stable.","On occasion there gets to be a debate between the use of revenues generated by mining for different purposes within government. And that's one back -- current situation, we have one or two that you talked about what we're seeing.","Red Conger","Yeah. Part of the reason that's such a surprise to the world is that Chile has been our country steeped in rule of law. Things work very well there and are very reliable. And over time, there has been this concern about incoming quality and how people can better themselves, can they grow the economy fast enough to create jobs for all of the well-educated people.","So, just a recent event of changing the prices of the metro fare by a relatively small amount, had sparked this current unrest. President Pinera has pulled everybody together, gave a great talk last night to the country about how they recognize these issues and are going to redouble their efforts to address it.","So it sounds like they are resolving this current unrest and everybody that we've talked to this morning, feels very positive about the efforts being made going forward.","Richard Adkerson","But, Timna as I reflect on your question, let me step back and look at a -- the global situation. You're raising issues about country risk, and I think unquestionably, that's a feature in today's world and recent history. And it's something that ultimately is very supportive of copper prices and supply development. And you just go around the world and look at what situations have occurred.","The situation in Alaska with a new mine that's been proposed there. The situation in Mongolia, our situation in Indonesia. We talked about, Peru, Chile has been really a stable situation. Situation in Africa where we were, and in 2008, our contract was challenged and now the new mining law has being revised, but that's beyond the DRC into Zambia and other places.","Even here in Arizona, where we have just remarkably positive relationships with the government, the communities where we operate and that's taken years of work, we have -- I tip my hat to Red and his team for the positive relationships we have with the native American groups where we need to have positive relationship for water access, but we are providing training and employment opportunities for their people. But there mines here in Arizona that are very controversial right now.","I won't go out and say specific mines, because I don't like to talk about other countries, but you're fully aware of the challenges that people face. And so mining is challenging, because it has such a major impact on communities where mines are located. There's issues about sustainability of mining, the resource curse question, the issue of environmental impacts, the competition for water, it's just in here. We are working on those issues through ICMM. But the reality is, is that's a major constraint on future mine development in an industry where the economic resource is scarce.","Copper is not like iron ore or coal, it's not everywhere. And the easy copper deposits have been found over the years, modern deposits at the surface are much lower grades. Like our Cerro Verde mine, it requires tremendous investments in infrastructure mining.","Processing, we have the largest mill facilities in the world at Cerro Verde. Enormous tailing dams are required, because you process so much material. And increasingly, mines are underground where costs are greater. So all of that is reality. Everybody is working to try to deal with it, but it is ultimately a very positive impact for future copper prices.","Timna Tanners","Okay. I appreciate that overview. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas.","Jatinder Goel","Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of small questions. I understand these are not material numbers, but just curious on -- your treatment charges for Indonesia have gone up by $0.02 on 2019 guidance. Is there a change in concentrate grade or is there any interim revision in the terms similar rise in royalty and export duties? I understand gold price and volumes are higher, but at the same time, the copper price is lower. Is it just the mix or something else is changing there as well? Thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","Right. It is the mix and we are exporting more than what we had in our previous plan, but it's really just a mix issue and not something more than that.","Jatinder Goel","Okay. Very clear.","Richard Adkerson","We get -- we pay global TCs and RCs. I mean, it's market based with the world's largest marketer of copper concentrate and the concentrate price that we pay is the globally negotiated rates.","Jatinder Goel","Sure, thank you.","Richard Adkerson","We agree on a royalty stream with the government and that's what we pay.","Jatinder Goel","Okay, very clear. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC.","Oscar Cabrera","Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. Everyone there, first of all, congratulations on the strong development of Grasberg. We look forward to see how that transition will excel. Just getting back to South America and Cerro Verde, are you assuming that the blockades won't be there for your budget in the fourth quarter and into next year?","Kathleen Quirk","With -- Repeat that after...","Richard Adkerson","He's saying of the blockades with -- they are down now, right Red?","Red Conger","Yeah and we're assuming that things run as\u2026","Richard Adkerson","No, now some of the issues that led to the blockade are still unresolved. And so, you know if something else happens it happens, but we don't predict that. We -- our plans are based on having normal access to our port for delivering concentrate, normal access for bringing goods into the -- to the operation and for our people to be able to come to work. So...","Kathleen Quirk","And that's the case today.","Richard Adkerson","And that is the case as we speak.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay. Yeah, now that was the question. Thanks very much. Then secondly,","Richard Adkerson","And I will say this -- I will say this Oscar. Not all of the disruptions that you read about affect us, okay. This one did, but there have been other disruptions for other mines that did not affect us, but this one was particularly well organized and it was directed to disrupt us as a protest against other operations -- as well as the other operations.","Oscar Cabrera","Yeah, no, I think that is well understood by the market, which is the unfortunate position of just having to use the same route to get your product back to market.","Then secondly, on Chile, there was -- can you just please remind me, one other large mining company cut back their projection for copper production because of the drought that they're experiencing in the South. But can you please remind me your situation in as far as water and power in El Abra?","Red Conger","Yeah. So the water at El Abra comes from well fields up near the border with Bolivia. So it -- those well fields are well managed, that are sustainable and no issues for us.","Kathleen Quirk","And this is a leach operation, not the -- not a mill. When we are talking about a potential there -- El Abra expansion, we would address water there with a desalinization. But the current operation doesn't require that.","Richard Adkerson","And you know, somebody asked earlier about future development projects. El Abra is a very attractive project that -- where we're partners with Codelco. It would be a mill expansion. It would require, as Kathleen said, desal and it would be subject to Chilean taxes.","We have a number of projects in the US that we're considering as an expansion at our Bagdad mine in Arizona. That is not as large scale, but we own 100% of the mine, we own the land at fee. We have no income taxes to pay in the US. We have expansion opportunities at a number of our other US mines, including Morenci. We have a potential expansion opportunity in New Mexico.","So we have a number of alternatives. What we're doing right now as we speak is, we are doing studies of these. We are advancing our understanding of the projects, the ore bodies with challenging capital. We're trying to come up to see which ones are most economic and we are ranking them so that when we do get to the promised land of strong cash flows, and pay and returns to shareholders, we will be able to evaluate which of these to pursue on a disciplined basis but -- I failed to answer your other question, I just wanted to make this comment.","Oscar Cabrera","No. We appreciate that, Rich. And we look forward to not turnaround in a couple markets, and then congratulations again on the Grasberg success.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you, Oscar.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael Dudas","Thanks everybody for squeezing me in. Richard, what do you and your team expect to see when you get to LME Week?","Richard Adkerson","Man, I'd say that's -- we're there next week as you know, Mike, and every year it's a good barometer for what's going on in the industry. My guess is, we'll hear a lot of complaining about US government's trade policy. We will hear talk about China's efforts to bolster its economy through fiscal means and through economic stimulus, and spending on infrastructure and Belt and Road Initiatives.","I'm sure we'll hear a lot of talk about Timna's question about government relations and dealing with governments with -- actually meeting will be focused on dealing with tailing down management, which is an issue we have long recognized as important for Freeport.","At the time of the Phelps Dodge deal, we put immense focus on it and we've invested a lot in it, continue to and our -- the situations that evolve around the world are matters everyone is studying and working with others in the industry to review our practices. But we are confident we're doing the right thing and we'll always do the right thing.","So, that's kind of an overview of what I expect. It's -- as you know like it's mood swing to come over LME and sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's hopeful and sometimes it's negative. And it's not always predictable in advance.","Michael Dudas","Well, you'll be running into the Brexit issue over there, so good luck when that happens. Thanks, Richard.","Richard Adkerson","Yeah. I don't even know what to say about that, and so I won't say anything.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Kathleen Quirk","Well, thanks everyone for your participation and we look forward to ongoing reporting of our progress. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to call David Joint. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website homepage at fcx.com and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer. We have also have Red Conger here, Mark Johnson, and Mike Kendrick. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our performance and the slide presentation that included on our website. After the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1 billion, or $0.71 per share. The results include net gains of $291 million, or $0.20 per share, primarily related to tax benefits associated with U.S. tax reform totaling $393 million, partly offset by charges for adjustments to environmental obligations.","The benefit from tax reform principally relates to the appeal of the AMT and a refund of our AMT credit carry-forward. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $750 million, or $0.51 per share. For the year, our net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.8 billion, or $1.25 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion, or $3.16 per share for the year 2016.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization or EBITDA totaled $2.1 billion and $6 billion for the full-year. A reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation is available in our slide materials on Page 37. For the fourth quarter, FCX totaled 1 billion pounds of copper, 593,000 ounces of gold, and 24 million pounds of molybdenum. And for the full-year, we sold 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces of gold, and 95 million pounds of molybdenum.","Our fourth quarter average realized copper price of $3.21 per pound was 29% above the year-ago quarter average price of $2.48 per pound. Our average unit net cash costs for copper was $1.04 per pound for the fourth quarter of 2017 and averaged $1.20 per pound for the full-year and that compared to $1.26 per pound for the full-year of 2016.","We generated strong operating cash flows in the fourth quarter totaling $1.7 billion, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $390 million. For the full-year, our operating cash flow totaled $4.7 billion and capital expenditures for $1.4 billion.","We used our strong cash flows to improve our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $1.7 billion in debt and that include \u2013 included the early redemption of $617 million of senior notes due 2020 and open-market repurchases of $74 million of notes due in 2018.","At the end of 2017, our consolidated cash was $4.4 billion and consolidated debt totaled $13.1 billion. Our debt net of cash of $8.7 billion at the end of 2017 was $3.1 billion less than at the start of the year and $11.4 billion less than the level two years ago. We ended the year with no borrowings under our bank credit facility and approximately 300 \u2013 $3.5 billion available.","I would now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be providing additional details on our results and our outlook.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. 2017 results reflect really strong operating performance throughout our global operations, as Kathleen just described. It also reflects the success of our ongoing cost management and capital discipline efforts, strong cash flow generation, we restored our balance sheet strength, developed attractive organic growth options for the future, and we made important and positive progress for the long-term stability of our operations in Indonesia.","Most of you have been here and watched our company for sometime, just think about where we were two years ago. We had just lived through as the industry had significant drops in commodity prices. The price of copper was just over $2 a pound. Many expected to drop below that.","We had the issue of having $20 billion of debt following the misplaced oil and gas transaction that we did. We had restructured our Board, restructured our management team and were faced with deleveraging. At that Board call, one of you pressed us to say what do you expect your debt levels to be. We weren\u2019t sure at that time. We said, we hope to reduce our debt between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next two years. We are under $9 billion as we ended the year, this year.","We were faced with the completion of our Cerro Verde project in Peru, which was a major project, which often are troublesome for the industry. We did not know what we\u2019re going to do with the oil and gas assets that time. There were no buyers in the marketplace in the first quarter, but we successfully exited that business. We thought we were going to have to hold all those assets for a period of time.","Many who followed our company were skeptical of our ability to sell copper assets at reasonable prices and we\u2019re working with our partners, Sumitomo with \u2013 and Morenci, with China Moly, which turned out to be a great partner to deal within the Congo.","We were able to get reasonable values at the time, great investments for those companies, because they recognize the long-term values and the values in the copper marketplace. We had to sell some equity, but we fought our way through that a year ago.","In October 2016, I went back and looked at my notes from LME work. There was still people predicting a wall of copper supply, still predicting copper prices in October 2016 of $1.80 a pound. The price on the upside that we were above $2.50 a year ago, but we were blindsided by new regulations that it come out from the government of Indonesia that affected \u2013 raised questions about our contract there. They came out in January.","Since that time, I\u2019ve spent as much time in Jakarta as I haven\u2019t been. Kathleen has been there on my last five trips. And we were pleased that after facing the prospects of very contentious arbitration proceeding, which we talked about publicly in the first quarter, we have reached a common grounds for moving forward with the government of Indonesia. We now mutually want to get this thing solved.","We made a lot of progress now, give you a report on where we stand and answer your questions. But 2017, price of copper came back. So today, we have a company that has really great set of long-lived attractively cost \u2013 operating cost profile, assets and resources.","I\u2019m so proud of our team. I have Red Conger here, who runs our business in the Americas; Mark Johnson, who runs our business in the Indonesia; Mike Kendrick, who runs our Molydenum business; Rick Coleman, who does our construction projects, who\u2019s traveling. But these guys and their teams just had an exceptional year this year and executing our plan and being focused on doing that, while we\u2019ve dealt with the issues associated over the last two years with balance sheet management dealing with Indonesia.","We\u2019ve got a great team. And this team has executed extraordinarily well. You can go back to the early 2000s when we had to deal with a serious balance sheet issue. The successful integration and that repayment following the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007, where we successfully repaid all the debt that highly leveraged transactions within four years after managing ourselves through the financial crisis of 2008, 2009. By 2011, we had a company with no debt, had an integrated team that is the best copper operating team in the industry.","Metrics are shown on Page 11 \u2013 on Page #4 \u2013 Page 4. So the key thing it jumps out is free cash flow generation here in 2017. First part of 2017 was tough in Indonesia. We were restricted on exports for a period of time. We had significant labor problems by midyear. We were exporting and continue to export, expect to be able to continue to export.","Our labor relations issues have been really progressed. New union leadership in Indonesia, we signed a new two-year labor contract in December without any controversy or drama associated with it. But even with that issues at the start of the year, we generated over $3 billion of operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures.","You can see our cost structure. We maintained our reserves. And as I mentioned, we have really reduced our balance sheet. As we look forward to our plan for next year, if copper prices remain at roughly the current levels, the debt level, when I say, next year, this year 2018, we should end the year if we use all of our cash flows to reduce debt at a debt level in the area of $5 billion. So $20 billion to $5 billion is a great progress.","Copper market commentary is positive right now, as we\u2019ve seen. Demand is growing throughout the world. For a number of years, many years, China was the source \u2013 sole source of growth globally. The day China is continuing to grow, their economy is better than people expected, as you\u2019ve seen. They appear to have dealt with their banking issues that was a big concern, probably still a risk, but growth in Europe, growth in the United States, growth in Japan just tune into the comments at Davos that\u2019s going on right now. And you can hear the positive comments about the global economy and all that reflects into stronger copper demand.","Supply side, the issues are still there. Analysts, consultants who follow this business are expecting 2018 to be the first year of lower copper production after providing for disruptions than the prior year, first time that\u2019s happened since 2011. The industry is \u2013 supplies, reflecting a very long period of under investments. And even as we speak today with higher prices, we don\u2019t see a wave of new investments being started immediately.","So there\u2019s a real absence of major new project on the horizon declining production from existing mines, exchange stocks are low. So, what McKinsey is talking about having a need to balance the market of 5 million tons of new projects over the next decade with a long lead times, the few world-class opportunities with a new usage for copper, transportation and power generation and so forth. The outlook for copper is positive going into 2018 and very positive for the long-term.","Now slide \u2013 the next \u2013 Slide 6 shows where we stand in the industry. Clearly, a leader. We operate all of the mines that we invested in. And if you were to look at the production of our partners and mines that we operate, we operate the leading amount of copper production in the world.","Large scale, technical capabilities in all forms of copper mining, whether it\u2019s SX\/EW open-pit, sulfide projects, underground mining, particularly block caving, where we\u2019ve been experiencing block caving since 1980s. We have the strong technical team, that\u2019s a huge, huge benefit for our company. And so, I \u2013 that\u2019s really strong competitive advantage.","The supply situation, I think, is reflected on Page 7, where we have a listing of the largest copper mines in the world in terms of reserves and production. Notably, no \u2013 there are no mines on here that have been discovered in the last 10 years. In the last 20 years, the only two mines, Oyu Tolgoi and Las Bambas.","Everything else is old ore bodies now, because we don\u2019t have new extent \u2013 new greenfield projects of size in the imminent outlook for copper demand, copper supply and makes it more significant these brownfield opportunities that we have with our ore bodies, and we\u2019ll talk more about those we have.","Besides our technical capabilities, I think, the real strength of our company lies in our current resource space, our 2P reserves. So we\u2019re a big producer to about 4 billion pounds a year. But you look, we have proved and probable reserves of 87 billion pounds, mineralized material of another almost $100 billion pounds and potential of 150 billion pounds, altogether that\u2019s 335 billion pounds, now what does that mean? And by the way, of the total half of that\u2019s in North America.","And today, in North America, with the power cost advantage that we have here in the United States, that\u2019s come about, because the shale revolution in natural gas and crude oil, with the improved regulatory situation that we\u2019re \u2013 that we now have, and with a very flexible work force, which allows us to deal with changes in our business, whether we\u2019re expanding or having to reallocate resources, the support we get from states, local communities, the big advantage of investing in the United States, which is still from a political risk standpoint, best country in the world.","And now with this new tax bill, that \u2013 that\u2019s another advantage. Now, we are not like most trans national companies in the United States. We were already paying higher tax rate outside the United States than inside the United States. We also had a very large and we continue to have a very large loss carry-forwards for the oil and gas business. So we don\u2019t have the issue of repatriation. The taxes are much lower, current tax tax rates. But we do benefit from the fact that the AMT provisions were repealed, that\u2019s going to allow us to file for refunds over the next four years or so $400 million to $500 million of additional cash.","The tax law retained a percentage depletion for mineral resources. So even looking out beyond the time that we have just a long period of time with these loss carry-forwards, the new tax law was a benefit to us long-term. So what we\u2019ve got these beyond our proved and probable reserves is really a great deal of optionality for the future. The strongest assets in the mining industry are long-lived assets. Long-lived assets, you don\u2019t face the investment risk.","You don\u2019t have to have success, the Greenfield exploration. You don\u2019t have to make acquisitions when you have a resource base like the one that we have. And it\u2019s not limited to any single mine. We have a very large footprint with five operations in the United States that have very large sulfide resources that we\u2019ve identified. And over time, I\u2019m convinced that the world\u2019s going to need the copper out of those.","South America, we have a really attractive project in Chile with our El Abra project, where we\u2019re partners with Codelco to develop a very large sulfide resource. Lots of capital, lots of studying be done. We\u2019re doing studies now. We haven\u2019t committed to spending capital on it, but we\u2019re preparing ourselves, too.","We have a couple of attractive exploration projects. We had a exploration project in Serbia, where we entered into partnership with Nevsun, who is continuing to do drilling and they\u2019re looking to develop and \u2013 Upper Zone, the Lower Zone is of size, and we have a significant position in it.","And while we sold our Tenke Fungurume project in the Congo, we still own an undeveloped resource that\u2019s in the area called Kisanfu. It\u2019s \u2013 we believe the largest undeveloped cobalt deposit in the world. It\u2019s permitted and we\u2019re looking at opportunities of developing it or entering into partnerships with other operators there.","In the Congo, we have a lot of interest that people willing to buy that outright, but it gives us a lot of options to consider with this big resource. And in Grasberg district, while we have a clear cut plan of developing and operating. Through 2041, there\u2019s significant resources beyond that time, they will come into play.","Looking at Americas, it was really strong performance. Congratulations, Red, and your team. In the fourth quarter, we sold 666 million pounds of copper in that quarter alone. I mentioned earlier, the Cerro Verde expansion, that concentrator averaged 374,000 tons per day in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s only 360,000 ton nameplate. I believe, it\u2019s the largest concentrator in the industry and is operating very effectively.","We continue our focus on cost and CapEx management. Some factors are coming into increased cost at the margin. With the higher copper prices, our margins are growing, but we continue to be disciplined in the way we spend money. We are advancing these studies for looking for future growth. But you can just see what a great business this Americas business is.","In the fourth quarter, we had $450 million, $500 million of cash flow after CapEx, and for the year over $2.5 billion. Still in our memory the time when it was said that Southwest copper district in U.S. was dead. Now it\u2019s profitable with major opportunities to invest capital, employ people. Our company supplies more than 40% of the copper to the U.S. district, and we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of that.","The sulfide projects in the Americas include five projects in the U.S. and the El Abra projects in Chile. These reserve numbers we\u2019re using is still based on a $2 copper mine plant, so there\u2019s significant upside at higher prices, both in our reserves and resources. But this is a \u2013 we\u2019re monitoring market conditions, going to be very disciplined in deciding when to go forward with it, but it\u2019s a strength of our company.","One project we are moving forward with is the Lone Star oxide project. This has been a resource. It\u2019s been known for decades in the industry. It\u2019s located seven miles from our Safford mine, which is just across the mountains from Morenci and Eastern Arizona. We\u2019re going to start or we are starting with a project to mine an oxide cap to this big sulfide project. The current project has reserves of 4.4 billion pounds of copper. The capital would be $850 million spent over several years.","We\u2019re commencing free stripping activities in the first quarter of this year. While this will serve to strip cover over the big sulfide resources going to be done in a very profitable way, because when you take that oxide material transport it to the Safford processing facilities, Safford is a mine, which is declining. It had a limited life, it has a big sulfide resource at depth. But now we\u2019re going to be able to use the facilities at Safford to mine this oxide or and have production of 200 million pounds of year for 20 years unit cost of $1.75 with over $1 billion of NPV at 350 copper. So it\u2019s a good project.","But what it does, it gives us exposure to a sulfide deposit lying underneath the oxide deposit. It has 60 billion pounds of contained copper. Now this would involve ultimately the development of a big concentrator mill and so forth, but it\u2019s an attractive way to get exposure to that bigger resource.","And we\u2019re showing the drilling that we\u2019ve done to date, that defines the resource and our 2017 drilling, which we spend a bit more money on than we had originally budgeted. But showed the extension of this sulfide resource, it was very positive. And as you\u2019ll note, you\u2019ve got some attractive grades that are in the current outline for the resource. But these deeper holes continue to encounter attractive grades going forward. So this is a great current and future opportunity for us.","In Chile, the El Abra sulfide project is a good project. I mean, this is really a good project. It\u2019s a big project. It is in our inventory. We\u2019re working with our partners, who are working with other landowners in the region to see if we can cooperate with them. It\u2019s in an altitude if we acquire saltwater\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","Desalinization.","Richard Adkerson","Desalinization project and transportation of that water of high. So it\u2019s going to be a big investment, but it\u2019s 2 billion pounds of 4 and 5 copper. Our correct expectation is that, it would involve the building of 240,000 tons per day concentrate somewhere to Cerro Verde could produce 750 million pounds a year. It\u2019s a six to eight lead-time and we\u2019re engaged in prefeasibility study and permitting panning now, so it\u2019s something that will develop over time.","We\u2019re in no rush on this, but it\u2019s going to be a great project for Freeport in the future. And you can see the results of drilling that have been done to date. You can see the reserve pit that has been identified the mineralized material shale and the continuation of mineralization with our deeper drill holes as we go forward in Indonesia. So, Mark, I want to again, congratulate your team for meeting the challenges that we faced at job site, while we\u2019ve been dealing with this attention on the negotiations with government.","I mentioned earlier, we had exports disrupted. We had labor problems. And the labor situation is so much better than they have been it\u2019s been since going back to 2010 timeframe. We\u2019ve had some security issues and that\u2019s Papua is always going to be a complicated place to operate. But in the last couple of months, we\u2019ve had some security issues. The thing that\u2019s encouraging now versus previous times is, we\u2019re getting great cooperation from the Indonesian authorities.","The head of the police who had previously served in Papua is totally engaged. I\u2019ve got to know General Tito a number of years ago, he\u2019s very well regarded in the government, he understands it and he is committed to help us. There\u2019s a new head of the military and they\u2019re working together with the police.","So you can see the results of that. And I know there\u2019s continued concern about the uncertainty about our contract and so forth. But the balancing deal we\u2019ve been working with is to progress the discussions with the government and take advantage of this high-grade ore that we have available to us as we mine the pit.","My first trip there was 1988, when the second drill hole we drilled at Grasberg. I took a little picture of the exploration chat, where I took that picture to date. There is a pit, that\u2019s a kilometer deep and 2.5 kilometer across that \u2013 since that drilling has been developed, we\u2019re at the very final stages of mining to pit, very little waste material to move, very high-grades of the core of this ore body, and we\u2019ll be mining that for the next year or so.","And so what that has generated for us this year, including negative impacts that we suffered at the first of the year is over $1.5 billion free cash flow, that\u2019s important to our company. Now, what is really important to our company is, getting the rights to operate through 2041. And I\u2019m pleased to report those negotiations are advancing in a mutually amicable way. We have very good working relationships with the ministers that have been assigned to represent the government on this.","The negotiations are at times challenging as all negotiations are. But we have mutual respect, positive views about each other and a mutual objective of getting to this stability. Now, what we\u2019re pushing for is, having fiscal and legal certainty for our long-term mining operations, and that\u2019s through 2041. And that certainty means that, we end up with a agreement that gives us those rights reserved, so that they can\u2019t be changed by future laws and regulations. And the government has accepted that.","We have agreed to provide mutual financial \u2013 provide financial benefits to the government that are in excess of those under our current contract, and that\u2019s principally by paying higher royalties, we redeploy higher royalties.","We\u2019ve agreed to two things that the Indonesians have really described as being nonnegotiable from their perspective. One has to do with building new smelter capacity and we are looking, we are approaching this with a commitment to do it, we told the government that we would do it in conjunction with getting this extension. We are working now at looking at a partnership with a company called Amman, PT Amman which acquired Newmont mine in Zimbabwe, the Batu Hijau mine and it would make sense for us to do something together, so we\u2019re talking about that, but with any event we have committed that within five years of signing of definitive agreement, we will build this new smelter capacity and do it in as cost efficient way as we can.","We\u2019ve also agreed and again this was a nonnegotiable point with the government of Indonesia that we would work to give the government of 51% interest in the project and the \u2013 what is actually a joint venture operations for the Grasberg operations between us and our joint venture partner. And we said we would do that so long as we have fair market value for any divestment and that fair market value would be based on valuations used internationally for resource assets and the government has agreed to that.","We also said we would do it so long as Freeport we continue to have control over operations in the governance of the business. A very complicated business, we\u2019ve invested billions of dollars to date, we are going to be managing another multibillion dollars investments as we go forward. I\u2019m not stretching to say it\u2019s the most complicated mine in the world because of its physical location, it will be the largest underground mine ever developed, environmental issues are very challenging, community issues are challenging.","We will work together as partners with the Indonesians and provide them a meaningful participation in it, but we need to make sure that it\u2019s run in the right way. That said, we\u2019re the best copper miner in the world, the governments state-owned business has some mining experience, but it\u2019s not anywhere near the scale of ours or with the complexity of ours and none within the copper business.","So we have this mutual objective of completing the negotiations and going forward. Our temporary IUPK has been extended to June, our contract award today is in place, the government has agreed to that, we\u2019re exporting we expect to be about to continue to export and we are going forward. The government \u2013 we are aware that the government is engaged in discussions with our joint venture partner about the potential of acquiring their interest.","In preparing for that they are going through a process of doing due diligence to build a record to show that they have \u2013 understand what they are doing. And we are cooperating with that providing them information, meeting with them and so we\u2019re helping to facilitate that transaction, that transaction would be the best outcome for all parties I believe, provided they can reach agreement on valuation.","The valuation negotiations are between the government and our joint venture partner, that\u2019s a separate interest from ours, so we\u2019re facilitating the process, but that\u2019s part of the negotiations that we don\u2019t have control over. But all that\u2019s moving forward, as I said, a whole new attitude about getting there, allowing \u2013 the government recognizes we need to continue operating, they need the revenues in terms of their taxes and royalties, they need to have employment in Papua and all that translates to our, continue to generate cash flows.","So really our Grasberg today is, we are completing mining the open pit. Development started in the early 90s in one of the great mining operations, most years we were moving 700,000 tons to a million tons a day and now it\u2019s coming to an end, but it\u2019s the same ore body that extends down to depths where it\u2019s more economical to mine underground and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focused on is the development of the Grasberg block cave.","Now we are currently producing from an adjacent mineral system that we began mining in the early 1980s and we\u2019ve continued to mine at deeper horizons and expanding it and this mine currently that we\u2019re mining from is the DOZ, the new mine is the DMLZ which we began production in \u201815 or \u201816, in \u201816 and we continue to have the opportunity to expand this resource as we go forward.","So add this altogether, we will \u2013 our plans call for us to process through our mill from the underground, ore at rates of about 240,000 tons per day, for the long term, continuing to 2041. And while \u2013 if you look at the next Slide 18, while all of this has been going on with the government and the labor and everything else, our team has just been plugging away at developing this Grasberg block cave infrastructure and we are virtually completed.","We got access to the underground, we can\u2019t start developing the block caves until we complete mining from the pit, we are now completing the ore delivery system, there is actually a train involved with this and that will be done this year so that by the end of the year we\u2019ll be ready to turn the switch on, start mining from the pit, start mining from the over ground \u2013 underground. Now this has been a challenging high risk project and Mark and his team has done just a great job in focusing on that and getting that done and I will say that the risk of doing that are now behind us.","Once we start managing the underground, we\u2019re going to be ramping up to where this mine will produce a billion pounds of copper a year. Very significant, a million ounces of gold a year on average and that will give it a really attractive cost structure. You know I don\u2019t do this very often, but just to put this in perspective of what we have here in the Grasberg underground, it\u2019s just under a billion tons of ore, with a copper equivalent approaching 1.5% when you add the gold into it.","Las Bambas has just over a billion tons of ore, they have 0.8 copper equivalency. We would produce 31, over 30 billion pounds of copper equivalents, they have about 20. Cobre Panama, which is a great resource has over 3 million tons of ore, but a grade of 0.43 billion tons of ore, but 4, 0.45 copper equivalents.","So compared with other great ore bodies around the world, this is certainly going to be one of them and one which we\u2019ll make a lot of money off of. So the key milestones that we\u2019ve completed to date shown on Slide 19, 220 kilometers of development, mine access, shaft, ventilation, rail connection, crushers, batch plant, and so we\u2019ve got work to do this year, but as I said, my view is the risk of development has been met.","Now what does Indonesia get out of this? Well, it\u2019s a very attractive deal for the government on our existing cap. To date, they\u2019ve gotten almost 60% of the financial benefits of the total operations, we\u2019ve been there 50 years at Grasberg we discovered in the late 80s, since 1992 when our most recent contract came into place, we\u2019ve contributed $60 billion to their national GDP, the largest employer in Papua, one of the largest tax players in Indonesia. We\u2019ve contributed over $700 million since 1996 voluntarily to a Community Development Fund. And as we look forward for the government, future taxes, royalties and dividends through 2041 would exceed $40 billion, good deal for the government, good deal for our shareholders.","2018, our guidance continues the same at about 4 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold, 90 million pounds of molybdenum, which by the way, is having a more positive price environment right now than we\u2019ve had in recent years. Attractive site production and delivery costs of $1.60 after byproduct credits about 90 \u2013 less than $1 a pound.","And operating cash flows at $3.15, copper would exceed $5.8 billion highly leveraged copper prices each $0.10 is $360 million, just over \u2013 roughly $2 billion of CapEx, including $1 billion on the underground development in Indonesia and the development of the Lone Star project. And about $1 billion for other mining sustaining capital, some of which has been deferred in recent years, the clearly right cash margins over CapEx are unit cost.","By area North America, South American and Indonesia are shown on Page 22, as well as our sales by region just make reference to that since I\u2019ve already talked about it. Our sales profile, as we look forward for the next two years, 2019 will be a transition year. We expect of moving from the open-pit at Grasberg to the underground. There is going to be as \u2013 while we\u2019re developing stockpiles and so forth, there will be a interim drop in production, which will build back up to a average over the next two years of approaching 4 billion pounds. And you can see that with our outlook for gold production.","Quarterly sales are shown on Page 24 for the upcoming, for this year 2018. And then Page 25 shows a model that we show each year for the next two years, giving EBITDA and cash flow numbers. At $3.25 copper, we would have average $7.3, EBITDA of $5 billion of operating cash flows. 2018 will be higher than this average because of the transition year in 2019.","And the sensitivities for our \u2013 the metals that we produce and the currencies presented on Page 26, capital expenditure outlook, which I referred to earlier, is \u2013 presented on Page 27, I\u2019ll just note that this does not include spending on the new smelter in Indonesia and we\u2019re looking at financing alternatives to finance that aggressively with project type financing for the smelter.","So just going back to what we\u2019ve done with our balance sheet improvement over the last two years ending the year at $8.7 billion. And if we use all excess cash flow executed on our plan, realized these copper prices, you can see that our debt would drop. significantly during this upcoming year because of strong commodity prices.","So in closing, we\u2019re really optimistic here about our company, about the outlook for copper and this long-term fundamentals. We like being the industry leader. We have a lot of Freeport people that listen to this call. And for all of you on the call in front of our investors and analysts, I just want to tell you how much I and our Board, being a Board and senior management team appreciate what everyone has done this past year. It\u2019s been a challenge. We\u2019ve had to support each other build our morale to come back.","Two years ago, our \u2013 the market was telling us through the CDS trading that there was well over a 90% outlook that this company would default on its debt. That\u2019s two years ago. Now our credit default swap has gone from a high of 2,700 to below 150 basis points. We\u2019re going to get better. Our credit \u2013 I expect our credit rating to increase over time. But what I\u2019m really proud of is, what this team has done. We shown our metal. We continue to do that. I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be part of it and look forward to 2018 to be a year of ongoing and major progress and accomplishment.","Kathleen Quirk","Operator, we can take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.","Alexander Hacking","Hi. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen.","Kathleen Quirk","Good morning.","Alexander Hacking","Regarding Grasberg and the potential that the government might buy the 40% stake from your JV partner, Rio Tinto, how likely do you think that outcome is? Is that now the most likely outcome in your view?","Richard Adkerson","It\u2019s \u2013 at a stage of negotiation. So you don\u2019t want to get ahead of those negotiations. It appears to be the desire parties to do that. So I would characterize as a most likely outcome.","Alexander Hacking","Okay. Thanks, Richard. And can you remind us of what Rio Tinto\u2019s CapEx commitment is to developing the underground? And would you expect that in the scenario, where the Indonesian government buys Rio Tinto stake that they would also assume that that share of CapEx commitment? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Yes. We have an understanding within Indonesian government that \u2013 in the event that they do a deal with Rio Tinto Freeport\u2019s economics under the existing joint venture agreement would be preserved. Alex, you understand what I say? Am I saying clearly?","Alexander Hacking","Yes, yes.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. So\u2026","Alexander Hacking","Yes, I understand that clearly. Could you just remind us what Rio\u2019s commitments are?","Richard Adkerson","All right. Well, it\u2019s complicated in that this joint venture agreement is relatively complicated, because under the agreement, which was signed in the mid-1990s, certain projects are designated as expansion projects and certain projects are designated as replacement capital. Rio Tinto placed 40% of the expansion projects and small amounts of the replacement capital projects, we\u2019ve agreed to share other projects 50-50.","So there\u2019s not really an easy answer for that. But if you look from right now through 2022, when the conversion would be under the joint venture agreement to a straight 40%, after that, it\u2019s a 40-60 joint venture sharing straight up. Their projected cash flows\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","Pretty much offset the CapEx.","Richard Adkerson","\u2026pretty much offset the CapEx, and those are going to be based on whatever copper prices there are.","Alexander Hacking","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s clear. I\u2019ll let somebody else ask the question now and I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. But thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson","Okay, Alex, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Francis Gagliano","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just stepping back for a minute. Obviously, the balance sheet significantly better than it was. Stabilization in Indonesia, at least, seems to be heading in right direction. And it\u2019s like quite a bit of free cash flow generation potential. Way back when the management team, the Board did payout this free cash flow dividends, special dividends, pretty big one at points. And obviously, on this call, your opening remarks are really more focused on highlighting the project. So I have a high-class problem type of question. As we go through 2018 and 2019 is a preference to spend that cash on developing projects, or is there also thoughts towards giving some of that back to the shareholders?","Richard Adkerson","These projects are very long-dated, Dave, I think, as you know. So we\u2019re not likely to be spending significant amounts of capital on these projects in 2018 and 2019. We\u2019re now building into our CapEx numbers this Lone Star project, which is a good project, but not huge.","So with positive cash flows, my expectation was \u2013 is and we\u2019re \u2013 this is a Board decision and we\u2019re talking with the Board and this has emerged pretty quickly with the copper price coming back so quickly and so forth. But my expectations are that, we would be looking at our long-term tradition of returning cash to shareholders.","David Francis Gagliano","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","And we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about all these projects. They\u2019re big, they\u2019re low risk. But we\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s still risk to the global economy as we all know and we\u2019re going to keep our finger on it, see how it\u2019s progressing, how China is doing, how the rest of the world is doing. And \u2013 but my expectation is, we\u2019re going to be generating cash. And I believe, our Board will be predisposed to returning to shareholders when we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew James Korn","Hey, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my questions. At Grasberg, operational question, now given all the challenges in the last several quarters in the production side, maybe you can remind us if nothing would have changed from the current situation of the government? When would Rio\u2019s 40% stake kick in? Would that be 2022, 2023 now? And then once the whole Block Cave is ramping and you\u2019re deep into, maybe the next decade, everything is as it should be. What kind of production delivery cost that you expect once we\u2019re there and solidly on the ground?","Richard Adkerson","Okay. So the answer to your first question is 2022 and sort of when in 2022 is at the margin could vary, but it\u2019s going to be expected to be then. And our net cash costs at $1,300 go and current levels of production is going to be in the neighborhood of\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","Low $0.50 a pound.","Matthew James Korn","Okay. All right. Got it. And another thing that\u2019s come up as we talk to lot of companies is that the \u2013 now that there\u2019s no tailwind from currency, from oil other kinds of improvement, other kinds of help on the price or the cost side. People worried about wages, they worry about labor, they worry about capital goods. I\u2019m curious if \u2013 as you outlined your capital spending over the next couple of years, how much of that is on yellow goods? And how much of that would be exposed to, say, price that\u2019s not completely locked up, or PPI linked, or are you still don\u2019t have a complete visibility there?","Kathleen Quirk","What we do have in our capital plans just maintenance and replacement of trucks. We tend to do a lot of truck rebuilds ourselves with our dealers on part. So there\u2019s in our sustaining capital a significant portion of that includes maintaining our equipment and replacing our equipment.","We are seeing some past inflation. You can just watch the oil price and are seeing some cost inflation from oil-related prices. But our team is very focused on being very disciplined about spending money, both operating and capital and timing it in a way that that we\u2019re not in a rush to get the equipment.","We\u2019ll do it in a smart way and be disciplined about, again, just trying to use what we have on hand and the new stuff that comes in just being disciplined about the timing of purchases of that equipment. But there is some cost inflation that\u2019s coming through both on operating and capital.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, there\u2019s definitely some correlation between some of our input cost and copper price. I mean, that\u2019s just \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve got trucks from Indonesia, in New Mexico right now and more on the way. Red, when is the last time we bought a new haul truck?","Mark Johnson","2008 was the last new haul truck.","Richard Adkerson","New haul truck \u2013 last new haul truck we bought was 2008. So we\u2019re having great experience with this rebuild program. We\u2019re working on extending tire lives. I mean, it\u2019s a constant deal. We need as a senior management team with our mine operators the week before our earnings call. And this relentless effort these people have to try to find ways of offsetting cost increases with efficiency gains is really remarkable.","I mean, we use a lot of diesel, but power for many of our operations comes from not from petroleum. And so, anyway, we\u2019re going to offset a good bit of that. But it\u2019s going to be a factor for the industry. I mean, we \u2013 lots of years we\u2019ve been Caterpillars biggest customer. I had a chance to glance over their earnings release early this morning.","So I mean, you can just see what\u2019s going on that and labor issues will be an issue. And one of the things in terms of the industry is next year, there\u2019s a lot of labor contracts coming up in this year, I keep saying next year, 2018. Thanks, Red. This year, there are a lot of labor contracts in Chile and Peru coming up. And you can expect those negotiations to be challenging, it could be supportive from a supply standpoint. So Codelco has a real challenge in maintaining production. All these things are challenges for the industry, but they\u2019re supportive of supply.","Matthew James Korn","Got it. Thanks for the comments. So good luck for everything.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please go ahead.","Andreas Bokkenheuser","Yes. Thank you very much. Just a question on Grasberg there as well. You mention that the Indonesian government has agreed to pay fair market value or it considered the divestment at fair market value. It always seem that they did agree to fair market value, but their fair market value estimate was always much lower than yours. Would you say that effectively you have now agreed on a fair market value for the divestment, or are you still somewhat a part on that issue? That\u2019s the first question.","Richard Adkerson","Let me answer that\u2026","Andreas Bokkenheuser","Yes, I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.","Richard Adkerson","Let\u2019s go ahead and answer as you raised them. So one thing and those of you who are veterans of this know this. There are lots of things that come out in the Indonesian press that are comments about people either in government or in business who are not directly involved in the process. So be cautious in overreacting to things that you might see that are said.","Now, we have not had a negotiation involving an exchange of values and so forth with the government of Indonesia on divestment values. What we have agreed to is a recognition that the standard for those negotiations would be as they are in all of the negotiations that we have standards related to way resources are valued in global markets.","So this idea of limiting the valuation to 2021, when our primary term of our contract ends. Our saying, you don\u2019t take into account reserves and so forth. All of those things are not part of the discussion any longer. The government has appointed internationally known financial advisors to work with them in this process, and they are being engaged and it\u2019s being additive to the process.","So while we have not negotiated value now, this issue with our joint venture partner really changes what the divestment obligation from Freeport would otherwise be. And so that negotiation is of much less significance to us than it would be if we were having to divest 51% of PT-FI.","So all of that\u2019s in play. All of us had hoped that this would progress more by the end of 2017. But the government concluded they needed to go through a due diligence process and we\u2019re working very cooperatively with the government and its advisors on that process right now. So while I can\u2019t say that there has been this give-and-take or specifics on values, I do feel comfortable that the values that will be negotiated will be reasonable.","Andreas Bokkenheuser","Thank you. That\u2019s very clear. And just a second question and I\u2019ll just talk about something other than just Grasberg. In your Americas operations, we did see a bit of a drop in lower grades and recovery rates as well, which is something you\u2019ve guided for before. Can you give us a sense of, is this mostly just one-off, or there sustainability to it on the operational side? Thank you very much.","Harry \u201cRed\u201d Conger","Yes, Andreas, this is Red. We did have lower recovery primarily at Cerro Verde in the last quarter. We took or out of stockpiles in the area, in the where the material has been oxidized, but it didn\u2019t recover as well. We don\u2019t see that as an ongoing thing in the future. We\u2019ve also got some changes in mining rates in those kinds of things right now that are making the numbers jump around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, that\u2019s all going to even out as we go forward.","Kathleen Quirk","As we look at the guidance going out for the Americas business, our numbers are relatively flat in terms of copper production that\u2019s sustainable over several years.","Richard Adkerson","Over several years. I mean, we\u2019re brining \u2013 it\u2019s not a big numbers, but we\u2019re brining up Cerro mine and with higher moly prices. Its cost cost structure is attractive. And then I pointed out in El Abra, we are \u2013 where we curtailed production. We curtailed production in both of those operations when prices drop low. We\u2019re building those back up and then coming into play. Over time will be this Lone Star Project, which has cost structure that\u2019s right in the neighborhood of our current level of cost structures, so.","Andreas Bokkenheuser","That\u2019s clear. Thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Christopher Mancini","Hi. Thanks a lot. Just first quick question is, just relative to this potential framework that you\u2019re talking about with Rio Tinto and the Indonesian interest having that 40% stake post 2022, just to be clear. So even if something were to be agreed to, say, in the next few months, Freeport would still have \u2013 would have 90% \u2013 would have the right to 90% or 90.5% of the economics of Grasberg until \u2013 until 2022, or whenever the Rio stake would kick in, right?","Richard Adkerson","Yes. Now that is not a certain percent that varies because of this metal strip concept that was part of their original contract. But what I\u2019m saying is that, we have an understanding that we will maintain the economics for Freeport that\u2019s embedded in the current joint venture structure.","Christopher Mancini","Okay.","Richard Adkerson","And there are structures that that might change how that\u2019s done. But we reviewed that. We had very good discussions with the Indonesian, explained it to them, explained how important it is to us, because we\u2019ve worked all this time to take \u2013 to benefit from this period. And so they understand it and we have an understanding that our participation will not be diminished in the event of their acquisition of the Rio Tinto interest.","Christopher Mancini","Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick question about Lone Star. So you\u2019ve made the decision to proceed with the project $850 million and around $200 million pounds of copper a year. Could you just maybe describe your thought process relative to like how you think about approving certain projects relative to their the IRR, or the NPV of the project and what copper prices you use? And just generally speaking, how you evaluate it the decision to invest the capital in that project, and maybe how that might apply to, say, your next project like El Abra or something like that?","Richard Adkerson","Well, it was a much easier decision. Let me just say with Lone Star then the next decisions will be. And that\u2019s because we had this unused underutilized processing facilities at the Safford mine that was nearby. So we didn\u2019t have to invest in a new SX\/EW facility and so forth.","So it was a pretty straightforward deal. I mean, this is near surface oxide material. You just need to determine how you mine it, how you transport it to the facilities. The rates returned very attractive. And it had the added benefit, as I said, of then exposing the sulfide or which would give us an option for future development of that.","Around the world today, a lot of the newer deposits tend \u2013 most of the significant oxide projects have been developed. And so you\u2019re looking at sulfide deposits and frequently you\u2019re faced with a very large expense of stripping those to have that opportunity here. Our stripping is going to generate positive return for us. It\u2019s going to add volumes, attractive cost and serve for the stripping thing. So it was an easier decision.","In looking at projects in general, we don\u2019t focus on any particular price. Now reserves are based on a $2 price. We talk about changing it. But that\u2019s kind of a regulatory disclosure issue and there\u2019s no sense in going through a huge internal exercise of raising the copper price $2.25 to $2.50. I mean, but when we come down to really thinking about investing in an El Abra, in a Lone Star sulfide or Bagdad sulfide or the next step at Morenci.","We look at an array of prices and not just how that fits in with that project, but how it fits in with our overall portfolio. So that we think how would we manage this if things got tougher after we\u2019ve spent the capital. Can we deal with it? And then we won\u2019t \u2013 we have a positive long-term view of copper, so we want to take advantage of this. And so we have the optionality of having these big projects to participate in the long run.","So it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m kind of like that add for the insurance company, the farmer\u2019s insurance company. I know a thing or two, because I\u2019ve seen a thing or two. And the \u2013 my experience has been, when companies get too formula-driven about hurdle rates and prices and things like that, there\u2019s another saying, I have around here is figures don\u2019t lie, but liars figure. And so, if you get too structured like that, people are going to play the games with you sometimes not intentionally, they come up with something that meets those formulas.","So we go away from formulas. We work together. What I love about our team is, we\u2019re not negotiating between operators and corporate. Kathleen works with her team hand in hand with these \u2013with our team, as we\u2019re working and looking at this. And then we think about, okay, if we expose this capital, what risk are taken for the company going forward? How does it fit in with the rest of our assets? That\u2019s why we felt so good about the Tenke project. It was how risk, high return deal, when nobody else was going into the Congo.","We didn\u2019t give any value to it when we bought Phelps Dodge. I wish, we still own it, but we did get almost $3 billion of value created. During \u2013 we started this in early 2008. So given the financial crisis and what\u2019s out with commodity prices, it was a good deal. But we recognize, it was a very high risk because of the political situation, the nature of the ore body and the mineralization, which was different than others. But \u2013 so that is much more of a\u2026","Christopher Mancini","Right, right.","Richard Adkerson","\u2026interactive process we have been than something that\u2019s formula-driven.","Christopher Mancini","Right.","Kathleen Quirk","And the Ore Flow project fits right into our strength in terms of the geographic footprint, where we\u2019re already operating a lot of synergies of the Safford team with the Lone Star team. And one of the big things we look at in qualifying projects is the size of the resource and the life of the project. And just, because something has a high NPV, but if it has a short life, it\u2019s not something that we are excited about disposing dollars to it\u2019s more of multiples in NPV that you can get over a long period of time, so that\u2019s really\u2026","Christopher Mancini","Right.","Kathleen Quirk","\u2026something that excites us. And looking at a range of copper prices like the Lone Star just for the oxide had a break-even up to 40 with an 8% return, with a lot of exposure to higher prices, but also exposure to the big resource that Richard talked about earlier.","Christopher Mancini","Sure, okay. Right. So Lone Star really is just a little risk from a jurisdictional perspective, from a technical perspective, and it just provides you with lots of optionality to the upside. And so it just made sense to spend that capital. And then as these other projects kind of become available, you just have to weigh all of those different \u2013 all those different things in terms of the risk to completing it or a risk to operating at the optionality and what not. So I think I\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","Exactly.","Richard Adkerson","You got it.","Christopher Mancini","Okay. Okay, thanks a lot, guys.","Richard Adkerson","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Gambardella","Yes, good morning, Richard and Kathleen.","Richard Adkerson","Hey, Mike.","Michael Gambardella","Couple of questions on Grasberg. But first, just congratulations on derisking of the balance sheet now work in the last couple of years has been significant.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Thanks, Mike.","Michael Gambardella","Looking back to the Grasberg, I just wanted to clarify, I think, what I heard you say before. So in terms of your agreement with the government right now, has the government formally agreed at if your stake were to go under 50% that you would still maintain operating control?","Richard Adkerson","Yes. Well, Mike, I want to be clear about this. In some ways, I\u2019d like to just say, we\u2019re working on this and defer comments, but I know, we\u2019re just not in a position to do that. We\u2019re not in a position to do it with people who follow us and our shareholders, and the Indonesian government has to respond to the \u2013 they have to respond to their parliament.","So we all have constituencies that we have to talk about these things when things aren\u2019t finally complete. I\u2019ve tried to use the word understandings, because while we did agree on a framework, we don\u2019t have formal agreements with the government yet. And there are still issues under discussion and we\u2019ve been very clear on our position. We believe we have gained the degree of understanding from the government. But there are different views within the government\u2019s team, the government itself.","So this issue of control is one that\u2019s very important to us just because of the factors that I mentioned earlier, the nature of the project, and the importance of having a disciplined investment in this underground. If you \u2013 without having a disciplined approach to the underground investment, the value of this asset dissipates.","I mean, because this is \u2013 as you know well, Mike, when you\u2019re dealing with these big projects and particularly Block Cave projects, you have to follow a plan and stick to it and deal with the long-term. So that\u2019s one thing that \u2013 the main thing that we\u2019re saying is, we have to be able to sustain that approach to investing and running this business. It is unusual, but not \u2013 but there are other limited cases of where investors own more than 50% of an asset economically and control is transferred to a minority owner. That\u2019s complicated, and all of that hasn\u2019t been worked out yet.","But that \u2013 so I don\u2019t want to say that, we have a formal agreement with the government on that. And again, you\u2019ll see comments on that in the press that talk about that. We are committed to have a very successful partnership with the government, with their state-owned company. We\u2019ve pointed to them what good partners Freeport has been in all of our operations, whether it\u2019s our multi-project partnership with Sumitomo, with our partnership with Lundin that we had in the Congo, with the various partners we have in Cero Verde, with a partnership with Codelco in Chile.","I mean, we do a lot of work with Rio Tinto. We\u2019ve had an excellent partnership with Rio Tinto. And the government really recognizes our operating capabilities and the need to have us to continue. So there\u2019s no question about that. It\u2019s this issue of how we work together in developing corporate policies and capital allocation, financial policy, purchasing policies, environmental, all those things that are so important to success in the operations. So, Mike, that will be part of the final agreement, and that\u2019s where we stand right now and that\u2019s what our position is.","Michael Gambardella","From an economic standpoint, say, let\u2019s just assume, Rio Tinto signs a deal with the government, is your understanding that from an economic perspective aside from smelter, aside from that, is your understanding the economics of your agreement same as they are today there\u2019s no change or is there anything else that would?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve had \u2013 we have had good discussions. We spent time explaining this and so forth. So that the acquisition of Rio Tinto interest would not change our economics. Now, in the framework for reaching the long-term agreement, we have said that, we would agree that the government\u2019s financial benefits from the project will increase. These things may be reshuffled and reorganized in certain ways.","But at the end of day, there would be \u2013 the government will be able to say to the people of Indonesia, they\u2019ve negotiated a larger participation. And that larger participation would come through the fact that we are paying higher royalties than under the cap. And in fact, we\u2019ve already been paying these high royalties since mid-2014.","But the royalties would be, they use the term more than we do, but the royalties would be nailed down. In other words, we\u2019ll agree on the royalties today and that would be the royalties for the remainder of the project. We agree on tax elements now and we made a lot of progress in defining them. We agree on local taxes and fees, all that would be nailed down.","Michael Gambardella","The final question on Grassberg. But the Board, could someone give us the feel for after tax situation. Right now, I thought you [Technical Difficulty] your entity?","Richard Adkerson","No. Well, so Mike, you were fading out. So I don\u2019t cover your question. Come back and ask me to fill in. So the way that our tax situation has been structured, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 FCX is a U.S. company then we operate in these countries where we have mines through entities in those countries. And those entities are subject to taxes and royalties in those countries.","Then, under the previous tax law you would consolidate all of that into a U.S. company and you\u2019d have a consolidated tax calculation, but you would get foreign tax credits for taxes that you pay internationally. And then, and so, and there was limitations on that, there was this alternative minimum tax calculation that would come into play, but then you would calculate a U.S. tax on the base of that consolidated results.","Now to the new tax laws, they\u2019ve gone to a territorial system and so now the, in large part the U.S. taxes will be based on the taxes for the income you generate within the U.S., the U.S. And within the U.S. we have a very large loss carry forward. We also have the benefit of percentage depletion which was left in the law and the AMT was repealed. So, we will have no taxes for as far as you can see in the U.S. We will continue to pay the taxes in these individual countries based on their own tax laws and our stabilization agreements and so forth.","Michael Gambardella","Fine, thank you, Richard.","Richard Adkerson","Did that cover Mike?","Michael Gambardella","Yeah and that covers it, thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Lucas Pipes","Hey good morning everybody and congrats on the progress in Indonesia. I was unfortunately on another call early on, this may have been addressed, but I wanted to touch on it, the net sum, I remember that there were export royalties in place while you were negotiating the new structure in Indonesia and I wondered to what extent is that currently being covered in the negotiations and Kathleen when you gave the $0.50 per pound cost guidance for I think 2022, would that include all of those royalty costs, in case they are even applicable? Thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","Yes, we are paying duties currently, export duties currently and those will face out once the smelter gets to a certain percentage, so post 2022 we have the new smelter completed in that timeframe, all of the concentrates will be treated domestically and there won\u2019t be a need to export concentrates and there will be no duty, but we do have duties in our current guidance for 2018 and 2019.","Lucas Pipes","And could you remind me about approximately what amount per pound those duties are?","Kathleen Quirk","You can see, we are paying roughly on the \u2013 just on the export volumes, we are paying roughly 5% currently and you can see in our \u2013 and I\u2019ll let David to follow up on the exact numbers, but in our operating summary we paid $0.34 and that included royalties and export duties, so it will get you to breakout.","Lucas Pipes","Alright.","Richard Adkerson","Lucas, you may understand this, but just to be clear for everybody, roughly 40% of our production at Grasberg is processed at the PT smelting facility at Gresik that we built in the mid-90s in partnership with Mitsubishi and other Japanese investors. There is no export duty on that. It\u2019s only own exports. And in your question you were talking about royalties and export fees, I mean we do have a royalty that\u2019s assessed on all of the production, it\u2019s unrelated to exports and then there is, we call it an export duty which has been the item of controversy that we\u2019ve had over the last three and half years.","Kathleen Quirk","But the export duty, I guess in those export duty that\u2019s in our numbers or for PT-FI is just under $200 million for 2018.","Lucas Pipes","Very helpful, thank you. And then maybe just to tie up some loose ends, I recall that was a $350 million Cerro Verde royalty dispute, has that been settled, could you give us an update on that?","Kathleen Quirk","There is really no update from our fourth quarter release, I mean from our third quarter release. We are continuing to work with the government officials to \u2013 on a settlement that would waive penalties and interests associated with that dispute and those discussions are ongoing, but there is no updated at this time.","Lucas Pipes","Alright, well, I\u2019ll leave it here. Thank you very much and good luck.","Richard Adkerson","And Lucas that $200 million would reduce our taxable income, so that\u2019s a pre-tax number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Dudas","Thank you very much. Richard, just wanted to follow-up on your thoughts on the transition from the pit to underground, you seemed much more confident about that in de-risking. What are some of the absolutes that you achieved and what are some that we may look for as we look in for the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the first half of 2019 on the progress and the flow?","Richard Adkerson","Alright, so that\u2019s why we added the slide, I think it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve used it. What was the slide number?","Kathleen Quirk","On the milestone?","Richard Adkerson","Yeah, on the milestone.","Kathleen Quirk","Slide 19.","Richard Adkerson","If you look at Slide 19, Mark, do you want to?","Mark Johnson","Yes, a lot of the challenge in the Grasberg block cave, the ore body system as Richard indicated, the rail systems there to be finishing, the conveyors that will, the crusher is already placed. The conveyers would be complete all of the way up to the mill in May, so we\u2019ll have six months there where we\u2019ll be able to just convey development mark, which is significant, we\u2019re mining about 6,000 to 7,000 tons a day right now just in developing drifts. The access to the ore body is extensive in the undercut extraction level we\u2019ve got the service level, the ventilation is in place, so there is \u2013 all the pieces are there, what we are going to start doing in the late fourth quarter is that we\u2019ll start glassing in the undercut.","And then in the beginning of 2019 we\u2019ll start taking draw bells and actually start pulling the material. The cave should develop very quickly, the area in which we\u2019re initially developing the ore body is in a very cave-able portion of the deposit. And at that point when we start that and the pit will be essentially done, there is a little bit of an overlap right now that we\u2019ve reviewed with our consultants, we feel that that can be like a three-month overlap of ongoing pit operations while the block cave, some of this blasting, some of this very \u2013 the initial starting of the block cave can go on without any impacts.","We\u2019ve got a very good plan for managing the water from the pit. We been able to demonstrate that we can get the water out of the pit before the cave starts up. So there is a whole network or there is a whole list of things that we\u2019ve been checking off over the last year and a lot of it\u2019s been really just getting these meters of development. We did over 30 kilometers of development last year, that drops down little bit this year as we get the ore body developed, so we\u2019ll be doing about 2200 meters a month and all of that just is moving along very well.","Kathleen Quirk","And the big deal in 2018 will be the installation of the ore flow and the scale.","Mark Johnson","That\u2019s right, the shaft is commissioned, we were using that for people and so all these projects are all just starting to come together, the big one will be the ore flow system getting that and we\u2019re doing that a little earlier than what we originally planned and it\u2019s just to get the congestion out of the underground, it will be a much more efficient way of getting development muck out and getting men and materials in.","Michael Dudas","Right, that\u2019s very encouraging, thank you for the update and my follow-up Richard is, I think we will on the corner, hoping some day these conference calls will be little less detailed in negotiations with Indonesia et cetera. If something comes together, however comes together and how do you think it\u2019s going to be announced? And what\u2019s the timeframe from, say, if there was \u2013 if it was announced tomorrow, how long it would take to get everything cleaned up and were there certain deadlines, et cetera? How long of a process and how clean of a process you think it will be if you can speculate towards that \u2013 towards the conclusion of this derisking?","Richard Adkerson","Sure. And Michael, you\u2019re talk about milestones. I have two personal milestones, I\u2019ll share with you.","Michael Dudas","Please.","Richard Adkerson","One is, when we start paying dividend \u2013 when Freeport starts paying a dividend again; and two is, when I can take a group of analysts and shareholders back out to Grasberg to see the place. This underground mine, Mike, I can\u2019t tell you if you remember a trip we had a number of years ago out there, but this underground mine is really spectacular. I mean, it is not like anything you would think of as an underground mine. But it\u2019s like a major manufacturing facility to see. And so anyway, I just \u2013 Michael, I just want to say, but okay\u2026","Michael Dudas","Those are great milestones.","Richard Adkerson","Yes. So what \u2013 actually, given the authority that the President has given to these ministers, reach an agreement is the key and documenting of things we\u2019ve already worked on. I mean, we\u2019ve gotten the form of the IUPK, where we\u2019re working on. There\u2019s an attachment. There\u2019s \u2013 coming up with the structure to assure us that it can\u2019t be changed by future laws and regulations.","So there\u2019s not going to be, this is something that the government is authorized to do under current laws. So it will not require changes to their laws or the involvement in the parliament in changing laws. The parliament will be informed and involved from that standpoint. But once the agreement is reached, the process of getting it documented is, it will be straightforward and not time consuming.","Michael Dudas","Excellent. Look forward to those dividends. Thank you, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Novid Rassouli","Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for you first on Indonesia. The ongoing due diligence related to Indonesia potentially purchasing your JV partner share, does that have the ability to potentially delay Freeport\u2019s goal of having an agreement here on the longer-term contract in the first-half of 2018?","Richard Adkerson","No, the timeframe or the first-half, which is \u2013 has really been set more by the government is to allow for that due diligence. So, we had all hoped to have more formal agreements reached by the end of the year. But there was a decision that having the need for this due diligence and that\u2019s why the target of midyear has been put in place to allow for that due diligence.","Novid Rassouli","Got it, make sense. And then my second question, I think, anybody has really talked or asked about the broader copper market. So I\u2019m going to go ahead and do that now. So based on the lack of investments over the past few years, as you highlighted in the past few calls, what do you expect the copper market to reach kind of peak tightness or deficits, I mean, in the coming years before maybe reaching an inflection point? As you said, we\u2019re kind of getting close to that 3.25 that you said is necessary for people that have the incentive to start investing, haven\u2019t really seen anything incredibly material yet. So just wanted to get a sense of how you\u2019re seeing the next two years and when we reach that inflection point? Thanks, Richard.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Well, thank you, Novid. The \u2013 you tell me what global growth is going to be. You tell me what China\u2019s going to be, because my view is the supply side of this subject to the uncertainty about disruptions, which could only be supportive of supply. They\u2019re not going to add supply, but they could take it away, is pretty clear cut at this point. Surprises will be on the negative side. You\u2019re not going to see somebody say in the near-term, we\u2019ve got significant amounts of new production that nobody knew about.","People will work to \u2013 at the margin increase production, but it\u2019s just going to be at the margin. And you know, you look at the long-term projects that are out there, whether they\u2019re \u2013 whether it\u2019s resolution Olympic dam, our big projects that we\u2019re talking about El Abra and others, there\u2019ll be more copper coming out of Africa, I believe, based on our experience there. But that\u2019s going to unfold over a number of years because of the nature of the mineralization and how it has to be mined.","You look at the experience of Oyu Tolgoi, it\u2019s a great resource, great ore body. But the number of years that it\u2019s taken to ramp up and the continuing issues they face with border crossings and power and the government. I mean, that\u2019s just fundamental to all these big projects. So I think, you can your arms around supply outlook relatively easy. And then you plug in your own view about what you think the global economy is going to do.","I just went back to Houston this week to give a luncheon address, not to a mining group, but to a general business group. And of course, it took me back after living in Houston for so long. And back in my earlier career one of my first clients was Mitchell Energy, which kind of kicked off the shale industry in the mid-1980.","In the oil and gas, people were asking me, is there anything like share for the copper business? Because nobody expected the U.S. to bypass Saudi Arabia and Russia and to produce 12 million barrels of oil a day. I mean, back in the 1980\u2019s, we were thinking of importing 75% of the oil production dropping to 4 million barrels.","But the great thing about copper and you take it with a grain of salt, because my feelings on this, which have been the same basically since of I became CEO in 2003 is, its uses are just built into the economy in such a way that it\u2019s really hard to replace for its basic usage, you can do it for plumbing and things like that.","But when you look at the way the world\u2019s going with the electrical \u2013 electronics everybody talks about electric vehicles and that could be a big deal. Alternative energy development could be a big deal. But just how much electronics are increasingly built into our lives, whether it\u2019s communications or control systems, power delivery systems, the development of the world for basic things like refrigerators and air conditioners, maybe I shouldn\u2019t say washing machines.","But in any event, it\u2019s just a commodity, I think, that is so well situated for how cheesed in the economy. And \u2013 but \u2013 so you\u2019re subject to the risk of the economy of China on the global economy. But supply side, there\u2019s no shale copper coming on stream. People are talking about mining in the ocean or on asteroids and things like that. But we should \u2013 we\u2019re just seeing in terms of basic production, the new projects are a major less quality than the old projects were.","They have much lower grades. You have to do a lot more stripping, building infrastructure, getting water, getting power, all of these things make the supply side of copper, I think, extraordinary well supported. I tell people today, we can increase price of copper to $6 a pound overnight, and we have what I just show 300 billion pounds of undeveloped copper resources. We could not bring them on stream to five to 10 years from now, even with $6 copper. So it\u2019s a great commodity and that\u2019s why I like where our company is so on.","Novid Rassouli","Thanks, Richard.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","Operator, are there anymore questions? Hello?","Richard Adkerson","We can\u2019t seem to get to the operator. So I don\u2019t know if everyone else is still on the line, but\u2026","Operator","This is Lucie [ph]. Can you hear me?","Kathleen Quirk","Yes, we can.","Operator","Okay. We had an issue in a call center, I do apologize. Our next question will come from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley.","Piyush Sood","Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thanks for taking the questions. First one, at Grasberg, it seems like total CapEx to be spent over the next five years may have declined to about $900 million to $1 billion. I just wanted to understand if that\u2019s surrounding it, or is there something else over there?","Kathleen Quirk","No, there really wasn\u2019t anything. It was just the time period of five years that we will, incurred last quarter versus this quarter and the way the rounding fell. So no material differences in our plans.","Piyush Sood","All right. And staying with Grasberg, labor relations at Grasberg seem to have improved. So could you comment on maybe worker productivity, how you\u2019re taking care of expectations around employment as you move underground? And when we could expect the new labor contract?","Richard Adkerson","Okay. So we signed a new labor contract in December, that\u2019s for two years, under Indonesian law, we have to do a new one every two years. So we have signed it. Mark make some comment \u2013 I\u2019ll let you make some comments, because you live with this thing.","Mark Johnson","Yes. Well, 2017 was a very dramatic year on the labor. In February, we had 32,000 employees and has combination of employees and contractors. With the export ban, we had some cost reductions, it was kicked off with a 10% employee hurdle program. After we started that program, we had a number of employees that went on an informal strike, it was not a legal strike, it started missing work.","And with the labor laws in Indonesia, they essentially resigned their positions. And that resulted in about 5,000 employees leaving. Recent to that, it\u2019s back about 4,000 contractors, so we went from 32,000 to 24,000. And now we\u2019re back up to around 28,000. The PT-FI component of that is under 8,000 employees now, it was 12,000. The contractors that we hired in have been very cooperative, have been very energetic. We\u2019ve had a very good response.","As kind of a byproduct with the new guy coming in, our PT-FI work forces also picked up the efficiencies and we\u2019re seeing a much improved morale, our safety. With all of that transition, we have the lowest incident rates for our reportable accidents that we\u2019ve ever had since the beginning of the project. So we feel good about the status of our labor force, the composition of contractors and internally employees, and really the effectiveness of our supervisors with under a new \u2013 kind of a new composition of labor.","As Richard said, there was a lot of transition within the labor unions that we\u2019ve dealt with their leader had been removed. He had some legal issues. He\u2019s out of the picture. The new team has come in has worked very closely with us. There\u2019s a second union that we\u2019re dealing with, that was kind of a new component of our negotiations this year, but all of that worked out. We went on a little bit longer. But we didn\u2019t have any threats of strikes. We didn\u2019t have any concerns that the workforce is going to \u2013 have any sort of a walkout.","So during that whole period of negotiation, we didn\u2019t see an interruption in our production, and it allowed us to focus on safety and bringing these guys on and focusing on the project. So we saw some benefits in there, for instance, in the Grasberg pit. Our unit rates went down by about 30% in the fourth quarter to what they\u2019ve been in the first part of the year.","So we\u2019ve seen efficiencies. We\u2019re getting more out of each worker, and that\u2019s also run into on the development side and then into the capital projects. So we feel well-positioned in 2018 with the group that we have.","Richard Adkerson","And for years, we\u2019ve been planning for this transition, because it is new skills, new work requirements and so forth in the underground from the open pit without the drivers for the all trucks and the big electric shovels and so forth. But we\u2019ve been doing that and it\u2019s much more mechanized. So anyway, that\u2019s all progressed very well.","Piyush Sood","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And Kathleen, you did comment on the long-term prospect for Grasberg at about $0.50. But just want to understand as we go into a transition year in 2019, is there kind of a step down coming in your total cost over there or would cost kind of lag \u2013 the decline in total cost lag while maybe production also \u2013 so should we kind of expect cost to go up drastically on a per pound basis or do you have some control around that?","Kathleen Quirk","In terms of absolute cost, we are not anticipating any significant changes on a unit basis, on a metal basis you know it will depend on the volumes and the grades that we\u2019re mining, so in 2019 as we get into a lower year, we will have higher costs than what we had in 2018, but it is still very, very attractive on a unit basis although it\u2019s cost mine in the company. So, as we go forward, we start to improve on the volumes after 2019 and the cost position goes down as a result on a metal basis per unit, but in terms of absolute costs, we are not expecting to have major changes in the absolute total costs of the operations.","Richard Adkerson","You know generally our costs are fixed, there are some things that vary, so when definitely some of that cost going up is unit cost going up, absolute cost we\u2019ll continue to manage to keep as low as we have, but for most part that\u2019s fixed.","Piyush Sood","That\u2019s very helpful, thanks so much for the color.","Richard Adkerson","Alright thank you, so let\u2019s have our last question and appreciate, I think it was, Michael was saying he looks forward to when we don\u2019t have to talk so much and nobody looks more forward to that than me.","Operator","Okay, our final question will come from the line of Karl Blunden with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Karl Blunden","Hey guys thanks for taking the question, all the questions today. I think you had alluded to this a bit in the call, a question back on Grasberg. So it sounds like potentially if the government is looking to get a 51% stake in the asset that Rio\u2019s stake would count towards that, is it clear that you\u2019d be able to I guess get away with a much smaller divestiture than initially thought about?","Richard Adkerson","Well, I would not use the term get away with, you know, but you know if Rio Tinto wants to sell they would reach agreement and they buy, it means that there will be a much lower level of divestment that would come to PT-FI. So the government currently owns 9.36% of \u2013 in effect the long-term 60% interest, so that\u2019s 5% plus. Rio Tinto has 40% and so our remaining divestment obligation would be roughly 10% of PT-FI which would be another net 5% plus, so that\u2019s the way the math would work and it\u2019s all contingent on everybody reaching an agreement on that transaction. That\u2019s the best outcome considering that Rio \u2013 it\u2019s up to Rio Tinto, they have been great partners, so anyway, but then their negotiations are with the government, we\u2019re facilitating them, but they have direct negotiation with the governments, so it would ought to be an elegant outcome.","Karl Blunden","That\u2019s very helpful. And then you mentioned earlier credit ratings momentum certainly been positive, what are the next steps we should look at or what are the gating factors on further upward momentum for you guys when you discuss this with the agencies?","Kathleen Quirk","Well, I think you know if you just look at our credit statistics and our balance sheet and cash flow generations, and really the portfolio of the assets that we have in the company I think our credit metric signals high ratings, but won\u2019t continue to review these with the agencies as we go forward.","Richard Adkerson","Look, we\u2019re focused on getting this Indonesian thing resolved and recognizes and until we do, you know that\u2019s going to be a factor for credit ratings, stock valuation, share valuation and everything, so we know what we need to do and we are focused on getting it done. So, let\u2019s see.","Kathleen Quirk","Are there any more questions? Okay.","Richard Adkerson","Okay listen, thanks for all of you who stuck around to the end of this and we appreciate your interest. If you have follow-up questions contact David Joint, thank you.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available later today on our website.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","Today on the call, we have Jim Bob Moffett, Richard Adkerson, Jim Flores and several other of our senior members of the team in the room here.","I'll just start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who'll review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open the call up for questions.","During the third quarter, we had an active quarter of announcements on revised plans and cost reductions. We've got further announcements in today's press release regarding our Sierrita mine, which Richard will talk more about in his presentation.","Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock $3.8 billion that was $3.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The net loss attributable to common stocks included net charges totaling $3.7 billion, or $3.43 per share, primarily related to the reduction of the carrying values of oil and gas properties.","After adjusting for the net charges, the third quarter 2015 loss attributable to common stock totaled $156 million or $0.15 a share. Our adjusted EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during the third quarter approximated $940 million. We reported total sales of copper during the quarter of 1 billion pounds, gold sales of 294,000 ounces, 23 million pounds of molybdenum, and 13.8 million barrels of oil equivalents.","Our average realized price for copper was $2.38 per pound. That was below last year's third quarter average of $3.12 per pound, and gold prices of $1,117 per ounce or below the year-ago quarter average of $1,220 per ounce. Our oil and gas realized price for crude was $55.88 per barrel that included about $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. That was substantially below last year's average price of $88.58, which included $6.77 of cash losses on derivative contracts. Operating cash flows during the third quarter totaled $822 million and capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.7 billion and consolidated cash of $338 million. We have information in the press release on our progress; on our after-market equity programs, to date, we've raised proceeds of $1.2 billion out of a total announced program of $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position. We had availability under our $4 billion revolver of $3.5 billion and availability under our Cerro Verde credit facility, $1.8 billion credit facility of roughly $300 million.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard who'll be referring to the materials on our website.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. What we're going to talk about here today is what our company is doing to respond to the current weakness in the commodity price market. Almost all of you have heard me talk in the past about how positive the long-term market is for copper. Continue to believe that. But we need to \u2013 we're recognizing the need to prudently manage our self in the short run, and we've taken some really important steps to allow us to do that, so that we can maintain our financial situation and our liquidity and our assets for what we believe is going to be a very positive market for us in our business as we go forward.","We have taken and continue to assess very aggressive steps to control costs, limit capital expenditures. We have, as we will show in a later slide, a very positive view about our free cash flow generation, particularly beginning in 2016 as we get the benefit of the expansion projects, the project at Cerro Verde.","In this quarter, we've had some really positive steps for our company, the things we worked on for a very long period of time. The Cerro Verde start-up is really going well, really proud of our team there, it's coming up very quickly. Our costs are under control. It's good to see where we are as we complete that project.","And then we had an important step, we got a letter from \u2013 of assurances from the Indonesian government about our ability to extend our operations beyond 2021, and a commitment from the government that we'll do so on terms that are consistent with the existing rights on fiscal matters and enforceability matters that's in our existing contract of work. Jim Flores will report on our continuing positive drilling results as we execute our development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.","As Kathleen said, with reluctance, we made a decision to raise some equity for FCX, strengthen our balance sheet, provide insurance against unforeseen potential negative situations, and we've executed that in a very efficient manner.","Just two weeks ago, our board announced that we are undertaking and we're now engaged in a strategic review of alternatives for our oil and gas business. There are some alternatives there, the market is a difficult market, unquestionably right now, but we have an overriding goal of being able to manage that business under these alternatives in a way that funds itself with its cash flows or outside financing.","Copper markets. Copper averaged $2.39 in the third quarter ranging from $2.21 to $2.62. I just returned last week from the LME event in London where we got a full dose of the financial markets' view of the situation in China and the declining growth and outlook for there. Chinese consumption of copper remains significant. Our physical business there, and actually globally, is relatively strong, stronger than the sense you would get by looking at the financial markets' view of the situation. And consumption in China continues to increase, admittedly at a much lower rate.","U.S. and Europe are recovering slowly and certain sections remain positive, in automobiles and construction. But the price volatility, without question, creates short-term demand uncertainty that we're taking into account the way we run our business and manage our financial affairs. Global macroeconomic conditions are weaker than many expected right now. And so, I said, we're being realistic about what we face here. But underlying that in the copper business, the industry continues to be supported by mine supply limitations.","We've announced and we're making a new announcement today about curtailing high-cost production throughout the industry. The companies are limiting CapEx. This is resulting in reductions or deferrals of investments in long-term development of supplies, that's going to be positive for the market as we go forward.","As we go through this time, existing mines continue to decline in grades. We're going to be moving underground at Grasberg and others in the industry. In South America, going to have to convert from open pit operations to underground operations. And some very important ore bodies are still being stymied by environmental concerns, community restrictions or government issues. So, our copper commodity continues to be supported by supply-side situation.","So, let's go over what we're doing as a company to be responsive to the current conditions. We made a 20% reduction in our 2016 consolidated CapEx, and we're continuing to review the CapEx that's currently in our plans for further reductions. In the mining business, as we did in 2008, we've gone through on a mine-by-mine basis to optimize cash flows and consider low prices.","As a result of that, today we are announcing a 50% reduction in our mine rates at our Sierrita mine in Eastern Arizona. This is a mine that goes back to the 19th century. It was a mine that has very low grades of copper, but significant molybdenum byproduct, and we're reducing its rate by 50%. And I'll explain that in a few minutes as to why we're not doing 100%.","But aggregating together with previously-announced cuts, we're cutting our copper, annual copper production by 5% and with other actions we're taking in the molybdenum business, where prices have been very weak recently, we're reducing our molybdenum production by 20%. We reduced mining CapEx by 25%, including 50% reduction in sustaining capital. Our major project CapEx will be dropping off in 2016 as we complete the Cerro Verde project.","We're having a significant reduction in our unit site production delivery cost, 20%; that's going, in 2015, from $1.78 to $1.45 before byproduct credits. The way we've approached this on a mine-by-mine basis, is we had Red Conger and our other members of our team look at each mine, and review their operations with a $2 copper assumption and ensure that we can be cash flow profitable at $2, including sustainable capital. As I mentioned, we're undertaking this review of our oil and gas business.","In our numbers today, we're reflecting a $1.8 billion reduction over 30% of CapEx in 2016 and 2017. We deferred investments in several projects. We included acceleration of production, and this review we're undertaking is going to be focused on an ongoing effort to eliminate the cash flow shortfall that exists between this level of capital spending and our cash flows at low crude oil prices.","So, here's what we've done with our mining operations. In North America, we've taken steps to cut mine rates at the Tyrone SX\/EW operations. We suspended all mining at Miami, where we're engaged in significant reclamation activities, and we reduced mining at Morenci and other North American operations. That aggregates at an annual rate that will come into play over time because it takes time for the reduced placement of material on SX\/EW stacks to affect production, but that will result in about 50 million pounds, and we're talking pounds here, reduction annually. The previously announced reduction in stacking rates at El Abra will result in a 100 million pound reduction in 2016. We've had a 35% reduction in molybdenum production at Henderson through adjusting operations there. And today, with this reduction at Sierrita, that's another 100 million pounds.","We are continuing to look at the possibility of a full shutdown at Sierrita. The barrier for that is we have weigh stacks there that were developed in the 1970s where we have to capture water coming off those weigh stacks, and we use that water in our mill to operate our mill. If we shut our mill down, we have cost issues and operational issues as to what to do with that water because we have to process it. So, we're looking at alternatives to that. In the meantime, we're using the water and operating the mill at a 50% rate.","From costs, we've deferred projects. We reduced our workforce in connection with this cutback. We're aggressively managing capital, operating and administrative costs, and we're keeping our finger on the market and in each of our operations and we're prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes, to keep our operations generating positive cash flows, to protect our liquidity, hold on to these assets for a better day.","Slide seven show what we are looking at going into 2016, which we've been pointing to at some times because it will reflect the benefits of investments that we started to pursue at the end of 2010 as we were coming out of the 2008-2009 crisis to invest in very high-return businesses. We've spent or will spend roughly $7.5 billion at expanding our operations in the DRC at Tenke Fungurume, at the projects that's completed now at Morenci, where we paid significant mill additions and other improvements, and now with completion of the major project of \u2013 at Cerro Verde.","I want to make a couple of points because there's a lot of focus on this. Aggregate capital was $7.5 billion. It was funded out of cash flows plus a $1.8 billion bank line at Cerro Verde. This is going to be repaid over a relatively short period of time. So, it is not a case of us going out and leveraging the company to invest in these funding it out of cash flows, these projects' economics were based with a view of looking at the possibility of the kind of economic environment we have now. They establish a long-term base for future production and they're going to give us increasing volumes in 2016, where we'll go to over 5 billion pounds consolidated a year at what we think based on today's rate will be a net cash operating cost of $1.15 a pound.","You can see that decline in unit net cash cost after byproduct credits, which is roughly at $1.50 level now, going to $1.15 next year. The combined impact of operating cash flows of higher volumes, lower unit costs will be roughly at $2.40 copper of doubling our cash flow from operations next year from $3.3 billion this year to $6.8 billion. At the same time, CapEx will be falling from $6.3 billion to $4 billion. That's roughly half in oil and gas, half in mining. And you can see sustaining capital bonus $600 million a year, and the $2 billion of oil and gas cash flows \u2013 oil and gas CapEx will be under review as part of the process we're now engaged in.","We've had really exceptional execution of these projects at Tenke, Morenci and Cerro Verde. Tenke achieved full operating rates early in 2013, Morenci achieved full rates in mid-2015, and Cerro Verde is ramping up now. It's a major project, it will be the world's largest concentrator facilities, we're basically tripling output there, and full rates are expected to be achieved very early in 2016, and we're moving up on that right now.","You can see some \u2013 a picture of Cerro Verde on slide nine. Notably, we've done this without facing community opposition, as many mining projects are based in Peru. Our team there has done a great job in doing community projects, including providing fresh water to the city of Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru. We're getting water for this project from a waste water collection plant. Previously, that city was just dumping its waste water into the river. Now, it's being modernized to collect waste water, treat it, the ecology of the river is improving, farmers like that and it's getting us a source of water without having to compete with agriculture interests for that. It's a big step for us and it's allowed us to complete this project, to-date, without protest from the local community. In fact, support and accolades from the local community. A little complicated slide on slide 10, but just to show you how quickly we're ramping this up, we've achieved two-thirds of production in a month-and-a-half. We have two major primary crushers. One is operating, the other is commissioning.","We have secondary crushing with eight units. Four are now operating. One is commissioning, three will be commissioned in the fourth quarter. This will use modern, high-pressure grinding roll mills, which we are using there now, and also using as part of our operations in Indonesia. Eight new mills, four are operating, three \u2013 one is being commissioned, three comes on in the fourth quarter. Six modern 40,000 ton per day ball mills, which are coming on-stream quickly in our flotation circuits. This gives you a visual just to see how quickly we're ramping this up. So far, knock on wood, thanks to Red and his team, we're achieving this without hitches, and we're focused on completing it.","Turning to Indonesia with our underground development, this is a major long-term project for us. You can see that the chart at the bottom as we complete mining from the open pit scheduled by the end of 2017, our future operations will be all underground. We have an existing mine called the DOZ, where we block cave, started doing that in the early 1980s. The recent extension of that is starting up \u2013 has started up in the third quarter, it's a deep MLZ mine, with very positive grades of copper and gold.","And then when we complete mining the open pit, we'll be moving to the Grasberg Block Cave mine, which we'll begin ramping up in 2018. Again, this is mine with 1% copper, eight-tenths of gram of gold per ton. This is an exceptional project, exceptional project. To-date, we've spent $3.5 billion of capital on the operations. And as we look forward, PTFI share, this is a joint venture with Rio Tinto with our company's share of these underground projects, we will be spending capital of $800 million a year for the next several years, including power and processing facilities.","And then, as we go forward, as we look in the first 10 years of the life-of-mine average for this underground operation, we will be, to our company's interest, achieving 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold a year. So that's the reason why we're spending this money and working hard to secure our contract rights.","This spending is conditional on getting the approval of the government on acceptable terms for an extension of our contract. And with this new step that we've gotten, which is a quote from the letter that we received earlier this month on page 12, we feel that an important step has been made in getting documentation of these contract rights on a basis that's acceptable to us and to the government.","Jim Bob met with the President in Indonesia and worked with the mine minister in securing this commitment. And it's a very, very important step for us. At the same time, we are progressing with our negotiations with union officials and expect to have our new CLA approved imminently.","Now, looking at our worldwide, large-scale mines, we have a group of mines globally that \u2013 potential of having 1 billion pounds of copper, roughly 500,000 tons of copper a year as we go forward, that's the base for having a company that, when we acquired Phelps Dodge, our goal was to set and make ourselves the premier company in the copper mining industry. And we've done that, and we have the resources to continue to do that.","So, we have the Morenci mine now with the recent expansion and future expansion opportunities. Cerro Verde is being completed. It will operate even though we're curtailing current production. It has an enormous resource that's available for future consideration.","Tenke Fungurume mine is operating well, generating cash, returning capital, has significant growth opportunities. We just had some very positive exploratory drilling intercepts there that are expanding our knowledge of that ore body and giving us opportunities for future growth.","And then the Grasberg mine, I've talked about earlier, with its underground development. We have a really interesting greenfield exploration project in Serbia, where we've had some really significant intercepts, with substantial indicated volumes and high grades, 1% copper grades and gold byproduct.","So, now, we have all these great opportunities to develop mine operations. I want to be clear. After we complete these current projects, until the market warrants further investments, we're not going to be making them. We're going to be planning for them in the future, but as we complete these projects, we're going to realize the benefits of the cash flow, our improved cost situation to delever our company, but underlying all that is an enormous future growth opportunity that will be available to us when the market warrants it.","Before turning off \u2013 handing the ball off to Jim, let's talk about oil and gas business, I want to go back and mention what we did at a board meeting earlier this month roughly two weeks ago. First of all, we reconstituted the FCX board in response to discussions with shareholders broadly. Previously, we had a board with 13 members and independent members and three management members. That was reduced to six independent members and two management members, and then we've added two representatives Carl Icahn, who had a position in our company.","And as we go forward, we're all going to be working together with a common goal of trying \u2013 of working to increase the value of shareholdings in FCX, to increase the value of our share price, to run business in a prudent way, and we're going to be working with our board to get everyone's ideas as to how we do that.","Our objectives with this oil and gas review, which we announced during the time of reconstituting our board is to achieve our original goal that we had when the deal was first announced of achieving self-funding of that business.","Now, current market's challenge for that, no question, given where we were with our operation, and we're going to look at a variety of alternatives to enhance values to the FCX shareholders. What we have is an opportunity to do that because of the quality of our assets in our oil and gas business. These are high-quality assets that have very attractive opportunities for low-risk development growth over time. We have significant existing Deepwater Gulf of Mexico infrastructure that has large excess capacity, which will allow us to do drilling for resources that can be tied back to these facilities and completed and brought on production in a low-cost way.","We have a talented and experienced team lead by Jim, and they know how to do this, and they are committed to doing it. Alternatives will include potential ideas for separating the business. We talked about an IPO. We've gone through the SEC process, and we're positioned to do that if the market provides us that opportunity.","It's a difficult market right now, but that's an opportunity for us. We will look at various alternatives for spin-off. All of these things are challenging in today's market, at the same time, we'll be evaluating other funding alternatives through joint ventures or other transactions.","And in the event there's a time required to get the markets to the point of where we can execute a separation-type transaction, we're going to come up with plans to significantly reducing spending, so that we achieve this goal of self-funding in any circumstance. And I want to make that clear as to what we're doing with this oil and gas review.","So Jim is going to give us a report now of where we stand operationally with the oil and gas business.","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you, Richard. On page 15, we have our third quarter 2015 highlights. You can see where 61% of our sales were in the Gulf of Mexico. It continues to be our most important asset area, while California continues to be a strong steady producer, and the rest is our gas business, onshore in Haynesville and Highlander area.","We had EBITDA of about $0.3 billion for the third quarter, trailing 12 months of $1.3 billion. We had \u2013 continue to have positive drilling results in the Gulf of Mexico and derisking our business plan. The Horn Mountain Deep well and the King well, we announced two wells with tremendous reservoirs and producibility. And we continue to deal with the success we have in our development drilling as we try to manage costs and manage our CapEx. At the same point in time, we did not plan for 100% success in our development activities at these fields.","And what I mean by that is the 100% success requires us to complete wells after drilling and so forth that we do not plan to capitalize. So, it becomes very much an orchestra of cutting and deferring projects at the same point in time continue to execute our business plan to create value long term for our company, but also be in a situation of be able to provide an excellent production profile and add value on a daily basis of production in 2016 going forward.","What I mean by that is because of the positive drilling results in the Deepwater is our oil production. Crude oil production 2015 to 2016 is going to increase by 25% with our CapEx of $1.8 billion in 2016. That 25% increase, we'll be able to kept flat going forward for 2017 on, in a $45 oil market, at a $1 billion of spending and \u2013 of CapEx. So, that's flat from 2016 through 2017 on, at a $1 billion of spending in 2017 after spending $1.8 billion in 2016, and increasing production by 25%.","Our business would be very \u2013 the cost will be variable from 2017 on as we have drilling rig contracts and service contracts and commitments rolling off that have already been committed to and execution in our production increase, much like finishing a large mining project in 2016. So, our ability to ratchet capital up or down in 2017 going forward, remains maximum flexibility. The $1 billion of CapEx in 2017, I mentioned, is a 65% decrease from capital in 2015 at the peak of our spending and ramping up in the Gulf of Mexico.","The field developments in Heidelberg and Holstein Deep, first production anticipated in mid-2016 continue to stay on track. Excellent execution by our operator, Anadarko, Heidelberg and, of course, we're 100% on project at Holstein Deep.","The announced CapEx reductions that Richard talked about in 2016, 2017 continue to expand, by deferring projects and right-sizing our business for a $45 long-term oil market. Again, that is not a forecast. It's just the way we're going to gauge our business and we certainly hope oil prices are higher than $45, where our shareholders can reap the profits. They've certainly taken the pain for the last 18 months with the severe decline going down. We suspect the substantial oil volumes and the 25% increase in 2016, and cash margins in the near term going forward as we control our spending.","On page 16 is a familiar slide of our assets. We continue to expand all the production here, and this is where our high-margin barrels. And it costs us about $20 a barrel to drill and hook up our wells to these facilities, which is about 25% the cost of a newbuild project, when you have to put all these facility costs ahead of it. So with a $20 a barrel cost of hooking up the production, less a $12 a barrel LOE cost in the Gulf of Mexico currently, and $3 or $4 of G&A and interest and so forth, we're talking about a full-cycle business with a cost between $36 and $38 a barrel, which makes a profit in the $45 barrel realm.","So, it's a highly-profitable business and it's the best place for us to spend our capital. The Deepwater Gulf of Mexico focus map on page 17 refreshes everybody's memories of where our assets are. You'll see the red, Power Nap discovery we discussed, which is going in with the operator, and we're working with regulators to figure out what our development plan will be there over the long term.","A key slide on page 18, where we have production that's coming on in our 100% owned wells in 2015, 2016 and 2017. You can see 2016 is a very active year. The Kilo\/Oscar, Qu\u00e9bec\/Victory KQOV, that is not named after Kathleen Quirk, but it does \u2013 because it's a prolific area. And Holstein Deep 1, 2 and 3 and our Heidelberg wells, that's our significant oil production increase.","And then in 2017, interestingly enough, we can put on Horn Mountain Deep, Horn Mountain Updip, King D-3 (sic) [D-13] (34:31) and King D-9, but under the $1 billion CapEx scenario, we'll only put on one of these areas, and we'll roll one of the areas in 2018. You can start to see the flavor of the operations and flexibility and keeping production steady, managing our capital and continue to provide returns back [ph] to our stockholders (34:40).","Richard, I'll turn it over to you for the outlook. How's that?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's great, Jim. Thanks. Our current outlook for sales for 2015 is $4.1 billion. That's briefly $100 million lower than our previous outlook. Most of that comes from Indonesia, where we're being affected by this very significant El Ni\u00f1o event. And, ironically, in an area where rainfall ranges from 200 inches to 400 inches a year, we have water constraints because of El Ni\u00f1o. This happened to us in 1997-1998, but it's limiting how much material we can run through our mill. We have been taking exceptional steps of getting water there, including trucking water up the mountain. You guys have been there before. So, this is an effect. Our production cuts really come in over time because of the way that adjustments to SX\/EW operations work, they will be more in place for 2016.","Our goal is down 100,000 ounces. Again, this is because of Grasberg. The \u2013 I mentioned the operating cash flow numbers from the previous time. Each $0.10 change in copper price for the fourth quarter means $110 million for us. And we've previously mentioned the unit cost and capital expenditure changes which \u2013 CapEx changes to date represent no changes from what we disclosed in July with the oil and gas CapEx under review.","Sales profile by year is shown on page 20. You can see impact in 2016 of the completion of Cerro Verde, but also the access to very high-grade ore at the bottom of the Grasberg pit, as we complete mining there. This is something we've been talking about since we started developing Grasberg in the early 1990s, at an operation where we once \u2013 where mine rates were 750,000 tons a day. We're going to be dropping to 200,000 tons in 2016 and down to 100,000 tons, 150,000 tons in 2017 with no stripping. There'll be no stripping virtually of those years, and we'll just have access to this very high-grade ore. So, it'll be a very profitable operation. And you can see the impact of that on our gold production in 2016, 2017.","Our quarterly sales profile is presented in the reference slides. Also, the longer-term outlook for Grasberg beyond mining in the pit is shown in the reference slides.","So, slide 21. You can see how our 2015 production breaks down by region and how our cost structure would be for this year, where we are very consistent with previous guidance of having consolidated net cash cost after our product credits in the $1.50 range and dropping down to $1.15 next year under current commodity price environment.","Our EBITDA and cash flow opportunities are presented at various copper prices on slide 22. This is an average for 2016, 2017 and excludes working capital changes. But it shows how it varies going from copper prices at $2.25 to $3.25. And at the lower end of the prices, we'd have operating cash flows after taxes and interest of $5.25 billion. And that would rise to over $7 billion at $2.75, to show you how leveraged we are to prices.","We present a sensitivity chart that we present quarter for your use and looking at how to adjust that for commodity prices and certain cost elements. And our capital expenditures are shown on page 24, where we're going from CapEx in 2014 at $7 billion plus to $6 billion plus this year, and dropping the $4 billion plus with oil and gas CapEx under review at this time. And I want to just comment on this at the market. Equity offering, as I said, we took this step reluctantly. None of us like raising equity in this kind of marketplace, but we concluded it was prudent as a further step to protect our liquidity and our balance sheet now. We found this to be an efficient way to raise capital without having to go to market and face the pressures that come about from a marketed deal and the pricing implications of that.","We did this in the first quarter of 2009, and now we've executed a $1 billion range in the third quarter where we raised capital at higher than market prices. We have a second $1 billion program approved by our board. Had to back out the market, as we got close to earnings release. But to date, we raised $200 million on that, since the initial offering, for what it's worth, and you know with the movement of our companies and other commodity prices during the calendar year this year. But we significantly outperformed other companies since announcing the first ATM offering.","As I said, it gives us advantage of deciding when we want to place the shares in the market. We do it at significantly lower commissions and costs than you would have in a traditional follow-on offering. And it allows us to price share issuances in appropriate days in the marketplace when there's demand for the shares and gives us the flexibility of execution.","We are committed to debt reduction, challenged by commodity prices, but we recognize the need to do this. We have a large resource base and strong cash flows. And with capital discipline, we have the ability to do this over time. We will be generating cash with increasing volumes, declining CapEx. This will enhance our credit metrics. To date, the credit rating agencies have supported our investment-grade rating, that's challenged by commodity prices, but we're taking steps that we believe will be positive in supporting that. And as we move forward, this situation will be improved.","We work hard to maintain available liquidity under our bank credit facilities. We have a $4 billion corporate facility at FCX, and $3.5 billion of that is currently available. We have a $1.8 billion facility at Cerro Verde, which is being used to fund that expansion. We have $300 million left on it. And we have, because of our past financing, an attractive average interest cost of 3.7%. Small maturities for the next couple of years, and we'll be looking for opportunities to deal with our balance sheet as we go forward.","So, with our long-lived reserves, our really strong production base, this great portfolio of undeveloped resources across our businesses globally, and with the great team of workers and management we have, we are up to dealing with these issues and working hard to create long-term values for our shareholders.","Thank you for your interest. And now, we are prepared to respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Kathleen and everybody. My question is actually for Kathleen. Could you talk a bit about what the stance is of the credit agencies toward the current commodity environment and obviously, everyone can appreciate your current leverage level. But have you received any kind of language from them that they're starting to get concerned about the protracted nature of your net debt balance?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, Jorge, I think you can see the press releases that both S&P and Moody's made during the quarter. They have \u2013 their commodities team have updated their outlook for commodities across the board including copper. And they undertook a review of Freeport during the quarter that both agencies affirmed our ratings and we did go to it from a stable outlook to negative.","We've been in close contact with S&P, Moody's and Fitch really to walk them through our plans for debt reduction, show them how we get there with our organic business in terms of rising volumes, lower costs and lower CapEx.","And so, the expectation is that as we get through 2016, our credit metrics will improve significantly and be within their parameters for our rating. And we're very focused on executing those plans so that our outlook can be moved back to stable. And that's really what they have been looking at in terms of our plans. But they've been running numbers at different commodity prices. Like I said, we've been in close communication. But they do see 2015, as we have signaled all year, as a bridge year, getting to this higher cash flow and free cash flow more importantly in 2016 and 2017.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Jorge.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Richard. I think without question, they're giving us credit for what we did in deleveraging after the Phelps Dodge deal and how we managed the crisis in 2008-2009. So, they are looking at what we say we're going to do. Now, it's on us as a management team to show that same degree of discipline in executing our plans as we go forward.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And sorry, just maybe a technical question. I'm not sure Kathleen or Jim would answer this. But what oil price assumption are you guys using to determine the carrying value of your oil assets, which obviously took another write-down this quarter? But where are we just as a jumping off point if we had to do a further mark-to-market? What are you kind of using as your baseline for oil at this point?","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Jorge, we're required to use SEC price deck which is a trailing 12 month average. If you use the forward curve, forward curve is actually lower by a few dollars than the SEC price deck. So, you'll see us continue. If oil prices continue to stay in the $40, $45 range, the $50 range, you'll see, in the fourth quarter, you'll see a slight reduction there. But all depends if oil prices stay steady or go up or erode going forward. But we're kind of at \u2013 we're at that apex point where we may not totally be there just because of the oil price in the fourth quarter. So far, here in October, has been a few dollars below the SEC price, average price for the last 12 months that we used for that reporting purposes.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Jorge, we used the realized prices in each region we have, but they are referenced off a WTI price of $59 a barrel at the end of the third quarter. So, that's not the exact price we use because we adjust it for what oil is selling for in California and offshore. But the reference price, the WTI price, and we don't have a choice on this. This is the \u2013 these unfortunate SEC rules that require us to use this trailing-12 month average and it was $59 WTI for the third quarter.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. But it sounds like, as you're saying, you're basically cycling that out by the fourth quarter.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that all depends. It won't all cycle out because in the fourth quarter we'll use the four quarters in 2015, and in the first quarter, the price was $70 something. So, it takes time for this to cycle through using the 12-month average, that's why I call these rules unfortunate.","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","But at the fourth quarter, we're getting through the \u2013 we're getting through a lower average price and if you have a $55 oil price in 2016, for example, we'll be kind of there, versus if it's $45 price in 2016, there'll be some more for reevaluation ahead. Does that kind of help you?","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. First question is just on Indonesia. It sounded like the government would make \u2013 maybe seeking a little bit higher royalties. Can you speak to that?","And then, on the guidance that's built in there for next year, how much of a wage increase is reflected in those numbers?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brian. We agreed last year when we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government that allowed us to go forward with restoring exports at the time and also set the stage for further discussions with the government leading to this recent letter. At that point, we agreed to increase the royalties that were in our contract of work to the royalties that were specified in the 2009 mining law.","That was a concession we made to meet the government's aspirations. And so, in our discussions with the government now, those are the royalty rates that would be reflected in our extending contract going forward. And they would be fixed. They wouldn't be subject to further changes.","So the \u2013 like we see here in the United States with this presidential campaign, there'll be a lot of comments politically coming out of Indonesia. But that's the facts of where we are with our royalties and with this recent understanding with the government about how we'll go forward.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And Brian, the second part of your question regarding the wages. We have made assumptions on what we expect the wage negotiations to be concluded at. But it wouldn't be appropriate for us to give that at this point because we're still finalizing those negotiations. But the numbers that you're looking at includes what we expect the results to be in our ongoing discussions, which we're progressing as we speak.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. That's helpful. Maybe the second question is just on the oil and gas with your plans, either a partial IPO or a spin-off, is there a cash dollar amount that we can think about that you would put into those assets under either of those scenarios?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's really what we're reviewing now. So \u2013 and again that depends on alternatives and marketplace and our view of \u2013 we're going to have a view of how to make sure whatever we do is supportive of FCX's financial condition and financial position. At the same time, if we do have a separation, we have to separate the business in a way of where it's sustainable on its own and can trade well. And so that's the trade-offs we're going. But Brian, it's \u2013 again, that's subject to this review and we'll be pursuing this aggressively. And further information will come out as we \u2013 as our board reaches decisions on it.","Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Definitely appreciate that. All right. Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my questions. I did want to drill in a little bit more on Indonesia. Just the commentary in the press release regarding the longer term, the underground development and potentially pushing some of that out, I was wondering, first of all, if you could give us a bit more color on the thought process there, the timing associated with more visibility on potentially deferring some of that CapEx and when we should hear more definitive commentary.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, the numbers you see today actually reflect some of the work that we're doing about adjusting our longer-term mine plans. Previously, the annual spending on a gross basis for the joint venture was a $1 billion. We've now \u2013 annually, average. We've now reduced that to $800 million. And part of that has to do with how we mine and ultimately process ore that contain pyrites. And that includes some of the Grasberg Block Cave ore. And that would in the longer range affect how we do with the Kucing Liar ore body.","But altering the mine plans to avoid the bulk of this pyrite ore, we can defer capital spending on the processing facilities and the transport and storage facilities for pyrite. We're developing plans to do that with \u2013 so that we don't end up wasting significant amounts of ore. So, it's a timing opportunity that would allow us to then go back and make those investments in mining and processing that ore in the future, and we're continuing to do that. But that's the major factor, Dave, along the lines of what you're talking about. That's how we're dealing with the long-term mine plans at Grasberg.","David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then just separately on the strategic review of the energy business, the alternatives for the energy business, I'm wondering if you could give us a feeling for timing, when we should get more visibility on that front as well.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we reconstituted our board two weeks ago. We announced this review. We're starting the process now of coming up with alternatives and how to evaluate it. We need \u2013 there is a degree of urgency in dealing with these capital cost. So I'm not in a position right now giving you any red line time dates, but I can tell you, it's a matter of focus, and we are approaching this immediately.","David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is it reasonable to say within the next, say six months, we'll get something or is it longer?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Within that timeframe.","David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you very much. Good morning, all.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Good morning.","Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC","I've got a couple of questions here. First one is on Indonesia. It does sounds encouraging that the process is moving forward. Now, assuming you get resolution on the extension of the COW, how can you assure investors that you'll be able to get a fair value with the additional 20% stake in PTFI? There seem to be conflicting reports about the ability to do an IPO, and I was wondering and associated, is that now off the table?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Tony. It's not off the table. Throughout this whole process, our position has been and now the government supports it, it was in the MOU in mid-2014, it's reflected in what the letter says, is that any divestment would be on the basis of fair value. And exactly how we divest depends on how we work with the government on it. The government, the central government itself will have the opportunity to acquire shares, they've had that opportunity in the past and haven't elected to do it, but we will work with them on it. The possibility of sales to stay-on companies is there. The possibility of an IPO is something we've done work on, and we can see some benefits to that to be traded on the Indonesia Exchange. Government officials would \u2013 some government officials are very supportive of that.","So, all of this process is, again, conditional on getting the final documentation of the extension, and then we're prepared immediately at that point to go forward in working with the government as to exactly how to do that. But the IPO is certainly one of the alternatives that we'll be talking with them about.","Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And then I got a question also on oil and gas. And of the $2 billion CapEx, how much is purely sustaining and how much of that number is required to develop and kind of reload inventory with prospects?","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","All right. Tony, look at this way. About $750 million will keep production flat in the Gulf of Mexico and California. So, you're really talking about $2 billion is forecasted and I might have mentioned today that we're trying to work \u2013 continue to work with that number. Everything above that would be toward the growth CapEx (58:11) 25% increases.","Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay.","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And going forward \u2013 going forward to 2017, that's kind of $750 million to $1 billion. That's why at $45 and even lower, we can continue to be cash flow neutral once we have this production on, and just defend it by putting on one or two wells a year. When you have 13 good discoveries in your inventory, it's pretty easy to see the visibility there.","Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And just \u2013 I'm curious what do you think is the most preferable outcome? I mean, a complete spin-off to existing shareholders or what the \u2013 obviously, it's a matter of debt allocation and a lot of other factors. But I'm just curious as to management's thinking.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Tony, that's something that's going to be a board decision. And so, for us to come out now and say \u2013 we're going to have lots of ideas. The ideas are going to be considered and assessed in terms of creating value for the FCX shareholders. And that's going to be a board deliberation. And all of us have ideas. And we'll present those ideas, do analysis on them. We'll have expert advice on the markets and what's best. And that \u2013 then the decision is going to come out. It wouldn't be appropriate at all for us to start speculating on where that's going to go.","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Tony, where Rich highlighted the board reconstruction, I resigned from the board and so forth. That's so we wanted to give the board maximum flexibility to have as far as separating the oil and gas business if that makes sense. Their advisors advise them and so forth of where the highest and best value of FCX is. That's the path forward. But they have maximum flexibility. There's no sacred path or no prohibited path at this point. So, that's the value for the FCX shareholders, that's the number one goal here.","Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And just \u2013 thanks for that color. And just a quick one on Sierrita. And I was wondering if the evaluation you're doing now points to a full shut-down there, what impact might this have on your overall unit cash costs?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Sierrita is \u2013 at these \u2013 it's really such an interesting mine because it's got low grades and big moly content. You don't have to look back many years ago to where it was our lowest cost mine. And now it's our highest cost mine. So, at current levels, unit cost are $1.90 roughly. And so that's why we cut it back and if we could cut it back totally, we're dealing with this water management issue, we would do it. But it's not big enough to have a material impact on our consolidated costs. But it's our highest cost mine or among our highest cost mines, it's the one obviously that deserves the cutback attention.","Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC","Good to see the discipline. Thanks very much. Appreciate the color.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.","Jeremy R. Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets","Yeah. Hello and thanks for taking my question. You spoke, obviously, quite a bit about some of the oil and gas initiatives that you are reviewing. But I'm just curious on the copper side. Outside of some of the production potential curtailments that you're looking at, if you consider something either small or even large on the asset sale side, and I guess the context is copper does seem to still be the one commodity that the majors, or at least one of the commodities, I guess, that some of the majors are looking to expand upon. Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Jeremy. Listen, we have an open mind on how we approach things. We have a constant flow of people coming to us with ideas, both companies, bankers, some of the private equity funds. So, we get opportunities to consider a lot of things. If you look at the majors, though, there's a consistent positive view of the longer-term copper market. And so, the better assets in that market are owned by the larger companies, and so, that's what is really a barrier for doing major transactions.","But, listen, we are \u2013 as I said, I was in London last week, saw a lot of people, had a lot of discussions, a lot of people want to meet, present ideas and we're open-minded, we're going to listen to the ideas.","Jeremy R. Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets","That's great. Thanks very much for taking my question.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you very much for all the decisions you've made in the last 90 days for the shareholders and progress since your last call. It's just been spectacular. First question, if you sell down from 90% to 70% in Indonesia, would you be required \u2013 would Freeport be required to fund the entire $800 million average full-year CapEx budget, or would the buyer be required to pay its share? First question.","Second question, if I may, have any of your commodity long-term price expectations changed in the last year or two as everything has fallen in price? It's notable that a week or two ago, Toyota said that by 2015, they'll stop making gasoline engines.","In New Jersey, there is a 3,400 megawatt, 100 mile long wind farm that federal government auctioned without asking New Jersey. West Texas is one company putting up 400,000 solar panels and Fort Stockton and I guess there're several others coming after them. And all these investments are being made not on the basis of price as they affect the energy market. It can create some doubts in our minds once in a while. Please we \u2013 we want to thank you for all the good decisions.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, John for your comment about steps we've taken. With regard to your first question, the divestment we're talking about is a divestment of shares, common stock in PTFI. And so, whereas now, we own 90% plus. The government has a 9.36% interest. After we go through this process of divestment, which will occur after we get the documentation of our contract extension, we would own 70%, but it's a share investment. And all of these PTFI funding of CapEx is coming out of its cash flows. So, we don't contemplate any of the shareholders being FCX or the new shareholders having any requirements to make capital investments in the company. So, it would come out of cash flows.","Then with respect to this future of the energy business, I'll make one side comment. Everything you talked about from electric cars to alternative energy investments requires substantial amounts of copper. And so, that's going to be the demand factor for future \u2013 the future of the copper business and all of these issues related to the future of energy and the future of climate change and so forth are \u2013 is an unfolding story still to be played out for the foreseeable future. The world's going to require substantial volumes of oil and gas to run these economies and maintain standards of living.","James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President\/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","John, as long as Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP are in oil business, I'm going to be in the oil business. So, that's the way I look at it.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question on the dividend. How are you thinking about paying the dividend now, especially considering that you're issuing stock and it would seem that you're free cash flow negative, at least in the current point in time? So, is there a potential for that dividend to be cut back. And second thing is in terms of the equity raises, how much more do you think you would need to raise to have an appropriate buffer for whatever might transpire in the commodities market, again, given that it seems like next year with the high grades at Grasberg in 2017, you'll be pretty significantly free cash flow positive?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good question. This dividend issue, we made a decision to substantially reduce the dividend earlier this year. We maintained a relatively small dividend because certain institutions have dividend requirements. The board's going to continue to review that. And we'll continue to look at.","With respect to equity raises, the board's approved this $2 billion raise. We're going to have our finger on the market with the factors that you mentioned. I believe it will, absent some further changes in our free cash flow generation, it's the cash flow coming in, in 2016. This appears to be sufficient to provide the kind of buffer that we need.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli","Okay. And just a quick question. I know other people kind of asked this, but on the oil and gas business, there are $2.5 billion of oil and gas senior notes. Would it be reasonable to assume that that would be the only amount of debt that the oil and gas business would be able to sustain if it were to be spun off? Or could it potentially take on more debt?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's a valuation we're doing. It's not related to the source of the debt at all. I mean, that's just the legacy issue that came to our consolidated company when the acquisition was made. So, we're evaluating it more broadly from a financial perspective as to what would be sustainable for the entity that was separated if, in fact, we go a separation route. But it's not tied to any specific issue.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And Chris, just as a reminder, the FCX parent guarantees that debt.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli","Okay.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So, that guarantee doesn't go away.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli","Okay. Okay. So, it's just a big picture valuation determination as to how much debt the oil and gas business will be able to take on?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli","Right. Okay. I understand. Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Good morning. I just want to go back to Dave's question on the longer-term situation at Grasberg because you talked about deferring the pyrite ore and stuff. But when I look at the 2018 through 2022 stuff, it all looks like the same guidance. Are you just pushing stuff post-2022 back by deferring this capital, i.e. the KL gets pushed back from 2025 or what exactly is happening there? Because you've obviously been able to save some money up front, but without any change to production in the next five years.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, and that's why it's attractive. That's why it's attractive, Brian. KL is scheduled to come on later. It is much later than that. So the real issue about production is, with the Grasberg Block Cave, and near-term production isn't really affected in any significant way by this deferral of capital, and that would come into play, basically, post-2020.","But it's the Grasberg Block Cave production as opposed to the KL production. I mean what we're doing is, as we come out of the pit and start mining the Block Cave, we ramp up to get back to a mill operation of 250,000 tons a day after the ramp-up, which will require several years. And then we have \u2013 the great thing about this operation is that we have the ore to feed a 250,000 ton per day mill through 2041.","Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Right. So are there any secondary benefits by pushing this pyrite ore? Like when you build the new smelter or whatever, does it allow you to put you throughput better there? So you get another benefit there, as well?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, and it also potentially gives us the opportunity to kind of stage the smelter investment at a smaller level to begin with, which saves some capital, and this is desirable, and then deal with it later on, as we ramp back into the pyrite. So there's benefit on CapEx standpoint, both at the mine and mill operations in Papua, as well as capital required for the smelter.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","But Brian, all of this is still being looked at and optimized as we go through it. So what you're looking at is our most recent thinking, but we're continuing to look at it, and continue to look at how we smooth out, concentrate production, so we don't have big spikes, and have enough smelter capacity to be able to deal with it. So, it's a work in progress, but what you're seeing is what our current thinking is.","Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And maybe just one question on the oil and gas. You talked about the 25% increase in oil from, I assume, Gulf of Mexico. But what's happening at California next? It looks like it's coming down in the third quarter. Capital there is pretty small. Is it actually on a decline the next three years? Or should we think it bottoms out and flat or how should I think about the reinvestment on that part of the equation?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've cut reinvestment from $300 million two years ago to $70 million this current year. Probably need to get closer to $125 million, $150 million, to keep production completely flat at this point in time, Brian. So what happens with the thermal reservoirs out there, as you've been heating them for years and years, you can cut capital for about 24 months before they start kind of cooling. And as they start cooling, the oil gets more viscous, and the production rate slows. We're all talking about small, small increments here.","So we'll need to start reinvesting there, probably in late 2016, early 2017, and then it flattens out. The one production adjustment that you're seeing is in our offshore business, where we have our (74:06) platform, which is our highest cost production. It's shut in, and it's shut in indefinitely, due to the plains all American pipeline situation, where the pipeline ruptured and they're shut in due to repair work. And that forecast is in years, so we're not sure that production will be restored. So I think the new production level that you see currently is pretty good for 2016 and going forward.","Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Great. And I should just use about $100 million in capital in California for the next two years, then?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's probably good average at this point.","Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Now, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard C.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Red Conger is here, Mark Johnson is on the line, Mike Kendrick is here as well. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of 692 million for the first quarter of 2018 or $0.47 per share. That included net credits of 13 million or $0.01 per share in the first quarter. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation for the first quarter of 2018 totaled 1.93 billion. There is a reconciliation of the EBITDA in the back of our slide deck on slide 27. ","As summarized on page, Roman numeral 7 of the press release, our EBITDA was reduced by 135 million in the first quarter associated with the impact of the decline in copper prices during the period from $3.28 at the start of the year to $3.04 per pound at the end of the first quarter. The adjustment relates to sales that were provisionally priced at year end that were marked to actuals during the first quarter and sales that were open at the end of the first quarter and those were marked at $3.04, which was the forward price at the time of our quarter end. Our provisionally priced sales are mark to market until final settlements occur.","Our copper sales during the quarter were 993 million pounds, gold sales were 610,000 ounces and we sold 24 million pounds of molybdenum. Gold sales were above the year ago quarter by a significant margin, but we're about 10% below our guidance of 675,000 ounces because of maintenance on the ore flow systems in Indonesia. Our first quarter 2018 average realized copper price was $3.11 that was above the year ago quarter average of $2.67 and gold prices averaged 1,312 per ounce in the first quarter of 2018. That was also higher than the $1,229 per ounce level in the first quarter of 2017.","Our unit cash cost, net of byproduct credits, for our consolidated operations, averaged $0.98 per pound in the first quarter of 2018. We generated strong cash flows above our capital expenditures. Our cash flows from operations in the first quarter totaled 1.4 billion and that exceeded our capital expenditures of 400 million. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet. During the first quarter, we repaid borrowings totaling 1.5 billion and in April, in the second quarter in April 2018, we repaid 454 million in debt associated with the early redemption of higher coupon notes. ","We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of 3.7 billion and our consolidated debt totaled 11.6 billion. So, our debt, net of cash, was below $8 billion at quarter end. We had no borrowings and 3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. We reported earlier this week that we have entered into a new $3.5 billion five year revolving credit facility to replace the existing facility, which was scheduled to mature in May of 2019. ","We\u2019re pleased with the outcome of the new arrangement, which is substantially similar in structure in terms to the prior facility. Also during the quarter, our board of directors reinstated a cash dividend on our common stock, which we\u2019ll talk more about financial policy, but the first quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share will be paid -- has been declared and will be paid on May 1. ","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be commenting on our slide presentation, which is located on our website.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, everyone. Refer to slide 3. Today, we're actually mailing out our annual report for 2017. You see a picture on the cover and some comments that are summary comments from the annual report. It reflects our leadership position in the copper industry. We operate \u2013 we\u2019re the largest operator of copper mines in the world. We operate all the mines that we have interest in. We have a set of high quality assets that would be very difficult to replicate in today's world and a very experienced team of mine developers and operators that are well respected and have had great success in developing and operating mines and our company has a focused strategy as we go forward.","With respect to financial policy, on the next slide, we have a balanced approach. Over the past two years, we've been very successful in taking our debt down from unsustainable levels to below our targeted levels actually. And as we look forward, we will be generating substantial cash flows in excess of our capital spending and we will use those cash flows to further reduce debt. We're assessing future investments and we have a number of alternatives that we are pursuing and we\u2019ll move forward with in a disciplined way and we started paying a dividend now and so we're focused on returning cash to shareholders over time. We'll continue to delever. We will invest in a disciplined way. We will look to increase the dividend either as regular dividends or as special dividends, we go forward in the future.","In the first quarter, we maintained our focus on productivity cost management, cash discipline and as Kathleen said, our operating cash flows exceeded our CapEx by about $1 billion. Our unit net cash costs were below $1, significantly lower than the year ago quarter. We repaid $2 billion of debt and our net debt is below $8 billion and we're working hard to advance planning for our development activities.","Copper markets, every quarter, I get a one page report from our marketing team about copper markets and I'm just going to read the headlines of the report I received yesterday. Copper demand steady after a quiet spot market in the US, positive sentiment in China, European cathode consumption, improving as scrap is driving up, Japanese copper sectors are positive. That tells the story about where we are and today Steve Higgins sent me a note saying that we're getting a great start off into the second quarter. We supply about 40% or so of the copper used downstream in the US market from our mines in the US. ","And right now, we're actually having to purchase cathode in the marketplace to meet the demands of our customers. The long term fundamentals for copper are increasingly strong, was down at Cisco and that was a common theme, you hear from everyone. Deficits appear inevitable, absent turmoil and downturn. In China, the global economic situation and with the low carbon environment is very positive for copper with electric vehicles and alternative energy generation. We have significant leverage to copper prices and we're positioned to take strong advantage of this.","In Indonesia, you're aware that in 2017, we reached a framework for our long term resolution to provide that stability. And that\u2019s our key to have stability through 2041, the term of our existing contract with fiscal terms and legal terms that would be stabilized and not subject to future changes. We made continued progress. We have motivated parties to this on our side, on the government side. I met with the finance minister in Washington next week where she was there for the -- in Washington last week where she was there for the World Bank meetings and did a presentation and she reaffirmed the government -- the president's objective of getting this resolved and was optimistic about it. ","We're working to complete negotiations and the required documentation as quickly as possible. Where we stand now, the government is in negotiations with our joint venture partner about the potential acquisition of that joint venture interest. That would be very positive for us where negotiation of shareholders' agreement to deal with the issue of managing the business, it's important for us that we continue to have control over the way the business is managed and its financial policy. We're working on the form of the stability agreement. Both parties recognize the objective of stability and we need to have this in a form that is satisfactory. ","And we're dealing with some new environmental claims that have come out of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. These were really shocking and disappointing to us and they don't really deal with the technicalities of environmental management, but the new position really expresses a fundamental view about the way the tailing system is managed. Back in the 1990s, in a transparent and comprehensive process, we, our joint venture partner and the government reached a conclusion to deal with the real complicated challenges of managing tailings at the Grasberg with its high elevation, high ranged ball and extraordinary large volumes. ","We all agreed at that time that we would use a river system that was designated to transport the tailings [indiscernible] and the tailings would be a positive out there, positive there with a portion going ultimately into the Air Force C. That was concluded to be the best system then. We\u2019ve now operated it for 20 years. The good news is it has operated as it was designed with no unanticipated, with no unanticipated impacts. Our tailings fortunately have chemistry that makes them benign. There have been no human health issues or impacts on the environment that wasn't anticipated. ","It was always controversial, but it was a decision that was basically said, are you going to develop this mine in this location or not. And it was agreed to, we followed it, we're going to work with the government. In a complicated system like this, there are always technical and environmental issues to deal with. We have and we will continue to work cooperatively to deal with that. But you simply can't say 20 years later, we're going to change the whole structure of what we're doing, you can't put the genie back in the bottle. And so it -- we're surprised others in the government are surprised and it's just something that we'll have to work with. I'll tell you this, it has no impact on our view of the value of our asset.","Now, we did have a very positive development with the government. Just last week, we had had had an ongoing dispute with the province, over the province\u2019s imposition of a surface water tax that was contrary to our contract of work. I want to say at the very outset is that we want to support the province. Since 1996, roughly 20 years ago, we've contributed over $700 million voluntarily to a fund to support the local community and we continue to devote 1% of our revenues to support that fund. Under the new agreement, we're working with the government in terms of taxes and royalties of greater percentage of those payments to the central government will go to the province. ","We're very supportive of that. So it's not a question of Freeport not supporting the province, it was a large assessment that the province made arbitrarily contrary to our cal, our total exposure was on the order of $500 million. We were disappointed that the Tax Court did not rule in our favor, but the Supreme Court did and the good news about it in the Supreme Court's finding, they pointed out that our contract was approved by the government in 1991 that it\u2019s binding on the government and on the regional government that the contract is specific in nature, Lex specialis, which means that it is a law that overrides general law and it governs the operations with the parties. ","The contract, provides it should be carried out in good faith. It was a very positive decision by the Supreme Court and we congratulate the government in this step in establishing the rule of law, which will encourage further investment in Indonesia. So we are encouraged -- we're continuing to work with the government. The next step is completing the divestiture process.","Grasberg Block Cave had significant progress in the first quarter. We actually commissioned the train and track that to keep part of the system while delivering over to our mill from there. We also commissioned a major uploading station. Significant work has been done to develop this high grade large scale mine. This is the same ore body that we're mining from the pit. We're just simply using block cave mining rather than surface mining. ","It is a major resource, almost 1 billion tonnes of ore that's over 1% copper and over 0.72 grams of gold over the life. It makes it very profitable with a very low cost, just in going forward. As we look at what this is, it really, as we complete mining from the pit, which we expect to do by the end of this year, there will be a ramp up period like a new project because we can't mine underground until we're out of the pit because of the subsidence of the surface underground and so this is really like starting up a new mine and there will be a period of time of ramp up, beginning in 2019 and within a three year period or so, we'll be up to full production from that. ","The good news is, we're ready to go with it. I mean, the basic system is in place. That's a big step. It\u2019s like completing the mine at Cerro Verde. I mean, if you looked at this project over a number of years, there were risks associated with it and we said that we needed those risks.","I want to address the deep MLZ mine. This is a separate ore system, which report begin mining underground in the early 1980s and it has successfully extended that ore body separate from the Grasberg ore body at deeper levels and the deep MLZ is the most recent extension that started with a near surface mine and went to an intermediate mine, the DOZ mine and here we are now. Now, it is a distinct post rock situation from the Grasberg Block Cave. The rock here is much more competent, hard. It has substantially more \u2013 is substantially lower from the surface and so it has a different rock characteristics and pressure environment. We have been ramping this mine and we began to encounter mining and used seismic activities. This is not earthquakes or natural systems, but as we create the Block Cave, it has created seismic events that has caused us to slow down the development to manage this safely. Our first priority is to keep our people safe and we're doing that. ","We had some new events in the first quarter and so we're not able to meet the schedule that we had planned going into the quarter. But our team and we've got a world class team of outside experts that\u2019s meeting with us continually on this. I had a report from this past week and we have got a plan to help deal with this safely over time. We do not expect this and are confident that it will not affect our longer term mine plans, our ultimate reserve recovery. In fact, our new adjustment for our five year plan from the underground, we have higher volumes coming over the next five years than we did going into the quarter. But near term, we are modifying our mine plans and we're continuing to review it and it's just one of those things about mining that you have to deal with. And as I said, we're being cautious because we want our people to be safe, but we're confident we can deal with this.","So talk about another project, the Lone Star Oxide development project that we reported on previously, reserve of 4.4 billion pounds of copper. We have a project in place to invest $850 million and we will be able to use the production infrastructure and facilities that we have at the adjacent Safford mine, which is a mine that began production 11, 12 years ago and now has available capacity to take this new oxide or we began pre-stripping in the first quarter. It will be a very profitable high return project, 200 million pounds of copper a year with a 20-year mine life, cash cost of $1.75, over $1 billion NPV plus $3 copper and -- but importantly, it will strip this oxide and waste layer from this area, exposing an increasingly attractive sulfide deposit.","And to show what that is, on slide 11, we show recent intercepts of our exploration drilling, which we have done some in the past and we're initiating a new program and it\u2019s some very attractive intercepts in this area, in this environment. You can see the last two intercepts or drilling that's been done this year, we're continuing to drill. This is pointing towards a mineral system that could well be consistent with a nearby Morenci mine. It could be that large and so it's a great indication of the future of our company right here where we have existing operations in a community that's supporting of us and it could be very, very large and this is new information for us in terms of the extent of it.","Page 12, I won\u2019t go with this because we review it every quarter, shows just the number of opportunities we have to develop our reserves. Our 2P reserves are over 60 billion pounds of copper. And then at $2 copper, this is in the Americas, in the US and in South America and we have huge volumes of mineralized material and potential associated with this. This is low risk development, extension of our existing operations. We're doing tradeoff studies now to see where our first step will be in developing this resources. In my personal view, this is a key asset of our company.","Our outlook for 2018 is presented on slide 13. It's consistent with our previous guidance and we will be generating, at today's copper prices, substantial cash flows well above our capital expenditures, which will allow us to progress our financial policy, our sales profile numbers is shown on page 14. 2019 reflects the completion of the mining of the open pit at Grasberg and the beginning of the ramp up of the underground mine there. The adjustments that you see there of about 150 million pounds reflects the issue that we have with the Deep MLZ and that reflects also, you can see the 2019 goal and we will again emphasize that this is not lost resource. This is a question of the timing of when we access to it. We're going to access it as quickly as we can, consistent with maintaining the safety of our people and our operations.","Our standard slide on EBITDA and cash flow is presented on page 15. Average EBITDA at $3 to $3.50 copper is roughly 6 billion to 7.5 billion. This is a three year average from 2019, 2020, 2021. Average operating cash flows from $3 to $3.50 is 4 billion to 5.5 billion. Capital expenditures are roughly in line with our previous guidance. The major projects include the continuing Grasberg underground development and Lone Star. We have been very aggressively, for years, constraining our stay in business, our sustaining capital and now we're having to spend some money to deal with the deferrals that we had in previous years, but we will be very disciplined the way we spend capital and generate lots of cash flows.","A slide we're all proud of here at Freeport is on page 17. We went into 2016, $20 billion of debt, lots of uncertainties. That time a year ago, on this call, I said we would try to reduce our debt by $5 billion to $10 billion over a two year period. We\u2019re now less than 8 billion and as we look forward to the end of the year, we will have this debt down with copper prices on the order to roughly $5 billion to $6 billion. So great success story. Reference slides included there, so I want you to quickly go through those slides to give us time for questions. ","And operator, we will open the call for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","So you've taken down, looking at your slide deck, you\u2019ve taken out 2019 expectations pretty substantially, making it even more of a transition year. With the DMLZ the main factor it appears, are there any other changes or reductions across the regions embedded in that 2019 number? And then is there any flex available across the other assets that could make up any of that production to the upside?","Richard Adkerson","The answer to your first question is no, there's -- I mean every quarter, I think you all know we don't have an annual planning exercise. We update our plans every quarter. If you had seen Red's team in here last week, and this is just the normal ups and downs for the rest of our operations. Outside of Grasberg, outside of PT-FI, there's really no magic bullet we can do in the short run. We have a mantra of pushing safe production and we do that continually and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We are working to progress the Grasberg Block Cave mine and we're making some progress in seeing how to maximize that as we go forward. Interesting time for the remainder of 2019 in the pit as we -- 2018 in the pit as we finish mining in the pit and try to get as much out of that as we can. So this is really a factor of having these seismic -- mining and do seismic events that were not anticipated, not in our original plans and so this is one of the things you deal with in mining and that's what's causing this impact.","Matthew Korn","Got it. Now let me ask more in the immediate than. Could you tell us a little bit more about what prompted \u2013 what looked like to be the unexpected maintenance activities here at Grasberg, what the status is there and then when you're thinking about today, looking through the rest of the year, what are the main risks you think the output reaching your expectations there at that mine.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. So, the Grasberg development is now 20 years old. I mean, we began production of the expanded facilities in January 1998. That was when we built our big sag mill and the ball mill systems. We completed the overflow system using these ore passage ways and developed a system of ore delivery from the passageways to the middle. So the truth is these things have [indiscernible] and we've had a system of maintenance. In doing a current review of that, these problems were really in some ways a function of the times we've gone through in recent years of where our production has been interrupted by export bans, labor issues and so forth. And so now that we're operating in a normal fashion and our mill, our mine rates, our labor situation has been very good and we return to a more normal function. ","As we ramped up, we found that we had these ore delivery system maintenance issues. We realigned resources in Indonesia, but we also marshalled resources from our global team and have sent them out there to rectify the situation. And so we are dealing with it. This will be something that is important to us as we have the high grades from the pit in the remainder of 2018 and then as we ramp up the underground, it is important that we have the ore delivery systems operating effectively. We've also had, along with that, some issues related to our -- the ore that we're feeding into the mill and that is a point in time issue. ","We're not mining waste -- we're mining ore and some of that ore, as we mined it, has been placed in the bottom of the pit, which you know the conditions out there are very wet and that's created some of this ore having a stickiness to a clay like situation to it, which is complicated, both overdelivery through our ore passes and the feed into the mill. So there's some special point in time operating issues related to where we are in the pit and we're addressing those and then we're addressing these maintenance issues to not only allow us to operate effectively for the rest of the year, but also to then have the systems ready for the ramp up of the underground ore from the Grasberg block cave that's going to start very early in 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR.","Lucas Pipes","I wanted to follow up a little bit on the situation in Indonesia. Richard, last quarter, you were pretty outspoken in terms of the likelihood of a resolution. How do you see things, where do you see things standing today? How quickly do you think you can look towards a resolution at this time? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Thanks. I've retained my optimism. The reality is the government late in 2017 concluded that they needed to do a due diligence process. I mentioned this last time, they hired an internationally known investment bank, a major accounting firm, international lawyers and a mining due diligence firm out of Australia to assist them with that. That process took longer than I expected. This is a government entity with a lot of players involved that are experienced in doing things like this. So it's not surprising, but it took long. It appears and these parties will speak for themselves because we're facilitating negotiations, but not participating in the negotiations, the negotiations between our current partner and our future partner. ","So it's a sensitive matter for us. And those negotiations have started. You have an apparent willing seller, certainly a motivated buyer, indications are that the President of Indonesia remains focused on seeing this deal through. That was -- been expressed to me by government officials and while the process, because of the due diligence thing is taking longer, is still on track. This environmental decree and I'm concerned that behind it was political motivations rather it\u2019s certainly not technical motivations. They're setting in the decree standards that don't apply to us as we speak, but set a timetable of six months that just can't be achieved. ","We had an agreement with the government that over the life of the mine, we would retain 50% of the tailings own land. They are now saying it should be 95%, which just cannot be done. They set suspended solid standards that are actually lower than natural sediment standards that would go through the river system. I mean it's 200 versus an agreement that we've had for 20 years of 18,000. So this is not good news, but it's so out of bounds that I'm very confident we will get this done. It's just -- it's taken some work to do it, but it's not something that I've got you on a technical issue, it is a revisit of the whole system and you can't revisit a system that was agreed to 20 years ago and have been operating effectively over 20 years with no unexpected environmental consequences. ","Benign tailings are being deposited in an area where they can be reclaimed. We grow agriculture projects there, the system needs drinking water standards. There's no impact on marine life. There's a thriving mud crab industry in the area, people fish offshore where we are and so this is a distraction, but you all know over time we have to deal with political issues and this is one of them.","Lucas Pipes","Thank you very much for that and I noticed there's a Presidential election about 12 months from now. Do you think there's a risk that negotiations will continue to drag on and potentially reach a point where it just makes more sense to conclude them after a new President is elected?","Richard Adkerson","Well, the presidential elections are -- will occur in 2019. There's regional elections that occur this year by the second half of this year. It will be in full swing campaigning and you have to say that that's a potential risk. It appears that the President would like to get this resolved before that. He's very popular. I mean, his favorable ratings are on the order of two-thirds. And he's done a good job in managing Indonesia, such a large diverse population and economy in a complicated world. So, but realistically, you have to say that that is a risk. We don't see anything to interfere with our operations. ","The government needs and desires now to make sure that we operate and they collect their taxes in all of these and our positions about the long term are very clear. With where we are, it's important for us to continue to operate the rest of this year when we have such a favorable ore to process and profit from altogether and it's not just us, but it's the government also. It's a reality and a potential factor that we'll have to bring into play. We want to move this as quickly as possible and I know there are those in government who do as well.","Lucas Pipes","Thank you very much, Richard and maybe one last one to squeeze in and to change the topic. You\u2019ve always been very focused on the Indonesia situation, but more recently, thinking a little bit more about growth and then restarting the dividend, from here on out, where do you think would you, outside of Indonesia kind of spend your focus, what is most important to you and to what extent does M&A also factor into those considerations? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","So you're correct about focus. I mean 2016 was a focus on de-leveraging, 2017 was a focus on Indonesia. By the fall, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with Red and his team who've been working all through this period in running our operations and looking at the future. And so I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in, when I was in Santiago talking with other companies about their plans, how people are sizing this up, what projects they have, when are they proceeding with them and so we are doing tradeoffs about basically two large projects right now and we have a series of others that will follow, but it's looking at the El Abra opportunity in Chile, which would be a major Cerro Verde type project with the added requirement for a salt water desalination plant and pipeline to take the water up to highs and we are 51% owner with Codelco. We met with Codelco people there. ","They are positive about the project. They're going through changes right now with the change in government. And then our Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona is, read my winces, a more straightforward project because it's a basically mill expansion but we have to deal with tailings area and water, which we worked on for years. And so those are the two that we're teeing up and so what am I looking forward to is announcing the new projects, announcing, last time I said I was looking forward to increasing the dividend. The board did that right after our call and initiating the dividend and we are -- it's great to see a future of where we can build shareholder value out of these resources where we're not getting value today. We know we need to convert those resources in to cash flows. ","We will get value. I'm very confident about the future of the copper business. That confidence is shared by my peers in the industry and so we feel a little great about it, we don't have to do anything right now. I mean, it's still a question with all these trade issues floating around. We need to see how those sort out. We're not, as a company, directly affected by. The copper is correlated to economic activity and these trade things affect economic activity. That's a factor. So feel really great about where we are, great about our company, our assets, our people and the direction we're going in and we'll always have issues to deal with like the Deep MLZ stuff and the best mine. I mean, you go back and look at all of big mines around the world that had times to deal with this, the great news is the resources there were a long term business and that resource is going to create value for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company.","Chris Mancini","First question is, just relative to your -- to the costs in North America and South America specifically, it looks like they're -- they crept up a little bit from last year and -- but it seems like there's some of it which should be somewhat temporary in terms of either lower grades or higher maintenance and repair costs. The big picture question is to what extent are you seeing kind of general mining inflation, to what extent is this temporary and then also to what extent is this like you were saying Richard catching up from not spending on maintenance capital in the past and if that is the case, how long would you expect to have to continue to kind of catch up.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. So you start with the fact that a significant portion of our input costs are correlated with copper prices. That does make sense. You know you think about things that drive energy cost and steel cost and contractor cost and all those sorts of things, so our job is to find ways of mitigating these inherent increases by being more efficient. Red made a presentation about that at the Cisco conference in Santiago, go to that website and you can see what we're doing. We haven't bought, I mean, Caterpillar had great results today and it's always a key indicator for us. They are kind of an index on infrastructure spending around the world. But we haven't built a new truck. ","We haven\u2019t bought a new truck at Freeport since the financial crisis. We are rebuilding trucks. We're taking frames and component parts. We\u2019re extending the life of our tires. We're using all these sensors on all of our equipment that\u2019s feeding all this data in to systems that make us better able to control what operators are doing and how we do this. So you have this dynamic of input cost increasing, efficiencies have an impact on mitigating that and then the issues you pointed out about graves and so forth and that's going to go up and down within a relatively narrow range over time. ","Red Conger","In the short term, we're also increasing the mining and the production rate, those are kind of front end loaded cost wise before we really start to see the pounds coming out later in the year. So that's part of it.","Richard Adkerson","That\u2019s right. El Abra was constrained, when prices were down. Sierrita was. Those mines are making money now and so we\u2019re having to spend some money to take advantage of that.","Chris Mancini","So like so you're doing more shipping \u2013","Kathleen Quirk","And I was just going to say, we\u2019re not showing significant changes in our cash cost trajectory going forward. During 2015 and 2016, we took a lot of steps to maximize cash flows and we do have some catch up that we're doing, but we're operating now in more of a normal situation and so we don't -- we're not seeing a lot of cost increases or decreases in the near term, except for the kinds of things Richard talked about, the things that would be correlated with energy prices or other currencies or other movements that are correlated to the copper price.","Richard Adkerson","And our current outlook for sustaining capital I think is a good longer term outlook. It\u2019s not something that's going to be increasing that, but we can't keep it at 500 million for an operation like this. It\u2019s going to be more in order of $1 billion a year.","Chris Mancini","And then the second question is for Grasberg, on slide 23 of the presentation, you have your production outlook. How much will you need to be mining from the underground in order to achieve that guidance and how much are you mining now from the underground and so like I guess my question is what's your expected ramp rate from the underground and what are the real inherent risks to getting there and achieving this guidance. ","Kathleen Quirk","As Richard said, at the end of 2018, we expect to see some mining in the open pit. We will have some stockpiles that will mine, but those aren\u2019t anything of great significance for the long term. So really all of our production will start to come from the underground mines for operating the DOZ mine currently and the forecasts include roughly 40,000 tonnes a day from DOZ. Our Deep MLZ ramp up, we expect to ultimately get to 80,000 tonnes a day from that mine and right now our projection is we\u2019ll get there in the 2021, 2022 timeframe. And in the Grasberg block cave, we will be ramping that up and we expect to get to roughly 100,000 tonnes a day from that mine in 2022 and the ultimate production from that mine we expect to be in the 130,000 to 160,000 tonnes per day range. ","But in terms of the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg block cave combined by 2020, from those two mines, we would expect to average about 70,000 to 75,000 pounds a day combined in 2020 on average versus in capacity, which will be 80 plus 130. So something on the order of 200. We do have and Mark Johnson is on the line and he can comment about this. We do have, in the Grasberg block cave, access to higher grade material in the earlier years. So even though we're in a ramp up period, we still will have the benefit of accessing some higher grade material from that orebody. As Richard said, it\u2019s the same orebody as our Grasberg open pit, just a different mining method.","But Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to the comments about the ramp up?","Mark Johnson","Yeah. Fortunately, the highest grade ore in these ore bodies is also the most capable. So it makes sense that we start there from both an economic and a mining method approach. As Kathleen said, in the early years of Grasberg, it\u2019s well above the ore body average. We're well above 1.1% copper and one gram, 1.2 grams for much of that ramp up period. The same for the Deep MLZ, we have exceptional grades, we start off in 1.6 copper and about 1.6 gram per tonne gold. So both of those are -- offset the lower tonnes as we wrap up and then as we get up to a steady state on the production rate over about a 5 or 6 year period at the Grasberg and we expect the same with the deep MLZ after we get the seismic event or seismic situation resolved. ","These ramp up rates are what we were able to do in the DOZ 10 years ago as we ramped up. So a lot of the ramp up is based on how quickly you can advance the undercut. You concurrently develop the extraction level, which is the drop bells and sequencing of the mine over the long term. So these are things that we've done in the past with the DOZ and we're applying. We've got better construction techniques now. As far as the overflow systems, going forward, Richard mentioned that a lot of the infrastructure that we have now is dated as we shut down the pit, much of that older system is mothballed and will be relying on, the majority of the ore flow system will be brand new systems that we built for both Deep MLZ and GBC. ","So we'll be starting fresh with new infrastructure that's all been done at a very high standard. So we're very optimistic on the ramp up of both of those mines, both the Deep MLZ and GBC. Big Gossan also, smaller mine but very high grade. It's about 2.5% copper equivalent and we're ramping it up also, it has the potential about 100 million pounds a year and about 60,000 ounces, not a large mine for PT-FI, but still a very significant contributor to what we're doing in the future in the underground.","Chris Mancini","Okay. Got it. Okay. So in 2020, because of the higher grades, you only have to do 70,000 tonnes per day from the DMLZ and the Grasberg block cave combined and then as you ramp up the throughput from the underground to 2021 and 2022, the grades will decline and that allows you to achieve the -- and then eventually even 2023, you should even see a bigger increase in -- or as you progress in 2023 and beyond, a bigger increase in throughput. And should production increase in 2023 and beyond or will grades like continue to decline because it's fairly steady?","Mark Johnson","It's fairly steady. We get up to that 200 plus 200,000 tonne plus range that Kathleen mentioned. And then the grades in the Grasberg steady for quite a while. We end up with a little bit higher grade towards the end again. So it's somewhat variable, but we've got a long term outlook that shows, as you know, very much over 1 billion tonnes a year and gold very. We've got slides I know that we\u2019ve shown in the past that show the underground era and it's in that 1.5 million ounce range longer term.","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. And that\u2019s 100%. So we would have 50% of that.","Richard Adkerson","So, our reference slides have that. I mean we\u2019re just casually mentioning an underground operation feeding 200,000, to 240,000 tonnes per day of ore to a mill. I mean, I thought that others in the industry and people are just, they're just amazed by -- it's the infrastructure there is truly amazing. So first time ever and we're very confident with it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC.","Oscar Cabrera","I'm just going to start with your development projects. I must admit that until you started focusing on Lone Star and realize that the resource grade was 0.61%. So as you're looking at the future of the company, with El Abra and Lone Star, could you comment on what do you think is, you look at the projects and what's more favorable to you? Is it all of the advantages that they have in the US or is it, if it's really now with requirements for this on that, so like taken on the list.","Richard Adkerson","Well, that's what we're trying to decide. I mean, it's in some ways comparable. 11 years ago, when we bought Phelps Dodge and we looked at El Abra, all we could see was the oxide project and a sulfide project and that was it. We drilled these core holes, found this enormous resource and now we're working to take advantage of it. People have known about Lone Star going back to the 1960s. And now we're drilling it and we're getting real stars in our eyes about how really big this thing could be. I mean, we're talking about something that might could well be over the years another Morenci type deposit. But that's going to take some time. ","We're going to evaluate that. We have, as I said, a much more straightforward expansion project available to us at Bagdad and that's where the tradeoffs that you're talking about really come into place, lower energy costs in the US, no labor unions, much flexible ability to adjust the work force, communities that provide education, healthcare, housing for people as opposed to our having to do all that, workers driving their forward trucks to work with a lunch pail, it is -- all of those things add up to making investment in the US relatively more attractive than it's ever been. And so that's what we\u2019re doing those tradeoffs for and the Lone Star deal is more of a bigger picture longer timeframe type asset, but it is going to create a lot of value for Freeport shareholders.","Oscar Cabrera","Thanks, Richard. And then before I ask you the next question, it might be worthwhile just starting like a cross section of the Lone Star sulfite just to get context and then lastly just a clarification on your comments on your discussions with the Indonesia Ministry of Environment, are they expecting changes in six months? Is that the part of the discussion, because I don't -- this is not realistic and as you said, might be politically motivated, but can you provide a little bit more context on those discussions?","Richard Adkerson","Well I am as perplexed as you are and we're having dialog, we\u2019ll continue to have dialog, not only with the environmental and forestry ministry, but with the ministers that are working directly with us on our contract situation. So this is -- we were not expecting these decrees. I had to tell you about them because they cannot be put in place. It\u2019s not just Freeport, nobody can mine this one body in consistency with these two decrees. You just physically can't do it. So it's some of the noise that happens from time to time and we\u2019re going to deal with this in a constructive dialog to explain. I've already -- we've already doing that, to explain the situation and talk about what realistically is do or not. It's addressing a problem that isn't there. There's no problem here.","Oscar Cabrera","Well, that's what it sounds like.","Richard Adkerson","Benign tailings that are being managed as we said we would and nobody can identify impacts of significance that weren't anticipated. It all almost goes back to the issue, are you going to develop the mine or not, because there was no way to store tailings up in those mountains and we look at every conceivable alternative. I mean, we had experts from Indonesia and around the world. It\u2019s a public process. The Indonesian environment minister at the time said, it was the most comprehensive environmental study ever done in Indonesia and we all said okay, this is the way we're going to do it, this is the way we've done it. So anyway, I had to tell you about it, I'm confident that this is going to be dealt with.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. ","Alex Hacking","Sorry to keep harping on Indonesia, but a couple of questions if I may. You talked about the Ministry there trying to impose new environmental standards, but there's also been reports in the local press about them making a very substantial claim for damages. I think it's been reported around $13 billion, something like that. Are those press reports accurate? And is that an official claim from that ministry, legal claim or is this just?","Richard Adkerson","No. This came about because of governmental audit group that\u2019s in some ways not totally like our GAO. It was a centralized audit group that came in and that claim is based on degradation to the tailings deposition area. Their take is a large area of land and they say that area was degradated by environmental impact. Of course, it was. I mean we had over 2.5 billion tonnes of ore to process, take the concentrate out, deposit of tailings somewhere and that's where we did it. Now to come back and say, okay, you've got to pay some financial form for doing something that the government approved, it is outrageous.","Kathleen Quirk","They haven\u2019t presented any kind of claim. It\u2019s in their report to these government ministries of what a number of what and potential environmental damage can be, so it\u2019s just a number, it\u2019s not a \u2013","Richard Adkerson","An academic group did a theoretical study to say what happened with this tailings deposition and they used some approaches to measure environmental damage that\u2019s huge around the world, but it's not something that is outside of what was approved. It\u2019s strictly in this designated deposition area, where we built dikes to cordon it off and agreed that\u2019s what we're going to put, these millions of tonnes of tailings and that's what we're doing.","Alex Hacking","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s very clear and very helpful. And then just a follow up on the deep MLZ, are you considering any impact there of the slowdown beyond 2019 and I noticed when you look at the guidance, you expect to make up for the slowdown beyond 2019, but I guess at a practical level, how is that going to happen, because it's \u2013","Richard Adkerson","Deep MLZ, some of the makeup is from what Mark was talking to you about with the Grasberg block cave. So you're looking at the total production, which includes Deep MLZ and the Grasberg block cave and to a smaller degree the Big Gossan. Now, the unfortunate thing about this unexpected occurrence was the Deep MLZ, because of what Mark said having this 1.6% copper grades available to us, when we look back couple of years ago and saw this coming, we said will this previously expected fall off in 2019, it was earlier years then, which is going to be offset by this ore from Deep MLZ. Now, we've had the seismic events and that's been pushed back. So we have to be candid. We're dealing with this, there's some uncertainty as to how long it's going to take to get this block cave operating in a way of where the seismic events are not of the nature that they create risk to our people. We have a plan, we're going to report to you how that plan goes over time, but it's all dependent on the timing for that and you can appreciate, we're being very conservative with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen & Company.","Novid Rassouli","So touching on kind of what you were just stating, the deep MLZ, you guys took down your mining profile out to like 2022 if we look at kind of what you guys had last quarter. Is that just the mining, the seismic activity, bringing down all the out years as well or what's the driver of that?","Kathleen Quirk","Well if you look at the slide for the five years of slide 23, the actual total production over that period net to PT-FI\u2019s interest is 5.4 billion pounds of copper, which is similar to what we had. I think we had 5.3 in our last plan over that period of time. And gold is similar to what we had in the last quarterly update. But what we're seeing is a shift out of 2019 and the outer years are higher than what our plan was because Deep MLZ is shifted out, as Mark said, that the beginning of the year, beginning production ramp up of Deep MLZ has higher grade. So that shift would just continue to shift it out and then also with the progress that we've made on the Grasberg Block Cave and the position we\u2019re in in terms of the commencement of the cave in early 2019, those two factors combined bring us to where we've got better, over the long term, it's essentially the same as where we were before, but we do have this impact in 2019 that at this point, our mine plans don't show being able to make up and we're going to continue to work on that.","Novid Rassouli","Got it. That makes sense. And then looking at your CapEx, it looks like you reduced your spend for the long term PT-FI investments plans to 0.8 billion from 0.9. However, net to PT-FI remained at 0.7 billion. Would you mind us running through why the net to PT-FI number doesn't change despite the CapEx number decreasing? Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Some of this is rounding. In other words, we give numbers that are rounded. ","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. We did reduce -- over the five years, we did reduce 100% Grasberg CapEx by about 300 million associated with the timing of power requirements and as Richard said, in terms of the sharing mechanisms that\u2019s going to be in the large part rounding, but some of the projects we share differently than others, so we can talk to you offline if you want more over the top into it.","Richard Adkerson","I mean we have this ongoing process of where all -- our whole team is looking at this question, I\u2019m saying that there are ways to do it cheaper better, do we have to do it now, can we defer it, it's all part of maximizing the economics of the operation and that\u2019s ongoing. Fundamentally, nothing that\u2019s changed.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS.","Andreas Bokkenheuser","Maybe one last one on Indonesia hopefully, but just going back to that Ministry of Environment and Forestry issue. So just to clarify, so obviously, you\u2019re mentioning it could very well be political, you're saying that technologically it may not be feasible. Within that, are we basically saying here that even if, I mean, that the statement was saying that it has to be a six month transitional period, even if the government came out and said, you know what, we\u2019ll give you 24 months of 30 months or whatever. Your space is still saying that it could be done. Does that mean that theoretically worst case scenario that production line to a halt or does it mean that production potentially is going to come down 50% of what, what is the kind of the operational outcome in the worst case scenario here?","Richard Adkerson","I want to clarify something you just said. You said may not be achievable, I want to be clear. It is not achievable. There's no may about it. It cannot be done within six months, 24 months, 5 years. This is so far out of bounce. It cannot be done. And as I said, it's addressing a problem that doesn't exist. It's -- the reason I say politically, it's a revisit of the decision that was made back in the 1990s, are you going to develop this mine. I mean, we look at pipelines, we look at sea disposal, we look to build a pipeline on the other side of the mountain, we cannot store these tailings in the mountains. ","And the question of this stopping operations, it's not going to happen. Indonesia is looking to relying on the financial benefits that\u2019s coming out of this mine to deal with this budgetary issues. The taxes, the royalties that they are receiving is on the order of $40 billion I think over the life of the mine and the province needs this economic impact. This is a province that doesn't have a lot of jobs, that won't have economic development. We are 95% of the economy of the Regency of Mimika. ","And so this is not going to stop our operations. It's a matter of education. I'm proud of the way we run this environmental thing. I expressed that to the ministers in Washington last week. We don't need to be defensive about this. We are managing these environmental issues in an admirable way, so we can show that it can be reclaimed, we can show that we're meeting drinking water standards that were -- we have land that was appropriate fertilizer can ultimately become crop land. And so there's nothing to be defensive about. There's no possibility that this is something that is going to disrupt our operations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.","David Gagliano","A lot of mine have already been answered, but one different question I had. Year-end 2018, kind of I guess a nitpicky question, net debt targets for year-end 2018 eighteen increased, it was 4.8 billion previously, now, it\u2019s 5.5 billion. If I look at the differences, I think dividend working capital changes account for about 200 million of that increase, lower CapEx is about 100 million swing in the other direction. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what caused the other increase of about 600 million to the targeted net debt figure for 2018.","Kathleen Quirk","Which case you're looking at Dave.","David Gagliano","I'm comparing the 4Q slide on net debt target by year end 2018.","Kathleen Quirk","But which price sale.","David Gagliano","To the page 17 on this slide deck year end \u2013","Kathleen Quirk","So part of it is we didn't get 325 all year, right, I mean, we\u2019ve already through part of the year and we\u2019re less than that. Also the previous slide was before we did our dividend. So this is net of the dividend. The other differences are the differences in the operating cash flow changes that we, that are on a previous slide. So we can walk you through it, but the main thing -- the main difference from what case you're looking at is we didn't get 325. This includes actual to the first quarter and estimates for the balance of the year based on these prices. And then we didn't have a dividend in the last case.","Richard Adkerson","So Dave, David Joint will call you and walk you through analysis on that, but there is nothing there other than what we just talked about for the rest of the group.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael Dudas","I'll try to make it brief. Good morning. Just two quick questions first. Now that the environmental issues that you discussed during the call are out in the open, what can we look for as a milestone or timing to figure out how things are working out just on that issue specifically and how it\u2019s licensed to the overall discussion regarding the potential transactions?","Richard Adkerson","So I've expressed a concern that these environmental issues represent a distraction from going forward with a plan we\u2019re working on. And so we have to deal with that. And at this point, the milestone will be making sure that the ministers we're doing with on the broader issue understand what this is and what this isn\u2019t and so we're engaged in that education process right now. I mean we\u2019ve presented written, had meetings and I'm reaching out to meet with the environmental minister to deal with this. I just have to tell you, this just came up. I mean, when was it, it was last week. Yeah. Mid-April. So you're getting this as we've got and we've got to respond to it. So I just want to keep coming back, it's addressing a problem that doesn't exist.","Michael Dudas","That's very helpful. And just my final call Richard. When you think about the planned Freeport 2.0 once Indonesia gets resolved, is there going to be acceleration on the plans you're talking about in Latin America and North America from a capital growth standpoint or you do need to wait to resolve Indonesia to really get yourselves set to track those plans or is it better just to harvest things before if you get some clarity on the other hand. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","I will say this. I don't think given the improvement we have in our balance sheet and given where we are with Indonesia, that it's a factor, but it's not a major constraint and what we decide to do going forward. We certainly have the financial capability of doing it. Quite frankly, we're not out looking for partners in this thing. We already have a partner at Codelco, Codelco and El Abra. We are -- there's nothing compelling us to act quickly. But as we get the clarity that I think we need to have is on the global economic situation and this trade issue was a curveball for everybody and that's obviously every day -- debated every day in the paper about whether that's going to be a negotiating strategy to deal with some obvious issues in China for competition or is it going to lead to a tit for tat deal that's going to have a significant global impact. ","But to me, that's the big issue. You scrape that away and look at the underlying numbers, China grew at 6.8%, business in the US is really good, our customers feel good, Europe and even Japan is growing. I mean that's first time we've had this and I feel people in the industry that never seen, I've been around this industry now for a very long time. I\u2019ve been CEO for 15 years. I've never seen a more positive outlook going into a year as we had in 2018 and then we get this trade deal that's got people scratching their heads. It clearly had an impact on investor flows and that affects prices at any point in time, but there's nothing in the underlying economies that changes. ","Nothing has changed the supply situation. There's -- and even these projects that people are considering are so long term and they're just going to be needed because we can\u2019t talk about having a need for 4.5 million tonnes of copper capacity over the next ten years and when you \u2013 and that's about the size of the top ten copper mines in the world and so the world's going to need this copper and increasingly every day, you read about people wanting to move more towards electric vehicles and alternative energy sources, electric vehicles three four times more copper, alternative energy sources is four times more copper than conventional power generation and then you've got all the support that goes on with that. I mean this is a good outlook for demand and the best thing about copper is there is supply constraint. You\u2019ve got Codelco facing challenges to maintaining production. [indiscernible] I'm a believer and I think there is consensus now.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you all of you. We appreciate it and we look forward to reporting on this -- on our progress and milestones as we go forward. Appreciate your interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We're pleased to be here today to report our first quarter of results following our oil and gas acquisitions, which were consummated in the second quarter. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call.","As usual, we have several slides to supplement our comments this morning, and we'll be referring to the slides during the call. They're also accessible using our webcast link on fcx.com.","In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in the press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today is our Chairman of the Board, Jim Bob Moffett; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of our Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas subsidiary; and we've got a number of other executives with us today who will be available to answer any questions.","I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, and he'll be reviewing performance and outlook, as well as Jim Bob and Jim Flores. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open the call for questions.","FCX reported today net income attributable to common stock of $482 million or $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2013. That compared to $710 million or $0.74 per share in the prior year quarter. Our results include the results of the wholly owned subsidiaries, Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, following the acquisitions of PXP on May 31, 2013, and of McMoRan Exploration on June 3, 2013.","Our second quarter results included a number of items associated with the transactions. We had $128 million gain to net income attributable to common stock of $0.13 per share. That reflected a gain on FCX's initial preferred stock investment and the subsequent acquisition of McMoRan.","We had $183 million of net income attributable to common stock or $0.19 per share associated with net reductions and deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances. And those were net of charges of $61 million or $46 million to net income attributable common stock of $0.05 a share for transaction and related costs associated with the acquisitions.","As you'll see in the release, the second quarter results also included unfavorable adjustments to our provisionally priced concentrate and cathode copper sales recognized in prior periods that totaled $55 million to net income or $0.06 per share. And we also had unfavorable adjustments of $35 million or $27 million to net income attributable to common stock, $0.03 per share related to oil and gas derivative instruments that were assumed in connection with the acquisitions.","Our second quarter consolidated copper sales of 951 million pounds and 173,000 ounces of gold were lower than our April 2013 estimates of 1 billion pounds of copper and 295,000 ounces of gold, primarily reflecting lower production from Indonesia as a result of the temporary suspension of operations in mid-May.","Our second quarter 2013 sales from the recently acquired Oil & Gas operations totaled 5 million barrels of oil equivalents for the period from June 1 through June 30, which included 3.0 million barrels of crude oil, 7.7 Bcf of natural gas and 0.3 million barrels of natural gas liquids.","The copper price realization for the quarter was $3.17 per pound. That was lower than last year's second quarter of $3.53 per pound. For gold, we realized $1,322 per ounce in the second quarter compared to last year's second quarter of $1,588 per ounce.","During June, the Brent crude oil prices averaged just over $103 per barrel, and our realized price for crude oil in June was $97.42 per barrel or about 94% of Brent crude. Excluding the impact of derivative instruments, the June 2003 (sic) [ 2013 ] average realized price for crude oil was $97.05.","Our consolidated average unit net cash costs for our mining operations averaged $1.85 per pound of copper in the second quarter. It was higher than the year ago period of $1.49, primarily reflecting lower copper and gold volumes in Indonesia and anticipated higher mining rates in North America and also the impact of lower gold prices and net byproduct credit. The cash production cost for oil and gas averaged $16.58 per barrel of oil equivalent in June 2013.","Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $1 billion, including $235 million in working capital sources, and our capital expenditures totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter. We ended the June period with $21.2 billion in total debt, which included $700 million of fair value adjustments to the stated value of assumed debt and a consolidated cash position of $3.3 billion at the end of June.","As previously reported, our Board of Directors declared a supplemental dividend of $1 per share, which was paid on July 1. The value of that dividend was $1 billion. That was in addition to our regularly -- regular quarterly dividend, which equates to $1.25 per share per annum.","During the second quarter -- we'll be talking more about this throughout the call -- we took a number of actions to reduce or defer capital expenditures and other costs. We've got a progress report included in the materials, which we'll be talking more about. We're going to pursue additional capital cost reductions and divestitures as required to maintain our strong balance sheet while preserving our strong resource position and portfolio of assets with attractive long-term growth projects -- prospects.","I'd now like to turn over the call to Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks, Kathleen. The -- obviously, a very active quarter for us. We've got a lot to talk about today with the Oil & Gas acquisitions of McMoRan and PXP. We're going to focus on the strong margins, cash flows, near-term and long-term growth opportunities that we have from these assets and how that complements the outlook for our mining business going forward.","You will see that we really had strong operating performance in North America, South America and in Africa, and we will be focusing on that. Our results were significantly affected, of course, by this tragic accident that we had on May 14 in our PTF operations in Papua. And we had significantly lower volumes of copper and gold as a result of that. And also, we were impacted by the fact that our -- a lot of our costs are fixed and continued during the period we were shut down.","After a period of grief and attention to the families and to our workforce and into the community as a result of the loss of life in this accident, we worked on safety procedures in coordination with the government and returned to operations in the open pit in the mill in June 24, roughly 6 weeks after the accident and began underground mining operations on July 9, almost 2 months later. And so that had an impact, and we want to make sure you understand what that meaned.","We did advance our development projects in the mining business at Tenke, Morenci, at Cerro Verde, Grasberg underground development. We progressed with the Lucius development in our Oil & Gas business, major discovery that's looking to come onstream in the near term. We did have a $1 a share supplemental dividend paid on July 1 that was in conjunction with completing the mergers to go along with our regular $1.25 annual dividend.","Kathleen mentioned this, but you'll hear more about it today, about our commitment to achieve our debt reduction targets. Even with lower commodity prices, which we had a lot of volatility during the second quarter and lower prices at the end of the quarter, uncertainty about the future with the impact of the Grasberg deferral of operations, with changes in plans, we have a set of assets that's going to allow us to achieve this targeted debt reduction, and you'll be hearing about our commitment to do that.","Before we get into the specifics on these matters, I'm going to turn the mic over for Jim Bob to make some comments.","James R. Moffett","Good morning. Our annual shareholders meeting, I thought you'd like to know that 15 of our directors nominated were elected, we've had the ratification of Ernst & Young, but advisory vote on say-on-pay did not receive a majority vote. Obviously, the board will continue to consider the shareholder feedback. We've been working with our [indiscernible] people and we look [indiscernible] and rewards discussed a new shareholder feedback.","But suffice it to say, we'll make sure that we'll pay you competitive and timely shareholder return. The shareholder proposal advisory vote on independent Chairman received a majority of votes cast. And what this means is that the independent directors will consider how we deal with this. I should mention that the independent members of our board have already appointed Gerald Ford to the newly created position of Lead Independent Director. And we haven't had an independent director like we've elected, which should have been serving our board members. Gerald has been chosen by the board. He has an impeccable reputation in the finance community. Our board has been totally aware of our management goals and the board goals. So I think that we've addressed this, this advisory vote of independent chairman. The board believes this structure is in the best interest of the shareholders and addresses this so-called nonbinding advisory proposal.","The bylaw amendment on shareholder right to call a special meeting with 15% received the majority of the votes cast. I won't spend any time on that, but you'll find that in our bylaws that in the state of Delaware, the 15% ownership adds several things that are appreciative and we'll get into that when the time comes.","The environmental director and the board diversity did not receive a majority of the votes cast.","On the recent performance, on the next slide, we thought you'd be interested to see that since we announced the deal in December, [indiscernible] copper, of course, [indiscernible] And look at the oil, 21% up, 5% natural gas on the indexes has a similar education. So we think this already starts to speak to the wisdom of having a more diversified asset base, including the Oil & Gas asset.","One of the things on top of the performance is challenges by current prices. Remember, discoveries in copper are very rare. If you look at the recoverable copper reserves on Slide 6, you will notice that the Grasberg in '88 and Escondida in '79 have really been the 2 main discoveries. There have been no discoveries that make the grid in 2000.","Most of the copper production [indiscernible] Escondida, Grasberg, and then the most recent, Chuquicamata in 1910, El Teniente in 1910; Los Bronces 1876; Norilsk in 1935; Morenci, 1870s. What this says is because the copper reserves were all [indiscernible] geology, that most of the reserves in the Rockies and Andes were found during the early prospecting days.","So with the advent of the Oil & Gas program, as you'll hear from Jim, there's a tremendous potential for us to have major discovery potential. So not only do we have a more diversified base, we've been very fortunate. Since the acquisition of Phelps Dodge, we've been using our greenfields, of course, with the brownfields and discovered the equivalent of maybe Grasberg has been going on for almost 7 years.","And as you will see, we continue to lead the greenfield opportunities [indiscernible] and the brownfields will be our main stake. We do now have the world-class opportunity to have some discoveries.","Now on Page 7, I wanted to make sure that you know we've got into the company a mandate of our board, the office of the chairman, myself, Richard and Jim Flores. As you can see, we're all on the same page, and that's philosophically [indiscernible]. You'll hear from Richard and from Jim that we're dedicated to our goal of reducing our leverage, and we said that we would do it in 2016. But you're going to hear some comments.","Certainly, we're -- as a result of more discussions with the board, we're looking at ways to reduce [indiscernible] before that date. And again, all of us are going to be working to expand our resources, take advantage of our existing resources and showing financial discipline and take advantage of this treasure trove of assets in which we find ourselves as we put these companies together.","So with that, I'll turn the meeting back over to Richard, and I thank you. I'd be happy to hear some of the exciting stuff that we've been looking at as we look at this new asset base. Thank you. Richard?","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks, Jim Bob. On the financial highlights page on Page 8, I'm not going to repeat what Kathleen reviewed with you at the start of the call, but I wanted to just point out the impact of the suspension of operations of PT-FI. You see that our volumes of 950 million pounds of copper, they were roughly -- that reflected the impact of having 125 million pounds of less production.","With gold of 173, we had 125 million ounces less production of gold. So that is really what drove the shortfall in our performance, together with this factor that I mentioned that many of our costs at PT-FI are fixed. Now that works for us in a very positive way as volumes increase because we don't have increased costs that's commensurate with our prices. But it also had an effect this quarter of having our unit costs higher because of the fixed nature of our cost.","This is further shown on Page 9. You can see in North America, in South America, in Africa, where we have our unit cost at the top of the page and our volumes at the bottom of the page, that those operations really performed strongly, both in terms of having a production achievement of our targets, our goals and control of our cost in today's environment. The numbers speak for themselves. The impact in Indonesia saw our unit costs rise significantly as a result of the lower volumes and the fixed nature of our cost.","The Oil & Gas operations, and Jim will talk more to this in a few minutes, are presented in summary on Page 10. This only reflects 1 month of operations. We'll account for the Oil & Gas acquisitions prospectively going forward. It was only from June in this particular quarter. But I want to point out just how strong the volume -- the margins are in this business, looking at the unit revenue cost and the operation margin per BOE.","Across the board, this again is a business that has very high operating margins, and that gives us a chance to focus on profitable growth and disciplined growth and achieve value creation for our company through these assets.","Copper markets, some bullet points on Page 11. This was a very volatile quarter. It started out fairly strong, had a dip in price of significance early in the quarter. When some Chinese economic concerns came back, it bounced back. And then in June, when the U.S. bid talked about moderating their open market purchases of bonds and the purchasing number came out in China and growth was just marginally less, the price dropped off. These are macroeconomic events. There really hasn't been supported by fundamentals in the marketplace, which really haven't changed that much. China continues to remain the important demand driver in the business, consuming almost 40% of the world's copper and accounting for the growth in demand.","And within China, fundamental copper demand is really strong. It's growing at 8% to 10% a year. The downstream business is strong, scrap is short, premiums are up. I'll just refer you to the analysts that follow the business, the -- that follow the business and you can substantiate that. But the prices are what they are because of markets. Sentiment in Europe remains weak.","Our business in the U.S., supported by automobiles and a stronger construction, is relatively strong and longer-range supply challenges persist. But be that as it may, the copper price is what it is; we don't run our business on any near-term expectations of price. We're very confident about the long-term fundamentals of this marketplace. And what you'll see is we're responding to the lower prices and to the risk of that persist -- continuing in the future. And we're taking that with actions to reduce costs. We began that during the quarter in earnest.","On Page 12, within our mining business, we undertook a project at looking at all of our capital spending projects and making decisions to defer costs or eliminate costs when we could do that without really disrupting our -- either our near-term at this point or our long-term growth opportunity. And we've had success with that. It's a list of items that just illustrates the breadth of scope that our team has done, led by Red and Mark and Dave Thornton and our whole team, to find items of where we could achieve this goal of conserving cash.","And we aren't finished, but as we report today with where we are, we have capital reductions for the next 2 years of $1.4 billion, and that includes $400 million in the Oil & Gas business, which is going through a similar process of looking at their capital spending. And then looking at costs beyond capital, and we end up with a total of $1.9 million of deferrals -- $1 billion of deferrals over the next 2 years.","Now that's one element and it's continuing. The other element is to look at our asset base and look for ways again of, as Jim Bob said, achieving this target of reaching our right balance sheet goals for debt in light of lower commodity prices and finding ways of potentially accelerating in achieving that goal from beyond the target of 2016.","We've initiated plans to sell conventional oil and gas production on the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico, and that's a process that's started. We have a broad set of other assets that gives us many alternatives in terms of potential property sale or innovative structures to come up with ways of achieving this goal, and it is a commitment. It is a commitment and we're committed to do it, and we're committed to doing it in whatever environment we have to deal with.","At the same time that we're going through this process, we're continuing to date with our brownfield development projects in the mining business. We had 3 major projects that were growth projects that we're targeting to add about 1 billion pounds of copper sales a year, which is a significant amount of volumes.","We've completed the Tenke Fungurume Phase 2 project on time, on budget. The Morenci mill project is in progress. We've incurred about $600 million to date of our revised estimate of $1.6 billion to our interest, we have an 85% interest at Morenci. That's going very well, very high rate of return project and one that has a very quick payback because of significant volumes that come out of that project as we add on to the existing substantial operations at Morenci.","At Cerro Verde, we commenced construction earlier this year. The plan is to complete that in 2016. We've incurred about $800 million of the $4.4 billion of good support from the government, the local community.","And so the numbers that you see to date involve continuations of those projects. We have options of changing those decisions if market conditions warrant, but we can achieve this targeted debt reduction goal and do these projects at the same time.","We're also continuing the underground development at PT-FI, which is necessary for us to be able to go forward with this very valuable operation beyond the exploration of mining and the open pit, which is -- continues to be expected by roughly the end of 2016.","We did have this horrific accident that we talked about earlier on May 14, where we had a tunnel collapse in a training facility, and we had fatalities and injuries. This wasn't really a mining accident, it was apart from our mining operations. It was an incredibly horrific convergence of events that came together because of the geology of the rock and the influence of water and air on our ground support facilities, and unfortunately just happened just as we were having this training meeting. And then it was terrible, and all of our organization has responded in a caring and professional way about it.","But we also undertook internally a special safety review of all of our operations, focusing on underground operations where people gather. We worked with people with the energy and mines ministry in Indonesia and an independent team they formed. And at the conclusion of that process, we were able to resume operations on June 24 in the open pit, in the mill. And on July 9 in the underground, we are now ramping up the underground operations. You can't just start those immediately at full-scale production, and that ramping up is progressing.","In the quarter, we lost roughly 125 million pounds of copper and 125,000 ounces of gold. The full year impact will be greater than that. We estimate 230 million pounds of copper and 250,000 ounces of gold. That resource is still there. I mean, it's not going anywhere. We'll produce it in the future. But the impact for the year reflects a couple of factors: One is the time it takes to ramp up underground to get back to full production levels; plus, as you'll recall in the first quarter, we talked about how we were going to assess high-grade ore at the end of the year under our mine plans. Now some of that higher-grade ore will be pushed out into future years.","We try -- we presented this slide, which we have shown for 2012 earlier on Page 16 to show just what the impact was. We show the -- we're showing the average of copper and gold production in prior years from 2002 to 2011.","\u2026 and average for -- what our mine plan shows for 2014 to 2016, which will -- at that point, we will transfer from being a combination open pit underground operation to a full underground operation. If you can just see the significance of the volume that we've had, the low volumes we've had in 2012 and 2013 and how that translates in the chart on the far right to our unit cost, which averaged for PT-FI $0.13 a pound for the 2007, 2011 period, would actually be projected at a net credit. Going forward, all of this will depend on the price of gold. This is a $1,300 an ounce gold. So that illustrates the impact on current operations for that.","Page 17 shows part of our cost-saving efforts. We've refocused our mining exploration expenditures, reducing about $55 million of cost. And the bulk of our spending is on our brownfield expansion of our orebodies. But we do have some greenfield spending, and that course is a greenfield discovery, is the best thing that's happened to a natural resource company. But our brownfield projects are projects that add a lot of value for us.","I'm going to turn the mic over to Jim Flores, and Jim's going to be talking about our Oil & Gas activities.","James C. Flores","Good morning. Thank you, Richard. Looking at the Oil & Gas development activities first. We have several large areas, California, Eagle Ford Deepwater, Haynesville and also, the ultra-deep completions we'll talk about.","In California, it's been a tremendous asset on the Oil & Gas business for a long period of time. The fields were discovered 100 years ago that they're producing at high rates and high margins for a long period of time. A lot of people don't realize that California's the third most productive state in the country, and it's got a tremendous oil and gas business. And the big thing it has for our company is a lot of free cash flow from a standpoint of very low maintenance capital to keep very high flow rates, and obviously, with our strong pricing, gives us big margins, as Richard highlighted earlier in his presentation. California will continue to get its ample amount of capital to maintain that production and look forward to a stable base going forward.","The Eagle Ford is one of our newer assets. It's been developed in the last 5 years. It's had a tremendous growth rate because of the rig activity as we expanded from 2 to over 8 rigs over a period. We're now reducing that rig fleet and in the large cash flows out of our high oil price at LLS pricing in our Eastern Eagle Ford.","We're in the premium position of the play called the heart of the watermill, we're in the Graven [ph] sequence that's got the thick ore-bearing part of the shale. And our wells continue to produce several thousand barrels a day as they come on. The near-term cash flow expansion will come at the peril of our rig count there. We'll be reducing our rig count going forward. And this is one of the areas we're able to save a lot of our CapEx savings, at the same point in time, maximizing the cash flow for the company. What you're seeing is we're taking advantage of the high oil prices in California and Eagle Ford to generate cash flow for the overall company.","In the Deepwater, we've made a large effort there, obviously, on the backs of some of our non-operated activities like our Lucius project, which is operated by Anadarko. It's on time and on budget. And contrary to a lot of the highlights you've heard and some of the large projects around the Gulf and around the world, we've done an excellent job and we expect that spar to be on location this summer and we establish initial production in the second half of 2014. Everything continues to look just stellar on the Lucius project.","Our large-scale infrastructure that we have in the Eastern part of the Gulf, the Holstein, Horn Mountain and Marlin, continue to reap benefits. We're getting very comfortable. We took over full operations, made first from the seller, allowed us to really weld our employees together and be able to look at all of the development projects. And the big growth opportunity we had there, tying back additional leases and additional production to that important infrastructure. Accordingly with that, we were very active in the last lease sale in March. We've done a lease sale, and we've now been awarded all 11 of our blocks at a recent lease sale, which will add several hundred million dollars of tieback opportunities to our Holstein platform.","Our goals in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico are to triple our oil production over the next 5 years, and we have the assets and we have the geology and the reserves to do it. It's a matter of execution.","On the Haynesville, one of the more significant gas fields in the world, much less United States, we have over 5 Tcf of gas attributable to our interest there in various forms. All of our acreage there has been drilled, then plumbed. It's maintained under or held by production rights there. We have not only significant Haynesville production reserves, but we also have shallower mostly [ph] reserves. And Haynesville is going to be the cornerstone of our gas business for a long, long time to come. And as we continue to watch gas prices and are bullish the second half of this decade, we think Haynesville is going to be an important part of our expanding gas business.","Moving on to our gas business. Our ultra-deep completions going forward, talking about that program. We're going to be active in completing the Davy Jones #2 well and also the Blackbeard West #1 well, and of course, Lineham Creek #1 well that Chevron [ph] is continuing to test at this point in time geologically and with the drill bit and with the coring opportunities to get all the data we need to put together a successful completion there.","So we look for an active production sequence on the ultra-deep with all the completions that we're going to be doing as we get on those early in 2014 toward getting some revenues out to the royalty owners by the end of 2014. That's our goal. All right? At the same point in time, exploration-wise, we're drilling our Lomond North well. It's moving toward the lower tertiary section, which is the primary objective and -- so stay tuned on that as those results become available.","We have a large exploratory inventory here. One of our goals as a company is to look at ways of managing our exploration expense and bringing in joint venture partners to help us participate. We have a couple of exciting opportunities. They're all very large, and we're going to continue to manage that growth in accordance what Richard talked about being disciplined and focused on returns and make sure that our exploration spending supports all of those activities and adds value every single day.","Speaking of adding value from the exploration standpoint, our Phobos well, which we were basically carried on our Phobos well to our Plains offshore structure with our great partner, EIG, there, we've found 250 feet of play in a nice column over 5,000- to 7,000-acre structure with Anadarko and Exxon. And this is just south of our Lucius infrastructure, so we're highly excited about the commercial aspects of Phobos and look forward to offsetting that well either late next year -- or late this year or sometime next year, in 2014.","So the Oil & Gas business, even though it's a couple of months old as far as Freeport-McMoRan is concerned, it's off and running, and we've hit the ground with a lot of great support from management and the board and look forward to being a big part of the story going forward.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks, Jim.","Let's go to Slide 20, and we'll update our outlook for the year. Our current sales outlook is for 4.1 billion pounds of copper. That reflects roughly 200 million pounds lower than we were in the first quarter for the reasons we talked about at Grasberg. Gold at 1.1 million ounces, molybdenum at 92 million pounds, oil at 35 million barrels equivalent, that's 65% oil. For those -- I know some of you are very familiar with oil and gas business and others less so, be careful with these barrels of equivalent. Because of tradition and some SEC rules, oil and gas is equated at 6:1 even though gas is selling today at $3.60 and oil at $110 a barrel. 65% of these equivalent barrels are oil, but oil represents over 90% or roughly 90% of the revenues.","Unit costs are projected at $1,300 gold at $1.58 a pound, $19 per barrels of equivalent. Operating cash flows, we're now looking at $3.15 copper at being at $5.8 billion. Each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year represents roughly $200 million. And capital expenditures of $5.5 billion, which is -- includes $4.4 billion from the mining business and $1.5 billion from the Oil & Gas business.","Our production profile, as we look forward through the -- for the end of the year and into 2015, shows our growth from completing our copper expansion projects, going from the 4 billion pound level to 5 billion pound level. The gold sales reflects the recovery of Grasberg and the access to higher-grade ore because of our mine sequencing.","Molybdenum sales reflect the operations of our byproduct from our copper mines, as well as Henderson and Climax. And the Oil & Gas sales outlook reflects the growth that Jim reviewed with you earlier.","From a unit production cost level, we expect to continue the positive performance on volumes and growth in our mines in North America, South America, as well as Africa. And then with the ramp-up of operations in Indonesia, we're looking at $1,300 gold of getting annual costs down to around $1.50 level, and then with significant improvements in that as we go forward into 2014.","Page 23 shows the cash flow generating capacity of our company. EBITDA charts are shown on the top, and operating cash flows, which is net of cash taxes and cash interest, is shown at the bottom. We show this at varying prices, ranging for copper prices from $3 to $4, with $13 gold, $10 molybdenum and $100 oil. And you can see within that range, EBITDA's ranging from $10 billion to $15 billion a year for 2014, 2015 average; operating cash flows at $8 billion to $12 billion; and then in 2016, when we have the benefit of these higher volumes, you see 40% increases in those numbers, with 2016 having EBITDA of $15 billion to $18 billion and operating cash flows of $12 billion to $16 billion. This shows the strength of these assets and how much cash they can generate.","Our sensitivity that we present each year is shown on -- each quarter is shown on Page 24. On an annual basis, each $0.10 change in copper is $330 million of operating cash flows. You can see molybdenum and gold variations, our oil sales variations, and then we've shown oil sale -- oil price variations net of our consumption of diesel within our mining operations. So that's for your use in terms of your modeling purposes.","Our revised capital expenditures are presented on Page 24. You can see that the mining capital has been reduced in 2013 and 2014 from previous levels, and some of those projects have been deferred to 2015. We are continuing to review those, and we will be responsive to market conditions in terms of how we spend capital and how we manage ourselves before in light of this really strong commitment to balance sheet management, which we show on Page 25.","Our total debt at June 30 was $20,500,000,000, just point out that it includes $700 million mark-to-market for some Plains debt. That gets amortized over time before its maturity. Maturity doesn't change. This is strictly just an accounting recording thing. This excludes here, on this chart, of the fair value adjustments.","Total debt, net of cash, and most of that cash will be used to fund capital expenditures going forward, is $17 billion. We have this commitment by 2016 to reduce this debt roughly to $12 billion level through strong -- using our cash flows, using capital operating cost discipline. We have a large resource base. We've started a divestiture process. We're considering other opportunities. We're going to respond to market conditions. That's the mandate of our board, and we have a number of ways to achieve that even if we have to face a period of low copper prices.","We also have some opportunities to refinance our balance sheet and to repay or refinance higher cost debt. We're going to be looking at market opportunities and the right time to do that.","At the end of the day, our financial policy remains the same, having a strong balance sheet, which we and our board have concluded as necessary and appropriate to manage this big resource base, so we can take advantage of it to create shareholder value. And we have these targeted debt reductions that we're going to achieve over the next 3 years, but we believe we can do it sooner than later.","We're going to invest in projects in a disciplined way and have strong financial returns. Our plan involves a commitment to our current dividend level of $1.25 per share. The board will, as always, review financial policy going forward and continue the Freeport long-standing tradition of looking to maximize shareholder value.","We have a strong and focused organization. As Jim Bob said, we're all on the same page in terms of looking at how we run this business for creating shareholder value. We're going to focus on execution, operational excellence, achieving production cost, managing costs and capital management and invest for returns, protect the balance sheet and our dividend, and that's what we are telling you today that our commitment is too.","And with that, Regina, we'll open the phone for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","I was very happy to see some spending restraint. But I'm a bit surprised to see a little bit -- not to see, a little bit slower approach at Cerro Verde. And I was wondering if you just go through the thought process again and elaborate a little bit as to why that project, why it's basically not touched here in terms of a little bit slower approach going forward.","Richard C. Adkerson","Yes, Tony. Tony raises a good point, just so everyone's aware of it. We have this project at Cerro Verde that we've been working on now for a number of years. We suspended it in '08, '09, started in earnest in 2010. We own the rights to this resource because of our existing operations. So it is a project that, from an ownership standpoint, would not be affected if we decided to defer it. And that is an option for us going forward. There are several factors that lead us to want to continue with this project so long as we can achieve our balance sheet management through other means. One of those has to do with the very positive relationships that we've developed with the local community and with the central government in Peru. As all of you -- all of the mining industry know, that's really unusual for major projects in Peru, where there gets to be competition often around water rights, often around community issues, and there's opposition in many cases and controversy with projects. Our team has done a great job in positioning this project to date where we haven't had those issues. We've worked with the city of Arequipa, the nearby city of Arequipa, second-largest city in Peru, where we've developed a positive deal by providing that city of 1 million-plus people with freshwater system. We're accessing water for our expansion through a wastewater collection and processing system, where previously the city was just dumping wastewater into the river. Now it will be collected, treated and we'll have access to water. We have negotiated a new financial tax royalty stability agreement that's in place. A deferral would result in us having to give up that stability agreement and go back at some future date to deal with it. So there's obviously also cost to mobilization -- demobilization. You add all of that up, and with the other alternatives that we have of achieving our goals for this debt reduction, and also in view of our long-term positive view about the copper market, we are currently have our plans of continuing that project but noting that it is an alternative available to us if market conditions are such that we need to act on it.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","All right, Richard. And if I could just have a follow-up. So the timing of the underground development in Indonesia, has that been pushed out a little bit because of the unfortunate incident there? And just to follow up there and -- how is that going to affect -- you're talking about the transition to 100% underground in kind of that 2016, 2017 timeframe. How should we think about that now?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, the -- our work in the underground development was interrupted for a period of time as a result of the accident. This is one area of our operations that throughout the strike and the labor issues of 2011, 2012, progressed very well. We have a great underground development team that Mark leads and our guys on the ground lead. And that was really -- that project was really, in many ways, going ahead of schedule for us. And so while this does represent a period of time where we had to divert attention away from it and we suspended operations, we don't feel that we are significantly off schedule for meeting our targets. Now as we get down to the last period of time of mining in the pit and so forth, there's likely to be changes as we try look for ways of maximizing the ore body. But at this point, we feel we'll be prepared to transition to underground when the time is right for just for information purposes. I know, Tony, you're well familiar with this. We've been mining -- we've been block caving since the early 1980s at Grasberg in a successful way. In our current full operating mode there, the underground operations provide more than 1\/3 of the throughput to our mill and through our DOZ mine. We are also expanding that ore body at depth with a Deep MLZ zone, which is scheduled really to start in 2015. And so all of that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to make this transition in an effective way. And we're going to be prepared for it. Mark, do you have...","Mark J. Johnson","That's correct. We still show Deep MLZ starting up in early 2015. The Grasberg Block Cave is still on schedule to be ready for us at the end of the pit. We did have some float in the schedule between the end of the pit and the start of the block cave, about 6 months. As Richard said, prior to this incident, we were exceeding our development meters. Our -- as we got the okay to start back up in those work areas, we really picked up without any issue. So we're optimistic that we'll be ready for those projects to start up on time.","Richard C. Adkerson","And I'll just point everybody to Slide 42 in your reference slides, which gives you a schedule of how this fits together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Jorge with DB. Just a quick question, maybe this is for Jim Flores. I wanted to understand the last guidance that was published before the deal was consummated was from December, and that showed about an oil and gas equivalent graph there showing 78 million barrels of oil equivalent for 2014 and 94 million for 2015. Those numbers have been pared back significantly to an average of roughly 60 million for both of those years. I do understand that some of this maybe just dropping out the ultra-deep stuff. But even on an apples-to-apples basis, it would seem that you're cutting your implied BOE guidance there by about 12% on average for 2014 and '15. And I just wanted to understand what was driving that.","James C. Flores","Jorge, there has been a modification of the expectations. Obviously, we've reduced CapEx about 20%. What the change there is really reduce the production growth rate at the Eagle Ford from a 15% growth rate to a 20% decline rate. But we saved $400 million of CapEx -- $300 million of CapEx there specifically, and we generated $300 million of free cash flow. So a $600 million swing in free cash flow. And then these low copper price environments, it's one of the things when you have $110 Brent oil, or you can get -- you can be a cash flow contributor. You saw it in the flexibility of our assets there. The leases are all owned by us, held by production. We can ramp back up the drilling and ramp back up the production, but we thought it was prudent from a standpoint facing debt reductions and low copper prices to generate free cash flow. So that's one area that happened. Additionally, the scheduling of equipment and completions in the ultra-deep, as you mentioned right there, was another area. And then the third area is the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico scheduling has been accelerated. And by -- what I mean by accelerated, we have 3 drill ships planned to be in the Gulf of Mexico next year drilling wells on all of our properties. That requires us to accelerate the development of the tieback facilities to our main production facilities. And when you do that, it takes -- there's a bit of construction time in each one of those facilities, somewhere between 45 and 60 days. Under the accelerated development plan, which will pay huge dividends in 2015 and 2016. 2014, however, we have scheduled 3 major platform modification periods of 60 days each, which all hit in the same year, which have the effect of reducing volumes during that year, but instead of having it spread out over the 3 years during that earlier forecast. So when you amplify that shutdown, which is basically a positive long term because it allows us to bring in all the additional production and meet those goals of triple our production out in the Gulf of Mexico on the oil side and the gas side in the next 5 years, it's unfortunate from a modeling perspective. But I don't think it's just a framework between the Eagle Ford, the ultra-deep and the scheduling in the Deepwater while we've modified our volume. However, we've been able to maintain our free cash flow because of the modifications in CapEx.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jim, sorry, is the idea of not bringing forward the Eagle Ford cash flow to run, as you're saying, to save cash flow, to contribute something up to the Freeport holding company to help in the deleveraging process? Or are you still standing by the idea that the Oil & Gas assets, broadly speaking, are free cash flow neutral to the deleveraging process?","James C. Flores","Both. We're going to be sending cash flow up to the corporation. That's depending on the oil price. Our oil prices are significantly stronger than the $100 a barrel price in our models and so forth. That can mean every $10 of additional $350 million to $400 million of additional cash flow. At least it's going to be funding its own CapEx when you talk about reducing CapEx and reducing volumes. In the strong price environment, we can do that, and that's not always the case, but that's what's going to happen going forward. We will cover our costs.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And sorry, if I could just have a follow-up question with Richard, just on the Indonesian side of the fence. All these changes that again, the Indo government continues to propose in terms of the banning of concentrate and raw material exports out of the country. Can you again confirm that you are unaffected by these potential regulatory changes there?","Richard C. Adkerson","We have under our contract of work, which is a, as you know, Jorge, but just for -- to make sure that I say this. The contract has -- was adopted by the Indonesian government, has the status of law. And under that contract, it provides us the right to export our concentrates. In 2009, the government passed a law, which restrict exports of ore. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has adopted a regulation that extends that to concentrates. And that's where you hear these comments that come out of Indonesia, which, as a democratic society, you hear a lot of comments as you do here in the press. So we are working in connection with seeking an extension of our contract, which we have the right to have that extension, requires government approval to find ways of working with the government cooperatively to reach a mutually satisfactory answer to this. We have advised the government that we will work with any entities that seeks to develop smelters. We have a commitment to supporting businesses in Indonesia but doing that in a way that protects the interest of our shareholders. And we are continuing those discussions. Recently, government officials have targeted completing our and others' contracts of work discussions this year, and we're prepared to do that and hopeful that, that will be successful and from a timing standpoint. But we have confidence, absolute confidence about our ability to continue to operate as evidenced by the investments we're making in our underground mines, which will be generating their cash flows essentially after 2021 when -- which is the extension period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","How is it going with the labor negotiations? You mentioned in the press release that it has restarted. I was just wondering if it's -- you expect it to go to the end? Or do you think there'll be a conclusion before the contract is finished in September -- in November, I'm sorry?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. Thank you, Sal. The labor negotiations had just had their kick-off meeting in early May right before we had the accident on May 14. And so it was suspended until the last couple of weeks when we restarted our operations and the preliminary discussions have begun. There is a recognition by all interested parties, including the union, our management, the local community, the central government, that a strike would not be in anybody's interest. And so we start out from that standpoint. We had a framework for dealing with wage adjustments that was part of our agreement in 2011 in the last negotiations where we had the extended strike. We're certainly prepared to work with the union on a timely basis. The union has made public comments within the last week that they're targeting completing the negotiations quickly. And so that's the goal right now. I mean, so we will just continue to work and report to you as that progresses, but that's the framework that we're really starting the discussions right now.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one more thing on the underground operation. The ramp-up is going to be another year, looks like middle of 2014 you mentioned in the press release. I was just wondering is it you're being more cautious or is it normal that it takes that long from about 40,000 tons per day to 80,000 per ton, which is the optimal level you want to be.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, Sal, I know that you've watched us for a long time, you watched us develop the DOZ initially, and you saw just the nature and block caving operations is that ramp-ups takes time. We're working on it as quickly as we can safely do it. We certainly hope to be able to do it before the middle of next year. And we're making progress now in achieving that. As always, our guys, as we set these plans on a basis that we have confidence that we can achieve them. And then we work on trying to maximize those plans as we go forward, and we've had a lot of success doing that historically. And so we will -- we're tackling it. We're going at it full stream -- full steam on a safe basis, and I think we have a good chance of beating it. Mark?","Mark J. Johnson","That's right. We have a number of objectives in the DOZ, just not tonnage. We've got a very high-grade section of the orebodies that's in the skarn. We balance that with the diorites that are higher in gold. And so our schedules, although tonnage is one of the measures, we have a lot of things that we're managing. We're going at it to maximize the value of DOZ. We've got some ongoing repairs that were there pre-existing the incident, and we're picking up, and we're making good progress on that. The ramp-up to date has gone or exceeded what we'd expected just for these last couple of weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Richard, I just wondered if you can kind of talk more broadly about how you see the copper business in several years in terms of once you ramp these expansions and transition in the underground, do you see any more meaningful shifts in the unit cost profile of the business? And also what do you think an appropriate level of maintenance spending for the copper business will look like at that time?","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks. We're focused on these expansion projects, and the expansion in Cerro Verde and Morenci is basically coming in on unit cost that's consistent with our current operations. At Tenke, that expansion also is unit cost is consistent with current operations. We keep working -- because of that high grades of that ore there, we believe we have the opportunity to drive the unit cost down. A lot of our costs are dealt with -- deal with logistics and power that are -- where we have cheap power now, but we have power supply concerns. And all of that just ties into doing business in that particular country, in that particular location. So we're focused on that. At Grasberg, transition to the underground period will allow that mine to continue as a world-class mine from a cost -- unit cost standpoint. And that all depend on the price of fuel, the price of gold and so forth, but it'll be high volumes, low cost. Then if you look beyond that, in the longer-range future for Freeport, is we have this enormous reserve base and resource base. We'll reach production levels of about 5 billion pounds a year and at $2 copper, we have proved and probable reserves of in excess of 120 billion or 100 billion pounds. And then we have resources beyond that of equivalent amounts of identified copper with our existing mines. Over half of that is in the United States, and it's typical of our current production, relatively low-grade, large resources, but we see those costs coming in consistent with the level of our current operations. So you need to -- just like I was talking about in the oil and gas business, you need to look at gas and oil separately. In our business, you need to look at Indonesia as one set of assets, Africa as one set of assets with tremendous growth opportunities, very high grades. And then in Americas, kind of the standard of what the global copper industry has available to it is resources that have relatively low grades. The thing that we have as a benefit in relation to the rest of the industry is ours are brownfield expansions. And the projects that are challenging are greenfield expansion with low grades and big infrastructure development, lots of pre-stripping and those sorts of things, which we don't have with our operations. So we think with the positive copper movement going forward for a very long period of time, we will have a series of growth opportunities that take time, take permitting, take resources. That's why copper prices are above and likely to continue to be above production cost.","Curtis Rogers Woodworth - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Great. And one follow-up if I may. Can you kind of characterize the incremental CapEx or savings opportunities? Is that going to be somewhat market dependent where if the copper price were to remain weak, then you would look to accelerate those types of plans? Or do you think that -- you had $1.9 billion you've announced, just kind of the first layer of that process, and there's incremental savings opportunities you're going to look to pursue regardless of the market climate over the next 12 to 18 months?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, I can't say enough the way Red and his team have approached this. I mean, we saw the situation in the market volatility develop in June. We saw the need to reduce our debt, and our guys went at it in a very disciplined and quick way just like we did in 2008, 2009. We don't see this situation as anywhere near the challenges or the fears of 2008, 2009. But we started this, as I said, as a first step. It's a continuing process, and we'll be looking at our business in mining and oil and gas with the continuation of doing it. And of course, if market conditions deteriorate, we'll have to do more, and we have the ability to do more both from cost reduction activities and then from being innovative in the way that we extract value out of this broad set of assets. And that could lead to lots of situations, joint venture arrangements in both sets of assets. We looked at MLP opportunities. We've looked at other types of kind of financial, engineering type things. We just have a lot of options to do it. The message that all of us wanting to get across to you today is the message our board has given us. And I know we read -- we've read some skepticism about it because of low copper prices, but we are committed to maintain the strong balance sheet, and we've got ways of doing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Duarte with Omega Advisors.","Adam Duarte","On the potential oil and gas asset sale, can you give us a little more detail around the assets, things like commodity mix and reserves associated with the asset and CapEx? And the second question is conceptually speaking, how did you arrive at this asset as being appropriate for sale?","James C. Flores","Adam, it's Jim. We're right at the beginning of our early stages of the sales process, and we've signed confidentiality agreements with buyers and the process of getting that process started. So I don't want to give a whole lot of -- I don't want to expound on a bunch of details that are in that process. But what we're looking for is somewhere between $500 million and $700 million worth of capital out of the Gulf of Mexico shelf business. The Gulf of Mexico shelf conventional is an area that is not a primary growth target for our company. There's other companies out there that see opportunities out there and the risk profile that more fits their needs, as Richard talked about and Jim Bob has also expounded on is the large diversity of assets we have and growth opportunities. But the thing to really to focus on is the high quality of our asset base and the high quality of the growth opportunities that we're going to prune off the ones that don't fit our profile. And so that's basically what we do. And in aspects like the Gulf of Mexico, which is so dynamic, we do have a large position there on the shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and also in the Gulf Coast as well as deepwater. So the process of trimming back in an area and then also reestablishing based on seismic interpretation and so forth is always a possibility. So this was basically one of the easiest places to reallocate our manpower resources to our existing assets and still it raises significant amount of capital and a business that just doesn't fit the new profile of Freeport-McMoRan.","Adam Duarte","So is it safe to say that sort of in the hierarchy of criteria of growth, when you look at your oil and gas assets growth is -- or the ability to achieve, growth is very, very high in the list?","James C. Flores","Well, it's 2 forms. In this large framework of Freeport, you can see where free cash flow is becoming a big aspect for the oil and gas business not only -- we've always focused on it and our business, but we've always used it as reinvestment capital. There's a return on assets, a return on capital structure here at Freeport that we have to adjust to and blend to, and therefore, some of our assets like California and Eagle Ford and so forth that we can find ways to maximize out of these [ph] structures. Like Richard talked about, we're looking at -- seriously looking at an MLP structure that makes -- that would make a lot of sense when we're trading 4.5x cash flow when you can start trading at an 8x cash flow of your assets that qualify. Of all those things, this new family of assets here at Freeport between the copper, oil and gas and gold, has given us an opportunity to be more flexible in structure and try to frame out that value and also accelerate not only the growth of our volumetric assets like the deepwater and the ultra-deep and assets like that, but also some of our free cash flowing assets, be able to rein out value there through the innovative MLP structure. So as we continue to research this and start thinking about putting it together and think about it. Even if that's on the copper side, I think it's going to be exciting days ahead of real value realization. We don't need to create a lot of value. We need to get realized for the value we've already created in these assets, especially at these oil prices.","Richard C. Adkerson","And I'll just say, just like I was talking about the growth from the resource base in mining, these growth opportunities in the deepwater from these big structures and the undeveloped, unexploited nature of the resource there that we'll now have access to, the ultra-deep exploration leverage that we have there, this really significant position in Haynesville and the U.S. natural gas business, which we all believe has the opportunity to have a lot of value down the road. As we deal with this near-term directive to reduce debt, we've all got our eyes on the long-term ability to grow in across our set of businesses.","James C. Flores","Just for everybody, remember the analyst day presentation. Those were not exploratory opportunities. We have a long list of development opportunities. We're -- our cup runneth over on growth opportunities and the aspect of present value and those in today's market and also our -- of the reserves that aren't going to grow is one of the high priorities especially in this deleveraging market. So we're totally in sync on all of these.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Oscar Cabrera - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Let me just start, Richard, the -- a clarification, please. During the analyst day, you mentioned CapEx and divestments and savings of about $1.5 billion. So are the asset sales in addition to the $1.9 billion you're presenting now?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yes.","Oscar Cabrera - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Okay, that's easy. Next, would it be possible to provide us with color on -- as to the oil and gas capital expenditures? So what is the percentage of -- how much is being allocated to each one of the regions?","Richard C. Adkerson","In each one of the regions. Slide 24 shows the aggregate oil and gas capital expenditures.","Kathleen L. Quirk","There's also, Oscar -- this is Kathleen -- in the press release on Page 13 shows what we incurred in June and what the outlook looks like for the second half of the year, which was $1.3 billion in total, $400 million for the deepwater, similar amount in Eagle Ford and $200 million in the ultra-deep.","Oscar Cabrera - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just trying -- okay. Now just trying -- and Richard, I'm just trying to assess how much, assuming [ph] Jim talked about the decline in CapEx in the Eagle Ford and wanted to assess how much capital he's been putting for each one of those. I can check back with you if that's easier.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay, good, but that's -- for everybody's purposes, look at that, and Oscar, give us a call, and we'll follow up with you on it.","Oscar Cabrera - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then...","James C. Flores","Oscar, just Eagle Ford specific, we're cutting -- we're going from about $600 million of CapEx in the Eagle Ford down to about $300 million of CapEx, Eagle Ford specific. So if that helps you in the meantime.","Richard C. Adkerson","And we're maintaining capital expenditure in California to keep production volumes up and then...","James C. Flores","Accelerate the deepwater today.","Richard C. Adkerson","The deepwater is where we have the chance of really having major incremental [indiscernible] to create shareholder value, and that's the focus for future growth near term and longer term.","Oscar Cabrera - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And similarly, with respect to operating costs, you give us the global $19 a barrel. Would it be possible to on a later date, I don't know [indiscernible], just to get a segmentation of the -- on the different areas of oil and gas production?","Kathleen L. Quirk","There's a slide, Oscar, in the back in reference slides, which takes you through that. Just looking for the number here. I think it's 31. It shows you by region what the operating cost profile looks like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","As it relates to the ultra-deep gas, could you explain how and when you'll decide to double up versus fold your cards for the big winners and losers and specifically the Davy Jones 1 and 2? And I'm not -- by no means do -- please don't misunderstand me that it's a bad idea. I just think that heat and pressure and temperature varies greatly from spot to spot, so some are going to be easier to complete and others won't. Specifically last month, when you described the 30,000 feet to Davy Jones drill muds solidifying, it almost sounded like the pressure and temperature is like a rift kiln [ph], and frac-ing lends itself to sedimentary layers of shale as opposed to bricks. So that's kind of my thought process. You know how the Comstock in the 1870s, the miners took ice baths every 30 minutes because it was so hot. In other places, it's not like that, that conditions will vary from spot to spot.","James R. Moffett","John, let me say that's why we've been waiting on the results on grounds like Lomond North at Davy Jones. We're waiting on the data from Lineham Creek. We're looking at all of that. And we're also looking at the deepwater. We had some new information. We have the so-called inboard, outboard cost. And what we're finding out there, the sedimentary character of the rock changed significantly as you go from the southern end of the basin to the middle of the basin called inboard, outboard. We're going to have that same thing. And as we go onshore, as we tried to explain to you, we're in shallower depths, and our temperature's going down. Our pressure is going down. Well, as far as north [ph] solidifying bricks and all that, it is not near as eccentric as you described it. So -- but the answer is, as I've said to you before and made an example, if you look at the gestures and then try to [ph] -- if you take them to 4 bore holes that we have to the real cost on the shelf and onshore, that covers up [ph] less than 1\/4 of your debt. And we're trying to figure out 200 square mile of area onshore and 200 square mile area on the shale. We're going to get a lot of information. But the sensitivity that you're talking about, that's all part of trying to pick the sweet spot every play and exploration whether it's a shale play or the ultra-deep or the deepwater has a sweet spot. And then we hear an update now on how we're going to be able to that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question for Jim. I don't know if you've talked a bit about the exploration things. But could you just maybe summarize any couple of -- 2 or 3 things where you do expect an update in third or fourth quarter of this year on exploration side?","James C. Flores","Sure. On -- initially, the Lomond North and our plans for going forward on Lineham Creek, those 2 projects in ultra-deep will be involved in our decision-making process in the third and fourth quarter. Other than that, it's going to be our Holstein drilling as our rig becomes active on our platform, first time it's been active in about 10 years that we've got a lot of great projects to drill, so we'll begin drilling our deepwater projects in the fourth quarter of 2013. Then '14, you're looking at our Terra project. It's going to be drilled, so very high, high potential Lucius look-alike project. That's going to be drilled in second quarter of '14 to start off, as well as following up with additional projects like England and maybe Martinique. So we'll have a full schedule and calendar starting at '14 going forward of -- for our exciting exploration that we're leveraging into. But as far as the '13 is Lomond, Lineham Creek and then our Holstein development starting in the deepwater.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And second and final question on Grasberg probably for Mark. Is there any total mill rate or the DOZ mill rate that you're targeting for the year-end 2013?","Mark J. Johnson","Yes, we'll be, in DOZ, we'll be up to 70,000 tons at the end of the year. The total mill rate will be 210, 220. We'll also be bringing up the Big Gossan. We'll likely begin to ramp up again. We took some of the resources from Big Gossan in the third quarter and allocated them to development crews and to the DOZ. So we'll be at the 210 to 220. 2014 will be roughly 225.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you give a little more color on the commentary you made earlier about considering refinancing the balance sheet and the higher cost debt? And in particular, how -- talk to any updated views on how Freeport looks at potential decline from the BHP bonds?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Carly, this is Kathleen. That is a priority of ours. We've got just under $2 billion in debt that we can use equity callbacks for. And so we'll be looking to do that either with cash flow generated or asset sales or refinancing. But that debt will be our most economic debt to repay in the near term, so we're very focused on that. We've also got a series of securities within the assumed debt that have calls over the next few years, and so we'll be looking at that, and we're going to be opportunistic about that and looking at what makes sense economically. But it is an objective of ours over time to refinance the balance sheet into more of an investment-grade type of a balance sheet.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is there any -- is there a specific timing that we should be thinking about for at least the callback portion of the bonds?","Kathleen L. Quirk","We're going to be looking to do that just as soon as we can. We're looking at free cash flow generation, as well as some of these other initiatives that are underway.","Richard C. Adkerson","All right. We appreciate everybody's interest and participation, and we look forward to reporting success as we go forward this year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call includes forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is here; Mark Johnson is on the line; and Mike Kendrick is also here.","I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook using the prepared slide presentation materials that are on our website. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $31 million, or $0.02 a share in the first quarter of 2019. After adjusting for net charges of $36 million, or $0.03 a share which are detailed on page -- roman numeral VI of the press release, adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $67 million or $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2019.","Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for the first quarter totaled $778 million. A reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA calculation is available on page 28 of our slide deck. Our sales for the first quarter totaled 784 million pounds of copper, 242,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum. As expected our sales volumes were lower than the year ago quarter associated -- primarily associated with the transition at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia.","Our copper and gold sales were approximately 5% lower than the January 2019 sales estimates of 825 million pounds and 255,000 ounces of gold. This reflects the weather impacts at the events that we had at El Abra during the quarter, which normal operations have now been restored, unscheduled maintenance at one of our North American sites and the timing of some shipments from Indonesia.","Our quarterly average realized price for the first quarter was $2.90 per pound. That was slightly below last year's first quarter average price of $3.11 per pound. And our gold realized price of $1291 per ounce was slightly below last year's first quarter of $1312 per ounce. Our consolidated average net unit cash cost net of byproduct credits was $1.78 per pound in the first quarter of 2019.","As anticipated the unit net cash costs were higher than the first quarter of 2018 average of $0.98 per pound and that primarily reflected the lower sales volume from Indonesia. We generated operating cash flows of $534 million in the first quarter and we funded capital expenditures including capital expenditures associated with our underground development and with the Lone Star development totaling $622 million.","During March, we redeemed all of our outstanding notes due 2020. That was $1 billion in debt redemption during March. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in consolidated cash and $9.9 billion in consolidated debt. We had no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility.","I'll now turn the call over to the Richard, who will be referring to our slide presentation materials.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, everyone. The first quarter for Freeport was really straightforward. We are pleased to report that we are on track with our plans that we discussed at our last earnings call and across the board our business is going in a normal fashion.","As a result, we haven't made any significant changes to our operational outlook and our important initiatives that we have that we're working on these two years of transition at Grasberg are proceeding as scheduled and as planned. This is the first quarter of those two years. And as we look forward to the ramping up Grasberg to sustainable levels, it's going to be a good time for our company. A note, we just published our new annual report and it showcases our assets the strength and quality of our geographically diverse portfolio of mining assets and the inherent fundamental values that these assets provide.","Going forward and looking forward we have a very clear strategy that we are confident will grow value for shareholders. The important accomplishment we achieved in recent years to strengthen our balance sheet to reach a resolution of our longstanding issues on our contract in Indonesia and providing some clear-cut long-range opportunity to operate in a stable fashion really position us to deliver on this commitment to build values for our shareholders.","Our 2019 priorities as part of the strategy is listed on page 4 of the slide deck. Here at the company we are laser focused on executing these priorities during 2019 and are diverting any plans for major new capital investments or looking at M&A activity because we are confident that success -- if we are successful and we believe we will be in achieving these priorities that that's what's going to drive the future values of our company.","In Indonesia, the ramp-up of the underground mines are going well proceeding on schedule. I'll cover other milestones later in the presentation. In the Americas, we're really focused now on productivity cost control and discipline across all of our operations. We're pleased with the success that Red Conger and his team are achieving. In that regard our Lone Star project is on schedule and it's going -- it's not a huge capital investment but it's a profitable one. And we continue really to be encouraged by exploratory drilling and analysis results for this asset, which we believe has the outlook of growing to a world-class resource.","We continue to study, evaluate and rank potential future growth projects to establish long-term value opportunities for our company.","But as I said, for the next couple years, we're in the study mode as opposed to the committing capital mode. The success on all these objectives combined with what we expect to be a positive future copper market environment, and that's a consensus across the industry will provide values for our shareholders.","Turning to page 3, we list out the attributes of our company that have been consistent: leading copper producer, responsible operator, great set of long-lived assets that can be operated in an attractive cost, structure, the portfolio. It\u2019s difficult to -- it would be difficult for anyone to replicate. We've got significant current production volumes, which we can continue by managing our existing sets of assets.","I mentioned our potential future growth options. And we've got a proven track record for superior execution. Since acquiring Phelps Dodge 12 years ago, we've had success. We've managed major expansions of our assets. When the time was right, the expansion at Cerro Verde improves a prime example of that. But we also, in two phases built great mine in the Congo with Tenke Fungurume. We expanded Morenci. We expanded our Climax mine.","And we've shown what we can do in terms of execution and building assets, and in operating assets. And we have a benefit for our company that's really a significant one. We operate all the mines that we have interest in. And that allows us to share expertise to find things that work in one place, and spread it across the company, and to be able to allocate resources people equipment, supply chain issues on a company-wide basis.","With the steps, we've taken over the past three years, we are now financially strong. We'll get stronger. We are positive about the outlook of the copper business, and seen nothing in recent developments to change that view. And we have a clear strategy of building values for the shareholders.","I previously referenced a slide on page four that talks about what we're going to be doing this year, and looking into next year. Focused on the transition at Grasberg in the Americas, productivity cost controls, and also in Eastern Arizona advancing the Lone Star project, and assessing long-term opportunities. And so, we're confident about what we're doing.","Looking at an operations update in North America, we are making progress in this productivity cost control management. We're using advanced analytics. We started a project at our Bagdad mine as in effect a text case. It's been very successful in terms of using -- it's doing things that we always knew how to do, and we had a team to do it.","What we're doing now is using data capabilities to measure things, and respond to them very quickly. You hear a lot about this across all industries. So this is not anything that's different, but applying it in a business like ours is not something that people intuitively think about.","We brought in McKinsey and other outside experts to work with us. We're really encouraged by what's happening in Bagdad now. The next stop is going to be Morenci. But across the board, we're going to be using this big data analytics to help make our business better, reduce our costs, improve productivity.","In Cerro -- in South America, the Cerro Verde mine continues just to excel. It's exceptional. The mill, which was originally designed to add to our 120,000 tons per day existing facility, 240,000 tons today is operating well over name play continues to have opportunities to further improve. And so, that has us focused on de-bottlenecking the rest of the business to take advantage of these processing facilities that we have.","Our volumes were off in the first quarter in the Americas. The principal reason for that was at El Abra, the driest place in the world. I mean Atacama Desert this is at altitude moisture just doesn't get across the Andes to this part of the world.","But in the second quarter, in a week's time -- in the first quarter, in a week's time, we had 10 years' worth of rain at this site. 10 years' worth of rain. It was a major flood event. We were out 35 days. The team responded very well to restore our operations. And now we're -- by mid-March, we're up and running again in a normal fashion. We also helped the people in the local community. It was an extraordinary event that had a big impact.","We also had a sales impact, because we were pushing a turnaround at our Miami smelter in Arizona. It's part of our productivity where we're trying to extend the time before we started the turnaround. I think Red, it was 10 days or 15 days before we were going to shut down anyway. We had an event in the furnace, and that knocked that smelter out for a period of time in the first quarter.","So you see there's a difference between our production numbers and our sales numbers, and that was because of the cut-off to the marketplace we had because of this event at the smelter. It's up and running again. All those volumes are going to be going through. It shows up in our unit cost numbers, because we had lower volumes, lower sales volumes. And so, otherwise our costs were pretty much in line with what we were looking for.","In Indonesia, Grasberg, we're competing the final phases of the Grasberg open pit. Our plans call for that to happened midyear this year. We may have an opportunity to extend that. It's very high-grade material, but it's an issue of where we're focused on the long term. We're going to do this safely. And the underground ramp-up is proceeding as planned. So this is what's going on with us.","On slide 6, we have these efficiency measures that we're taking through using data innovation. I mentioned the Bagdad team that we formed across our board using our metallurgists, our operators the process control team. We've got big data experts from our organization and from the outside. We're using this information technology to do very basic things about running the mill, making sure that we have, the right grind for the right ore dispatching in our mine operations.","Just bringing all the basics together, with using information technology to make us a lot better, and we're really encouraged by the initial results at Bagdad. We have a 12% increase in mill throughput. We've increased recoveries. All this doing without much capital being put into it. So it's very profitable. As I said, we're now taking it to Morenci, and we'll be using our information that we have across the board.","And if we are able to achieve, which we think we will be a 10% increase through productivity measures, that's equivalent to adding 20 million pounds of copper a year annually with virtually no capital. So we want to continue to use technology to standardize our systems and processes, and to help us achieve this kind of meaningful addition to our volume.","Lone Star is really taking shape. Those of you, who follow us, know this is a long known resource. It's adjacent to our Safford mine, which was just being -- beginning production 12 years ago. It's original oxide deposit. Resources are being depleted. This is right across the mountain ridge from Morenci. And so we are now in the phase of mining a leach oxide deposit, that we will be able to process at our excess facilities at the adjacent Safford mine as that mine wraps down.","So this allows us to profit from this oxide cover over a major sulfide resource that we're working to understand. And it's an $850 million project that we spent, just under $400 million of that by the end of the quarter. It's got very favorable economics. And will give us 200 million pounds a year of copper, with expansion opportunities for the oxide. So, we're doing that.","But the really exciting thing long-run is this is serving as a stripping exercise over what we are seeing as a major sulfide resource. And we've shown some drill holes reserves that we're seeing. And we're beginning long-term plans about how we would develop that resource.","It would be a major mill investment. But, literally as we look at this it has the potential of being another Morenci which is the flagship mine of our operations -- or the industry's operations in North America. We're really excited about it.","I mentioned that Cerro Verde with this outperformance by the mill that we're having. You can see with the 360,000 tons nameplate, we're operating well above that. Indications are we can continue to do that.","And so that means we're processing 15% more ore than originally designed. And now we're looking about how to feed the mill, how to make the movement from the mine to mill more efficient, but also how to attack the mine in a way to get more ore to it.","So, we began this process just three years ago early 2016 after a $4.5 billion $5 billion expansion project that was completed at the end of 2015 going into 2016. So we're three years into it. It's improving debottlenecking. It's a great asset. And we're real proud of it.","So, PT-FI underground transition. How long we've been looking for this. It was something for me. My first trip to the job site was -- in Papua was in the first quarter of 1988 when we were just drilling the original drill holes.","Now we're seeing that pit being completed major activity there. And now, going forward, just by the end of the year we'll be totally underground with the Grasberg Block Cave which is the same ore body extending beneath the open pit. It's got about $1 billion tons of reserves at 1% copper and 0.72 grams per ton gold on average.","As we've been working in recent years on all these matters we've been working with an Indonesia and going through all the issues there Mark Johnson and his team have really done a great job in investing in the infrastructure to get us in place to kick this mine off as we're doing right now.","So we are -- we're making great progress in the first quarter. We've been focused at the Grasberg Block Cave on expanding the cave and opening drawbells. We had 11 drawbells opened by the end of the first quarter. One was blasted in December and 10 in the quarter. We're five drawbells ahead of schedule.","Undercutting of the new face in that mine is proceeding, this is really two mines in 1, three faces going on in those two mines and this is ore that we've been mining now for 30 years. So it's the same ore. We know the chemistry of it. We don't expect any issues associated with processing and so forth.","The adjacent mine, which is a separate mineralization feature altogether is the Deep MLZ mine. This is the latest deepest extension of mining in a Block Cave underground at Freeport began in the early 1980s.","And after our work in the first quarter we're on target for development against a forecast to get this mine up to stream. It's been delayed because we encountered seismic events.","In response to that, we -- our team which is very experienced and we brought a team of global experts into play have designed a program of using hydraulic fracking which has been used in South America, but not in our operations previously to precondition this harder than expected rock, so that we can promulgate caving in a normal fashion.","To date, we've hydro fracked, 14 holes nine from the DOZ truck level and five from the undercut level. The seismic response to this has been positive. And so we are very encouraged about it. It's working so well that we are likely to build this into an ongoing feature in mining the Deep MLZ mine.","Now, we are really taking this mine in two faces. There's a production block 2 which we are opening up the cave area to the west of the current cave. This provides a second separate working face. It will grow the hydraulic radius faster. And we'll be in better shape.","And by doing this we're now on track of meeting our targets for ramping up this to meet our original targets. So, all of this is going well. We've got the really significant reserves there of these two mines. And we're on track to continue to achieve what we've set out to achieve and meet our plan.","On page 10 -- slide 10, we have the ramp-up of the underground. You can see the impact of completing mining in the open pit in 2019. Mark and his guys are looking at perhaps getting a bit more out of the pit, but as I said, our focus is going to be how can we, get back up to sustainable levels on our timeframe.","So after two years of ore volumes we will begin ramping up. And you can see how that works with the Grasberg Block Cave beginning this year and then basically doubling every year up to 130,000 tons a day. And that will be our primary asset going beyond 2023.","The Deep MLZ mine is also ramping up going from 27,000 tons per day in the mine in 2020 to almost 60,000, 80,000 and long-term 80,000. So, we're on track to get these sustainable volumes coming out of these mines, feeding our mill at over 200,000 tons per day which is a major accomplishment in terms of having large-scale underground mining. And we're on track to get it done.","There's a lot of talk about copper markets. As usual we were down in CESCO, talked with everybody down there. So, we have seen nothing to change our fundamental view about, the positive outlook from a fundamental standpoint.","When you look at the long-term reduced percentage growth in China, but the sheer amount of copper that would be required for that economy with the mature markets our current business in the United States has been strong.","Over the past couple of years we supply about one-third of the downstream copper to the U.S. market from our mines in the U.S. and it's really, really tight. But longer-range, you're looking at what's the emerging markets are going to require.","You certainly see that in Indonesia. I mean, I spent a lot of time in Jakarta and just watching the cranes and seeing the growth in that economy and that's true all across Southeast Asia into Latin America and ultimately Eastern Europe and Africa. So it's a -- we feel very confident about the fundamentals of copper it's qualities and its need for the world's economy.","Things that will add to it over time in terms of the growing electrification of the world, the use of alternative energy, electronics and everything we do electric vehicles and so forth, we feel very good about the demand for copper and the project pipeline remains thin. And we know as an experienced operator what it takes to develop new projects. And we also know that others in the industry are going to share our disciplined approach to what we do going forward. So we believe that a significant long-term structural deficit remains in place and that our assets and their ability to address this deficit we're going to create great values for our shareholder.","For the year, we are looking at producing 3.3 billion pounds of copper 800 million ounces of gold, just under 800 million ounces of gold -- 800,000 ounces of gold and just under 100 million pounds of molybdenum. Site production costs are going to be higher than the long-term sustainable amounts because of lower volumes with the Grasberg transition.","And our operating cash costs depending on the price of copper will come close to funding our CapEx over these two years. And our current dividend may fall a bit short again depending on the price of copper. But the company is financially strong and certainly has the financial flexibility to deal with that. And then coming are details for our production coming out of the two years and seeing the significant increase in copper and gold sales as we ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ will provide substantial cash flows and that's shown on slide 14 where we have -- where we show the cash flows for the transition year of 2020 and averages for the next two years.","You can see at $3 copper, it goes from just over $4 billion to $7.5 billion and if copper prices are higher that delta gets much higher. So we're set up to have a situation of really benefiting from the ramp-up in underground and Grasberg having potentially good copper markets. We're focused on keeping a strong balance sheet. We should have opportunities to further reduce our debt in the future. We're going to be disciplined about investments. For the time being, we'll maintain our current dividend. The board is looking forward to days in the future when we can increase it and believe that we're real well positioned. It's been a good quarter and we're going to be continued focused on execution.","So with that, we will open the line up for your questions and look forward to hearing them.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Piyush Sood","Hey guys, good morning. A couple of questions. First one, the 2021 outlook on costs of $1.30, what are you assuming for export duties out of Indonesia? Do you see them falling versus the 5% level right now? Or are you holding them at 5%?","A \u2013 Kathleen Quirk","Once we get to a certain level of construction progress on the smelter they fall to zero. And so we're expecting during that period of time that our export duties will fall away in Indonesia.","Q \u2013 Piyush Sood","So that would mean that you probably hit the threshold which take these export duties down to zero. So maybe the construction on the smelter -- or at least the progress on the smelter has to start happening soon to meet that timeline?","A \u2013 Richard Adkerson","It's already started. We had a commitment to build the smelter with our December agreements. And with that agreement we're full. As I said I think at a conference we're full-throttle on the smelter development. We've got a site, we're working with engineers. We've met the initial targets that the government had set. So we are in progress with it right now. We didn't start it in earnest until we got the agreement with the government in December. So we had done some initial prep work, but now we're full-throttling into it.","Q \u2013 Piyush Sood","We read that PT Amman the owners of Batu Hijau will likely go ahead with their own smelter, so they might be less inclined to partner with the PTFI. Is that something you would comment on? And if that's true, would you be open to other international partners?","A \u2013 Richard Adkerson","The answer is yes to both of those questions. We have a great relationship with Amman people. We've known them for a long time. We had discussions about doing something together and we still may. At the present time, they've concluded, they need to do something at Sumbawa. We looked at that decided it didn't work for us. So we're focused on East Resik and continue to talk with them about whether they might join us there. At the present time that's not the plan. And yes, we are talking with potential other international investors who might have an interest in the offtake.","Q \u2013 Piyush Sood","And last one for me. The reduction in gold guidance in 2021, do you think that's largely just a rounding of the total? Or is that because of some changes to mine planning?","A \u2013 Kathleen Quirk","No that's actually just a rounding change. We had just a slight -- real slight change in gold output which rounded from 1.6 million ounces to 1.5 million ounces. So wasn't a -- and the same thing with the capital expenditures for this year. It was less than a $50 million change, but just because of the rounding it rounded up.","Q \u2013 Piyush Sood","All right. Thanks for the color and all the best.","A \u2013 Richard Adkerson","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Matthew Korn","Hey good morning Richard. Good morning Kathleen.","A \u2013 Richard Adkerson","Good morning.","Q \u2013 Matthew Korn","It's Matthew Korn here. So you've given us a walk to your cost expectations for 2021. What kind of indications can you give us around 2020? Because I'm looking at your slide 14 in which you lay out the EBITDA levels indicated and I see that what you now expect for 2020 copper at $3, looks a lot like what the average last quarter for 2019 and 2020 looked like. So how can we think about -- the volumes aren't going to increase that much in terms of Grasberg, but if there -- should we see any substantial cost improvement that will actually flow through?","A \u2013 Kathleen Quirk","We do expect to see lower unit costs in 2019 -- I mean 2020 versus 2019 stepping down somewhat not getting to $1.30 like we talked about for 2021, but it will step down some during 2020.","Q \u2013 Matthew Korn","All right. And then I...","A \u2013 Richard Adkerson","And I'll just say with having the new structural deal, with having this progress we're making on the underground advancement, Mark has been working with us and his team is really going to be focused on cost efficiencies at Grasberg and we think there's some opportunities there. We know there are opportunities there and we're going to find them.","Matthew Korn","Well looking out at the PT-FI plan and looking out at the expected production levels at Grasberg, it's always good to see that kind of stability. I did see some slight changes in the underground ramp for 2020.","Looks like there's a little bit of decline in throughput and per ton -- or ton per day throughput, but it doesn't look like that's actually DMLZ it's looks like it's actually more DOZ and Big Gossan. Is there anything in particular driving that slight reduction in ore milled?","Richard Adkerson","Well, we do have a program of updating all of our outlooks every quarter and so you're going to see quarter-by-quarter. So, what we try to avoid is having any kind of big annual review and not reporting things there. So, as DOZ is a very mature mine and the Big Gossan is -- it's not a Block Cave mine.","You're going to see some adjustments to their DOZ throughout its life. It's had issues with wet muck and we really kind of led the industry in developing remote-control mining in response to that. They've had some issues like that. So, these are -- Matt these are just normal adjustments that are typical for operations review. There's nothing fundamentally that's changed right. Mark Johnson is in Indonesia and is on the call. Mark do you have anything to add to that?","Mark Johnson","Yes, Big Gossan was unchanged. We're still targeting ramping it up to 7,000 tons per day which is the nameplate. We'll get to that in the third quarter of this year. DOZ we had a slight reduction in what we saw. Based on our -- some of our recent experience on ramping up the automation systems, we had a peak of 43,000 tons a day that we've reduced to 37,000. We've had some real breakthroughs there. We're continuing to be optimistic on how we're applying the technology into DOZ. But we're being just a little bit more cautious on the out years.","Matthew Korn","All right, fair enough. That's very helpful. Appreciate. I'll pass along guys.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Thanks Matt.","Operator","The next question is from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Curt Woodworth","Hey good morning Richard, Kathleen.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning.","Kathleen Quirk","Good morning.","Curt Woodworth","First question is just with regard to I guess the hydraulic fracking at Deep MLZ. You talked about adding a third unit there. Can you just talk about what the I guess the milestones you expect to achieve there over the next several quarters?","And then you mentioned starting to produce in Block two over the second mine area which extends the radius. So, I mean is that is effectively that giving you more cushion in terms of hitting your production targets? Or if you could just elaborate on kind of exactly how that provides confidence to the target? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Well, it's those steps that allow us to meet this plan. So, it's -- what we've done is we began this process and are now seeing good positive results for it and we're continuing. We had one issue that had some maintenance problems with it and so we bought a new unit to bring it onstream. And so all of this is what goes in to enable us to meet the plan.","And the report today is that as we stand here it's working as we had hoped. Now for us to achieve the plan we have to continue having that progress day-by-day and we're very encouraged about it.","So, there's not anything that I would describe as cushion but it's what's gone in to enable us to present this plan and that's our expectation. We have confidence but we recognize we're in a show-me time so we've got to we show ourselves show the world that we can achieve this plan.","The really good news is we've had a good first quarter starting this year off in doing just that. I don't know if that answers your question or if anything is in specific Mark can address but--","Curt Woodworth","No. Yes, that's helpful. And then just second question on I guess how you think about sort of your resource base and portfolio where there's a lot of strategic interest and relatively high private-party valuation multiples that's being paid for assets. Is there any potential that you see for monetization of assets or reserves or JV arrangements that could accelerate the deleveraging targets you have?","Richard Adkerson","Well we're very comfortable with really where our balance sheet is today. You look at what's happened with our bond trading and our relationships with our banks and so forth. So we don't feel any pressure to further reduce our debt. We will if copper prices stay reasonably strong if they strengthen as some expect we'll have cash available to further reduce our debt and we'll do that. But that's just a use of cash as opposed to feeling any pressure to do it.","We like these resources for our own company's opportunities to create value. We have a partner at our El Abra mine. Codelco is a 49% partner at El Abra in Chile. We own 100% of a number of our properties here in the U.S.","One of the great things about our company is we don't face income taxes on production in the U.S. for a very, very long time. The combination of a tax loss carryforward from an oil and gas deal and the new U.S. tax regime. And so that when you think about having development opportunities with zero tax and you look internationally and you've got significant taxes wherever you look that's a real opportunity for us.","So, I -- from time-to-time, we approached people about who want to do something if it makes sense for us we'll do it. But so far we haven't reached that conclusion. We'll have an open mind but there's no pressure to do anything. We're very comfortable with our balance sheet.","Curt Woodworth","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Terry","Hi Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from me. Just firstly on the second quarter numbers that you've guided towards. Those are down a little bit I guess on the update for the 4Q 2018. Can you just talk through some of the moving parts on that and the slight pushout to the second half of the year? I think it's around El Abra, Grasberg et, cetera. Is it around the export delays on Grasberg? Just a little bit more color on the second quarter. thanks.","Kathleen Quirk","We've got -- Chris this is Kathleen. We've got some -- just in our shipping schedule, we've got some concentrate inventory build at Grasberg planned during the second quarter.","Potentially, those could move into the second quarter from the third quarter. But at this point in time, our shipping schedule shows that we've got some concentrate build during the quarter. So, it's really more of a shipment timing as opposed to anything else.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks Kathleen. And then just in terms of the comment on the export permit trying to increase the amount there. Is that -- that would only impact things say early next year or in that order, right? It's not a cap on an amount that you can ship per month or anything. It's a total amount for the year right? So, can you just give some color?","Kathleen Quirk","It's a total amount per year, but it was set based on our plan that we submitted to the government last fall, last October\/November timeframe. And we're actually -- it shows a quota that's much lower than it has been historically, because we're in this transition. And we actually believe that we're going to produce more than that quota this year. So, we'll be going in to get a revision. That's partially why our shipping schedule is planned the way it is to give us time to get that revision.","It's not a big revision we're looking for in these numbers, but we do want to try to build some flexibility in there because as Richard mentioned, Mark and the team are looking at some trade-off studies as to whether we can get more out of the open pit this year. And so that's something that we'll be looking -- evaluating kind of week by week. So we do have some upside to the numbers we believe, but we'll need to get a revision to our export quota. And it's annual thing, but it was based on a plan submitted last year and now we have some opportunities to increase it.","Richard Adkerson","And as a practical matter, we kind of wanted to see how this analysis goes about what we might be able to achieve. And the presidential election was just held in Indonesia and we didn't want to make any new filings until after that. So that's one of the -- part of the reasons of why we haven't acted yet to adjust the plan for the very positive news that we're having about having increased production.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks for that. And then the last one from me. You spoke about the smelter, I think in one of the earlier questions. But what should we expect in terms of any announcements on that in terms of financing or key developments for the Indonesia smelter? Thanks.","Kathleen Quirk","Right now, we are doing the engineering, the front-end engineering work. We've contracted with a third-party to do that study for us. We're doing some ground improvement work at the site. And we are evaluating potential partner and financing plans for the smelter. We don't have a significant amount of capital to invest this year. It starts to increase next year. So we'd like to be able to have some sort of financing plan in place by the end of this year, but those discussions are ongoing.","Chris Terry","Right. Thanks. Thanks, Kathleen and thanks, Richard.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","The next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Gagliano","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to focus in on the North American operation. They've obviously -- these assets have been around for quite a while. Typically, they're very predictable. This quarter volumes came in low, cost came in high in slag. I think the smelter issue in Miami I think. And then unscheduled maintenance maybe that's the smelter issue. You also mentioned implementing productivity targets efficiency measures and when I look at the full year targets they implied about a 10% rebound during the next three quarters in volume.","So a long-winded question or a long-winded intro to my question which is can you just expand a bit on what the main issues are in North America? Are we running into more challenging or can you describe reconciliations cropping up, that kind of thing. Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Yeah. Not of the latter, Dave. I mean, you look at the production number versus the sales number points to the smelter issue and it was really -- it was an unexpected event but it occurred right before we were going to have a shutdown -- a turnaround shutdown in any event. But we were down and so we just were producing things as expected, but we couldn't sell it because of this issue at the smelter. As you know these smelters are complicated assets and around the world you're seeing things like this. So this was not -- nothing to do, the ore -- the grades are there. We're improving in operations. We had 10, 15, 16 we had really scaled back maintenance capital as we talked about in earlier calls, really stretched our team. We've rebuilt that now. We've added to volumes in North America, South America's really going very well.","So the thing you saw was that we did have a -- and it didn't have a major effect, but we had some maintenance issues that we had at our Chino mine in New Mexico which is -- it is an older mine. You go back five years ago, we didn't think Chino would be around. Now we've done some drilling and we may have a major expansion project there in our future, but our concentrator there was down 15 days.","You'll have these things all along. You see in mines, but fundamentally our Americas operations are -- grades, the models are holding up. The team's getting better more efficient. And that shows up in our production numbers and the sales thing was a one-off deal because of the smelter issue.","Kathleen Quirk","Dave ...","Richard Adkerson","It was down 40 days by the way so.","Kathleen Quirk","We'll say just going back not just this quarter, but going back several quarters in North America you do see a trend of costs going up. And that really reflects the mining rate increases that we've done back in 2015 and 2016. We took mining rates way down to try to maximize cash flow during a tough time in the copper market. We've been ramping back up. Our mining rates and milling rates and that's had some impact on costs.","As we look forward, we're really focused on bringing in efficiencies and containing cost and using technologies to arrest any increase in inflationary pressures, et cetera. So, we're really focused on this cost management, particularly in North America.","We did have some diesel price increases and that's reflected in our updated guidance. The diesel price was up 10% 12% from our plan number. So we factor that into our new guidance and we factored in some of these issues which Richard was talking about in maintenance that we experienced in the first quarter. But this cost thing in productivity is really what we see being able to drive value in the U.S. because the more we can contain costs there the larger the resources. And that's why we're investing in these technologies to have lower cost better productivity and ultimately more value.","David Gagliano","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Just switching gears back to Indo and the smelter. The CapEx guidance, I think we've talked about this in the past. The CapEx guide 2019\/2020s exclusive of funding for the smelter and given where we are now, can you just comment a bit on what you think CapEx will be in 2019\/2020 for the smelter Freeport portion of the total funding?","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. Well, just the 2019 ...","Richard Adkerson","One thing I want to make sure when we say Freeport, we're talking about the smelter being funded by PT-FI. Our current plan and you could conceive of a joint venture scenario, but we don't anticipate equity capital requirements out of FCX for the smelter. It'll be spread over a number of years as a PT-FI investment and we're a shareholder in PT-FI as is INALUM and so that's where the funding for this will go.","If it's totally debt financed, as is likely to be the case that would result in incremental consolidated debt out of -- for FCX. But the cash requirements all would come out of PT-FI and it's all folded in to our December agreement with the government. So go ahead Kathleen.","Kathleen Quirk","Yes. I was going to say, the spend for this year and it's -- again, it's really ground improvement and continuing with the front-end engineering is less than $100 million. And as we get into 2020 and we don't have a specific number until the feed work is done, the front engineering is done. But we're estimating somewhere in the $500 million range next year.","And as Richard said, we expect this to be funded out of PT-FI or with partners. And so, PT-FI would have a separate financing arrangement or a new project company would have a separate financing arrangement. So, as Richard said, we don't expect it to come from FCX.","David Gagliano","Got it. Understood. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. ","Richard Adkerson","Thanks, David.","Operator","The next question is from Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Orest Wowkodaw","Hi. Good morning. Follow-up on Grasberg, it's just -- when I look at your mine plan here over the next couple of years, the part that really jumps out at me is that massive step up in 2021, where effectively you're calling for a 300,000-ton year-over-year increase in copper production.","Just curious, how realistic you think that is and whether that kind of tonnage has ever been produced in the market from a year-over-year basis on -- from any kind of block cave. It just seems overly aggressive to me and trying to figure out what I'm -- I guess what makes you so comfortable with that and then maybe we can go from there.","Richard Adkerson","So it is totally realistic. I mean, we -- quite frankly we wouldn't present it in our plans. We have had experience with operating large block scale mines, as we've been doing managing pits since the early 1980s. And this is not just a single mine.","The Grasberg Block Cave is going to have three phases to it. We've modeled all this with exactly what we have shown we could do with our DOZ mine, which was really the third phase of the development of the ore body that the Deep MLZ mine is the fourth phase.","And that began in the mid-1990s when we brought in Rio Tinto that replaced the mine called the IOZ which was depleting and so over time we've shown what we could do. It's not a single mine. It's large numbers in the aggregate, but it's things that we've done and we have in fact three phases going forward in the Grasberg Block Cave, which I want to just go back to and say, this is the same ore that we've been mining.","It's not deep under the surface like the Deep MLZ mine and this is basically doing what we've done before. The Deep MLZ mine, as I mentioned, has two phases and by having that second phase is going to allow us to meet our original target of getting up to full scale production in 2021.","And it's the one where we've had to bring in this fracking and we're satisfied with the progress, but that's the key issue for us is that having this fracking to precondition the rock, to allow it to cave, as we've planned is what we are engaged in now. This has worked in other places. First time for us to do it at Grasberg.","So rather than -- I would suggest, rather than thinking about this as having this one massive single mine that may lead you to think it's an aggressive expectation, is to break it apart and say, like, it is five different mines that we're doing. And Mark, do you -- and I'm not going to share to everybody. Mark is not an overly aggressive person when it comes to numbers. So, Mark, why don't you add some comments to what I just said?","Mark Johnson","Yes. And I think going back to what you initially started with Richard is, the ramp-up for each of these phases, GBC really is two block caves that share one set of infrastructure. Deep MLZ, as you mentioned, we have two phases that we'll be advancing at the same time.","Both of them are based on actual ramp-ups that we experienced in the DOZ, as we ramp it up from 20,000 to 50,000 tons and it's very much driven by the undercutting rate and the amount of draw points that you can develop.","And all of these, both the GBC and Deep MLZ, as we ramp them up, are following those empirical or historical experiences that we had. We are getting more efficient at both the undercutting and the draw point development. So we feel that we're well-positioned to ramp them up.","The other thing, when you look on the volumes is just, particularly in the Deep MLZ, as we ramp up the tons, the -- we're really in the very sweet spot of the ore body. As we ramp up the tons in 2020 and 2021, copper grades are 1.65 to 1.7. So you're seeing not only an addition of tons, but the grade of those tons are quite high. GBC also is in very good grades as we ramp up in the initial years.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks, Mark.","Orest Wowkodaw","Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, more of an accounting question. Your environmental obligations and shutdown costs, there were $42 million this quarter. They seem to be kind of jumping around a fair amount. I'm just wondering if you can give us an idea of what we should anticipate those going forward on an annual basis.","Kathleen Quirk","If you look at the press release, Roman numeral VI, it shows that we did have a special item that was recorded in the -- an accrual that was recorded in the first quarter for our legacy costs. If you adjust for that number that -- the balance would be kind of a run rate.","But we do have from time to time, this was a legacy item where we had an indemnification from an asset that Phelps Dodge had sold years and years ago and it met the cap. And so we had to accrue for it. But if you back that out, you'll see that on a run rate basis, that's where we'll be, except for these one-off items that we can't forecast.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay. Thanks very much.","Richard Adkerson","And this is just like our mine plans. We review all of these legacy liability issues and our reclamation activities every quarter. We have a separate team with outside experts that's involved with that. And so they will, like mine plans, get adjusted as new conditions come into place.","I will say that going into the Phelps Dodge deals 12 years ago, that was a huge concern for us. People wanted us to do an unfriendly deal. We decided not to, until we can do some due diligence on it. And over the 12 years, we've managed those costs to be less than in aggregate than what we anticipated. But it's a constant fight and issues come up all the time that we have to deal with. It's a major part of our business. So it's a reasonable question for you to ask.","Orest Wowkodaw","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Your line is open.","Oscar Cabrera","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Richard in your prepared remarks glad you mentioned that you're going to take a sturdy mode for the next two years and then deploy \u2013 deployed additional capital for your older opportunities. As you're thinking through that where does adding value to shareholders in whether it be a special dividend or buyback how does that play into your thinking now?","Richard Adkerson","It's a use of cash. I mean, as we look forward with the strategy of not committing new capital now, if we have a scenario, which many people think reasonable where we have a good copper market two years out from now and we're ramping up production at Grasberg you see just how much our cash flows would increase with success in that ramp up. Even if we decide to sanction a new project after that time, and I say after that time any new project's going to take a number of years to invest in. And so in that scenario, we would have substantial excess cash for our company as we've had in years past. And we would look to further reduce our debt and then make decisions about where to set an appropriate long-term dividend. And if there's additional cash behind that, we have paid special dividends in the past or buy stock back. But it's the use of cash Oscar rather than have a planned strategy going into it. It's going to be based on the circumstances that we face in.","Oscar Cabrera","That's clear. Thanks very much. Then you piqued my interest with this additional production out of Grasberg in 2019. And I was under the impression that after the \u2013 you depleted the open pit that would be it. So I was wondering, if you can provide a scope of the increase that you could have in 2019. Does this go forward to 2020? And how do you achieve that? I believe Mark referred to grades in some of the block caves.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. So Oscar, don't think of this as open pit being depleted. I mean, depleted is when you have an ore body and you've mined the whole ore body. This is the same ore body that's going down below the limits of the open pit. We worked on this in the mid-90s. The design and optimal shape of the open pit. So as we make this transition the ore is still there in the pit. It's just in the future that ore is going to be mined in the Grasberg Block Cave. And so as we're pulling out of it, we have these geotechnical issues of the shape of the pit how to be safe, how to make sure that as we wind down mining there we're not putting anybody at risk.","At the same time, we've already started promulgating the block cave in the Grasberg Block Cave. So this is a bit of a cat and mouse game. If we can get that ore out of the pit, as we're starting up the Grasberg Block Cave that's gravy. I mean, it's very high-grade. We're literally mining the road ramps that come out of that pit. The marketing guys they're going to \u2013 and we always knew this was going to be the case at this time. They're going to see what they can scrape out of that pit of high-grade copper and particularly gold ore. We've given you our best estimate. This would all be done. I don't think Mark there's any thoughts that this was extended beyond 2019, right? We're looking at potential excess in the second half of this year. Isn't that right?","Mark Johnson","Yeah. That's true. It's very small scale mining. We're doing 30,000 to 35,000 tons a day in this extension of the pit. As you mentioned, we're taking the ramps that were left in the final pit that were 40 meters wide and we're narrowing those. Those ramps are all in good grade ore, so it's a relatively small scale boutique-type mining that extends the life of the pit. The one thing that we're managing and we have excellent monitoring capabilities is as the cave develops at some point we're going to see some reflection of the cave activity in the high wall of the pit. And that is what will drive us away from this continued ramp removal.","If it were not for the block cave underneath, we could do this conceivably into the early part of 2020. Our best estimate is, is that and what we've reflected in the forecast is the ramp removal will end in June. We've got plans that, if the monitoring shows that it's safe to continue we would continue that on a month-by-month basis beyond as long as the monitoring allows us. We don't intend to slow down the block cave development to try to maximize the potential from the pit. The value is truly in the block cave longer-term, that's our focus. The open pit mining is an auxiliary opportunity during the interim.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay. Great, Mark. Super helpful. And then the last thing if I may. In one of the notes for your 2019 operating estimates you state here that the 2019 sales assumes Indonesian government approval or increase of PT-FI export quota. Could you provide like a number for that additional scope? I think it was \u2013 you have a permit for 180,000 tons?","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. It's \u2013 what's in our plan is very close to that. So it's -- we've got a little bit more in the plan today. I think it's 40,000 tons of concentrate or something. It's not a huge amount. But we do want to get some flexibility for these things that Mark is referring to so. But just to meet our existing plan it's not a significant number.","Oscar Cabrera","Thanks very much, everyone. Good luck.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is open.","John Tumazos","Thank you very much. If I could impose with two questions. First, it's very exciting Richard when you say Lone Star could be Morenci. And I know, you're not going to wait 100 years to draw it out. So the first question is, do you think that defining Lone Star in the sulfide is at 10 year $300 million project or a five-year $100 million project or faster in terms of firming up that 50 billion or 70 billion pounds?","Then second question and forgive me for thinking outside the box a little bit. I remember when Freeport sold everything to just be Grasberg, because Grasberg looked so good back 25, 30 years ago. And this isn't a good time to sell everything and just be Lone Star, because the market's afraid of a gazillion things. It wouldn't give you a good price, if you sold the mine. Why not distribute Lone Star to shareholders or Safford to shareholders and have two pieces of paper where Safford is 100% owned in Arizona, you probably could have a smart tax-cut figure out how to preserve the tax shields that wouldn't pay taxes. And Lone Star alone might command over $5 billion of your market cap of $20 billion and based on the questions people are asking you they don't understand your company today.","Richard Adkerson","Yes well \u2013 ","John Tumazos","Excuse me for throwing all that at you, Richard but\u2026","Richard Adkerson","John you never -- we worked 30 years together and the last thing I would do is expect you not to think out of the box. So that's \u2013 no, I appreciate your question and I understand your thought about it. So let me see. Going back to the first thing is\u2026","John Tumazos","How long does it take to drill it out?","Richard Adkerson","Yeah, we are drilling it out. We have been drilling it out and we've upped our budget for drilling this past year. We're spending about $8 million a quarter. We are directing resources there away from some other greenfield efforts that we had and other things and we expect that we will have a good understanding of this ore body by early next year.","And it's a question of drilling it out, developing high level models of what the -- going through that whole process that you're so familiar with I suppose and then doing metallurgical test work to see what's there. And so far you've see the grades, you've see what we've seen so far and it just keeps expanding in terms of its breadth and depth. And that's why we see it. And it's right there in the backyard of our total operation.","I don't think it makes sense to take Lone Star itself out. We'll take on board this whole idea, but there's just these huge benefits of having this America's operations as a single business. And as I look what other companies go through in terms of dealing with joint venture operations and issues related to safety and all the things that go into it, I don't know if I should expect, I don't expect people just from a pure investment logic standpoint to understand just what a massive synergy that is for our company and what it is.","So we're going to as I said focus on doing what we're doing the next two years. There'll be strategic opportunities for us to look at it in the long run but not now. And because we still you hear from the questions skepticism about our ability to upgrade. We're very confident, but I appreciate we're in a show me mode.","So we need to get Grasberg in a position of where it's once again like it was when you said. I still remember, George Putnam died this past quarter. He was our Director when I first joined the company in 1989 that when we first saw what Grasberg was and we were making decisions.","As you said we focused on that. We did. We shutdown everything, sold all these assets. That was a good year at my job when we first joined the company. It was the first three, four years we're selling assets all over the world.","And George said, play the card that's dealt you. He said that at one of my first Freeport Board memories and that was Grasberg was dealt to us. We made a decision. This was a company that five, six years earlier it passed on Escondido and let Rio Tinto vibe because of political risk in Chile. Anyway Kathleen's telling me to go on. Those are all war stories.","So we understand what you're saying. We're going to have a broad mind about what we do with this company but for two years we're going to have a focused mine. We're going to do what we just laid out we're doing.","Kathleen Quirk","And John, I know you know this, but as we're doing the oxide projects that really improves the value of the underlying sulfide resource, and we've got this great opportunity not only for the first initial project that we're completing next year, but additional expansion opportunities to the oxide and those are NPV positive projects and then just make those sulfides more valuable. So we're really, really, really excited about the resource there and again that could be a cornerstone asset for this company for years to come.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","And I'll throw out a commercial. If you want to -- if you have any interest in the history of what's happened to Freeport and where we've gotten to I'm speaking to the Melbourne Mining Club in London at its meeting on June 20. So we're going to have a full discussion of how we got to where we are.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Andreas Bokkenheuser. Your line is open.","Kathleen Quirk","Let's move on maybe we can come back to that one.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.","Chris Mancini","Hi, everybody. Just so quick on Lone Star again. So the concept is that you don't necessarily have to strip all of the -- mine all of the oxides before you get to the sulfides.","Richard Adkerson","Yes we do.","Chris Mancini","Okay. And so with that\u2026","Richard Adkerson","It's just like overburdened\u2026","Mark Johnson","Just like Cerro Verde.","Richard Adkerson","Like Cerro Verde was, like all these other mines that are other companies in the industry too. They got to move overburden to get to the ore and it's just fortunate this overburden is leachable and now it's profitable.","Chris Mancini","But is it 200 million pounds a year and then you have -- is it 5.6 billion pounds of oxide ore and so wouldn't that be a really long time before you get to the sulfides?","Richard Adkerson","It's expanding, yeah, and you know and we could -- we can make investments in facilities to shorten the life of the oxide ore. Right now it's designed to use the facilities at Safford, which are available. But as we go through this process of understanding this sulfide ore, so understanding more about the oxide ore. So what we could do is scenario here, where the scenario if oxide ore does expand, build some new facilities, mine it out quicker shorten its life, get to the sulfide earlier.","Chris Mancini","Okay. So the concept would be what we would likely see would be first an expansion of oxide production at Lone Star and then you'd be defining the sulfides and just show us instead of say 200 million pounds a year for 20 years. It could be -- you could show us 500 million pounds for 20 years or something like that, which includes the sulfides?","Richard Adkerson","Or 500 million pounds for a shorter period of time. And during that time, you could then invest in the sulfide infrastructure and so forth at the same time. So it'd be a concerted project because this would be a major sulfide mine in how long Cerro Verde took us to red to\u2026","Mark Johnson","From start permitting seven years...","Richard Adkerson","seven years. So all of this fits together.","Chris Mancini","All right. Okay. But the first step would be we would see an expansion of the sulfides and the capital needed for that more\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","Essentially oxide right.","Chris Mancini","Sorry, right, right expansion of the oxides. Okay, guys. Okay, thanks. And then quickly just on El Abra so what\u2026","Richard Adkerson","All I'll say is think about a company with that kind of core asset. Here we've got Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg. They're not mines like this. I mean you look at the biggest mines in the world and now people have got things going on now there that are different, but the top 10, 12 mines in the world, Grasberg's the youngest. And to be able to take a company like ours and plug in that asset in that neighborhood with that kind of ore with what we're good at that's a huge deal.","Chris Mancini","Yeah, I agree and it's low tax, I mean no taxes like you said, and also\u2026","Richard Adkerson","40-plus percent taxes in Indonesia and damn near that much in Chile. Zero tax. That's a lot of money.","Chris Mancini","And then \u2013 yeah, and also as you expand the oxide you should be able to get benefits from economies of scale at Lone Star. So the unit cost should decline, so yeah that's a huge\u2026","Richard Adkerson","And by the way, there's a big sulfide deposit under Safford.","Chris Mancini","Right. Okay. Yeah.","Richard Adkerson","All of that comes in. It's a district. I mean, this is not just, I don't know it's exciting. I know people are worried about China and this two-year transition. We should take a longer-term view of this company, and we really, we really have some great assets.","Chris Mancini","Yes. It's fantastic. Okay, great. And then on the El Abra expansion, what are you waiting for there in terms of committing to doing that? Do you need to do more engineering or is it an issue with your partner Codelco needing to\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","We're doing some value engineering to try to bring the capital cost down and at the same time moving the studies along for the U.S. projects, because what we're wanting to do at the end of the day is compare the economics and pluses and minuses of the various projects and rank them sequence them.","So really we're aligned with our partner and taking this time really try to improve economics, while we look at these other options in the U.S., where we are doing work to try to develop concentrating facilities at a lower capital intensity than what's been done historically. So we're taking this time to improve economics, reduce capital intensity, and drive values, while we're ramping up Grasberg and watching this market situation.","Chris Mancini","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Michael Dudas","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just one question. So as you think about Freeport and looking at investments going forward, and looking at the industry and what you've talked about out in Chile a couple of weeks ago. If Freeport was two years out 2021 and Grasberg was humming and everything is doing well, would you be changing how you think about capital allocation investment in the business given where copper is at $2.85 $2.90 today.","And do you think others in the industry are going to be still rather cautious in bringing up and making some investment decisions on these expansion projects? Or do you sense there's going to be an acceleration because of this perceived gap that everybody is pointing towards five years, 10 years from now?","Richard Adkerson ","So I can see a range of scenarios between what you just said, but you start out with a base of saying, despite we're seeing this time last year everything was rosy. It changed in the summer with the trade war stuff and then everybody started raising questions about China.","Now China is taking steps to use its tremendous financial resources to stimulate its economy to offset the weakening consumer export business. They're investing in infrastructure in the country. They're revamping the one belt one road thing, and that's good for resources. So -- but there's all these questions about what's going on globally. Economically, the political situations complicated everywhere around the world. And so everybody's stepping back and thinking about how that's going to unfold?","And you've got, I guess, I've lived through maybe three generations of CEOs in this industry, and you've got history of companies that have been on the burden of making bad investment decisions or strategic decisions, so you've got a structure of where boards and managements are understandably conservative about what they're going to do, that's all going to be good for the outlook for the commodity. And then just the resources are very limited.","And so I really think this two years from now where we're going to be and I'm really looking forward to being there as I'm happy to be where I am now, but two years from now things are going to be better. We're going to be in a position to generate a lot of cash, and I'd love to return cash to shareholders. That was a lot of fun and get back to that as we look for chances to invest. And it's kind of like history repeating itself. That's where we were beginning 2010 going in 2011.","And so I think it's going to be a time of generating cash, really getting the balance sheet strong. I was happy with zero debt, and -- but be real disciplined about it the way we would approach to allocating capital. We've got some great projects. There's trade-offs that build in the lot of factors, and it's not just looking at the resource and grades, but the required capital, the tax structure, the energy cost, features and then the water accessibility and cost. All of the things will come into play.","So I think where you see will be in a scenario with reasonable commodity markets success and execution in the last two years of generating cash, reducing debt, returning cash to shareholders to disciplined growth.","Michael Dudas","Appreciate your observation Richard. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR.","Matt Key","Good afternoon everyone. Matt Key here asking a question for Lucas. Just a there's been some reports about two landslides during the quarter. And I wanted to ask you if you maybe be able to provide a little bit more background on that. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Well, we haven't had a land -- well, let's see\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","He's talking about I think about the mill.","Richard Adkerson","The mill.","Kathleen Quirk","Mark\u2026","Richard Adkerson","Well, let me set the stage. And then Mark's here to talk about it. So we had a real tragic accident in our overflow delivery system at Grasberg and this was a real heartbreaker for all of us, because we have a -- as part of that system we've had ore passes that we've used now for over 20 years where the ore is mined, crushed, conveyed to ore passes at the Grasberg mine level -- operations level. And it goes to these ore passes 600 feet, where it's dropped and to the mill...","Mark Johnson","That's 600 meters.","Richard Adkerson","600 meters sorry Mark 600 meters then where it's dropped at the mill level and we've had series of these ore passes over the years. They operate it very well generally and we had an accident of where some ore got hung up in one of the ore passes. Two of our workers were in an unfortunate position and we're trying to examine why they were, where they were, but efforts were made to free this ore. It broke loose and covered these guys and they perished. And here we are with a system that literally maybe two months from now would've been retired and we hadn't had any accidents like it. So it's really sad situation.","So that's one case which you maybe describing as a landfall, but that was an issue with our ore pass system. Then at our -- in the area that's above our mill, we did have some landfall events. This has always been an area of concern. You may have seen pictures of it, but this is a massive industrial development done in a challenging place with high elevation around it. Heavy rainfall and severe elevations. And over the years we've had a couple of cases of where we've had ground give way, particularly in times when it rains and dries out.","This happens all around the island. It's not just where we are. But we had -- we've had a couple of events that have occurred recently there no one's got hurt hasn't been major impact of damage to our equipment -- we've had to do some cleanup, but this is things we've encountered in the past and sort of kind of part of what we actually deal with then physically where we are. But we haven't anything else. Red have we \u2013 Mark, do you have anything to add to that or?","Mark Johnson","No. The one about the mill it was just as you said we're in this very deep steep valley of the mill. Facilities are tucked at the bottom of it. We had a natural event. It was about 900 meters above our north-south mill and very small amount of material, but it came down unexpectedly. It's very difficult to predict these natural events. They came down, we were fortunate that it buried the road near our stockpile. We've been continuing to manage that over the last month or so. It hasn't shown any activity. We built some barriers around any of the areas that we have people working below and continue to assess the situation.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, and Mark makes a good point. It was a natural event, unrelated to mining. That mill has been there since 1972. It's been expanded massively over time. I don't know if it still is but back when I was managing insurance, it was the largest single site insurance risk and we haven't had any major -- with operations now for 40 years, we haven't had a major catastrophic event in any fashion there and this is certainly far from that.","Matt Key","Got it. Thank you for that detailed response. And just one more for me if I could squeeze it in. We've seen a lot of large M&A take place this year in the mine space albeit on the pressure side with one included an unsolicited offer. Do you...","Richard Adkerson","You're calling gold precious?","Matt Key","Do you have a view on M&A kind of in base metals and do you consider an additional defenses given your current valuation in the market? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","So M&A is coming in the base metals business. Companies are large with great balance sheets. Every company's got its own story, so there's issues that might be barriers to it. But when you have a situation of limited resources and great assets and scarcity of assets. I think it's just inevitable that things will happen. Defenses, we don't have any extraordinary defenses. We're going to take actions to make sure our shareholders are well represented.","We don't think now is the time to consider things like that and I will tell you my judgment is. It's not likely to be an immediate issue because of the circumstances of the industry. But the facts are as you can't predict M&A and I mean we're a great example of that. We were a company that had very limited access to capital and then Phelps Dodge presented itself we had action and things happened. So it's going to be driven more by circumstances and opportunities and not something that you can totally plan in for.","Matt Key","Got it. Thank you for that color and best of luck going forward.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you very much I appreciate that. Appreciate everybody's being on the call and we look forward to reporting you on our progress as we go forward and to the rest of this year. Thanks everybody.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our Website at www.fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, anyone may listen to the [Audio Gap] materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice-Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice-Chairman and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas President and Chief Executive Officer with several other senior members of our team in the room today.","I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then will turn the call over to Richard who will begin reviewing our recent performance and outlook in the slide presentation. After our formal remarks, we\u2019ll turn the call over to questions.","Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of 2.5 billion or $2.38 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The loss attributable to common stock included net charges of 2.4 billion or $2.32 per share in the first quarter primarily for the reduction of the carrying value of oil and gas properties pursuant to SEC for cost accounting rules and a related tax charge to establish a deferred tax valuation allowance. Our adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled 60 million or $0.06 per share during the quarter. ","Our copper sales during the quarter totaled \u20a4960 million that was above the first quarter of last year of \u20a4871 million. Gold sales totaled 263,000 ounces that was also above the last year first quarter of 187,000 ounces and oil and gas sales totaled 12.5 barrels of oil equivalents in the first quarter. Our realized copper price of $2.72 per pound in the first quarter was below the year ago quarter of $3.14 per pound. Gold prices of 1186 per ounce were below the year ago quarter of roughly $1300 per ounce.","FMO&Gs average realized price for crude oil was $56.51 per barrel in the quarter and that included about $12 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts.","Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled 717 million, capital expenditures as we advance our projects totaled 1.9 billion in the quarter. We ended the quarter with total debt of 20.3 billion and consolidated cash of 549 million. As previously reported, we completed amendments to our bank loans during the quarter to provide more flexible financial covenants and to extend maturities under our term loan.","At the end of the quarter availability under the revolver approximated 3 billion of undrawn availability and undrawn availability under the Cerro Verde credit facility approximated $1 billion.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard who\u2019ll be referring to the slide materials on our Web site.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning everyone. Before we turn to the slides, I want to look back on our January call when we discussed this year 2015 as being a bridging year as we complete our major copper expansion projects that we started in 2010 and transition to 2016 when we will realize the ongoing benefits of these investments. These projects will generate volumes that will be accompanied by lower cost, lower capital expenditures. All of this adds up to a significant free cash flow generation which will not be dependent on higher copper prices.","Now we remain very optimistic about the outlook for the copper markets. We supported by the world\u2019s need for copper and the challenges in developing supplies and maintaining supplies for copper, but we are cognizant of the near term uncertainties and commodity prices so we\u2019re going to continue to be diligence about controlling cost and will remain flexible to respond to market conditions.","We\u2019ve already taken a series of actions to respond to these market conditions and to maintain our financial strength as we work through 2015 to future years when our financial metrics are expected to improve dramatically. We\u2019ve made significant progress in our near-in completion of our Brownfield copper development projects. These are among the most attractive in the world. As we complete these projects, we\u2019re positioned to achieve our deleveraging objectives over time, increase cash returns to shareholders and provide exposure to our shareholders to a streak winning commodity markets in the future.","Jim\u2019s going to be talking with you about several important milestones completed in our oil and gas business since our acquisitions by FCX in 2013. The combination of our large scale infrastructure in the Gulf with significant available capacity to expand and our strategic lease position and exploration and development inventory together with the experience of our team in our Gulf of Mexico focus area positions us to grow our business, generate attractive investment returns and increase asset values.","When we completed the oil and gas acquisitions we established an objective for the business to be self-funding. Today that has been accomplished through cash flows and asset sale. We are now evaluating a range of alternatives to provide supplemental external funding for our oil and gas investments and we will continue to do so. ","We are going to talk today that among these alternatives we are considering a public listing of minority interest in Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. Publicly trated Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas would -- values of our oil and gas assets through a public market evaluation and enable us to expand the financing alternatives for our oil and gas operations on a standalone basis. Subject to market conditions this alternative essentially would be completed in late 2015 following the completion of an SEC review of the required registration statement ","The following review of our business and its outlook will evidence that we have a strong portfolio of assets with attractive near-term and longer term organic growth options, a dedicated and highly motivated management team and organization to execute these plans and a roadmap for managing our assets and finances as we deliver on our strategy of providing long term values for our shareholders.","Turning to Slides, on slide 3, we have a picture of our new annual report for 2014. This report titled Value at our core, talks about the substantial value and our assets, the growing production and cash flow profile, our exposure, to markets with favorable fundamental. It's our financial strength, the way we manage our business in a responsible manner, environment community and social aspects, and an experienced management team that we have","In the first quarter, just turning to slide 4, the highlights are, we substantially ramped up our Morenci expansion. We had record quarterly sales at our Tenke Fungurume projects following the completion of our phase II expansion in 2013. The Cerro Verde construction project is on track to become the world's largest copper concentrator facility. We are entering into the phases of the higher ore-grades of Grasberg as we approach completion of our mines planned to complete mining in the open pit. And we set the stage for growth as I mentioned in production with declining future capital expenditures.","In the oil and gas business we had positive drilling results. And our Holstein deep facility and Parnell in the Vito basin and at the King, project Green Well high end to the modern facility, this significantly expanded our resource base. We established new production as the Lucius project came on-stream. Dorado, Highlander and our on-shore, the gas project, combining these added we are producing at 25 barrels of equivalents a day by the end of the quarter. ","And we have an enhanced inventory, a financially attractive development projects and as I mentioned we are advancing plans for external funding for executing this plan to develop these assets. Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights for the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of 2014. Of course we are dealing with lower commodity prices with copper prices being roughly 12% lower and oil prices is half of what they were in the year ago quarter. Other than that our business from the fundamental standpoint operated in an efficient and effective way.","Just returned from the annual CESCO Week in Santiago, Chile, that was last week; a lot of commentary there about copper markets. When you step back and look at where we are right now in 2015, the surpluses that had been projected for a number of past years are not developing as they were estimated. Projects have been delayed, production has been interrupted and the market has not moved into a large surplus position. The focus by investors and people involved in the industry has been on China, with China's lower growth rate and uncertainties about its economy, its base has grown significantly. The government is providing economic stimulus and China's need for copper is going to continue to be significant and the key factor in terms of near-term.","The U.S. as we evidence, we provide over 40% of the downstream copper for the U.S. markets growing at a moderate rate. Economic stimulus is being applied in Europe and Japan and we're seeing the beginnings of growth in Europe in our business there. The industry continues to face the supply side challenges.","We're cognizant and as I mentioned in the near term price uncertainty but we remain very optimistic about the midterm and long term fundamentals of this business. And our company is really positioned to take advantage of that in a very significant way. You can see on slide 7, our operating results for our mining business in the first quarter we continued to be focused on cost management. Our team and leaders of that team are here in the room with me today. They've done a great job in leading our whole organization to focus on cost.","We had good cost performance in the quarter. We came in significantly lower than our own internal plans for cost control and our consolidated unit cost guidance with our $0.64 a pound was lower than the guidance we had last quarter and you can see how that operates, how that was reflected in our regional operation.","Our growth in production in North America came from Morenci was also good performance as we know and in South America the decline reflects the sale of the Candelaria project, which produced just under a 100 million pounds in first quarter of 2014. Indonesia is a stronger quarter in the first quarter of \u201914 when we're dealing with the export ban and as I mentioned Africa operated well and achieved record production for the quarter.","Looking forward through 2015, we have been working to get to the point now that we are approaching for several years to be well positioned and take advantage of what we will achieve to the completion of our expansion project. What we will achieve in Indonesia Grasberg as we enter into the final period of mining from the old pit, you can see growing production volumes during the quarter lowering unit cash cost as we move forward in 2015 and lower capital cost as we go beyond 2015. In the 2016 this has been our long term plan and now we are achieving it.","At [indiscernible] we are just terrifically excited about what the progress has been made there. Engineering and major procurements are complete. As I mentioned, when we complete this we'll be processing through our concentrate 360,000 tons a day and that will be the world's largest, the construction is on schedule at this point and 70% complete.","We're targeting getting it finished in late 2015 and as I said the entire organization as we review this internally is very excited about what we're doing there. This way at 600 million pounds of copper per annum, $4.6 billion was our original estimate and that's where we are today in terms of looking at it. So, it's good to see that we're progressing on a time schedule we set within the capital budget that we set.","In Indonesia, we continue to be engaged in active discussions with the government to amend this is -- the government has expressed -- the government officials have expressed the recognition of our need for certainty in terms of our physical terms and our operating rights and we're working cooperatively with the government in how to accomplish this within the government's regulatory framework.","A lot of mutual benefits for us, our company and for the country of Indonesia with the operations and Papua, we had a very long term positive partnership. We're working hard to sustain that in an environment of changes in government and expectations and aspirations in Indonesia but this operation is the economic engine for the development of Papua and that something that we share in common with the government of Indonesia and with our own company. It provides significant benefits to the Indonesian economy.","As we stand right now all of our rights under our call continued to be applied until we reach a mutually agreeable approach to amending that and these negotiations are taking place. We do have a memorandum of understanding that was extended earlier this year to July 2015 and as part of that in the memorandum of understanding, we're working with partners to advance plan as far the expansion of our Smelter operations we're focused in the Gresik area of East Java where we have the existing Smelter that was developed in the mid 1990, which is Indonesia's only Smelter.","At the operations itself we have now completed the access to our massive underground ore bodies. We expect that DMLZ extension of the existing DOZ mine to start up late this year and we're working to develop the underground reserves that lie below the Grasberg open pit. The Grasberg Block Cave mine, which is scheduled to begin ramping up in 2018.","Development capital of over $3 billion has been spent, $2.5 billion net to PT Freeport Indonesia and we expect that PTFI share of these costs will average 600 million a year over the next five years and throughout this period we've been able to successfully continue with this underground development.","Beyond our existing producing asset our expansion projects the transition of Grasberg to being a fully underground operation we look to the future, our projects where we're not currently committing capital to at this point but they will provide the opportunity for long term growth for our company. They include a very large sulfide resource at our El Abra mine in Northern Chile, this mine will -- this resource would support a major concentrator development projects, currently our operations at El Abra have been SX-EW operations with significant incremental production that would be achieved with that.","At this point, we're studying options for getting water power, dealing with tailings and working with our partners to do this in an effective way. In the United States, we're with the lower energy cost here and the productivity of American workers, we have great opportunities for future expansions at our mines in Arizona. ","At Bagdad there is a large sulfide resource that would allow us to more than double mill capacity at significant amounts of copper and we're doing the initial steps to look at that project including the acquisition of water rights which is a key for that and tailings deposition areas.","At our Safford mine, which is in Eastern Arizona near Morenci, we have additional oxide resources that would extend the existing productive facility. That\u2019s in an adjoining Ore body called Lone Star, which is near there and has oxides that could expand that, extend our infrastructure beyond the life of the oxides at Safford and then at both Safford and Lone Star there is a significant sulfide resource for the future.","At Tenke Fungurume besides the oxide ore we have the opportunity for further expansion to produce incremental volumes from oxide, that\u2019s depending on getting power. But there is a massive high grade mixed ore and sulfide resource that we're conducting exploration, drilling and doing metallurgical studies that would look for, and looking at how we process it over time.","With that report on our minor operations then I'm going to turn the presentation over to Vince who talk about oil and gas business.","Jim Flores","Thank you, Richard. Good morning everyone. Before we start, we talked about the ore market commentary, you can see the WTI and Brent curves an HLS curves. Here on the graph the market obviously continues to be volatile as it goes to its price in market discovery of where all the wall ore needs to go and at what price. We see it as continue to be volatile, it was down 50% in the beginning of the first quarter, was up 20% at the end of the first quarter. So, as we bear through that as an assets re- price both in accounting but also in the marketplace. We continue to focus our operations and continue to do good things with the drill bit and fall through with our operating plan.","We continue to see the ore market cleaning up if you will. The contango curve is always a positive event future oil prices on the Brent side and we continue to see the oil market under strain going forward as demand has really been the big story here in the first quarter as we seen a lot of gasoline demand here in the U.S. and other parts of the world on the finished product side that we think is going to continue increase as these current oil prices take hold of the marketplace.","On Page 14, to put together just a chronological series of highlights from 2013 to 2014 obviously for Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. When it was formed as the combination between PXP and MMR and acquired by Freeport 2013 big adjustment period and the total oil and gas divisions by 174,000 BOE per day. It was a big increase from 2012. Get our hands around all the assets and also the corporate structure of Freeport. It was a big achievement for us in \u201913 and put us on a growth path to say how we\u2019re going to develop all these assets and have the right personnel, right equipment, right operating plan going forward was a key part of it. And when we look at our asset review in 2014, we saw what assets might not fit in the next five years for us building value overtime. They were valuable at the time but they were not going to build value overtime and be meaningful to Freeport and the Eagleford shale someone like category which will end up selling it for $3.1 billion and we were able to rotate that about $1.5 billion of that money into some significant assets well overtime like Heidelberg, Lucius and our Vito project we\u2019ll talk about.","Then we continued to acquire leases and seismic to put our projects in the best possible position of bringing forward the exemplary results without failure and been able to use the new seismic and additional acreage to add the resources to our existing infrastructure. For 2015 we started seeing results there through with our first production of Lucius development that was a discovery that we discovered in 2009 with Anadarko and it came one netting us between 20,000 barrels a day to 25,000 barrels a day. We\u2019ve successfully drilled wells at Holstein Deep and also King Marlin areas around our existing infrastructure that have validated our seismic and bought big resources there. We\u2019ll show you the Holstein Deep progression of resources that we\u2019ve identified there with additional drilling. And then also on our Vito area they\u2019ve several joint prospects we drilled the first one that Richard\u2019s talked about Power Nap that was successful, so we\u2019re off to a great start there.","And you go through \u2013 on top of that the Highlander discovery that we announced in \u201914, we put in our production here in \u201915 and it\u2019s producing quite well down in the lower St. Martin Parish Louisiana and we look forward to talking about developing that further going forward as gas prices rebound.","So all in all we\u2019re on the edge where rose spot in oil and gas business and then with the 145 projects outlined on Page 15 that there are about greater than 20 percentage strip in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico this is all because it\u2019s attached to existing infrastructure or has infrastructure plan that has \u2013 it\u2019s very cost efficient in the Vito area but the Keathley Canyon, Green Canyon, Mississippi Canyon is tying back toexisting infrastructure that we own or we have an interest in. ","And the Vito area the reserves are so large that the returns are going to be excellent from the standpoint of size and the facility that we\u2019re going to build with the operator shale and be in a situation to maximize our economics in that area. So with this deep inventory and so forth what we need to focus is manage our cash flow, manage our capital whether inside or outside going forward to make sure that we achieve the copper objectives of FCX. In the first quarter 2015 Freeport-McMoRan highlights on Page 16 we\u2019ve had continued steady production performance from California.","We advanced our Gulf of Mexico growth strategy as I described. The Inboard Lower Tertiary besides the Highlander significant flow test and production at Highlander, we\u2019ve had our Farthest Gate West well as a potential discovery we have completion underway that we hope to have that completed this summer and I\u2019ll talk further about that and we had about $100 million in net ore hedging realizations that helped buffer the volatile prices in the first quarter. And our deepwater Gulf of Mexico progress reports specifically area by area Green Canyon, Mississippi Canyon in the Vito area on Page 17 you can see there\u2019s a lot of busy work going on and as we go through this process I want everybody to understand is that our operations plan and our budget or risk and that\u2019s everybody does that but as our operation plan outperform our risk basically we had an incredible two and half quarters of excellent drilling results and so forth it also de-risk some of the capital and that\u2019s somebody upside moving in our capital budget is strictly because who else who have risked it at 80% success for now, 100% success and so forth it may sound small but the numbers are big and so that puts upside pressure due to the success of all these projects [indiscernible] all of that in the last two quarters.","And you can go through the detail here. The big key here and everybody focused on the whole thing deep Great Canyon with the gross resources were initially 75 million barrels and now up to 280 million barrels because of the additional drilling and then the cash flow is going to get out of the Dorado King and KOQB area because of our seismic tie and the success we\u2019ve had there is our Vito area, power discovery which is offset discovery to our victory area, very significant discovery for several reasons, number one obviously its large column of bore that is over extensive, a nice reservoir size, on top of that it is really helped us getting confidence and all the additional projects and the next when we have to drill deeply that we going to nearly move to after we finish our present logging operation at Parnell. ","And the next page or page 18, you see the overall picture of our assets. We want to focus on hosting deep by like in the Great Canyon Parnell is for us to two highlighted assets that we have. On page 19 the hosting facility, our hosting deep development we\u2019re drilling on the southwest side you can see phase 1 and it is called the Subsi 1, 2 and 3 and then you see the phase 2 development wells in lighter blue and even lighter blue is the phase 3 development and as we go around from the initial three well development that we\u2019ve planned that will add 15,000 barrels per day in 2016 that\u2019s on track and expanding the drilling results could add up to 75,000 barrels a day to by 2020. So this project continue to drill out above the expectations and therefore its budget is going to be expanded. ","The hosting deep production profile on page 20 given representative if we talk about cash flows and timing for your modeling purposes but it\u2019s a very significant project for the company going forward. On page 21 is our detailed area, Power Nap [ph] discovery the reason I\u2019m seeing the picture you see up in the top left corner of detailed development discovery show operates Power Nap [ph] just at the East of that two red dots is another discovery these are net DOE exposure to Freeport McMoRan oil and gas.","And you can see just to the south of Parnell, deep sweep oil to the very depth part of the basin which is kind of separated but the Parnell discovery and then we have our Sun project down for the south east which is 240 million barrel in that project and is about 384 million barrel. All in all, I\u2019ll skip ravioli in detail, it is smaller but it is about a billion barrels of oil net in the company and this is the most significant long term play that the company has in its books today. You can see the extremely thick column at the Alan four stands upper and lower fence in our detail discovery well, it\u2019s a great size and signature it takes all over the mini basin. ","So, when you pull up the page 22, you look at our plan going forward for the next 10 years. You can see production growing from various 130,000, 140,000 barrels to-date over 600,000 a day. The key about this line that we want to put in there is the estimated reserve, refresh ratio for next five years is 137% by any cost going forward $26 a barrel and $21 a barrel within your model is it all these assets are in hand most of these are all been discovered or have validation within the basin, all of our gas assets in Haynesville and Cretaceous as gas recovered later in this decade. A California assets, specific Green Canyon, the Vito Area, there is no additional exploration, there is no additional outside business acquisitions in this model. This is all what\u2019s in hand. So, just following our playbook, we can increase production at least 3X through our company on the oil side.","Now, work talking about right now internally and externally is timing because the assets are there, the equipment is there and so forth and the cost structure is there. When you look at our five year finding cost structure at $26 a barrel and just take our average LOE forecast is about 15 bucks a barrel, it's 18 right now, it's about 50 bucks going forward because our fixed assets have fixed costs and when you have more volumes to you dilute the per barrel cost.","Now if you take 26 bucks and 15 bucks is about $41 a barrel and you add $5 corporate cost. You buy $46 a barrel all in cost for oil and gas business. In a $65 to $70 oil market we make a lot of money in this business. There is very little risk because of the risk we're taking and the way we de-risk it with the drill bit, it's very little risk from the execution standpoint because the equipment and platforms are in place.","So we're very excited about that and we've been working all internally with everyone here at Freeport to figure out the best way to fund these assets going forward. On page 23, I just want to highlight two different ways to think about our business. #1, the current plan, which is what in our corporate projections of 2015, 2016 and 2017 production volumes and EBITDA's on the top right and then if we're able to bring in additional funding that would accelerate that business and get us up to a production level that would allow us to be self funding in a much faster level.","The model is in the lower right hand corner, which is the growth plan assuming additional funding. And what happens here is because of all the wells we drill and so forth we're really talking about how fast we hook them up -- how fast we put the equipment in to bring that production on and so forth. So, for us we're going to be very stingy about it from the standpoint of funding. We've looked for funding sources in the first quarter. We found some that were wrenched in and anticipating or very expensive and we looked around that we found some others that make a lot more sense.","And right now, the public sale or public equities for minority interest FMO&G is something that we're working on and we're going to probably have a decision on that here this quarter to where we file a document and getting registrations as Richard said for the summer and look at raise some money in the fall our JV monetization and\/or divestitures. Divestitures are they help patch the hole but they don't solve the problems. So, the IPO alternative of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas on page 24 abides that an alternative fund of -- way to fund the business, but the key thing we think it does is highlight the standalone value for oil and gas business.","There is a big disconnect between the value of our oil and gas business within Freeport-McMoRan today and the public market perception is stand alone. I guess we have had more success than anybody with the drill bed in the last two years and it's caused more spending but it is also likely reflected in our equity. So the aspect of being able to get that visibility for the Freeport shareholder we think is an important part of it. FCX solely plans to maintain control in majority ownership of the business and the case study is obviously Freeport done as before the FCX IPO, we did it planes with planes exploration, we funded out of PXP \u2013 PLX and the best of our IPO that from ARCO in 1994 that really funded their deepwater discovery developments in 1994 when the deepwater was first showing up and which really is a big part of BP portfolio today. The timing might \u2013 it is early as late 15 or this market conditions stable we are going to be patient for the standpoint and we'll continue to assess other alternatives and have other discussions in other areas in the interim certainly from that standpoint.","Richard, back to you to talk about the 2015 outlook?","Richard Adkerson","Okay, thanks Jim. We want to give you this overview of our assets and make sure that you can sense what our degree of excitement is about the scope of our assets of both our mining business and our oil and gas business. And I want to talk about how this comes together financially for us, as we move forward with our plans for developing them. First of all looking at the near term for 2015 we are looking at sales of 4.2 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold, 95 million pounds of molybdenum and 52.3 million barrels equivalent of oil, 67% of that is oil. The operating cash flows that would be generated at 275 copper would be 4.4 billion and we\u2019re highly leveraged to copper for the rest of the year $0.10 changes in copper is $250 million. The unit cost is an attractive $1.53 for copper and as Jim said $19 a barrel for oil for this year. Our capital expenditure reflect a $500 million adjustment for our oil and gas business at 6.5 billion as we move forward and you can see as we look beyond 2015 as we go to Slide 26, the volumes increase significantly as we talked about earlier both for copper, gold with support from molybdenum in our oil project where we will be preparing for longer-term growth through our investment activities there. Our copper sales for the quarter will be growing as I mentioned earlier throughout the year and that information is presented on Slide 27. Our 2015 operating estimates for our unit cost for copper shows the effects of the higher volumes with continued cost controls. We\u2019re now looking at projections of $1.53 a pound consolidated for copper and you can see our sales are divided by region.","The EBITDA models and cash flow models that we present each quarter presented on Slide 29 as an average for the next for 2016 and 2017. Average EBITDA at various copper prices would go to 1,200 and oil at $70. This approximates the current strip for \u201916 and \u201917. You can see EBITDA ranging from 250 copper at 8.6 billion to 13.7 billion and 350 and operating cash flows range from 6.6 billion at 250 up to 10.3 billion at 350. The sensitivities for our different commodities and currencies are presented on Slide 30 for your use. Our capital expenditure, plans as they current stand are shown on Slide 31. You can see declining from 7.4 last year to the new estimate 6.5 this year, 5.6 and 5.1 and we\u2019re going to be evaluating these as we go forward but this is what our current plan is as we stand now.","We are committed to maintaining financial strength and we have a strong track record for doing that. Our large resource base gives us strong cash flows and we will exercise capital discipline and how we invest for the future with taking significant steps to reduce cost and capital expenditures, increasing volumes, declining CapEx that\u2019s going to help our existing credit metrics and we are advancing plans for external funds as Jim just talked about. We have available liquidity under our FCX revolver and we have a facility at Cerro Verde that together provide us $4 billion of availability at the end of March.","So our key priorities as we go forward is to maintain our financial strength, manage our operations and our CapEx to maximize near term cash flows in an uncertain commodity market, but to look forward to this great set of assets that we have for future growth, future value creation we\u2019re really going to be focused on executing our plans for our near term mining projects in our oil and gas investments and to generate values for our large resource base.","Before we turn the call over for questions, Jim Bob\u2019s here and he has some comments to be made about our company\u2019s culture and how we\u2019re approaching the current environment based on the successes we\u2019ve had over many years in the past. Jim Bob?","Jim Bob Moffett","Thank you, Richard. As you look on Slide 34, 1981 [indiscernible] [indiscernible] In 1988 year remember we did an IPO of FCX [indiscernible] we had a deposit [indiscernible] we had to rely on our geologic instincts to know that this was a major find and as you know after the drilling that we did, we end up with the largest oil body in the world. Copper, gold and silver. In 1990 we developed gas pipe [indiscernible] how to manage that business which is we had a discovery in the middle of [indiscernible] 13,000 feet and we had already $6 billion [indiscernible] used resource and mortgage, we got gold bond, silver bond and then we made a major change [indiscernible]. I remind everybody that [indiscernible] really set the tone [indiscernible] shareholders [indiscernible] 100% of what they own and we already gave up reserves in the future.","When FCX was went off the [indiscernible] $6 billion [indiscernible] acquisition, not only did we created the largest publicly traded copper producer but remember we had the instinct [indiscernible] geologic instincts we were able to drill these [indiscernible] imagine doubling the reserves [indiscernible] so my observations [indiscernible] in the first part [indiscernible] CEO and then and Jim [indiscernible] 2013 [indiscernible] we didn\u2019t have the benefit of [indiscernible] the way we can profile oil and gas prospects we didn\u2019t have the benefit of [indiscernible] we rejected the [indiscernible] in the case of the oil and gas [indiscernible] we got these [indiscernible] that are outlined [indiscernible] information but when you look at the discoveries that Jim has referred to [indiscernible] Power Nap [indiscernible] just offset [indiscernible] discovery was made [indiscernible] so we [indiscernible] oil and gas property in the Eagleford [indiscernible] over $4 billion so we\u2019ve done what we said we intended to do now what we have to do is to take advantage of the [indiscernible] that we have this growth profile which has been the history of our company [indiscernible] complete major projects [indiscernible] challenge but remember we acquired [indiscernible] acquisition platforms [indiscernible] three platforms now with the price drop $150 a barrel you can just imagine that we have a monopoly on the deepwater [indiscernible] platforms [indiscernible] on those assets for several years [indiscernible] happen in [indiscernible] facilities. We had geologic engineering teams working at the best place to put these platforms, so [indiscernible] acquire these in 2013 but today [indiscernible] price drop from $100 a barrel to $50 a barrel [indiscernible] platforms [indiscernible] justify. So lot of the production has been around our platforms aided by Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas by third parties who come to our facilities [indiscernible] equity [indiscernible] platform we have about 250,000 barrels capacity and when you compare that [indiscernible] which was of course the first one built in Freeport had a lot of lead time because [indiscernible] some of the engineering [indiscernible] about ten years [indiscernible] about $10 million to put that facility out there. We have about the same capacity [audio-gap] three platforms that we have. So as usual [indiscernible] this history of [indiscernible] geologic engineering big projects so although [indiscernible] just imagine the resources that we [indiscernible] $20 billion [indiscernible] facility [indiscernible] starting to turn around the [indiscernible] which was pointed out [indiscernible] in Asia [indiscernible] export barrel that was not just copper but [indiscernible] complete restructuring of the market [indiscernible] labor union situations there. Nobody was [indiscernible] when copper was $1 but when copper went up to $1 billion we owned up to $3 or $4 [indiscernible] part of the world-wide phenomenon we as I said we found the [indiscernible] copper was less than $1 and gold was $400 an ounce so when you look at where we are today [indiscernible] as I said we completed this 20 billion [indiscernible] expansion [indiscernible] the benefit this major investment we\u2019ve made [indiscernible] PXP MMR acquisition so [indiscernible] company [indiscernible] shows that we successfully managed some of the biggest projects in the world [indiscernible] oil and gas [indiscernible] not only managed from a clinical standpoint but managed it from a financial standpoint so [indiscernible] chance to what we\u2019ve done with our assets we\u2019ve always proven that we know how to manage risk we know how to manage the [indiscernible] projects and no matter how remote they are we are a leader in the industry and with what we\u2019ve put together with our asset base we\u2019re in a position now to really show [indiscernible] of what the [indiscernible] oil and gas [indiscernible]. So this is [indiscernible] whole team here [indiscernible] oil and gas experts [indiscernible]. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks Jim Bob. And we\u2019re ready to open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Tony Rizzuto","I\u2019ve got a couple of questions here. First of all, I think many people on this line today are surprised to see increase in CapEX especially after the nearly 85% dividend cut and obviously at a time when you\u2019re burning a lot of cash. Having you exhausted all opportunities to cut cost and CapEx elsewhere and if 2015 is the bridge year, why not take on some additional debt here instead of diluting shareholder interest further?","Jim Flores","That\u2019s a very complex question. I\u2019ll tell you we have gone through an exercise of looking at our capital cost across our business and coming up with a plan that we believe reflects the objective of limiting cost in the current environment, while protecting our assets and positioning us to take advantage of them over the long-term. So we\u2019ve clearly done that now and we can respond in more details about that Tony.","The issue of funding more debt is we started with strong objective which we communicated with the market following both the announcement of the oil and gas deal in December 12 and the closing of the transaction in mid \u201913 was that we were going to be focused on reducing our debt because of our belief that the nature of our assets can best the managed and position for growth with the balance sheet that\u2019s strong. We have a strong balance sheet. We are an investment grade rate company and we want to take actions to protect that investment grade rating.","We believe that\u2019s important for the credit markets, for the equity markets but also how we manage some of our reclamation obligations where we\u2019re able to use corporate guarantees as an investment grade rated company. So you mix this all together and our view has been that we should take steps not to grow debt, but to position ourselves to reduce debt overtime and then our board make the decision to reduce our dividend for now. We\u2019ve reduced it in 2008 as you recall and as markets recovered we aggressively increased it as the markets changed. My view is that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but we needed to take into account the uncertainties of the near term market conditions, position our company for future growth and for delivering our balance sheet in years beyond 2016.","We do not have current plans to issue equity for the parent company. We as Jim talked about this issue of getting highlights on the value of our oil and gas business, the idea of potentially issuing equity at that level, we could see it has benefits both in terms of highlighting those values, but also giving us the opportunity to look at a broader range of funding within that entity as a public entity. So we can see some benefits for it by the nature of doing that it takes time. You have to file registration statement with the SEC, go through review process and for us to have that alternative that filing would be required that doesn\u2019t mean that we would be fully committed to doing it that will be based on our view of all the alternatives we have and how the markets develop as we go forward with one of our fingers in the markets at all place and we\u2019re going to evaluate all alternatives and take the actions that best to our shareholders.","Tony Rizzuto","Okay and then again just I switch gears for a moment. Just the production at the couple places. First at the Grass Paver the production was 20% below your January guide or estimate are mainly due to lower mining. So I\u2019m wondering and you kind of indicated that it will prove through the quarter. Could you bring update where you were at quarter\u2019s end in relation to capacity there?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, one of the things to keep in mind is that we are ramping down the mining of waste there, in fact by the end of this year we will essentially have mine all of the waste in the Grass Paver pit, that\u2019s the material that allows us to get to the bottom of the pit and as we go forward we\u2019ll be mining ore and some low grade material that we\u2019re stock piling to provide throughput formula as we ramp up Grass Paver blockage. So for you Tony and those of us who have been following this for a long time, we need to adjust our view of what mining rates are there because that\u2019s not part of the Indonesian government issues or the labor union this is just the normal mine plan. Now we did have a work stoppage that was not a union action during the first quarter and some of the labor issues within our work force continue to be complicated. But that did not last long and by the end of the quarter we are essentially operating on a normal fashion and so that had an impact not only for a very short period of time when we had a work stoppage, but it\u2019s affected the some absenteeism issues, it affects some productivity issue and we\u2019ve been dealing with this labor issues now since 2011. But we now are back to a normal fashion we have negotiations with our unions coming up this year and we have confidence going into that, we got our union contract completed 2 years ago and it\u2019s relative straight forward fashion and we\u2019re building more positive relationships with union. But there are other issues within our work force that we\u2019ll have to continue to deal with. So one is look at where we are with our commandment in the fit with money rates going down and then we are working with some ongoing labor issues that had an impact in the first quarter and we\u2019re going to work hard to minimize that impact and we think we can going forward in the 2015 going in the last 3 quarter.","Tony Rizzuto","Alright, Richard. So strip ratios improve as you go through or should allow more normal or lesser rate of absenteeism. So lower unit cost and the other question I had was on server day and in the text talked about higher repair maintenance expense and higher mining cost. Is that all and preparation for the expansion ","[Audio Gap]","Richard Adkerson","\u2026\u2026based anymore. We are just following our plan. On the way and now we are down to where we\u2019re going to be mining. Since we are after this year or for the mill currently and some low grade material that we stockpiling to provide mill throughput [Audio Gap] when complete mining in the pit and ramping up the underground bucket. So all of that and as I said that\u2019s what we will be doing under any set of circumstances and before I turn it reed I want to, Kathleen give me a good note to follow up on the earlier conversation about delusion.","We have the ability to fund the plan that you see under our current revolver which we have $4 billion of availability at the end of the quarter and under the current plan we\u2019ve got to deal with the commodity prices whatever they will be hard prices or lower prices causes us to respond to those but we have the ability to bar temporarily under our credit facility and then if we get in the 2016 and generate cash flows even at today\u2019s prices we see that facility to coming back available to us in full force.","So it's -- we don\u2019t have the need to do a -- we don\u2019t have an absolute requirement to do external financing to execute the plan that you see today. We're focused on how to take advantage of these oil and gas assets to provide funding for its opportunities that separate apart from our overall corporate financial plan. ","Jim Flores","Tony just quickly, it\u2019s already we've brought additional trucks down from our other operations, 10 trucks this year that again is one of the strengths of our company where we could do that with support from other mining operations and our good equipment availabilities. So we're advancing the mining, they are making sure that, that fits in great shape and able to defeat this new big concentrator that is being built on schedule as Richard pointed out. So, we have taken some of the mining equipment to help with the construction of the starter temporarily and again to do all of that and achieve to facility, so it did cause a variance in the first quarter.","Jim Bob Moffett","If look at where we are today actually we have been spent $20 billion [indiscernible] planning [indiscernible] trying to measure oil and gas, [indiscernible] during the year we saw there is $4.5 billion worth of assets [indiscernible] there is [indiscernible] what we have to do this year we're pushing the right buttons. Thank you -- if I just [indiscernible] stop looking [indiscernible] make sure they were using debt [indiscernible] have in the past[indiscernible] but most importantly the ability for any company imagine a company our size [indiscernible] 20 billion of middle of the expansion [indiscernible]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jorge Beristain","May be this question is meant for Kathleen, but where are we right now with the carrying value or the book value of your oil and gas assets as of this latest write-down and if you could just give me both the 100% book value and then the net to Freeport.","Kathleen Quirk","Okay. Jorge, if you look you can find that on our balance sheet, we've got that details so you can see what the balances were at the end of the quarter compared to where it was at the year end.","The full cost accounting rules which we talked about in the past require that we assess the ceiling each quarter. And it's important to keep in mind that that formula we are using approved reserves.","So, we've -- as Jim talked about during the comments we have really expanded our resources those haven\u2019t been converted yet into proved reserves and SEC requirements under full cost accounting requires to use a 12 month trailing average for oil and gas prices. So that's why you saw that charge in the fourth quarter and a subsequent charge in the first quarter. The trailing number for oil is roughly $83. So we could have a oil prices stay below that we could have additional charges in the second and third quarter until the 12-month trailing averages is trued up. But you can see here we've got on the balance sheet we\u2019ve got $6.7 billion in the oil and gas property and that\u2019s the -- essentially the proved reserves and then additional 9.7 billion that's not in the full cost ceiling. And that\u2019s the net of depreciation. ","Jim Flores","This is Jim, just on an operational basis, oil and gas areas like Holstein Deep are deep are detailed base and our high Lander. All those are not in our approved category yet and that\u2019s how we can manage our funding cost at our proved reserves growth from. We have a huge pipeline of projects that will become proved this year and next year and the following year already established.","Jorge Beristain","I\u2019m just trying to sort of get out of ahead of what a book value could look like for this unit at time of IPO and we\u2019ve just run a quick sensitivity if we just hold a Brent crude constant over the next 4 quarters and just kind of see what the trailing 4 quarter historical looks like. It looks like you could still be in for but another 3 billion of rate downs in 2Q maybe a billion and half in 3Q and that\u2019s not including the stock you are proving up that you are mentioning this not in your book value yet. But I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of if those kind of order of magnitudes seem correct you and what kind of book value do you actually see having by 4Q that the present takes?","Jim Flores","That looks high to us. If we were to have calculated our full cost sealing test at the end of March using the current strip prices there would have been approximately a $2 billion incremental higher right down at the end of March, SEC rules wouldn\u2019t allow us to do that and because we\u2019ve to use this 12 month average. But if you were to go forward and say the strict prices would be realized over the forward, the numbers would be closure to $2 billion than $3 billion and $3.5 billion.","Jorge Beristain","I\u2019m sure that\u2019s because as you was seeing spot health constant not the forward strip. But that is helpful and then to Jim\u2019s comment earlier, could you give us an order of magnitude of what you think the offset that could be coming against those futures right downs would be by the proving up or the conversion of resources to reserves?","Jim Flores","The aspect that is going to be fully engineered and I strictly feel at this point all right that the difference is of having so much of it discovered in the last 2 years and not hit the approved category, the price function, the actual operating function and we push to our capital like we\u2019ve been pushing our capital that slows down the proved booking process. So there is, If I can figure out exactly what capital we have where the external going forward what the acceleration of those developments were and what prices were, I can answer your question lot closure than just saying is a positive trend. I think it\u2019s the best way to talk about it because the inventory is full. It\u2019s just the matter of all those factors and coming together what actually gets booked and what don\u2019t. But the resources are there.","Richard Adkerson","I\u2019m sure you understand this but just to be clear, once you write something down even though prices may come back, you have future reserves, you don\u2019t write it backup under our accounting system. The book value stays there, what higher prices or higher reserves would do and it\u2019s important to note that reserves are function of prices as well. As prices go higher economic limits extend and reserve volumes increasing, lower prices put limits on how much reserves you can add at a particular point in time. But that could tend to offset this $2 billion number we\u2019re talking about. It wouldn\u2019t result and ride up our past right now.","Jim Flores","And you are going to see our rate in the oil & gas unit because of the right downs be more critical to our final cost going forward and will be an ad reserve that finding cost which will be beneficial or par with our DDNA rate versus what\u2019s it been at the end of last year was $40 plus and this could be 20S doesn\u2019t the right down I guess going forward.","Jim Bob Moffett","[indiscernible] when you talk about resources if you look at the map in detail. [indiscernible] resources you see there [indiscernible] drilled and undrilled the important part of that would [indiscernible] All those have been drilled so that number you see going from $75 million to $270 million and have [indiscernible] so we have two kind of resources on these maps. [indiscernible] full cost raised and then its separate, you know we had a green color for resources and red color for reserve. We have lot of in this category right now. ","Jorge Beristain","Fully understood and I appreciate the extra color and just lastly Jim on page 22 at the PowerPoint are those projection for the potential tripling of your production based on the assumption that you are self funded or is that assuming extra capital comes into the company. ","Jim Flores","That\u2019s a lot assuming, extra capital comes in the company. What it does, it will just \u2013 if it does and that we self funded ourselves that just means it\u2019s a slower slop and it would extend the peak cap beyond 2025. So everything just shift forward into the future years at the slower pace but we can accelerate with the additional funding that comes in. ","Jorge Beristain","Got it. Thank you. ","Jim Flores","And let me just say everyone these forecast accounting rules are complicated and logical in certain respects in today\u2019s world and so if you have questions call David and he will answer them or he will arrange for our people to walk you through. So, we\u2019ll make sure everybody understands what this is and what it is. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Brian Yu","Good, thanks. First question is just on oil and gas on page 23 of the presentation where we can see the improvement EBITDA between additional funding versus without additional funding. But I increase \u2013 if incorporate the increased CapEx notes under both scenarios are the net number is about a negative 3.9 billion unlevered free cash flow for 2015 and 2017. So, in the context with the impressive IRIs that were laid out on page 15 at the handout. When should the energy business start generating positive free cash on a standalone basis under those assumptions? ","Jim Flores","It would be at 2017 at a $74 oil price. As the assumptions, so if it\u2019s not \u2013 so if oil is not $74 in 2017 it will be in 2018 and setting forth, so functional price and also the production scheduling wise. ","Brian Yu","Okay. In 2017, there is still about a $400 million sure fall. ","Richard Adkerson","At these prices you have to --. ","Brian Yu","Okay. I guess maybe I can ask you just because at the IRI deal work so specifically a lot higher than what we would typically see for the mining business. I\u2019m just trying to figure out where the disconnect is versus the projections versus the more bottoms up individual project analysis. ","Jim Flores","Its probably in the snapshot of the three years from the stand point of scheduling what projects are being funded in 2017 that will affect 2018, 2019 productions. So it\u2019s a function of prices and also production schedule out there and when we sold the Eagle Ford and took that big chunk of production out of our production profile still in that whole we can debate a long time when we get it down but sooner we fill it with production and then we start to worry about the price, the simple our model with become and all the way to do that to schedule our wells being hooked up that we drilled already at a faster rate with outside funding. That\u2019s the model and understand your frustration but you imagine trying to put together a static model for you guys with so many moving parts with depending on what capital is coming on the door. ","Richard Adkerson","The other thing we have is through this period you see through 2017 we have existing rate contracts that were contracted for couple of years back. What we are seeing is cost coming down and so we\u2019ll be able post 2017 to do more with less cost. So, you\u2019ll see the capital expenditure numbers reflecting longer term reflecting lower cost of rigs and service cost etcetera. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Captial. Please go ahead.","David Gagliano ","I have two questions related to the capital spending issue and may be you've already covered some of this, but I just -- I still don\u2019t understand. On the oil and gas site CapEx went up by about a billion, obviously volumes went up only 10% on 2017. So my question is actually tied to slide 22. How much of the growth between 2018 and 2020 in oil and gas on slide 22 is now covered or whatever by these updated capital spending plans and how much more CapEx would be needed to get to the 400 billion barrels per day target by 2020. That's my question on the oil and gas side. And then on the copper side, can you -- I missed this. What were the main drivers for the $300 million increase in copper spending since the last conference call. ","Jim Flores","Well, the second part is -- we don't have. What you focusing on there because we haven\u2019t really\u2026","Kathleen Quirk","The capital we're spending in 2015 is 3.7 that\u2019s the same as what it was before. Actually we've taken down CapEx in 2016 and 17 by a total of 300 million, it's 300 million -- ","David Gagliano","I think that we got that one backwards. So that\u2019s helpful. That answers that one. Okay, and then on the oil and gas side?","Jim Flores","Kathleen, keep going.","Richard Adkerson","David, the swing areas is, we got two types of capital. You got your drilling capital and capping alluded to the costs are covered down the spread right, I think we have 10% reduction this year. 15%, 20% and the 30% as we have passed 17, reduce the -- some of the drilling costs. Assuming those costs continued to go down.","But the other big thing is the timing of the completions and the completion capital. That\u2019s really our variable capital in our budget, our discretionary capital. So I can't emphasize enough the quip to your question is, it's going to be how much we spend early enough to get the production response so we\u2019re self funded with the production versus continue and breed along without the capital, without the capital early because if we're going to slow our program down we could show for the next -- in two years, we could be totally self funding the 17 based on the $75 oil price and ramping up production and close the gap that Brian highlighted. Okay.","Or we could spend four years at a slow pace spending us less amount of money and continuing to fund the deficit, you get to the same point. And we have that flexibility and the assets. And that\u2019s where the question of we've been wrestling with here Freeport as to what's the best thing for the shareholders and that\u2019s why we're exploring the external option of the IPO, to accelerate that business so it becomes self funding faster versus the -- versus the longer debt spend at the slower burn.","David Gagliano","Okay, is there a way just to give a number on 2018 to 2020 incremental capital needed to get to the 400 million barrels or is that just not --?","Jim Flores","The incremental capital is a function of how what, there is some base plan to what we're talking about, the current plan or the high growth plan without high capital. ","David Gagliano","I am basically talking about the chart on slide 22. How much capital did you need to get to the 400 million barrels of oil a day by 2020?","Jim Flores","That would easy thing, be from this what forward it would be as reflected in the numbers here on page 23, it would be the 3.8 billion in 16 and $3.5 billion in 17 on a aide X basis and depending on what's has been it's the delta between that would be the additional capitals. We were projected 2018 through 2020 and be self funding through the EBITA growth. I know __ how that the EBITDA growth and or the EBITDA in 18-20, but it's not a negative number, it\u2019s positive. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Curt Woodworth","Jim I wanted if you can address what incremental CapEx would be under the funding scenario, looks like you're looking for about 1.5 billion of incremental spend, in \u201916 or \u201917 and can you also talk about why you think an IPO would be more preferable to try to structure either JV or a partnership on a project basis.","Jim Flores","Well it all depends on what the market -- what market's out there and so forth. Currently, the market that we see is a market that has capital in it from a JV basis, but everybody has got a lot of projects to do and there is not a lot of discretionary capital, those are very expensive. The private equity market is very expensive as well because they re-capital other existing businesses. We\u2019re just looking forward the best former capital. I mean we\u2019ve got a fabulous growth profile in our business. We\u2019ve drilled the well taking the risk. We certainly not going to give them away just because we don\u2019t want to borrow money. Here that\u2019s not purgative. We want to make sure we find the lowest cheapest cost to capital and with the best benefits and the benefits are getting the visibility borrowed by our shareholders to what we\u2019ve achieved and what in the performance of oil & gas business along with what we think is a inexpensive form of equity for Freeport McMoRan in the form of equity at SMLG make some sense. Again like we\u2019re just said we\u2019re studying, we\u2019ve helped that go to this process and right now it looks the most favorable because the industry just issued $8 billion of equity here in the pretty dynamic environment. So right now that\u2019s a very viable into for us and we encourage while allow the investment banks to pursue it.","Jim Bob Moffett","[indiscernible] these 3 platform that we have that are pushing in you deep water side are the [indiscernible]. You should imagine those as magnets. These people [indiscernible] including our sale. We have a [indiscernible] market for this is we are totaling with people[indiscernible] difference is the [indiscernible] the diamonds if they made a [indiscernible] ] facility [indiscernible]","Curt Woodworth","Okay, thanks. Richard just a question on the need can you comment on kind of how the discussions are going with the MOU and specifically what the plan would be for these sell down of PTFI I understand I think the new mining were acquired some additional 19% to 20% stake reduction with the government having the first right to acquire that, so I\u2019m just curious on where that stands and how do you think that could be resolved actually.","Jim Flores","That is one of the points discovered in the MOU and the government has regulations that applied to different types of mining arrangements they have to existing mines so forth with in terms of our working with the government and reconciling our contract of work which requires no divestitures and the governments new regulations. The MOU reflects a mutual agreement that we would increase the current 9.36% interest owned by the government to 30% over the time and as you said the way that would be approached that would be part of the set of points that we would agree to and getting the extension of our rights to operate under except gold. Physical terms is that within the pursued over time in steps. The agreement is that the sales would at fair value and the first step would be offering it to the government we\u2019ve talked about having a piece of that ultimately through a listing on the Indonesian stock exchange and the government officials have expressed positive aspects of that, the province of pop was indicated an aspiration to own symmetry and we do some financial structures to accomplish that. All of this would come in to play as part of reaching a resolution of the long term operating rights that we have but the MOU covers the extent of the future divestiture.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera of Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Oscar Cabrera","Just I wanted to get back to the \u2013 in general want to get back to oil and gas question that couple of people asked and if I may, increase your CapEx from 15% to 17% by 1.6 billion with that increase in CapEx will we get to again \u2013 slide 22 has approximately 225,000 barrels a day which my math is about 82 million barrels a year of oil equivalent. Can we assume that that\u2019s the figure that you\u2019re looking for in 2018?","Jim Flores","Out of the growth plan, yes with additional capital, that\u2019s correct. So, if this is not something that is committed to all the future growth plan, it\u2019s an opportunity for us and we\u2019re going to assessing whether \u2013 what we\u2019ve given you in our budget plans that\u2019s part of the presentation is where we are today with our capital spending plans. We have opportunities provided we can get capital through a variety of sources. Cark mentioned the joint venture opportunity with other companies whether there is financing at a property level, whether there is financing available at the entity level. And if we\u2019re able to \u2013 possible to get funding on the reasonable basis to pursue the growth plan the chart that you\u2019re referring to as what would be achieved under that plan. If we aren\u2019t able to, if we conclude that the cost of capital is to expensive than we will give you guidance as to how that would work out under our base plan and the opportunities won\u2019t go away, its like the projects we suspended in 2008 in our mining business. Cerro Verde being pursued before that we suspended it. It didn\u2019t go away and now we\u2019re developed it later. ","So, we have rights to these resources that are long term and we will be managing how we spend money, how we finance that spending in a way that responsive to market conditions, and market conditions are changing as we speak and so we\u2019re going to have our figures on all of these sources of financing and we\u2019ll make decisions and we will advice the market as to what the consequences of those decisions would be as we go forward. ","Oscar Cabrera","Okay. Maybe if I ask the question this way. On slide 31, you have oil and gas expenditures in 2015, 2016 and 2017 at $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion. This compared to the last presentation is $1.6 billion more. So, you presenting in 2017 oil and gas fields of 63 million barrels. So, with additional capital that we increase from last time we talked in the conference call to now will that give you additional production of oil and gas in 2018. I assume so and I\u2019m just trying to assess what\u2019s the level? Is the level the one that you\u2019re showing in slide 22 and I can appreciate that there opportunities. ","Jim Flores","That\u2019s slide 23, that\u2019s the current plan on top with the current, our current funding that\u2019s reflects on page 31, reflects in the current plan and this what I was talking about. If we continue to put off the completion and hoop up and facilities need to add new production as we drill it, as we \u2013 we\u2019ve already drilled it in the last two years than we will not see a show up in the production numbers. Okay? It will in the current plan, their production aren\u2019t going anywhere like we\u2019re just talking about and it will take longer years forward to get all that production. So on a three year outlook you\u2019ll miss some of that production if we raise the additional fund and we\u2019re able to put the wells on that we\u2019ve already drilled on the timely basis then you will see the graphs at the lower portion when gross 1.43 to 2.17 and the additional funding required and our variable funding is the completion dollars which affects the timing and that\u2019s when I think it was David heard whatever I wanted 18 to 20 will tell you where you can see the reflection basically in the current plan we would hit the same 217 of few year further out because of this delay of spending in that funding.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay. Thank you. Then in terms of the equity raise or potential equity rise. I\u2019m assuming based on your comments that this will be at the oil and gas business level. How much or have you sort of upto what levels Freeport McMaRan holding company would be willing to dilute of its holding in the oil and gas business.","Jim Flores","We are under some restrictions under the securities law about how much we can talk about details part following which duration registration segment and getting SEC review. We can\u2019t say this Freeport McMaRon [indiscernible] a significant majority interest in that FCX would retain a significant majoriy interest in Freeport McMarRon I don\u2019t\u2019 want to guess and the amount of the offering in terms that will dependant on market condition when we\u2019re ready to inter the market and we cannot do that because of the procedure of requirement of the SEC review.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay, then lastly just if I may just a comment and a question. So the comment is just I wanted to thank congratulations for the achievements already. I think that\u2019s being remarkable our project and then the question. You have a comment here on your release talking about the MOU in Grasberg and it says no terms of this the COW all that and those relating to expert duties, smelter burn and increase royalties will be changed. Can you clarify that like is the government still trying to increase royalties or change beyond?","Jim Flores","Let me clarify that those who are agreed to last summer when we assigned the original MOU. We agreed to increase royalties to the current royalties under the mining law and there is no further adjustments to that, we also agree to put assurity bond of $115 million to demonstrate our seriousness about pursuing the smelter deal. There is no adjustment to that and then we agreed to pay an export duty on a sliding scale. All of that was agreed to in the summer of 2014 and none of those terms were changed when we extended the MOU in January and they are not we\u2019re not being approached for further changes along those lines.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay, great. Thanks very much for your answers.","Jim Bob Moffett","It is Jim, I want to give you a little color on, the questions you asked about the capital less area production and then you said the same for you. We have this platform where keep talking about there have been about $60 billion worth of platform. [indiscernible] production to be increased to these capacity and the interim camp between every [indiscernible] and what we\u2019ve done to date. We now drill well [indiscernible] there are 100 of fees to pay [indiscernible] not guessing because of you want to be resources being drill and [indiscernible]. so we have the platform in there, we have the wells that are getting drill. The question mark is how much money do you spend across the capital. [indiscernible] you get the oil from the well on the platform that\u2019s already been drilled, already in our [indiscernible] paid for [indiscernible] genius is around here. Extraordinary things, but mission impossible is to say what\u2019s the right decision [indiscernible] to date because that\u2019s going to depend on what the price is [indiscernible] so you understand the difference between the risk factor. Platforms are built the well drill and you [indiscernible] when we heard about [indiscernible]","Oscar Cabrera","That was just all right. Understood. It\u2019s just coming from doing about 15 years of mining research. Oil and gas is new and we\u2019re just learning about this risk and it looks from a distance it looks that oil and gas and deepwater is lot more riskier than onshore and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to establish the parameters to give you the right value for those assets but thank you for your comments.","Jim Bob Moffett","[Indiscernible] then you got a good teacher and Jim Bob\u2019s the best teacher in oil and gas as you\u2019ve ever heard of.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian MacArthur","My question is coming on [indiscernible] but I just want to go back to the Grasberg capital. You\u2019ve got the five year forecast your share from 700 million to 600 million, but then you make a comment that there\u2019s an additional 300 million a year for the next five years for underground ore handling et cetera. My first question on that is that all yours [indiscernible] to fund some of that?","Kathy Quirk","[Indiscernible] does fund some of that Brian the percentage varies depending on the share of production. And that\u2019s nothing new, those numbers were always in our plan. You see in the CapEx schedules that we will reduce some of the CapEx in 2016 to 2017 that is related to timing of some of those expenditures that we\u2019ve pushed out, but those capital expenditures from no modifications and power upgrades have always been part of our plan.","Brian MacArthur","Right so that\u2019s where it\u2019s soft then it is fairly back-end loaded so a lot of that spending would be if I\u2019m trying to look at things out in \u201918 there\u2019ll be much higher numbers out in \u201918 as you spent a instead of like 600 million a year you\u2019d be spending closer to $1 billion a year should I think of it that way?","Kathy Quirk","Yes I mean as we do \u2013 we\u2019re planning when we need to do these no modifications and highlight handling and power upgrade and we\u2019re going to do it prudently and with an eye on trying to match it up with when we ultimately need it, but yes we\u2019ll have some of those expenditures will be higher in \u201918, \u201919 timeframe.","Brian MacArthur","And do you need to \u2013 so the forecast you\u2019re giving us for those years \u201819 to \u201821 because the production figures have moved around a little bit. Do you need to do that to get to those numbers that you\u2019re talking but i.e., if you don\u2019t do this will production be lower because of some complex metallurgy or something or do you need to do these for sure just to get to those forecast levels?","Kathy Quirk","Yes what we need to do and what we need to do is reflected in our long range plans.","Jim Flores","But some of this has been adjusted because the completion of the pit was originally supposed occur into 2016.","Brian MacArthur","Right.","Jim Flores","It\u2019s been extended [audio-gap].","Jim Flores","\u2026estimates because the effects of worldwide global energy cost and the lower cost of steel and things like that so we have some impact not a huge impact from currency changes so but the basic plan has not changed what we\u2019re going to do little bit of change to when we\u2019re going to do it and some of that on the absolute amount of cost because of the changing global commodity prices.","Brian MacArthur","Great. Thank you very much for that color, that\u2019s helpful.","Jim Bob Moffett","Let me \u2013 this is Jim Bob, let me address [indiscernible] rapid bullets fired around here. [Indiscernible] deepwater and the onshore give me a chance to talk about the Highlander well produced in that the Highlander well which you haven\u2019t been -- we haven\u2019t talked about much in the detail [indiscernible] situation [indiscernible] 28,500 feet is the largest well that\u2019s ever been completed since [indiscernible] if you remember was [indiscernible] and it was such a big part of the Exxon Mobil transaction [audio-gap] 100 million a day [indiscernible] like to move [indiscernible] and the reason why that\u2019s important law low[indiscernible] that can use [indiscernible] and that well probably and some of the wells are producing over 250 BCF and projection production 400 BCF. So we\u2019ve been have a wells for similar to the low [indiscernible] resivor and the structure is [indiscernible] and we are from 30 to 60,000 [indiscernible]. So we have been [indiscernible] 5 years becoming experts at deep drilling and the deep potential and it\u2019s old trend from 200 miles away is [indiscernible] how that put spotted over it. [indiscernible] export terminal is [indiscernible] projects they don\u2019t have to have 5 to 700 million cubic feet of gas per day. [indiscernible] in exploration for gas because more the gas price [indiscernible] exploration. They look up and see the other half 5 to 700 million cubic [indiscernible] per day. And the time when we drill the discovery of 125 million in 1981 and also [indiscernible] had a the reasons on that gulf and [indiscernible] and they were having to provide a contracts with the help of Florida gas. But 300 million a day and they wouldn\u2019t have pay for [indiscernible] the well we drill offset was deregulated natural gas. We sell the gas for $9 NCF. So just to tell you that [indiscernible] have a funny way of turning on you and people make [indiscernible] from image to be able to deliver gas like with your export gas or L&G. [indiscernible] these toward looking the 5 to 700 million cubic gas a day. You better know [indiscernible]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Again coming back to the questions around the CapEx, I think a lot of us are still having trouble understanding what the rationality is for increasing your base case CapEx for the oil and gas business by $1.6 billion. [Audio Gap] Thank you.","Jim Flores","Again [indiscernible] its timing. The aspect [Audio Gap] of delaying the completions, we increase the CapEx for couple of reasons. I\u2019ll talk about that first of all. The discovery at [indiscernible] the additional drilling there the acceleration of offset exploitation projects like deep [indiscernible] by the operator. Obviously we are going to participate in because of the lowest nature of it and the de-risking by the [indiscernible] as well. Also when we drill our [indiscernible] West we risk them at 25% success or whether it success we have to complete it. We have to add capital in for that.","We\u2019ve also taken a delivery of an additional shift called the [indiscernible] relentless here in the later third quarter to drill some development wells around the foreign mountain area to further like our operation to more efficient. We have to shut that platform in for the facility modifications. Those sides of things are making our operation more efficient and they can reservoir the placement more achievable and [indiscernible] of the long-term. You are not seeing it in the first 3 years with dynamic production growth because we are delaying a lot of the completion dollar for those projects because a budget concerns. So the whole exercise on page 23 that everybody struggling with is that if we would spend the money to complete the wells and earlier than what we plan our current plan and we have the capital to do it. We would see those production adjustments in 2017 as for the bottom part of page 23 versus the current plan we have on the top part of the page. Strictly production timing issue and we\u2019re going to get back David [indiscernible] will have some information on 18, 19 and 20 where you\u2019ll see the rest of the production profile. So if we have the additional capital we\u2019re able to accelerate those [indiscernible] not to drilling, not to risk and so forth of drilling wells is strictly hooking them up and the capital involve there then you\u2019ll see the production response within the three year period. But then on the current plan that we have that\u2019s on the prudent finance plan of allocating capital reducing our CapEx company wide, we\u2019re taking a more measured approach bringing that capital forward. And if the Katanga curve and oil curve is correct if we\u2019re in $70 oil market in couple of years, it\u2019s going to be much more beneficial to delay that production coming on because of price going forward. So that\u2019s where the magic happens. That cleared up?","Unidentified Analyst","It does to some extent but perhaps can you quantify this $1.6 billion, how much incremental production does that give you say in 2018 versus three months ago forecast?","Richard Adkerson","There\u2019ll be another 30,000 barrels of that. Yes but that\u2019s not the story for you. Let\u2019s take the success we\u2019ve had in the Vito Basin area as an example. I mean we acquired an interest in this area that shows been working on a development plan. Together we show we drilled this Power Nap well that\u2019s had tremendous amount of new information about the geology in that area and it\u2019s a very positive well. It\u2019s leading us now to look to develop to drill another exploration type well called Deep Sleep which will provide us significant information which has been de-risked significantly and has the chance of identifying a huge structure there. The information that we get from Power Nap and Deep Sleep to change the whole idea about how to develop that Vito Basin area. In that case for developing that that\u2019s going to take a number of years because this is a case where we have to put in new production facilities. It\u2019s not tying back to these existing production facilities and so this has similarities to making decision for major mine developers. First have to understand the geology. You have to develop a \u2013 you have to come up with a development plan for it. That development plan takes a number of years to put in place so the [indiscernible] that has been added to capital expenditures because of the success at Power Nap and Vito Basin area is going to lead us to spend some more capital to understand what we have, how it should be developed and make decisions on development and so that production is not going to come [indiscernible] for a number of years.","Jim Flores","That\u2019s illustrated on Page 22 and 2019 is when Vito area starts producing in 2020 and so that\u2019s going on very fast illustrates exactly what Richard just said.","Richard Adkerson","And we still don\u2019t know because when we drill this Deep Sleep well that may provide us some new insights just to how to develop this whole area. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s unfolding. It takes time and it\u2019s not going to be a question like some of the hook ups that Jim was talking about that have production consequences much quicker, but this is a major-major development project that could be one of the biggest projects in the entire deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico.","Jim Flores","Net a billion barrels for the company.","Unidentified Analyst","And just one more question on CapEx, how much incremental CapEx should we assume will be spent on the smelter in Indonesia which I assume is not in your guidance here?","Richard Adkerson","It\u2019s not something where capital would be spent of significance until post 2016 because of the permitting time and so forth with that. In order to give you a sense of that the \u2013 to think of the smelter project because we come up with an approach of expanding not necessarily expanding making a Bolton type addition to our existing smelter [indiscernible] with partner Mitsubishi being an expenditure on the order of $2 billion with working capital something maybe slightly more than that. And so our plans would be to obtain project type financing for majority of those cost and then there would be the underlying equity that would be funded by partnership structure which we would have the major part of, but we would have other partners coming in, we are negotiating that and so our share of that projects cost would be a portion of the underlying equity for the project financing for majority of that cost in that construction that would be started in late 2016 or in 2017.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and Rio would be responsible for their kind of proportionate share of that as well currently?","Richard Adkerson","Rio I\u2019m not sure if they don\u2019t call knows it Rio is our partner now and their interest in [indiscernible]steps up to 40% both 2021 and so they would have an interest in seeing that we come up with an arrangement for with the government for extending beyond 2021. We are in discussions, we have a great partnership with Rio and we are talking with them about how best to proceed. We don\u2019t have an agreement on that now. But I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get a one that will be good for all of us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. But it sounds like you are suggesting that we should not assume that Rio is planning to fund 40% of it or my misunderstanding?","Richard Adkerson","Mitsubishi\u2019s potential partner there is other potential partners out there, you shouldn\u2019t assume that we\u2019re going to fund 60% of it. So we\u2019re at the stage right now working with Japanese construction firm, own construction contract. We are working with the land owner which is in Jason fertilizer operator where we have an additional deal with own land ownership rights and Sophia [indiscernible] up take, we are working to permitting. So there is a lot of work to be going forward. Let\u2019s go back to your original question about capital spending. We\u2019re not looking at $2 billion of capital coming to Freeport. We are looking at a smaller amount coming in over years in the future and we\u2019ll update you as we go forward in getting the details instruction of this project completed.","Jim Bob Moffett","Let me just make sure that you understand. The change in the export [projected] price last year when no more permission given [indiscernible] for the [indiscernible] et cetera. What is main this is comment. It\u2019s not [indiscernible] it is export. [indiscernible] I mean if you can\u2019t take all from the Indonesia and putting it back to [indiscernible] so that means the Japanese are sitting there with their smelters with no fig. so this is not just a problem for the exporter the matter if the problem is discovered, the complete restructuring of the market. In other words to make is simple everybody assume that this is [indiscernible] and then for 100 years in Japan and other places [indiscernible] with archeology expert without [indiscernible] contract to work and for this negotiation you still [indiscernible] so the smelters don\u2019t have a slam dunk. [indiscernible] we just don\u2019t [indiscernible] there is a problem. [indiscernible] has no minerals on it and yet it has the downstream part of business. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s still [indiscernible] there is going to be fun work because this is not just one guy caught in [hot fire] everybody got the same problem. It\u2019s complete restructuring of how the business is done. Train to concentrate and the smelter.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Paretosh Misra","I had two questions I could ask but one is based on your conversation with the government so far, do you get the sense that they are open to renew your contract sooner than 2019 as long as there is an agreement on other issues like that [indiscernible]?","Richard Adkerson","Yes that\u2019s our mutual objective and we are working towards that and the issue is and you know we are working on that happening this year sooner this year than later and the government officials working on recognize that as well.","Paretosh Misra","And out of the total CapEx this year, how much are you spending at Grasberg including sustained CapEx?","Richard Adkerson","Around 600 million.","Kathy Quirk","The underground capital is in the $800 million range and sustaining is in the few $100 million range.","Paretosh Misra","And actually just one last one. I know you\u2019ve given in the past your some sort of guidance for the cash cost at Grasberg when you built completely underground, can you just remind us what that number is?","Kathy Quirk","Yes well the guidance we\u2019ve given is based on getting the full capacity, so in the earlier years as we\u2019re ramping up it will be higher, but at current oil prices we continue to expect that Grasberg underground will be the lowest cost portfolio and certainly less than $0.50 a pound. So we\u2019re not seeing here it changes in the open pit cost versus underground because of the nature of underground mining and the absence of stripping, so we\u2019ve got a very good cost structure, large scale it will be similar to the track record you\u2019re seeing with Grasberg over the years.","Richard Adkerson","With all of this noise that we\u2019ve had to deal with for the past several years we \u2013 none of us here lose sight of just what a fabulous ore body this is. I mean it\u2019s really special in terms of the copper grades and gold grades that you have available through us. The ability to operate large scale block caving operations is spectacular. We\u2019re moving towards having a 250,000 tonne per day concentrator mill filled totally by underground operations and that\u2019s unique in this industry and we\u2019ve shown that we can operate Block Cave scales. Freeport\u2019s been block caving there since early 1980s and our DOZ mine and its predecessors that shallower elevations had years of successful operations, so we have the kind of ore the kind of host rock that allows us to operate at a truly world leading scale to get to this high grade ore and the rates of return on this project are spectacular.","Jim Bob Moffett","This is Jim Bob again [indiscernible] open pit and in open pit you have [indiscernible] because you can\u2019t just make [indiscernible] underground. When [indiscernible] block caving [indiscernible] surround your ore [indiscernible] Block Cave [indiscernible] Block Cave. You don\u2019t have to do it other ways, so imagine [indiscernible] open pit [indiscernible] with all these [indiscernible] right around [indiscernible] to just sit there and scratch the bottom of this Block Cave [indiscernible] first blast and then [indiscernible] and find a place to put it [indiscernible] enormous part of our [indiscernible] but that\u2019s because you have to build [indiscernible] when you look at that [indiscernible] all that has been there [indiscernible] copper and gold and silver [indiscernible] so that\u2019s why we have the change. It sounds like 100 million people historically thought underground was [indiscernible] changes the whole impression of [indiscernible] but remember you\u2019re operating underground [indiscernible].","Richard Adkerson","And for the industry as a whole underground mining is a lot more expensive, but that\u2019s a unique characteristic of this [indiscernible] ore body is that we are able to mine such large volumes of high grade ore and reduce that unit cost down to depending on diesel fuel and so forth the levels that are and the price of gold levels that are consistent with our historical price cost levels there so, it\u2019s great asset. Listen we appreciate everybody\u2019s participation in I think a record setting length of a conference call, but we had a lot to talk about today. We want to make sure that in the context of these commodity markets and the changes in our plans that you understood what our assets are that we have to work with, what options we have to do, how we\u2019re approaching it. We\u2019re going to have as I said our fingers on all aspects of the markets for commodities and markets for capital that are available to us and we\u2019re going to find the right alternative to go forward and achieve our strategic objectives. Bring value out of these assets being alone.","Richard Adkerson","[Indiscernible] talk about [indiscernible] properties.","Jim Flores","All right everyone thanks and follow up questions [indiscernible] is available to be the point guy and we\u2019ll get people to answer them for you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also got Red Conger here, and Mark Johnson. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our presentation materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for Q&A.","Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion, $3.35 per share for first quarter of 2016. The loss included net charges totaling $4 billion or $3.19 per share primarily for the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties, idle rig costs and other items. After adjusting for the net special items the first quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $197 million or $0.16 per share.","Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter approximated $873 million and there is a reconciliation of that amount on Page 32 of our slide deck. Consolidated sales totaled $1.1 billion pounds of copper during the quarter just over 200,000 ounces of gold, $17 million pounds of molybdenum and $12.1 million barrels of oil equivalents.","Our realized price for copper during the first quarter was $2.17 per pound that was below last year\u2019s first quarter average of $2.72 per pound. Gold prices were slightly above last year\u2019s average. In the first quarter of 2016, our gold prices averaged $1,227 per ounce.","And our realized price for crude oil during the first quarter of 2016 was $29 per barrel that was significantly below last year's first quarter price of $44.54 per barrel which included about $12 per barrel and realized gains on derivative contracts. We reported very good cost performance during the quarter and are on track to meet or exceed our cost guidance for the year.","The average cost of production net of by-product credits for our copper mines averaged $1.38 per pound in the first quarter of 2016. Those were lower than last year's first quarter of a $1.64. We had the benefit of volume and also the impact of our ongoing cost reduction initiative. Our average cost of a $1.38 was below the estimate we provided in January of 2016 of $1.44 per pound.","We generated operating cash flows totaling $740 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were just under $1.982 billion during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in debt and our consolidated cash was $331 million. Richard is going to be talking on this call about our efforts to reduce debt significantly and our progress on our asset sale program.","We ended the quarter with availability under our revolver totaling $3 billion at quarter end and at the end of the quarter we had $1.25 billion common shares outstanding.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We are just mailing out our annual report and the theme of it\u2019s \u201cProving our Mettle\u201d that\u2019s the ability to face a demanding situation in a spirited and resilient way. And I can tell you our team here couldn\u2019t be approaching its work in a more positive way from that standpoint. I\u2019m very proud of all that our team is doing.","We have a clearly defined strategy that our Board has set and we are really focused on executing it now. We experienced strong operating results in the face of weak commodity prices and we made a lot of progress in achieving our strategic and financial objectives during this quarter.","Our reported earnings were in line with our plans, actually a bit higher because we had somewhat higher copper prices during the quarter. We did have a significant additional impairment charge, which was substantially all in our oil and gas business and we have taken recent steps to restructure that business to reduce costs and that is progressing well. We got a really good operating team there and some good assets and we are focused on attacking cost aggressively and have begun to do that.","We are continuing to look for opportunities to sell or monetize assets in the oil and gas business, but we are now working with \u2013 and this is a tough market, admittedly a tough market to try to do that. But we are working with our operating team on new plans to preserve and enhance value of our assets for the future.","With our mining business, we are performing well. The Cerro Verde startup is proceeding exceptionally well and we will talk a bit more about that. Mining CapEx are declining as we\u2019ve been talking about in the past. Volumes are increasing. Costs are being constrained, and copper prices have risen from the lows in the face of an admittedly uncertain global market, but there has been positive movements recently.","We are continuing with our efforts to improve our balance sheet and have increasing confidence that we are going to be able to do that in effective way and after we get our balance sheet situation developed, we are going to have a \u2013 continue to have an industry-leading copper Company and we remain very positive about it\u2019s long-term fundamentals.","With the copper market itself the initial benefit came of course from monetary policies to encourage business activity in China and dovish positioned by the U.S. Fed initially created more positive environment for copper and other commodities prices, but recent data at China\u2019s internal economy has been encouraging in the power grid business automobiles, but recognized that it is a mix situation there, its construction remains subdued, but there is improved market sentiment, short positions have been closed, long positions have been taken which is just a function of the marketplace, and globally demand is improving modestly.","So what\u2019s the net of all this is been that the large anticipated surplus in the copper markets have not materialized. Companies are reducing costs as we are and we are pleased with our progress there. There has been some curtailment not as much as might be expected, but almost 800,000 tons per year today, but the pipeline of new supply projects is declining as companies are deferring projects cutting CapEx and all of this is resulting in a longer-term outlook for very positive copper price environment and therefore we focused on finding a way to structure our business to take advantage of that.","Page 5 is a slide that illustrates the thing that I've been talking about for years. Existing base production is declining over the next 10 years Wood Mackenzie predicts an 18% decline in production from just under 20 million tons a year to just over 16 million tons a year. If you take very modest outlooks for our global consumption growth they use 1.7%, you end up with a shortfall of mine supply in relation to consumption of 7 million tons.","Right now Wood Mackenzie estimates that highly probable mine developments only 2 million tons that lead 5 million tons to be made up by other projects. The top 10 mines in the world produce about that level, so that shows the extent of the shortfall in one-third of that 5 million has to be come from new projects that are not considered probable there that\u2019s over 3 million tons, that\u2019s three, yes indeed there is eight \u2013 roughly eight Morenci, so its got to be a lot of new mines developed and the selling price even in today's world for developing new mines is that prices that are probably 50% higher than the current price.","So that\u2019s what we are in the business for and we remain confident about it. So what are we doing right now that\u2019s was on everybody's mind and that\u2019s what we are focusing on. We are executing our strategy, we are going to strengthen our balance sheet, we are going to maintain a high quality portfolio of assets and we are going to position them for value creation.","We've adjusted our mine plants curtails, some high cost production, have contingency plans for taking further steps if need to be that\u2019s going well. We are completing our major projects with the Cerro Verde project that\u2019s the completion of the third of three projects that we started in 2011and all three of those is going well and will be beneficial to us in the coming years.","We financially suspended our dividend; we issued $2 million of equity in 2015. Our asset sales progress which we commented on in some detail in our fourth quarter earnings release is going very well. We are really encouraged by the nature of those discussions and now we've taken steps through restructuring our management oil and gas business, taking cost cuts to align that business with our corporate objectives of improving our balance sheet and reducing by reducing cost of approaching future investments in a different way. And so that is what we are doing and what we are all about.","In terms of cost experience in the mining business for the first quarter, you can see on Slide 7 that we\u2019ve made progress, we are down \u2013 we achieved levels at lower than our January guidance at consolidated $1.38. We\u2019re reducing that further as you\u2019ll see for 2016 as a year, particularly strong performance and Red Conger is here with his team and the Americas where we\u2019ve come in below our fourth quarter numbers and our guidance for site production and delivery cost in the Americas and we continue to have our low-cost operations in Indonesia and Africa. Volumes were good, consistent with our guidance going into the quarter. So running the fundamentals of our business is important and our guys are doing great doing it.","Asset transactions that we've announced to date includes the Morenci transaction and two smaller transactions, good values in those, Morenci scheduled to close in the second quarter, no hitches there. We recently announced a transaction involving the Serbia exploration project Timok, which we\u2019re getting both good initial values, accomplishing some strategic objectives in getting initial development going on the upper zone, while we were going to retain a significant interest in operational control of the potentially much, much larger lower zone. So that is going good.","We are advancing discussions on additional transactions, very pleased with that project. Much more confident today than we were early during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation, but what we\u2019re seeing here and we\u2019re in advanced discussions is the scarcity of quality assets in the Copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer-term positive view of the marketplace.","So we are confident that we are going to be able to achieve the goals that we set out. And beyond that we have other opportunities that are available to us that we\u2019re not currently pursuing but in which parties have stepped up and said they're very interested in those.","So while we don't have specific transactions to report today I am telling you that we internally are very optimistic, confident that we\u2019re going to be able to go forward and meet our goals in a way that\u2019s going to be positive for our Company and positive for our investors.","The reason we can do this is because this portfolio of assets, we got pictures here on Page 9 of Morenci recently expanded largest copper mine very profitable in North America very long life. Cerro Verde as we developed it have the world's largest concentrating facility and it is ramped up very well and without the kind of typical startup issues you have in terms of cost and schedule and mechanical issues going forward, it was a big project $4.6 billion, but lots of support from the local community in the Arequipa region of Peru, great team, has gone very well.","Grasberg where we continue to have discussions with the Government of Indonesia on our contract is remarkable long-term resource one of the industries historically largest copper and gold reserves and it's an asset that is very important to our portfolio, important to the Government of Indonesia, important to the province of Papua. And then Tenke Fungurume is the most successful largest mine in the copper belt region of Katanga and Zambia and operating extremely well and has a long life with very significant development opportunities associated with.","And coming back to Grasberg, we of course want to refer back to the important letter that we received on October 7, when the Mines Minister, was support of the President indicated that the government would move towards granting our contract extension on terms that were consistent with our existing COW in terms of the financial aspects of it and the enforceability of it.","The revised revisions to the regulations that were anticipated in unfortunately have not been adopted instead; the country is now working on revising its mining law and the related regulations. The government officials continue to express support for the position in the October 7 letter. We have agreed as part of that to divest incremental interest in PT-FI at fair market value up to 30%. Press reports out today about a government position referring to replacement cost and a lower valuation than the $17 billion valuation we submitted in January of this year.","The official letter from the government did not give a valuation amount. It is in the press, but it wasn\u2019t in the letter. They refer to regulations, not specifically replacement cost. I want to tell you that in all of our agreements with Government of Indonesia, we have indicated any divestment would be a fair market value that\u2019s consistent with our contract and that remains our position.","Slide 10, shows the Cerro Verde project. You can just see how well this thing is ramped up. We began first copper in September and month-by-month we've increased the throughput through our new Concentrator 2 project. In March, we hit above capacity, 373,000 tons a day. Strong performance on capital cost management startup though that was an issue for us, that was our objective a year ago to talk to you about, at this call about what we\u2019re going to do in 2015 here is an example of how we execute.","Since we did the Phelps Dodge deal nine years ago now, I\u2019ve talked, I think, on every conference call about the strength of Freeport has been in our copper resources. Very large proved and probable reserves, very large mineralized material at our existing mines that provide assurance of the opportunities to invest when the market\u2019s fit. And then potential that is huge that goes beyond that, so that\u2019s what we still have and this is what\u2019s going to allow us to deal with this balance sheet issue by raising capital through property sales or otherwise and then end up with a very substantial copper resource-based company as we go forward. That\u2019s our strategy and this is a reason why we will be able to execute it effectively.","Now, to show you \u2013 and I think those of you who follow us know we\u2019ve got a great copper business underneath all this market issues associated with oil and gas investment. The Company has a remarkable copper business. This is shown that by in 2015, when we\u2019re still investing in Cerro Verde so aggressively and we had EBITDA that matched our CapEx.","Going into 2016, as we were wrapping up Cerro Verde and copper, even lower copper prices averaging $2.17, EBITDA substantially exceeded CapEx. And as we look forward to the year 2016, at varying copper prices from here forward, first quarters in the books, but it\u2019s $2 for the rest of the year, we would have $4.6 billion of EBITDA, $2.25, it\u2019s $5.7 billion, $2.50, it\u2019s $6.8 billion, and our CapEx is only $1.8 billion as we\u2019ve completed Cerro Verde and as we're continuing to invest in Grasberg underground and managing maintenance capital in very effective way. So we got a business that is generating substantial cash flows to help us with our financial objectives.","Now in the oil and gas business, the debt level that we have of roughly $20 billion was created by the initial oil and gas investments and subsequent spending in that business on an aggressive growth profile. That was really upset by initially the fall in oil prices and then when copper prices fell that took away the ability of the copper business to support it with its own cash flows.","So that\u2019s why we are having to take these really aggressive actions now to rectify our balance sheet. We got a new organizational structure in the oil and gas business. It\u2019s now being integrated into our Freeport-McMoRan corporate structure, being run as an operating division as opposed to a standalone corporate entity that it has been done since the acquisition in 2013. This is allowing us to reduce cost. Last week, we reduced employment by roughly 25% and we are continuing to look for ways to reduce costs through looking at office facilities and other cost elements.","We are going to align the way we spend money in that business with our corporate objectives and in terms of how do we generate cash flows, how do we contribute to our balance sheet improvement activities. We are winding down significant capital spending. We have recently completed a series of tieback wells to our production facilities that\u2019s going to allow us for a period of time to maintain near-term production without additional drilling.","In the Holstein Deep area we commenced initial production just this month. Two additional wells are coming on in the second quarter. At Horn Mountain and Marlin tiebacks, we commenced production on the D-13 King well in the first quarter. Kilo\/Oscar and Quebec\/Victory tiebacks are in progress and we have four additional drilled wells at are in our inventory including Horn Mountain Deep that we are going to be able to bring on production without drilling new well that\u2019s going to allow us to maintain production for the foreseeable future.","And when you step back and look at these assets they are very attractive. We know it\u2019s started with the acquisition prior to the merger of three underutilized deepwater platforms in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Horn Mountain Holstein projects in Marlin. That's where our tieback activities are going. We also have interest in the non-operating, new producing projects at Lucius and Heidelberg and a long-term development project in the Vito area in Mississippi Canyon. This is the structure of business. We have significant production in California, but these are really good assets.","We look for potential bars for the business during the first quarter aggressively. The Board had special financial advisors. We worked with established bankers and canvas the market and because of the conditions in the marketplace with low oil prices with credit pressures on the companies from the very largest through the business with the lack of credit, we just concluded at this point that the values that might be available in sale or monetization transactions simply didn't reflect the long-term value of these assets and that's why we taken the steps to restructure our business.","We have got an operating team there that's really impressive, they are experienced, they are well recognized in the industry that got a great track record and so we are very comfortable with our ability to manage this business in an effective way and realize long-term values for our business.","Now turning to Slide 15, you can see the leverage to prices that our oil and gas business has and $35 Brent, we have $600,000 million, but at $45 its $1 billion and $1.4 at $55 these are EBITDA numbers and $1.8 at $65, we\u2019ve reduced CapEx for 2017 to $500 million, we do have some idle rig costs of about that amount that we are dealing with, but it is a business that is leveraged to all prices, no guarantees, but there's certainly opportunities for oil prices to increase. We can maintain production. We continue to monitor the marketplace and look for ways of contributing to our strategic objectives of improving our balance sheet.","We have updated our numbers for the outlook for 2016. This does reflect the closing of the Morenci transaction where we are selling an additional 13% interest in Morenci and so that's the basic adjustment for copper and other adjustments are more in the nature of this typical ongoing adjustments. I\u2019ll point out that the unit cost for copper has been dropped to a $1.05 consolidated, that\u2019s down from a $1.10 reflects some improvement in gold price by-product but also the efforts of all our teams that reduced cost before by-products.","Strong production cost of $15 a barrel, $14 a barrel for our oil business which is down a $1 operating cash flows as we talked about earlier at 4.8 to 25 copper and each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year the last nine months of 2016 is $340 million variance for us. CapEx were in line with our previous estimates.","Sales \u2013 as we look forward to 2017 we will see copper at $4.6 billion, gold sales rising as we complete mining the open-pit at Grasberg. Molybdenum sales being adjusted for the market and as I pointed out earlier oil sales being maintained at the current level of close to 160 million a day.","EBITDA variations are shown and cash flows variations are shown on Slide 18 starting with EBITDA, this includes first quarter actuals and sensitivities for the remaining nine months averaging 2016\/2017. At [$2 it\u2019s $5.6 billion, $2.25, $6.7 billion, $2.50, $7.8 billion] for EBITDA and cash flows varying over prices going from [$2, $2.50] between roughly $3.5 billion and $5 billion.","Capital expenditures are dropping Page 19 we have cut capital in half for 2016 cutting it another 50% for 2017. You can see how that splits out between our oil and gas business our major mining projects. The remaining major mining project is the Grasberg underground development and then what we\u2019ve done with maintenance capital.","I keep mentioning we are committed to improving our balance sheet we are going to get this $20 billion debt level down. We are going to do that by running our business right constraining cost and capital spending and also raising capital through asset sales. The improvement in our share price and our bond trading may give us some opportunities for capital markets transactions but for the time being really focused on these asset sales discussions that we\u2019re advancing.","We have a very manageable near-term debt maturity schedule, we have roughly $3 billion available under our $3.5 billion amended bank credit facility, have $300 million in cash virtually - no very low maturities at least in 2016 and manageable maturities in 2017. So from a corporate standpoint our near-term liquidity is very strong.","Come back to saying we\u2019re focused on execution, had a great quarter in terms of execution for \u2013 to begin the year off with. And I am very confident we\u2019ll continue that track record as we go forward into the year.","So that\u2019s quick overview and I wanted to run through it, so we can have time for your questions. And so Tony, I see you\u2019re first up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question does come from the line of Anthony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Anthony Rizzuto","Thanks very much. Hi, Richard, Kathleen, Red and Mark. It's good to see the progress thus far.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks Tony.","Anthony Rizzuto","I've got several questions here. The first one on Indonesia and I was interested in the comments about capital spending deferrals. I was wondering if you can comment about that a little bit further. And then also, the mill issue that you experienced during the quarter and you applied a temporary fix to it. Just wondered if you could just talk about that a little bit more and what you're doing there and that type of thing. And I've got a couple other questions about different areas.","Richard Adkerson","Okay, Tony. First of all we have taken steps to reduce capital. Mark Johnson\u2019s here \u2013 to reduce capital. We revised some mine plans and we are reducing capital. What we have not done yet is defer the fundamental development of our underground resources. We completed the Deep MLZ, extension of the DOZ mine. That's really a long-term extension from our initial Block Cave development beginning in the early 1980s. This is the most recent major extension on that. That was completed last year and is ramping up.","The underground development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is really beneficial to the asset, beneficial to Government of Indonesia, and of course Freeport for us to continue with that so that when the pit is completed roughly at the end of 2017, we would have that mine ready to begin ramp up. And so we\u2019ve been very reluctant, remain very reluctant to suspend that, but that is drawn into question seriously by not having the regulations amended and getting our contract extended.","We obviously are spending that money in expectation and confidence that we will get extended. And the government officials keep saying that, but have not taken the actions that are necessary to document it yet. Roughly 75% or more of the production from the underground is going to be realized after 2021 when our primary term ends, so we\u2019re currently engaged with the government and explain that to them.","We also have the issue there with the smelter that we\u2019ve agreed to develop, provided we get our contract extension and we're unable to spend substantial money on advancing this smelter project without having contract extended. So that's the big issues we face, discussions are ongoing as we speak, and our Board is considering what actions we should take. With respect to the mill issue, Mark, why don\u2019t I let you explain that briefly? ","Mark Johnson","Okay. Yes, Tony. In late January, we had a bulk sale in our 38-foot Siemens wrap-around mill. It\u2019s a gearless motor, electric motor that both failed and it\u2019s ended up shorting out of about seven of the coils, there\u2019s about 648 coils that are part of the stater. As you mentioned, we initially were able to bypass that damaged segment and we\u2019re able to run the mill fine, about 5% derated.","Since that period, we\u2019ve evaluated the longer term repair and got prepared for it and determine that we should take it down in April, which we did, just over eight days ago. We took the mill down, we\u2019ve got Siemens there to help us, some other contractors, so we\u2019re just eight days into the repair, but it\u2019s going very well.","We scheduled about 32 days of downtime for this repair, but we are pretty confident where we sit right now that that will be closer to 24, 25 days. So in addition to repairing the mill, we are going to look at some of the issues and we think we can address any of the issues that might have caused that bolt to fail in the first place. And we\u2019re also obviously taking advantage of this downtime to reduce some opportunity maintenance throughout the plant.","Richard Adkerson","All of these things are reflected in our outlook, in our cost, in our production volumes, and so forth. First time this is happening, 20 years of operation of this mill and it\u2019s happened in other places. And we\u2019re confident getting it fixed on schedule that Mark talked to you about.","Anthony Rizzuto","Thanks, both. Richard, just a follow-up on Indonesia in terms of the bigger picture with \u2013 from a standpoint of the negotiations, the discussions with the government. Is it still the biggest log jam there, is that still the refusal to this point for the government to want to discuss this extension only until two years before the original COW is due to expire?","Richard Adkerson","Well, that is the current regulation. Our legal position is that regulation doesn't apply to our contract, but so far the government has not taken steps to revise that regulation. My observation is that there is a wider recognition of that being a problem not just for Freeport, but for the mining industry in general and the anticipation by many is that that would be addressed in the revision to the mining law and the regulations.","So that is a current issue for the government officials. We thought it would have been resolved by now, it has not been and so now the government is working with the DPR to address it that way. That has an uncertain timeframe for getting done and you have to admit uncertain outcomes because of the different political views, so anyway we are continuing to work with them.","Anthony Rizzuto","Okay, Richard. And then I want to ask a question with regard to the asset sales process. I think you mentioned in your comments, you mentioned something about other opportunities and I didn't quite know what you meant by that?","Richard Adkerson","Let me address this Tony then we are going to \u2013 need let others come on and ask question.","Anthony Rizzuto","Okay, understood.","Richard Adkerson","But all I'm doing is referring back to my original comments in the first quarter \u2013 the fourth quarter year-end earnings release that to convey to the market that we\u2019re putting our highest priority in fixing our balance sheet and that we would look for opportunities involving all of our \u2013 any of our assets.","And so what we've done since then as we focused on transactions that would help us achieve our transactions in a positive way. We are going to work and I believe we will get those transactions completed, but beyond that we have other assets that are not part of our current transactions that we would turn to if we are not successful with this initial round of discussions. I am telling you I believe we will be successful with the initial rounds of discussions, but if for whatever reason we are not, we have other alternatives to turn to it.","Anthony Rizzuto","Understand Richard. Let\u2019s appreciate that and I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Well, thanks Tony and I just want to say you got appreciate that these are confidential discussions that take time and due diligence and a lot of issues go into it, but I'm feeling much better today than I did in January.","Anthony Rizzuto","Thanks Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Kurt with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Kurt","Hi, good morning.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Kurt","I had a question on Cerro Verde. I guess there's been some reports out that the water allocation issues with Rio Chile, and it seems like from your guidance that you're managing to move you through this without any sort of issue. I'm just wondering if there's any risk to that?","Richard Adkerson","Well, the reports came about because this El Nino effects have weather consequences throughout areas where we operate and there was a drought period there, the river was affected by because of the upstream downs. And so there was some allocation deals \u2013 rains I mean there has been returns of replenishing rains and we\u2019ve worked this out, we don't anticipate that being a problem at all.","Evan Kurt","Got it. Thanks. And then one question on Heidelberg. Cobalt had put something in their 10-K that I picked up on, something about the appraisal well leading to them, I can't remember the exact language, but concerns that there could be a material downgrade to plan. Is there anything that you can comment on there as far as what you're seeing out of that?","Richard Adkerson","Sure, first of all when you look at these earnings releases of different companies, they acquired their interest in different ways I mean and so their book carrying values are going to differ company to company. The geology at Heidelberg is [indiscernible] analysis is changed some of the locations of the wells are being revised.","Our team still has confidence about the resource and this will be handled and so what\u2019s you're seeing now is the effects of some of the initial development wells having to be relocated in terms of where they're being drilled to access the reservoir. Visit with the team last week and they feel confident that it's not a - is not really a detriment to the overall resource that\u2019s available there.","Evan Kurt","Okay thanks. Just maybe one final one, if I may. At the last half of the year, at the market equity raise, the stock price was actually lower than where it was trading today. I'm just wondering given the rebound in the equity if that's something that you may consider following up on.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, I made a brief reference to that, to the fact that share price is up and the trading in our bonds is really improved over the last six weeks. And so that opens up consideration for other types of capital raises for us. We currently believe that it's beneficial to us - for us to first look to asset sale transactions because we believe that we're going to be able to accomplish those in a positive way and hopefully you know and the market is going to be driven by a lot of factors, that they\u2019ll be well received by the market and that might give us opportunities in the future to do better. So that\u2019s kind of the strategy of what we are looking at.","Evan Kurt","Got it. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","And Kathleen\u2019s giving me a note just to remind everybody that the basic source for our mill water at Cerro Verde is not from the river or the dams for the expansion at least, but from this wastewater system that we put in for the city of Arequipa. And the issue that Evan raised was the downstream water was affected by this lower flow through the river and that was what led to it. But our water is coming from the wastewater system for the expansion.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Gagliano","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to drill down a bit more on the divestment plans on the mining side. First of all, in Indonesia, what are Freeport's alternatives, if for whatever reason the Indonesian government doesn't agree to Freeport's expectations regarding the fair value of that ownership interest? That's my first question.","Richard Adkerson","Let me answer that, Dave. The ultimate resolution mechanism that we have is international arbitration. That\u2019s a provision that\u2019s in our contract and based on all the legal advice that we've gotten over the years and recently, our position in an arbitration proceeding would be very strong.","And because the legal - the contract is available on file with the SEC you can read it straightforward been in place since 1991 and so we believe its ironclad. We are trying to avoid that, it\u2019s such a long-term asset, we are trying to avoid going into a legal proceeding like that but that\u2019s our ultimate fall back.","Under our contract we have no obligation to divest that was acknowledged by the government in Indonesian in the mid 1990s and a letter that we have on file and all of our discussions since then where we voluntarily offered to divest to try to be responsive to the new mining law and to the aspirations of the government has always been at fair market value.","David Gagliano","Okay. Okay. Is there - just as a follow-up to that, is there any specific deadline or time line that we should be thinking about here for this or it's an open-ended negotiation?","Richard Adkerson","It is not a specific timeline, but we are spending so much money, together with Rio Tinto we\u2019re spending about a $1 billion a year on this underground development, and we simply just can't keep doing that without bringing this issue to a head. And the government wants us to proceed with this smelter and best case for constructing a smelter based on global experience all the smelters that have been built in China is that starting all out today would require us to go to 2019 to build a new smelter and without having contract assurance beyond 2021, we simply can't do that as a practical business matter and that\u2019s the message we\u2019ve been conveying to the government.","David Gagliano","Okay. That makes sense. And then just my separate question related to the divestment plans, just regarding the comments about discussions on additional transactions, which of the mining assets specifically are actually currently being negotiated for sale or JV, et cetera, aside from Grasberg. Obviously not looking for anything other than just the assets that are currently under negotiation.","Richard Adkerson","Dave, because these discussions involve multiple parties and we have multiple alternatives to consider I just don't think it's an answer I should publicly state right now. And I know all of you want to have more details, we want to get this thing done, we have a real sense of urgency for it. I\u2019d just comment to you the processes is one that involves a great deal going into it in terms of negotiating the details of the transaction and people conducting due diligence.","These mining assets are complicated, complicated assets. We\u2019ve got great assets and lots of support to values. So all I can tell you is I feel real good about where we are. Now, I wish I could share more details, but I simply can\u2019t.","David Gagliano","Okay. I appreciate the position you're in. All right, thanks very much.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Korn","Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question as well. Question on the copper market. We had CESCO a couple weeks back. Most folks seem to come out of there with a sense that the copper industry really sees cost cutting, not curtailment of supplies, is the best path to take in the current market. I was wondering, Richard, if you believe we're going to need any more cuts in production over this next year to help support pricing given some projects ramping over the rest of the year, given Grasberg ramping up. For you, would you consider maybe fully idling any of the assets where you're currently at half rates or so?","Richard Adkerson","Well, thanks Matthew. I mean the reality of this, and I\u2019ve been through a number of these cycles and gone through this is that decisions to shutdown mines are very complicated because of the transition cost that you incur in having to do it. Not only is there an issue of the \u2013 and this varies country-by-country depending on labor laws, but the cost of employee severances, but it also often triggers reclamation obligations and shutdown obligations because the mine is an operating system.","And when you operate that system, you're able to manage a lot of environmental issues in a particular way by the way you process material. And once you shut it down then you often have to come up with new system of how to operate water flows and so forth. That\u2019s one of the things we faced at Sierrita. Those are complicated.","So the barriers to shutdown mines that you are seeing across the industry has to do with these transition costs. And sometimes those costs are economically more significant than operating losses at marginal profitability or even losses. Not clearly the lower prices go, the more pressure will be and the more shut-ins you\u2019ll have. We would have some more. But for example at our \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s not the entire mine. Its segments of the mine, which we did in Morenci in 2008, 2009 when we cutback our mill processing and cutback our mine rates and the crushing rock we put on our SXEW stacks, our lead stacks.","For example, we cutback El Abra by half, but the remaining half that we\u2019re operating at El Abra is profitable at these prices and at lower prices. So it's a dynamic situation, it will be driven by prices, but what we\u2019re seeing is people are really focused on cost.","Now, the thing that I think that we're looking at in a positive way and I\u2019ll suggest that that market looks at, is what is the price of replacing this shortfall that\u2019s looming for the copper industry. I gave you the numbers 10 years out, but that the market does not have a significant surplus balance today. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen.","There is risk in the global marketplace, but there is opportunities. And this thing could come back and even today the incentive price to develop new production and we know this because we got all these resource being studying for years, it's going to take a very high price $3, $3.30 to develop new resources from known resources.","There are not major new discoveries. The expansion projects that are available to the industry are either expensive underground projects or projects that require low grades and lots of infrastructure development, so absence just a calamity in China or the global marketplace are still in very positive that this copper business is going to be a great business to be in and Freeport is going to be a really strong leader, player in that industry.","Matthew Korn","Thanks. That actually well leads to my next question. Given your position as a leader in the industry, how \u2013 when you're looking and considering the sale of the mining assets, how important is it for you that you still maintain operating control over that asset? I'm wondering whether that has limited the opportunity set, the set of potential buyers who may not be interested if there's -- if you're really just talking about minority stakes.","Richard Adkerson","Well listen, if you just listen to what I just said you know how bad I feel about selling any of our assets. I mean we put together a great company ahead of diverse set of assets and now circumstance had led us to have to do some and we really don't want to do. So that answer your question varies asset by asset.","When we look at our business there certain of our assets and we create a lot of value for by having them managed together, regular share equipment, technology, people, resources, and that\u2019s a huge benefit for us. And so one thing we are looking at how can we do transactions that retain that ability for Freeport to create value. Other assets which we don't want to sell, but we have to look to sell would involve a transfer of ownerships.","There are certain companies in the world today, who would only do a transaction if they can be operators. You read about it everyday in the paper. So we are having to look across the Board for that and at the end of the day, we are looking for transactions that are executable at acceptable values and in ways it help us meet our financial objectives.","Matthew Korn","Got it. Thanks so much and best of luck.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you so much Matthew.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Sussman","Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question and certainly good job on costs this quarter. In terms of just \u2013 in terms of the asset sales process, I guess you've announced $1.4 billion since mid-February. Obviously in your release you noted that you expect to show additional progress. I think specifically in Q2 was what was mentioned.","I know there's a springing collateral and guaranteed trigger that was added, which basically means I think you need to total $3 billion in aggregate announcements by mid year. Assuming my math is correct, that's another $1.6 billion or so in announcements in the next couple months.","So I guess do you feel comfortable with the timeline and maybe just conceptually how would you sort of describe activity level relative to your initial expectations in terms of just parties at the table. Any big picture color would be great? Thanks guys. Bye-bye.","Richard Adkerson","All right. The answer is yes, we really expect to meet that springing collateral test in the second quarter, very confident about that. And I've tried to get across and have done my best to talk with you today knowing that I can't meet the hopes that many had that I could give you very specifics, but to tell you how much more positive I am on this call than I was on our call for the year-end earnings release.","This year started out really tough and I\u2019m not telling any of you that it really started out itself with uncertainties in the global commodity space and uncertainties about China and copper, a lot of unknowns as to how we receive. We thought internally as we talked among ourselves about how we approach the market that we would get good receptively because of the high quality of assets.","Now we know we are getting good receptivity, so we know it internally, we are confident we are going to get this done in a reasonable way and now you know we're going to be charged with executing that reporting to you the results as we go forward.","Jeremy Sussman","Richard, that extra color is very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks very much.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Thank you, Jeremy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Chris Mancini","Hi there. Just a quick question. Most of my questions were answered. In terms of cash management when you do realize the proceeds from the sales of Morenci and your JV with Reservoir, do you intend to buy back some of your higher yielding bonds at that point or are there covenants in your credit line that would require you to hold a cash balance to pay that down first?","Kathleen Quirk","Chris, this is Kathleen. We have agreed to a cash flow asset sale cash sweep to our term loan lenders, a 50% of asset sales and if our leverage is greater than six times, which we\u2019re not currently, they would get 100% of proceeds. So we'll have opportunities we believe to not only repay term loans, but also look to repay other debt in the capital structure and look at you know take care of the upcoming maturity. So that is what we're thinking at this time.","And as Richard said the debt levels, the trading levels have improved from where they were earlier in the year, which opens up other opportunities. But we\u2019re focused on absolute leverage reduction, but also given ourselves enough runway over the next several years in terms of maturity schedule.","Chris Mancini","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot and good luck with the asset sales.","Richard Adkerson","Chris, I can\u2019t tell the frustration of looking six weeks ago where our bonds were trading, where our stock was trading and not having the money to buy them.","Chris Mancini","Yes, no, I bet. For sure. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos","Thank you. I was studying slide 23, which has the oil and gas output price realization and direct cost and it looked like the margin was $7.96 per BOE times the $12.1 million, or $96 million for the quarter, if I'm reading it right. Put a different way, a $0.09 upswing in the copper price would give you as much cash flow as oil and gas has in the March quarter, admittedly probably at the bottom of the oil price, we all hope. Do you think it's worth just shutting in all the oil and gas output and preserving the resource and waiting for a better day after the market gives us $0.25 of upside on copper?","Richard Adkerson","Well you know John that\u2019s a kind of scenario analysis that in hindsight you could say maybe that would been the right answer, we can\u2019t live in that world. And the nature of oil production is such that you just cannot make decisions like that and preserve the reservoir, preserve the asset.","So it\u2019s you know I recall back in 2008 you may have been at a meeting I had one time when somebody said, why don\u2019t you just shut in all of your North American production. The market doesn\u2019t need it and it would balance the market and is not - my answer then was you know running these kinds of assets is not like managing a portfolio of stocks and bonds.","You can\u2019t just sell something and get out of it you have to manage a lot of complicated operating factors in doing it. I understand your financial analysis the practicalities of it or that we can generate some cash to help meet our obligations that we have. We\u2019re cutting these costs aggressively now. We\u2019ll continue to do that and we\u2019ll take the actions to preserve these assets and create some incremental value over time.","We are working on contingency plans now, for example, of how do we look forward in terms of drilling some of the really attractive tieback opportunities. We are not going to spend money now, but we\u2019re going to be prepared to as markets increase to help arrest the natural decline. There is a big difference in these average numbers that you talk about between California, which is a significant production, and the deepwater. The California doesn\u2019t have the decline issues that the deepwater has and we\u2019re able to basically breakeven out there and preserve all of the resource, but continue and operate it. If you were to try to shut in that California production with the nature of the way that it\u2019s produced \u2013 you are doing that.","So the oil and gas business is in tough shape. It\u2019s just in tough shape, because our plan was to have it, fund its own CapEx and there were all \u2013 besides the acquisition, I mentioned there were all these commitments made to fund an aggressive growth project that was in. The legs were cut out of that by the drop in oil prices. And now that business has committed cost and obligations that's well over its current resources, we know that because we just try to sell those resources.","So we got a profitable copper business. We got to manage this oil and gas business in a different way to reduce costs, focus on how to preserve the asset, because the offshore depletion will happen at some point in future, not in the next period of time, because the success we\u2019ve had in drilling. But it\u2019s a challenge I mean I\u2019m not going to pull any punches on it.","But we\u2019ve got a good team. I\u2019m really enjoying getting to work with these guys directly. They are doing a great job. They\u2019re well respect in the industry. I know that, because I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people outside our Company about how they run the business. And we\u2019re going to find a way to get value out of these assets.","John Tumazos","Thank you. If I can ask a simpler question, just about the accounting. Over the last six quarters the oil and gas charges have been about $22.9 billion. Is there only about $5 billion in carrying value left? And what was the 12-month average oil price for the March quarter, full cost test? Would think that at some point the balances would wind down and the charges would pretty much be de minimis.","Kathleen Quirk","John, it\u2019s Kathleen. If you look at the balance sheet, we separately identify the capitalized cost for oil and gas. And we've got \u2013 at March 31, we have roughly $3.4 billion which includes $1.7 billion that\u2019s subject to amortization which is part of this full cost ceiling test that you referenced and we\u2019ve got about just over 1.7 not subject to amortization and those are things where we don't have proved reserves both at this point.","And in terms of the 12-month trailing average that we used at March 31 for the ceiling test write-down it was $46 a barrel WTI.","John Tumazos","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Christopher Terry","Hi, guys. I'll try to be quick. You've obviously talked about asset sales and mentioned around your views on equity raisings. What's your thoughts around streaming or royalty transactions?","Richard Adkerson","We\u2019ve had a lot of discussions about that recently and over the years. I mean going back 25 years or more, we\u2019ve looked at doing that. The asset where we have the biggest streaming opportunities is Grasberg with the big gold component associated with it. Yes, that gold component is what makes Grasberg such a strong strategic asset for us and reduces our cost and that\u2019s - it is not an inexpensive place to operate. We got 30,000 plus workers there and one of the world's largest mills, what will be the world's largest underground development, complicated environmental issues to maintain complicated community issues and community support issues, logistics issues.","And so really we\u2019ve concluded and thank God we didn't succumb to that idea in past years because today that would be a bad decision, but we really believe having the goal component of Grasberg together with high copper grades what makes it such a great strategic asset for us. So we look at that, we watched what\u2019s going on in the industry, we talked to companies involved in bankers and if something makes sense we would be open to it, but today we\u2019ve concluded that it has not made sense.","Christopher Terry","Okay. Thanks very much. And just a final one. Given the importance of the second half of Grasberg and the mill issues you've highlighted, can you just remind us, what's the mill split between the open pit and the underground for 2016 and 2017?","Mark Johnson","This is Mark. Right now, the underground provides about 45,000 tons of ore out of 200,000, so the remainder is coming from the pit and that will change next year 2017 the pit starts to wind down a bit and the underground ramps up. It's more like 130 and 70. 130 from the pit and 70 from the underground.","Christopher Terry","Okay, thanks very much.","Richard Adkerson","And we vary that from time-to-time based on the nature of the material in the pit.","Mark Johnson","We are looking at the highest value material we sent to the mill, so that drives that determination.","Richard Adkerson","I visit there and went to the team and I mean its and I\u2019ve been around since the initial development of the Grasberg and to see the technology advances, so what we are able to do underground is remarkable through remote mining equipment, safety factor of that, but also the efficiency we have, we are working very well with our contractors and our team there is doing that.","So this you know \u2013 once at this point in time, we're looking at having a significant reduction in mill throughput as results are going on ground. Now we look at it and we are going to be able to keep our mill build. We have to make some \u2013 actually some enhancements over time in the mill. The resources is just grown and the economics of mining, large-scale underground mining have become much more attractive than we would've thought years past.","Christopher Terry","Thanks very much for the color.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, thanks Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Matthew Fields","Hi, everyone. I just wanted to ask, there's been \u2013 I know you're laser focused on asset sales and it seems like you're pretty confident about hitting that June 30 deadline to avoid the springing collateral, but \u2013 and I probably shouldn't ask this as a credit analyst, but what's so bad about secured debt? I mean, if I'm an equity holder I think I'd rather grant the bank security over some assets rather than giving away a chunk of future earnings.","Kathleen Quirk","Well, I think as an investment grade company, we worked hard to have a structure of flexible capital structure where everyone was secured. Our objective is Richard just talked about is to takedown leverage very significantly. We think over time, we have the ability to commence the rating agencies of the strength of our assets. And we like to return to investment grade and we also see the benefits of having non-secured capital structure.","And having said all that, we recognized the relationships we\u2019ve had with our bank group, the commitments they've had to support our business and we are going to work cooperatively to make sure that those lenders - all the lenders are protected but also just to make sure we have an ongoing continuation of bank relationships that will allow us flexibility in the near-term to navigate through this situation. But we do - we worked hard to get to a completely unsecured structure and we want to get our balance sheet back and restore the strength that we had previously and I know it\u2019s a tall order but we are very focused on taking the steps to get there.","Matthew Fields","Okay. And then I think just one more follow-up. I think earlier on the call you said that the proceeds from Morenci, you obviously have that 50% cash flow sweep but that you could look elsewhere in the capital structure. I think in the press release when you announced it you said that FCX expects to use the proceeds to repay borrowings under its bank term loan and revolving credit facility. Is that still the thinking for that $1 billion of proceeds?","Kathleen Quirk","Yes, we have \u2013 as you saw we had $500 million drawn roughly at March 31 under our bank credit facility and we've got the mandatory prepayment on the term loan and will use the balance to reduce borrowings under the revolver.","Matthew Fields","Okay. And then just sort of lastly, just real high level on this whole asset sale versus secured debt question, because I get it a lot and it's something we talk about a lot in the credit world, is obviously there's a disconnect between the way your securities are trading when we see the spot copper prices and where strategic assets trade on a sort of future basis with obviously a much higher longer term price deck. Is the tradeoff do I sell assets at this valuation versus a secured debt deal that could clear my runway for a number of years? What's the tradeoff there?","Kathleen Quirk","Just to be clear we\u2019re not doing these asset sales to avoid secured debt that was just a provision that we agree to in our bank facility. We\u2019re doing the asset sales to repay debt and restore our balance sheet strength.","So it has nothing to do with secured versus unsecured it\u2019s simply is the reality of us needing to accelerate our debt reduction and that's what we\u2019re focused on and we are looking for ways to do it in a way that reflects long-term values in these assets not the kind of spot pricing that\u2019s currently reflected in the market but long-term values for these assets as you saw with the Morenci transaction while we were able to demonstrate a very significant value and its reflective of that long-term asset of the resource there and that the price view of other participants in the industry not to use a spot pricing but a longer-term view of prices.","Matthew Fields","Okay Thanks for the [indiscernible]. Just one last, real quick. Is the priority overall debt reduction over sort of just clearing the deck for the next four, five years of maturities?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, Matthew let me just make a broader comment. Our company is over leveraged, I mean in the nature of the business that we are in where you have such high operating leverage from commodity prices, you just should not be this leveraged, because when conditions unfold as they do from time-to-time and your revenues drop because of what's going on the global commodity prices having this kind of debt is a killer and unfortunately we\u2019re in a position that were in.","So from a broader perspective we got great assets, we need to get back to where we have a balance sheet that is does not put us in a overleveraged situation. And that's what we\u2019re about fixing that. So unfortunately we got here and now we\u2019ve got to fix it. So all the other issues about managing maturity levels in doing that is part of the tactics of how do you do that. But at the end of the day we have good assets, we have great resources, we can create a good company, we have to give up some of those to get us to a position of we\u2019re not overleveraged.","Matthew Fields","All right. Thanks very much for the perspective.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line Justine Fisher with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Justine Fisher","Thanks. I'll make it quick since it's been a long time. Just on - Kathleen, on the working capital comments in press release, you said that based on certain price assumptions the Company expects $4.8 billion of operating cash flow this year, including $800 million from working capital and other tax payments.","My question is how sensitive is that $800 million to pricing, i.e., if we have a different price deck than you guys, could we assume that most of that $800 million might still materialize? Because that number was a much larger gain that what we had expected. I just want to know how much certainty we could have around that number if our price deck is different.","Kathleen Quirk","Yes, it wasn\u2019t materially different, Justine, at $2 copper, we\u2019re getting and we\u2019ve received some already, but we\u2019re getting some refunds, tax refunds in 2016 related to payments made in previous years. And then also with our international business the timing of when we pay taxes based on the prior year has an impact on it. But we did going into the year expect a working capital source and it\u2019s somewhat price-sensitive but not significantly price-sensitive.","Justine Fisher","All right. Fabulous. Thanks very much.","End of Q&A","Operator","We will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard Adkerson","Once again thanks everybody for your interest in our Company and participating in the call. And we look forward to our next opportunity we have to get together.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Quirk","Thank you. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call.","We have several slides to supplement our comments this morning, and we\u2019ll be referring to the slides during the call. The slides are also accessible on the webcast link at fcx.com. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments today, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; we also have several of our senior operating executives here today, Mark Johnson, Red Conger, and Dave Thornton.","I'll start by briefly summarizing our quarterly financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be going through the materials on our website. As usual, we'll open the call for questions, following our prepared remarks.","Today, FCX reported second quarter 2012 net income attributable to common stock of $710 million or $0.74 per share compared with $1.4 billion or $1.43 per share for the second quarter of 2011. Our second quarter 2012 results included charges for adjustments to environmental obligations and related litigation reserves, which affected net income by $53 million or $0.06 per share.","Our second quarter 2012 consolidated sales of 927 million pounds of copper and 266,000 ounces of gold were higher than the April 2012 estimates of 895 million pounds of copper and 235,000 ounces of gold. This primarily reflected how our copper volumes in North America and how our gold sales volumes in Indonesia, which were principally timing related.","Our second quarter 2012 consolidated sales as anticipated were lower than the second quarter of 2011 sales of 1 billion pounds of copper, and 356,000 ounces of gold, primarily reflecting lower ore grades and production rates in Indonesia. The lower copper sales volumes also reflected lower ore grades in South America partly offset by increased production in North America and Africa.","The operations in productivity at PT Freeport Indonesia have continued to improve following the first quarter 2012 work interruption, the milling rates in the second quarter of 2012, our average just under 180,000 metric tons of ore per day, that compared with the first quarter average of 115,000 metric tons of ore per day.","The mining operations in the Grasberg open pit are approaching normal levels and the undergoing mining operations at the Deep Ore Zone or DOZ underground mines continue to be ramped up, and we expect to reach 80,000 tons per day in the fourth quarter. Mining rates at DOZ average 45,000 metric tons of ore per day in the second quarter.","Our molybdenum sales during the second quarter totaled 20 million pounds, and that was in line with our April 2000 estimate and the year ago period. Our realized copper price of $3.53 per pound in the second quarter compared with the realized price of $4.22 in the year ago period.","We realized just under $1600 per ounce of gold in the second quarter that compared to just over $1500 per ounce in the second quarter 2011. Our realized molybdenum price was $15.44 per pound in the second quarter of 2012 compared with just over $18 per pound in the year ago period.","As anticipated, our consolidated average unit net cash cost of $1.49 per pound in the second quarter were higher than the unit net cash cost of $0.93 in the second quarter of 2011, primarily because of lower volumes in Indonesia, and higher mining rates in North America, and lower byproduct credit.","We generated operating cash flows of $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2012, which exceeded our capital expenditures, which totaled $840 million during the second quarter. We ended the quarter at June 30, with more cash than debt. Our consolidated cash at the end of the period approximated $4.5 billion, and our total debt approximated $3.5 billion.","In May 2012, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $31.25 per share, and that followed the February 2012 authorization by our Board of Directors increase the annual dividend rate to $1.25 per share. We have about $949 million common shares outstanding.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who\u2019ll be covering the materials in our slide presentation.","Richard C. Adkerson","Good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased again to be able to report a solid operating performance by our organization and as Kathleen indicated, the financial performance was in line with our plans. Some important things happened during this quarter. We made further progress by improving productivity at Grasberg; it was about this time last year that we began to see the issues with our PTFI union that led to the strike in the second half of the year. And our relationships with our workforce has improved significantly, and we're taking some steps to help build positive relationship there in terms of being responsive to some of the aspirations of the workers.","Outside of Grasberg, we had some important developments. As you know, our strategy is focused on our significant resources of copper, and we have a number of brownfield development projects, which we\u2019re currently engaged in, which we\u2019re focused on for the future.","At Tenke, we have achieved our first copper, we\u2019ll be completing this expansion project by the end of the year, this is the first expansion at Tenke following the initial development of the mine in 2009.","We\u2019ve initiated construction of Morenci our flagship mine in North America, Red Conger\u2019s group there is really focused on taking advantage of the resources we\u2019ve been able to identify through our exploration and drilling. And this is the first project, but not the last, and we\u2019re really excited about that.","At Cerro Verde, where we are developing that mine to be the world's largest concentrated milling operation, we are progressing with the planning and permitting, we have some important steps to accomplish with the government, government intrude on a non-controversial supported basis. And so we\u2019re looking to move forward with construction there.","At our molybdenum operations, Dave Thornton is here, the Climax mine restart, we completed construction, we produced our first commercial molybdenum there. We\u2019re ramping that up, ramping that up in a way to take advantage of the resource and be responsive to the market needs for molybdenum.","We paid our dividend, increased dividend of $1.25 per share annually. We have a very strong balance sheet, which is good to have in this world with cash exceeding debt by $1 billion. The financial highlights, that Kathleen reviewed on page 4, as I said, it was a quarter in which we basically met our plan. There is always ups and downs in that, but we basically met slightly exceeded our production volume guidance and cost, we\u2019re inline with expectations.","Page 5, shows what our cost structure was; consolidated unit net cost, net of byproduct credits were $1.49, that reflects unusually high cost and characteristically high cost out of Indonesia because of the grades and you will see that as we look at our volume productions going forward with typical grades, typical production volumes at Grasberg, Indonesia those costs will come down significantly.","Obviously even these levels at a $1.49 consolidated with copper today being in the 350 range and shows just what a high margin business we have. And you can see our production is divided among the North America, South America, Indonesia and the growing African production.","Today copper markets certainly reflect the global economy and despite that inventories have dropped globally, and in many places even in Europe with weak economic demand, copper markets remain relatively tight. And with all of the negative comments about the world\u2019s economic situation to have copper at $3.50, I think is notable. And the outlook for copper we believe is very positive supported by the continuing challenges of the industry in terms of supply, mine disruptions, falling grades of existing mines, delays in constructing new mines really a very supportive of the marketplaces, you\u2019ve heard us talk about for a long periods of time.","China remains the important demand driver and China\u2019s economy has slowed, it\u2019s still growing at a substantial rate and the base of that growth is larger as it reflects the significant growth that is occurred over the last 10 years. China has expressed commitment to support its economy through fiscal policy and also through infrastructure spending, which is obviously very key to copper and our commodity there.","In the U.S our market has been supported by the automobile industry, which is now returning to pre-2008 financial crisis levels. Housing has picked up as you can see, read about in the news and that\u2019s provided markets for copper. Overall in the U.S, copper demand is stronger than the overall performance of the U.S economy, and it certainly reflects the weakness in the economy of the U.S. but their pockets that are making the business stronger than the overall economy.","Europe of course is weak, but these global inventories even in the phase of the global weakness in economy, inventories are low historically and it had been dropping and is \u2013 I\u2019ll mention again, this is the business that is supported by supply. And even though we\u2019ve had, a long periods of time with very high copper prices, high in relation to historical levels. The industry has not responded as we did in the past. The supplies just have been slow to develop and lower than expectations and that is very supportive of the market, and we think that will be supportive in the long run.","Now that\u2019s what leaves us to our strategy. Our strategy is not built on acquisitions. It\u2019s not built on major new greenfield development projects. We have the benefit as a result of the transaction we did five years ago by combining FCX with Grasberg and [self storage] operations of having a series of geographically diverse assets, which have very large reserves and we\u2019ve added significant reserves and very large resources beyond reserves, which we are continuing to qualify as reserves and develop new project. These are greenfield projects; they have a lot lower level of challenge and accomplishments, and execution, a lot less risk and a lot of certainty and the ability to perform them and to manage them in times of varying price levels. So we are \u2013 I couldn\u2019t be more pleased about what we\u2019re doing and where we stand with our set of assets.","We\u2019ll start with Climax. Molybdenum prices have weakened slightly, but the market outlook longer run was good. We are the world\u2019s largest lowest costs molybdenum producer. We\u2019re very active in the high value chemical sector of that marketplace. With our Henderson mine, and now our Climax mine being primary, molybdenum mines, the byproducts that we get out of our copper mines, it\u2019s a great business.","The Climax mine is the world's most attractive new mine development opportunity. And we have completed the construction of that mine, we're ramping it up. We had our first shipment of moly in the second quarter. The current capacity, which we expect to reach in 2013 depending on market conditions is 20 million pounds a year, the resource would allow us to go to 30 million pounds a year, and with the combination of Henderson and Climax, we\u2019re going to be in a position to flex production to meet market demands, the markets strong will be producing all out, if it's weak, we have the ability without restoring our cost structure to adjust production.","Then when we turn to the copper business, you follow this as we have returned our existing mines to their levels of production prior to the 2008, 2009 financial crisis. We deferred some projects that have been restarted; all of those have gone well.","Now looking forward, we have near-term expansion projects. We have longer-term expansion projects, but the near-term major projects that we have, as I mentioned are the Cerro Verde expansion, the mill expansion, and mine expansion at Morenci, and the Tenke 14000 K expansion. Together these projects, which we can see completing in the next three, four years or so, will add about a 1 billion pounds of incremental copper at $6 billion of capital which is attractive in today\u2019s world.","And beyond that, for example at Morenci, we have this current expansion underway that we expect to add 225 million pounds of copper annually. We have sulfide resources that will give us the chance to execute potential plans, which we are now engaged in studying to have significantly additional incremental production out of Morenci here in North America.","The expansion at Cerro Verde is going very well. There has been lot of issues with communities for expansion in Peru. We found a way of having a really good relationship with the adjacent community and the government and the communities are supportive of us there. Always some \u2013 this hasn\u2019t commenced, but basically the way we are approaching this is the way that we get support for.","Beyond that, we have a significant resource in Chile at our El Abra mine, which gives us an opportunity and I will say, at this point it's an opportunity to have a major expansion. At Tenke, where we began construction on our project in early 2008, completed 15 months later, we\u2019re operating effectively, the logistic system is working, production is going in a reasonable way. We are in a area, the Congo that\u2019s far away from the difficulties in the eastern part of the country and we\u2019ve had peace in our area. We are now engaged in our expansion project and it is going very well and beyond that we have a very significant resource of mixed ores, sulfide ores that we\u2019re studying that we believe will allow us to openly develop this to a world class mine.","And at Grasberg, we are actively engaged in developing our underground resources. Kathleen mentioned that the DOZ mine is in the process of returning to its established capacity where we were operating before the labor issues occurred and then beyond that we are advancing work on the development of the block-cave underground reserves that we have underneath the pit. We\u2019re now with inside of the completion of mining in the pit, which will occur in 2016, 2017 timeframe. and at that point, we will have the infrastructure, mine development to begin mining underground and continue the Grasberg for many years forward as a high-volume, low-cost profitable operation.","The details of the Morenci mill expansion represented on page 11, is expanding our mill to 115,000 tons per day, increasing the mining rate, attractive capital cost, significant new production. and this gives the detail permits are going well, we don\u2019t see foresee any permitting issues, and we\u2019re progressing engineering and long-lead time items. we expect to have this expansion project at full rates in 2014 as reflected in our numbers. You can see some of the details to just about how significant this property has been and continues to be, and we are excited \u2013 we\u2019re really excited about a much larger expansion down the road for Morenci. Cerro Verde, at the time we acquired Phelps Dodge, we were just getting to operate the last expansion, which brought capacity to 120,000 tons per day to the mill.","Now, we\u2019re talking about tripling that for 360,000 tons per day at significantly higher mining rate, $4 billion of capital, but this is building at a site that\u2019s established with footprint there, water and power issues, we believe we have been identified. this is a proven technology, proven approach to development. We came up with a water supply that benefits Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru by developing that community a much, much needed wastewater treatment facility, which community is very exited about. And that facility will give us the water source that we\u2019re not directly competing with agriculture interest. We filed our environmental impact statement, the government has recently improved our fiscal stability agreement, which will kick in 2014, we\u2019re going to start construction next year and expect to complete it by 2016.","At Tenke, this is a project that we had a lot of conversation about in the past, and it\u2019s really a gratifying to see just how well that operation is going. We have today, including construction workers about 85,000 workers in Katanga at our project. Of those more than 85% are Congo lease, our contractors are working with this in a much more effective way and we did own our initial project. The initial project has operated itself above design capacity, we\u2019ll be significantly increasing our mining rate there, we\u2019ll increase productions significantly, construction as I said is going well, and is targeted to be completed in 2013. We continue to advance exploration and metallurgical analysis to determine where we\u2019re going for that and remain very excited about it.","The Grasberg block cave and the extension of the DOZ mines, what we call the DMLZ mine underground development has been restarted, advanced following our labor issues. Significant development has been done. We are working with all four systems, and the block cave shaft development. It\u2019s a significant development cost. Our share of development expenditures are expected to average $550 million over the next five years, Rio Tinto will have the funding, an addition amount. We have been operating with block caving operations at Grasberg, and I don\u2019t think many people focus on this, just because of how big and exciting the pit has been, but our team has been block caving at Grasberg since early 1980s. And we have continual development of new mines at lower elevations and it\u2019s been a very successful part of our operation. It\u2019s an extension with the Grasberg block cave of the same ore body we\u2019ve been mining, and we\u2019re very confident about our ability to operate that at levels where we\u2019ll have mill rates well above 2,000 tons per day, which we make it in all likelihood the largest underground mining operation in the world.","With respect to Indonesia, as I said, we\u2019ve advanced productivity during the second quarter. Still some issues to deal with, we\u2019ve had some contractor issues recently, and those will be ongoing. Our team is working cooperatively to try to address these or to address them, and it will be something that we\u2019ll be focused on from here on out and we are focused on quality of life improvements for our workers being involved in dialog with them, and with the government authorities to make sure that we have a harmonious workplace.","As we speak today, our open-pit mining is approaching normal levels. We\u2019re ramping up the DOZ. By year-end, we believe we will be back to normal capacity there. We\u2019ve had some \u2013 we\u2019ve had to do some panels that were affected by work stoppages and so forth that we are doing there.","We are engaged in discussions with the government of Indonesia, which is conducting reviews with contract of work including ours. We\u2019re talking with them about a contract extension. Our existing contract provides for extension from 2021 to 2041, and those discussions are in place. So, there\u2019s going to be limited amounts of what we can say on today\u2019s call about specifics related to that.","I can tell you that the discussions are on a cooperative basis. We are committed to working with the government as we have for years in a way that\u2019s responsive to the government aspirations, at the same time, we\u2019re representing our shareholders. And I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll find a way of coming forward with the completion of this review and extension of our contract in a way that we will be well received both by the government and people of Indonesia and by our shareholders.","Now, the exciting thing about our company is growth. If you look on page 16, you\u2019ll see what copper production in the Americas with our mines in North America and South America is planned on. And these are projects that we are now actively engaged and have confidence that we can execute. We\u2019re again very sensitive with that, managing cost escalation, making sure we get good rates return on it, and that we\u2019re managing the risk of development.","But we see, now that we could reach 3.5 billion pounds of copper out of Americas by 2016. That\u2019s been the ballpark of our existing company today, excluding Indonesia and excluding Africa. So it\u2019s a great success story particularly in North America where you don't have to go back for many years when they were talking about the Southwest copper region being dead in the water, and that these assets that we\u2019re making so much money at of and getting such growth of assets were low grade, low quality assets. These are very profitable, we\u2019re really excited about it and thinking the world that we foresee in the future, they\u2019re going to continue to be growing, continue to be profitable for our company.","And then in Africa, when we first began to look at the Tenke opportunity in 2007, we could see a resource that have never been developed, had not being fully understood, we still don\u2019t fully understand it, we still got a lot of work to do with exploration and metallurgical analysis. But one, which in today's world is extremely attractive, provided we can manage all the challenges of doing business in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We\u2019ve made great progress there. We had a recent review with the governor of the province and I could not have been more positive about Tenke Fungurume been an example for mining success in the country.","The mines Minister spoke recently about it. We feel very good about the relationships we\u2019ve established with the government. And as a government that faces major challenges because of the economy of the country and the social unrest, but we can be a major contributed to that, very supportive of the government, employment, community development, health, education, all the things that mining can do for a community, and we're doing it, and we\u2019re proud of it.","So page 18, just gives a global map, shows where our major operations are. Jim Bob said on one call at one time \u2013 one of those Jim Bob comments that I\u2019ll always remember and refer to is small amounts get smaller and big amounts get bigger. Well, we have now five mines that we are operating, expanding and so forth that can be ranked in the millions. They have the potential. We are not there yet, in all cases to be producing 1 billion pounds of copper a year.","Grasberg is there, Morenci and Cerro Verde are in development. El Abra and Tenke have the potential to get there. And there just haven\u2019t been that many mines in the history of the world or currently today that have that kind of opportunity, and gives us a portfolio with geographic diversity, and the ability to have significant production.","We spending money on exploration as part of our heritage and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Our budget this year is $275 million, over half of it\u2019s in the Americas, principally focused in major part on brownfield exploration. So that we can take advantage of these reserves and resources that we have available. We\u2019ve added since the Phelps Dodge deal, 46 billion pounds of new reserves in the last five years of copper, 46 billion pounds and we see the ongoing capability of adding to our reserves.","Now 2012 outlook; this is very consistent with what we gave you last quarter. We\u2019ve made some adjustments principally from a \u2013 slight adjustment at Grasberg, because we made a decision to pull out of the bottom of the pit in the second half of the year, that always still going to be there. You can see in the supplemental slides that we\u2019ll have a plan of taking Grasberg\u2019s down to it\u2019s ultimate pit limits over the next five years and getting into very high grades as we go forward.","Unit cost, we\u2019ve got some benefits from lower energy costs in certain cases. Unit costs are affected by the volumes, but they remain under control in today\u2019s world. At $3.50 copper we will see operating cash flows of $4 billion this year, it\u2019s net of some working capital changes, an CapEx in that same category. So that\u2019s our outlook.","Now looking on page 21, you can see how that outlook for 2012 as we look forward will be much better, but those volumes will be increasing. You see for copper that 3.6 grows to 4.3, 4.5 to 5 within site in 2016 or so. This is a low gold here at Grasberg because of who we are at the \u2013 in terms of our mine sequencing and gold volumes return to more normal levels as we look forward to 2013 and 2014.","All of that translates depending on copper prices, gold prices and molybdenum prices, all that translates into higher levels of operating cash flows than we see in outlook for this year and we have a bright future.","With respect to this year, on slide 22, you see that volumes will be down because of mine sequencing, some in the third quarter returning to higher levels in the fourth quarter.","And on page 23, that would result in consolidated cash \u2013 consolidated net unit cost of roughly the levels we had in the second quarter, and you can see sales by region. With respect to the net unit cash cost in sort of historically where we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve prepared this slide on page 24 to show the impact of what Grasberg would be is that we\u2019re more at its traditional or characteristic volume levels, and that has an impact of about $0.30 this year and so with more normal Grasberg our cash cost would be substantially lowered to $1.16.","Our EBITDA and cash flow models are shown on page 25. EBITDA between $3 and $4, $7 billion to $11 billion cash flows or $5 billion to over $8 billion, this is based on average 2013, 2014 production levels, and it\u2019s also based on $1,200 gold and $12 molybdenum. And sensitivities are presented on page 26, and it shows just how leveraged we are, corporate prices instinct translates into $218 million of variations in cash flows.","Our capital expenditures reflect some timing adjustments basically $300 million has been pushed from 2012 to 2013. It covers the projects that we\u2019ve talked about, and then our financial policy remains focused on strong balance sheet, investing in attractive growth projects in a disciplined way, returning cash to shareholders and that\u2019s been our philosophy for a long time.","So as we \u2013 close out my comments and open the lines for questions.","We had a couple of investor conferences this quarter, and heard a lot about the concerns of investors about the near-term economic outlook situation in Europe, slowing growth in U.S., concerns about China. And then, when I look at our business and our assets, we had a great visit with Red\u2019s operating group here recently, you can just see the excitement of what our people feel about the opportunities that we have.","We feel like the future for our commodities is very bright, because of the world\u2019s need form and growing needs in different places, the challenges the industry faces in developing, new projects, and new resources, and then seeing what we already have in our company. And with the technical expertise, the morale of our people, we couldn't be more excited about where we\u2019re placed right now.","So with that, we\u2019ll open up the lines and respond to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of David Gagliano with Barclays.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just have two quick ones, on the contract extension discussions, are there any particular milestones or dates that we should be looking in terms of either deadlines or potential resolutions? That's my first question.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, Dave, it\u2019s a process that we just can\u2019t. We can\u2019t identify those things, we\u2019ve been thorough things like this in the past, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s set with a specific regulatory timeframe. Both government representatives that we\u2019re speaking with and our team really wants to get this done as quickly as possible. And then, we\u2019re certainly going to be responsive as we can. We hope that the government can meet it\u2019s targets of completing these reviews by the end of 2013, and we\u2019re going to continue to work to do that in advance of it. So but, it\u2019s not something that has any sort of set timeframe that we can say, here is the milestone.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, all right. Fair enough. Just switching gears, you mentioned in the prepared remarks the strategies not built on acquisitions. My question is, are acquisitions essentially off the table or if not, where does that sit in the packing orders internal project development versus returning cash to shareholders versus acquisitions?","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, it\u2019s certainly not off the table. We are always looking at opportunities; we\u2019re monitoring internally opportunities in the resource business around the world. Our friendly investment bankers are constantly knocking on our doors, suggesting thing to us. We\u2019re thinking ourselves about what we might do in talking about things with our Board. So it\u2019s not off the table by any means, and we have \u2013 we\u2019re fortunate that we are not pushed to do anything. We have the ability to grow and return cash to shareholders, if something doesn\u2019t work out, but if an opportunity came to us that was attractive we have the financial wherewithal, the capabilities to take an advantage of it.","So I want to be clear about that. We have a good strategy; if an opportunity came to us we can take advantage of it. If the opportunities don\u2019t work out we have got a great future without them.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Okay fair enough, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. And Richard if I look at last two years inflation and the cost excluding the byproduct credits, it\u2019s running about 20% average, I was just wondering, how should we think about it over the next couple of years, you think that kind of inflation rate will remain in the cost side?","Richard C. Adkerson","","Well Sal, let me just say one thing that I think is really important in looking at those inflation rate, a lot of our significant elements in our costs are correlated to copper prices. So when energy cost or when steel cost or certain other input cost increase, it\u2019s in a world where the scenario is the copper prices were increasing and we are able to maintain or increase our margins, because when you look at those other cost elements, it\u2019s hard to picture a commodity that\u2019s better situated from a price standpoint than copper, because of the supply challenge.","So we fight costs, we try to take advantage of whom we can reduce them. Our guys, when we have our meetings, the first thing we talk about is safety. The second thing is production volume. The third thing is cost. And even though we\u2019ve the straight margins, we all recognize we\u2019re in a commodity business and we\u2019ve got to do what we can to reduce costs. We worked very closely with our suppliers. And can\u2019t say enough about how supportive our major suppliers are to our business. We\u2019re big customers of theirs; we\u2019re at the cutting-edge of operations and development activities. So, it\u2019s in their interest and we all work together to find out ways of extending to our lives, and getting the right trucks fleet in place.","We\u2019re doing a major test right now with the Caterpillar\u2019s large trucks, and they\u2019re putting money into that, we\u2019re putting money into it, and we believe at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to come out with a lower cost alternative for our big truck fleet, which is going to be very helpful to us as we ramp up these mine rates and mines take advantage of the resources.","So, it\u2019s something that we fight every day. And we are \u2013 when we look at our outlooks here, we\u2019re not projecting significant inflation. Labor rates are increasing through around the world, but if that inflation hits certain of our costs, it will we be in an environment with a much higher copper prices.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen.","Richard C. Adkerson","Hi, Brian.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is on CapEx, you touched on a little bit that seems like the reduction this year is related to timing. I guess the bigger question I\u2019ve got is, when we look at your CapEx spends going forward, you\u2019re running at close to this $4 billion above level. In a scenario where \u2013 let\u2019s say copper prices due correct, so I guess significantly, what\u2019s the ability to try to lower that CapEx spend, are there leverage that can be pulled?","Richard C. Adkerson","Brian, I say this with a smile, but when you say correction, you mean it goes down right?","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Yes, sir, yes.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, that was right at the forefront of our mind five years ago. Obviously, we had a lot of debt at that point and we were taking of \u2013 working with our new team, how we would manage that. I think we had a great track record in 2008, 2009 for what we can do. And when you look at our set of assets, our set of assets, we have an ability to do that in a way I think that\u2019s better than many others in the industry.","We were able to adjust operations at Morenci and drive our cost down dramatically. We can defer some of these projects, if we have to without loosing them. And there is always some inefficiency of starting and restarting, but we did that at Climax. We were going out at Climax and we deferred it, and came back and completed it when the financial situation was improved.","So, and when we did that we always did it in a way, so that, one, we wouldn\u2019t loose assets or we wouldn\u2019t loose opportunities to grow, because we believe the longer-term view even if we do face a downward correction will ultimately be positive. So we have plans of doing that, our project economics are not built around having to have $3.50 copper. And so we can take that into account, but as we\u2019ve shown, if we have to, we have a business it can be adjusted to take into account some period of lower prices.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay. And then my second question is a clarification on Grasberg, I remember last quarter in early April you were running at close to 200,000 ton per day rate and at average 180, was there anything notable that happened in May or June?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yes.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","That changed that?","Richard C. Adkerson","In June we had a nine day scheduled maintenance for realigning SAG mill. And we made our targets, we were targeting 180, and we may have met our plan. As we look forward into the third quarter, we\u2019re looking at 200, a little bit better than that. So we anticipate normal operations in what you\u2019re seeing. In the second quarter numbers, it was a scheduled nine day maintenance to realign one of our big SAG mills.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","All right, good morning everyone.","Richard C. Adkerson","Hi, Oscar.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Richard, about two thirds of your Brownfield expansions which are very, very competitive compared to the rest of the industry. BHP and Exacta have had a tough time managing the social unrest, and I just wonder if you mentioned in your comments that the government and the locals are very supportive, but there are still some signs of opposition, could you just provide us more color on that?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. Well, first of all we did some ground work early on, we came in, and this is where our experience in Indonesia has proved useful, I think in creating the team we have here now, with organization we have, because we had to learn how to work with the government, government that changes rule for the local community of indigenous people and the surrounding community and we knew that it took investments and resources and people involved with it, so even before we started our expansion, we were working more aggressively with the people of Arequipa.","We committed to build a water system for them and that's a big issue for them, when I talked with President Humala and his background and his aspirations, he talked about very basic things of infrastructure for people, water, energy, education and so we focused on that before we started talking about expansion and then as we were talking about the expansion we benefited by the fact that, we had a footprint, we weren\u2019t building a new mine in a new location, and the footprint was very conducive to what we are trying to do.","And then we started, we worked through the power situation and we were able to find sources of that. Then when it came to water, we looked at a number of different alternatives about what we might do including building new dams and things like that and then hats off to Red and this team, they came up with this idea saying, let's do this wastewater project for Arequipa, the second-largest city in Peru and a city by the way that traditionally has had a pretty radical political ban in terms of the country.","But that wastewater system is a big addition for that city and the Mayor of Arequipa, who was a early supporter of Humala, got into it, see the benefits to the community, we\u2019ll find ourselves as many other miners do, putting head on to agriculture interest for competition for water, there is always some of that, but at the same time, it\u2019s a way that gave us a way forward to do something on the co-operative basis. And it reflects a lot of hard work and focus on what works for the community as well as what works for us.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s great. And if I may, just a quick clarification on your reconciliation of unit cash costs on slide 24. You talked about $0.31 decrease when Grasberg volumes returned to normal. What metal prices are you assuming for gold and molybdenum that\u2019s part of that as well?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Oscar, it\u2019s Kathleen. That reconciliation just says, what would be a 2012 average cash cost on a consolidated basis. If we were to roll in the estimated production both copper and gold from Grasberg in 2013 and \u201914. And so it assumes the same $1,600 gold that we are using in the second half of this year. And this rolls through what those volumes are, and we expect Grasberg, unit net cash cost to look a lot like they did historically before this year in the outlook. And so on a consolidated basis, that has the effect of dropping our consolidated cash costs by 30 plus cents.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Garchitorena with Credit Suisse.","Richard Garchitorena \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks, good morning.","Richard C. Adkerson","Good morning Richard.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Good morning.","Richard Garchitorena \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Yeah, so my question is on Tenke, and it looks like the current expansion is progressing on target and on budget. My question is, when should we expect some additional commentary on the next phase, are you \u2013 so working towards completing Phase II first before you look at Phase III and beyond?","Unidentified Company Representative","No, no Richard not at all. I mean we have a master plan of what we can see. We can see another expansion, think about whether that's one step of two step, that still focuses on the oxide ore, and that's what we're processing now. So we're looking already at additional tank house capacity as we complete Phase II. And then, we have a team that go from our wells exploration team, what they\u2019re drilling to doing metallurgical work and different processing alternatives for this what appears to be a very, very large sulfide mixed ore.","That information changes continually as we go through things. I can tell you the information has become more positive recently, but we will be reporting to you as those plans go forward. The first thing we have to do is get the first expansion done and prove that we could operate in reasonable way. Logistically, operationally, administratively, and we've done that. So we're comfortable going with the second expansion, its going very well, but as we do that we\u2019re studying for the future.","Richard Garchitorena \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Okay, great. And then my, just one follow-up. Announced for Grasberg that, you didn't change your volume expectations for 2013 to 2016 despite the fact that you are \u2013 you lowered 2012s. Does that mean, is the higher grade ores to be \u2013 is that going to be past 2016 or just being concerned at this point in terms of when you will access that?","Richard C. Adkerson","","No, we will get back to that higher grade ore, most of what you see is just rounding differences but I would suggest, spend some time looking at our supplemental slides, and look at that outlook and I think you can get a good understanding about what we\u2019re doing here and...","Kathleen L. Quirk","But in general, the five year plan at Grasberg and PT-FI is substantially the same as the previous plan.","Richard Garchitorena \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Dahlman Rose.","Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co. LLC","","Thanks very much. Hi, Richard, Kathleen, Jim, Bob. I\u2019ve got two questions, Richard I thought the color on Cerro Verde was excellent and how you have positioned yourself with building the relationship that was excellent. I wasn\u2019t \u2013 and I wonder on the same lines, you mentioned about taking further steps at Grasberg to be more responsive to the workers there. And I am just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of those steps that you guys are taking?","Richard C. Adkerson","","Well, first of all we had a union merge in a way that was different than we ever had. They had a leadership and so forth. We\u2019ve been there since the early 70s, we\u2019ve had very, very few \u2013 very limited worker issues and they were in short duration. So we\u2019ve now set up processes to more formally deal with the union leadership, to involve them in situations were there may be some disruptions in the work place. We are really focused now on dealing with some shortcomings that we identify with things like food quality, housing, recreational opportunities, like many places around the world. We did this in Congo. By the way, we sponsored the local Katanga soccer team and that just, I mean it\u2019s amazing, our workers get by big TV, they all wear the jerseys. Well we\u2019re sponsoring a soccer team in Papua now and it\u2019s been received very positively. So it\u2019s just the world changes, in Indonesia, the country where social networking is amazingly well established.","And then so we\u2019re having the change with that. And we made investments over time in facilities, and quality-of-life issues and we got to make some more and listen and do things in a way that is responsive to where we are. You\u2019ve been there Tony. Everybody knows it\u2019s the challenging place to do business because of the geography and weather, and the remoteness, and so we have to deal with those.","Our workforce is changing. It\u2019s increasingly being populated by Papuans, that\u2019s something that begin in 1996 and as our futures are creasing in. And so culturally there are some issues we have to deal with as well. So, it is more of a question of adjusting to new circumstances and that\u2019s just the world and it\u2019s going to be the world there as we go forward.","Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co. LLC","It\u2019s a great insight. I just have one follow-up on Cerro Verde, and on all the progress there, can you update us on the status of the environmental impact assessment? And are you getting any indications when that \u2013 of the next key point on the timeline there?","Richard C. Adkerson","","Tony, I want Red to respond.","Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Red Conger","","Yeah, Tony, that\u2019s progressing well. We've done all the community input; we\u2019re now responding to the input that we've received. We anticipate having those permits, it\u2019s all in place early next year and commence construction to maintain that schedule that we showed you in the packet.","Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Dahlman Rose & Co. LLC","Excellent, good stuff. Thanks a lot Red and Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks Tony.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos.","John Charles Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Thank you very much. In terms of the capital spending profile going out multiple years, you have completed this phase the Tenke and you\u2019re completing the mill next year at Morenci, and then the projects will build up at the Cerro Verde expansion or the El Abra mill and few build that one too et cetera. Will the CapEx increase as the $4 billion consolidated Cerro Verde mill starts up or will other things wind down and is there any level that we can comfortably say is the upper limit or cap on capital spending like $4.5 billion or $5 billion or $5.5 billion or $6 billion or $7 billion.","Richard C. Adkerson","Right now, it depends on \u2013 I'm want to say some qualifiers, John he knows this industry well enough that I know I'm not, did you understand this. It depends on how these studies unfold. We want it, we\u2019d like to go faster than we can but it just takes time because of the need to drill, to do metallurgical work, engineering analysis, get permits, arrange for water and power. I mean if you could just see the effort that our team is exerting to find water resources here in Arizona for the opportunities we have. We are looking at buying ranches, we are talking with Indian tribes, we\u2019re talking with other water users, and dealing with things.","So all those things result in a longer time period for developing these resources than we probably like. On the other hand, everybody in the industry faces these sorts of things and that\u2019s what supportive of copper prices, because supply can\u2019t be turned down very quickly. I would say that as we look out and what you are talking about that for purposes of investor analysis, the capital expending is shorter than the lower end of that range as you were talking about, $4 billion, $5 billion, $7 billion.","Kathleen L. Quirk","$4 billion to $5 billion.","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah, $4 billion to $5 billion. And it will be down for a period of time as projects wind down as we startup other projects. So\u2026","John Charles Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","So I if could talk (inaudible) Richard, Jim Bob used to say, it\u2019s all about buy mama a brand new dress, so when we are we going to see the brand new dress from all the expansions?","Richard C. Adkerson","That\u2019s going to unfold over time depending on copper prices and so forth. But we are thinking about pearls and diamonds rather than dresses, John.","John Charles Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","We just don\u2019t want to feel subordinate to the capital expenditure vendor suppliers to shareholders and I\u2019m a shareholder Richard and I idolize Jim Bob and you in the company.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, we appreciate that and we understand that and I can tell you that message came through loud and clear as we have these investor conferences, and that\u2019s the world today. we will be very disciplined about our projects. We believe the investments we make will create value for shareholders and the opportunity to return cash for shareholders as we go forward. and as I said John, as you can sense, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the set of assets that we have. You know our track record; you know what this Board has done and what this company has done in the past. So I hope that give you some comfort.","John Charles Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Melissa Hernandez with [New Burger Barmen].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you for taking my question. It\u2019s a quick one on molybdenum and the Climax mine with our moly price that has weakened somewhat here and you mentioned that the ramp up for Climax would depend on market conditions. Could you tell us a little bit more about that? How confident are you that the market can observe the 20 million tons from Climax next year maintaining a price up about 15.","Richard C. Adkerson","Dave, you want to talk about a little bit?","David H. Thornton","Yeah. I think we're ramping up Climax right now. The market has weakened a little bit and we\u2019re down in the 1,270 per pound range, but our outlook for molybdenum and for growth remained strong. the European economic issues of slowdown in China causing some of the softness in the global economies today, but our long-term outlook for moly, as it is for copper and other metals continue to be positive. We feel next year with just our normal growth rates in the 2013 will be able to move those 20 million tons of moly into the market. So our view hasn\u2019t changed on that",".","Kathleen L. Quirk","The other thing Melissa, this is Kathleen. The other thing is that we\u2019ve also got some lower byproduct production forecast as you look at our outlook for sales. We expect to go from roughly 80 million pound level, currently the 90. So we\u2019ve got some offsets with byproduct and as Rich and Dave mentioned, we\u2019ll have a delay to flex production with Henderson to meet market requirements.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, thank you.","Kathleen L. Quirk","The issue at the byproduct is the sequencing issue, primarily at our U.S. mines. We have some lower grades coming in 2013 and it will ultimately get back to higher rates.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Yeah, you\u2019re seeing that in fact this year, with Climax starting up, our sales are relatively flat compared to last year and that\u2019s the same reason.","Unidentified Company Representative","One good thing about our set of assets is we can adjust quickly. We can adjust quickly through mine rates, throughput rates, and so forth without turning our cost structure upside down. Because we \u2013 our cost are low and reduction would increase cost some, but not to the point where it\u2019s a major decision to do that and then the nature of the operations gives us a lot of flexibility.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities","Good morning, I had couple of questions. Just following on that last question, lower grade moly effect, in three day in 2013, does that continue like for three or four years or what sort of time horizon should we think about statics that will the effect the cost there?","Unidentified Company Representative","It\u2019s down for a couple of years, I think is Sierrita and it picks back again and I believe the \u201914 range.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Yeah, 2014.","Unidentified Company Representative","2014, we see a pick up again. So it\u2019s just the sequencing of the mines in those two places. I think that\u2019s a little more stable on their throughput where you see more variability at Sierrita.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities","Great, thank you. My second\u2026","Richard C. Adkerson","","Both of those have resources that we're looking at down the road. They have great expansion opportunities to Sierrita; we have the Twin Buttes property that we acquired for couple hundred million dollars that we're looking at. So we talk about these, this pipeline of opportunities those are two mines that have resources that we're looking at very hard.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities","Just on that. My second question sort of follows on, and I realize you have lots of optionality in all these projects, which is a great asset to have all that optionality. But just to clarify on Morenci, we've talked about drilling the current mill to 115,000 tons per day, which will get us the 800 million pound. But you\u2019ve also got the statement now, current expansion on page 18 could get Morenci over a billion pounds. Is that possible with the current 115,000 tons, i.e., there is some higher grade coming, or does that start to include the second sulfide expansion where you\u2019ve talked about 800 million pound. Can you just reconcile like how all those numbers fit together and I realize there\u2019s a lot of moving parts?","Richard C. Adkerson","Right, right, it would require that further expansion. It's that opportunity that would get us to those kinds of levels.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities","Right. Then it\u2019d be kind of like, I have 800 million pound today, and then I get the other 800 million pound with major capital expenditures. That\u2019s the way to think of it?","Richard C. Adkerson","It would be a big capital expenditure. And it would be the sort of thing that would be done, faced on the world\u2019s need for copper. Like, which you said about optionality. Having this here, gives us the chance to generate lots of volumes, lots of profits at today's prices, lower prices the world\u2019s needs for copper growth, I believe they will. We didn\u2019t have a resource like this where we can go in, make an investment, take advantage of that opportunity as an option.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities","","Great. My final question is a little bit the same, but this time at El Abra we\u2019re obviously, at the current operation wind down we replaced whatever to 50 million pound. Again you talk about the billion is that \u2013 two questions, is that the additional 600 million that you talk about from the sell side, and if so is there a way to actually \u2013 does that make sense just in a capital allocation decision to go right from 350 million to 1.2 billion, and I realize this is the move in the future or how do you, are we talking about making like a 360,000 tons per day operation like Cerro Verde or how does that actually work at El Abra?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yeah, it\u2019s a long-term deal. It\u2019s separating apart from ourselves sulfalix project. We looked at what to do as we were going from the hot side into the sulfur resource. And as frankly, we weren\u2019t aware of this resource five years ago. It was only through this process that we had tried to understand that ore bodies do a lot of drilling, and so forth that we became aware that there was a bigger opportunity yet at El Abra. It has got some challenges to overcome, some big challenges to overcome.","We decided to go forward with sulfalix and continue to work on this additional sulphide resource which would require major capital view processing, it won\u2019t be a leach operation, it will require lot more water and power and all those things that are in short supply until it probably require us to work with our partners in the area to find ways of doing this in an efficient way. It\u2019s an opportunity, Brian, but it\u2019s a separate opportunity.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities","Great, thanks very much for all the color, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson","All right.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","","Hi.","Richard C. Adkerson","Hey.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Good morning, guys. I guess my first question quickly for Kathleen, a bit of a technical one. On these recent environmental litigation charges, could you comment as to \u2013 it\u2019s just going to be more of a recurring kind of nature charge, something that you are working towards settling, are these just lumpy and kind of would you take them as they come?","Kathleen L. Quirk","","It\u2019s latter, we've got established reserves what we think our exposure is and when something changes from that, we review the reserves and in this quarter we had two matters that, they were things that developed that costs as too, as we look at those reserves, so it's more lumpy than it is a recurring item.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay, and then maybe for Richard, my second question was, would you expect the changes in the tax code coming in 2013, namely the higher taxation of dividends, is there a thought process in Freeport that you may want to shift to a strategy of maybe more buybacks, has a more tax efficient way to return yield to share holders?","Richard C. Adkerson","","We will take into account everything, but when we look at our shareholder base we have principally institutions that aren\u2019t subject to income tax. And so it's not a \u2013 as we talk with investors it's not a major factor, investor feedback in recent years has been more positive about dividends, I must tell you as I am sure you\u2019re hearing, I am hearing more about stock buybacks now being something that investors are attracted to, but it's not going to be tax driven.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay, and then just last quick question, what would be the incremental cost at Climax to ramp from the 20 million pounds to 30 million pounds that if you choose to do that?","Kathleen L. Quirk","There is no additional capital, we designed the facilities to be able to produce at 30 million pounds per annum. We\u2019re operating those currently at a reduced rate in light of the market situations. So there wouldn\u2019t be additional capital and actually there would be operational cost efficiencies of doing that. But we\u2019re really trying to wrap it up in a measured fashion. We\u2019re managing the costs closely. So we\u2019re \u2013 but we did design it for the 30 million pound level.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","","Great. Thanks very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","Great asset, Jorge.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","It sounds good. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the incremental production.","Richard C. Adkerson","In regards to\u2026","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Massoud with Stifel Nicolaus.","Paul Massoud \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","I just have a quick question about Tenke. It sounds like Phase 2 is coming along well and you\u2019re adding the extra tankhouse capacity. I\u2019m not mistaken, the extra capacity is coming on in the couple of phases. One Phase, being completed later on this year, and then the entire thing probably done, it sounds like in the beginning of 2013. Is it possible, you want to see any incremental benefit from increased capacity going through later this year that isn\u2019t being incorporated in guidance, or would you expect to see cost go up before they come back down?","Kathleen L. Quirk","We\u2019ve got \u2013 in our outlook we\u2019ve got improved production in the fourth quarter associated with the start up. We won\u2019t get to the full rates until next year, but we do have some benefit in the late part of this year from the new tankhouse capacity.","Paul Massoud \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay. And I have \u2013 just as a quick follow-up. I mean has there been any more discussions about a potential cobalt refinery game plan in there?","Richard C. Adkerson","We\u2019re looking at alternatives about how to deal with this significant amount of cobalt in the small market, in the small market of getting it to market in an efficient way. The same sort of issues conceptually that our predecessor companies faced with the molybdenum business. So we\u2019re looking at a number of different alternatives. Right now, we\u2019re able to market the product we produce, and it\u2019s a good demand for it, and it\u2019s not something we have pressure on and it\u2019s more of a long-term view as to how we\u2019re going to deal with a significant amount of cobalt resources there.","Paul A. Massoud \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research.","Charles A. Bradford \u2013 Bradford Research, Inc.","Good morning. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled on the medical constitutionality, the medical plan, a number of companies have found we are beginning to look at maybe (inaudible) their medical coverage for their U.S. employees. So I think it\u2019s pretty mature to do that. How many U.S. employees do you have that covered by the medical and what is the cost per employee?","Richard C. Adkerson","Chuck, we don\u2019t have a cost per employee situation here. we\u2019re not going to (inaudible) our medical coverage for employees. We, it\u2019s one of the important benefits that people see from working with our company. this issue about what the cost is going to be is a very complicated when that all American industry right now is trying to sort through as to what it had. it\u2019s not going to be a game changer for us, it\u2019s \u2013 and we\u2019re going to find ways of dealing with whatever law comes down this hike and what we have to deal with in terms of being responsive to the needs of our employees and doing it on a cost efficient basis. Over time we made changes to our benefit plans and as other companies have, but this is not something, that\u2019s of huge significance to our company.","Kathleen L.

Wayne Atwell \u2013 Global Hunter Securities LLC","","Hey good morning and thanks for all your insights. I had just a quick question to follow-up on John\u2019s question about capital spending and the like, you seem to have a pretty good cash flow, you have a great cash balance and we talked about dividends and buybacks, you seem to have plenty of cash available, your debts fairly low, what are your thoughts about the buyback, it seems like this might be a good time to do that?","Richard C. Adkerson","","It's something our board looks at continually. I will tell you, in a world that we live in today, with the uncertainties that I mentioned earlier on in my comments, it feels great to have really a very strong balance sheet.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer of FCX; and Red Conger, President of Americas and Africa. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we'll open our \u2013 after our remarks, we'll open the call up for questions.","Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $479 million, or $0.38 per share for the second quarter of 2016. As detailed in the release the net loss attributable to common stock included a special item totaling $452 million, or $0.36 per share during the second quarter, primarily for the previously reported drillship settlements and impairment of our oil and gas properties partly offset by net gains on the sale of assets. After adjusting for these net charges, our second quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $27 million, or $0.02 a share.","Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for second quarter of 2016, approximated $966 million, we have a slide on the deck that shows you the go forward of getting to that number.","And during the second quarter, we completed previously announced asset sales for aggregate consideration of $1.3 billion, that included the $1 billion sale of the additional 13% undivided interest in Morenci during May. And also in May, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in TF Holdings Limited for $2.65 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to $120 million. In accordance with the accounting guidelines as you'll see in the release, the results of Tenke are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.","During the quarter, our consolidated sales volume totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper, 156,000 ounces of gold, 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalents.","Our average price of copper was $2.18 per pound. That was below last year's second quarter average of $2.71 per pound. Gold averaged $1,292 during the quarter. That was above last year's quarterly average of $1,174. and our realized price for crude oil of $41 per barrel was below last year's quarterly average price of just under $68 per barrel, which included $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts.","Unit net cash cost for the quarter averaged $1.33 per pound, that was lower as expected than the year ago period of $1.50 per pound, and that primarily reflects the higher copper volumes and economies of scale that have come in during the quarter as anticipated, and the impact of ongoing cost reduction initiatives partly offset by lower gold and silver credits.","We generated operating cash flows during the quarter of $874 million, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $833 million during the quarter. As previously reported, we have exchanged some of our senior notes into equity through July 25. Yesterday, we exchanged a total of $369 million in face amount of bonds at a cost of $311 million or approximately 28 million shares of our common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions.","Our debt at the end of June was $19.3 billion and consolidated cash was approximately $350 million. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. And we ended this quarter and currently have approximately 1.33 billion common shares outstanding, which includes the shares that we issued through yesterday, in connection with the settlement of the debt exchange.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to our slide materials and discussing our operations and outlook.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kathleen, and thank all of you for joining us, today. I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit, before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about, situations to talk about with the quarter, and we'll cover those in detail. But I believe it's important for you to understand that we feel very good about the progress we've made during the first half of the year.","Late last night, as we put the finishing touches on today's presentation, Kathleen and I were reflecting aback about, where our company stood a year ago. A year ago oil prices were in the mid-$60 a barrel, copper prices were $2.70, we were talking about controlling costs and talking about strategic alternatives for our oil and gas business.","As 2015 proceeded and going into 2016, oil prices dropped at one point below $30 a barrel, copper prices dropped below $2 a pound, there was a lot of uncertainties about our company, because of the debt level, witness the way our bonds traded and our CDSs traded.","We took steps, we reorganized our board, the restructured board emphasized our focus on the future of our company being in the mining business, we restructured our management team, and we took actions. When we had our year-end earnings call, there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to execute the plans that we needed to execute to address our balance sheet issues, a lot of skepticism. Internally, there was a lack of clarity about not where we were going, we knew what we had to do, but how we would get there, how the market would react to it.","So, looking back, we said then that we would sell assets, raise capital, targeting $5 billion to $10 billion and we went to work. As we were doing that, Red and his team and our global operating teams focused on executing our business plans. And when you look at the charts on the side of page three \u2013 slide three, you can see how effective we've been doing that. We've reduced our site production and delivery cost before byproduct credits by 23%.","Oil and gas business, we cut our production cost from $19 a barrel to $15 a barrel. We cut CapEx, we completed our major expansion project at Cerro Verde, which a year ago was a significant undertaking risk for our company and it is a very complex project \u2013 you know as it was completed, it was the largest processing facility in the history of the mining industry and it was a big project, $4.5 billion-plus. We reduced CapEx in the oil and gas business. We undertook the sale assets in a market that had uncertainties.","We did this to strengthen our balance sheet, but as a surprise to some people we were able to achieve valuations that reflected a positive view of the long-term copper market. We had that a year ago, we continue to have that today and I'll talk about it. Not only does this generate cash to reduce our debt, but it highlights the value of Freeport's assets as we go forward.","We have raised today over $4 billion or in position to complete transactions to raise it by only selling 9% of our copper reserves. We had an effort to sell our oil and gas business or assets, it was a tough time to do that, we restructured the business to operate within its cash flows, we reorganized the business, we dealt with some major obligations that had been committed to in past times when the strategy was to grow that business aggressively and we made some tough decisions to restructure drilling contracts and other contracts and we continue to view strategically, how these assets fit into our long-term business and we understand their values and we will look over time to see how to generate value for our shareholders out of those assets.","Our copper volumes are growing with the successful Cerro Verde start up, 15% quarter-to-quarter year-on-year increase. And we'll step back and look at how our company is now positioned for free cash flow generation.","As we were talking last night, Kathleen and I and our management team feel that we have truly turned the corner for Freeport. And our ability to do that wasn't just clear cut as we started the year. We proved that our assets are attractive. And our strategy and we'll talk about how our financial strategy fits with our longer term business strategy is focused on leaving us with a core set of assets to build long-term value for shareholders. It would be one thing just to sell assets simply to raise cash, but we've kept a view about what will Freeport be for the long-term and which of our assets will be there to allow us to take advantage of our core competencies as a company and also to take advantage of what we believe will be our long-term copper market. So, that was always in our mind as to what did we want to be left with after we sold assets.","So, looking on page four, we have set a target of reducing our debt to $10 billion. Our debt at June 30 is just below $19 billion and we have a contract to sell our Tenke asset with the related assets that we'd be selling for $2.8 billion. Now, if we look forward at different scenarios of copper prices and with successful execution of our plants, you can see what our debt levels would be at $2 copper, $2.25 copper and $2.50 copper at the end of 2017.","That reflects the transactions that we sold or we have contracts for. It does not include any divestment of PTFI shares and we have a strategy of working with the Government of Indonesia to sell an incremental approximately 20% of PTFI contingent on getting our contract extension. We will consider further asset steps, strategic steps, for example, this doesn't include any sales of our oil and gas business. And I want to emphasize that as we look at any divestment of PTFI, it's a condition that we sell those assets at fair value to our company. And so, as we looked at this and we take into account the risk possibility of copper prices trading down, throughout the Financial Community Day and with many of the experts that follow the industry, there's a risk that because of slower growth in China and global economic uncertainties that we may have to deal with lower than today's copper prices in the short-term.","I'm going to talk about the longer term view, but we have to live through the short term to experience the benefits of a positive long-term market. So we sit here with a balancing act. The balancing act was to look at these debt levels, understand what it's going to take operationally to get to those, then think about what next steps should we take to address the uncertainties of the short-term market. And we are still open and on the table for all strategic moves, whether that means selling assets, selling the company, we're focused really on creating value for our shareholders, and to create that long-term value.","Our recent history with this company shows that we need to have a strong balance sheet to allow us to be positioned to aggressively take care of the long-term values. We've had ongoing discussions about some other asset sales, we are continuing those. We look at capital market transactions, and today, we've announced that we have plans to file the necessary documents to allow us to issue another $1.5 billion of stock through and at the market offering.","Our company has had success with these in the past. We did one in 2008-2009 crisis. We've done two of these offerings last year when our financial situation was more dark. What this allows us to do is to access the market, and if the market is available to us on a day-by-day basis to sell shares into the marketplace when there is demand for them. And so, we felt looking at these numbers that this was the step that if we can successfully execute it, you know absent just a collapse in the market, we basically have a path forward of achieving what we set out to achieve.","There is no requirement to sell further assets. There is no requirement to sell further equity. We've got it now, which we didn't have six months ago, a clear-cut path as to how to get our financial situation to the point where we wanted to get it to. And we will have done it in a way that we can hold on to what we believe is our highest quality assets to build the company for the future.","Now, those assets \u2013 the transactions today they're listed on page five, it includes the successful sale of an incremental interest, an incremental 13% interest to our long time highly valued partners Sumitomo and Morenci. That transaction is closed. We have a series of other smaller transactions, and the Tenke Fungurume transaction, which is where we have a contract and working with the large aluminum, they are proceeding with the necessary regulatory steps in China to get the transaction closed. Their reports are that that's going very well. They have to have a shareholder vote since there is a minority public ownership \u2013 minority public ownership, so the shareholder vote doesn't involve uncertainties as to the outcome, but procedurally it has to be conducted. All indications are that this transaction is going to be closed as anticipated in the fall. And so, that would generate for us considering all factors, something between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, pleased with that.","Now what then does Freeport have left. I mean, it's a great set of assets. We will have seven copper mines, lead by our flagship mine in Morenci into North America. We also have two molybdenum mines and we have a great molybdenum business, largest producer, lowest cost producer. We have two pure molybdenum mines in North America and byproduct produced at our other mines.","We also have two great mines in South America; Cerro Verde, which I'll talk about and El Abra, where we and our partner CODELCO are doing studies now for the potential for a major expansion of that property only when market conditions allow.","Now, one of the things as we really gotten into this and evaluated potential transactions and buyers is really a recognition of how much value we create by having this set of assets run together. These are mines which benefit significantly from the synergies of being able to share people, technology, equipment to have the flexibility of focusing on growth projects of one of these mines or the other and looking at how to fit those together in a long-term plan, but ultimately growing volumes.","You can see in these bubbles, really huge resources, over 30 billion pounds of copper reserves each in North America and South America, significant molybdenum, beyond proved reserves, huge amounts of mineralized material and future growth projects. We have a growth pipeline for this industry with these assets that extends as far as you can see. And we also have the ability of executing these when it makes sense. In undertaking low risk, executable transactions without having to do it, we can run a really rational business strategy of generating profits and focusing on long-term growth in a very business-like and rational way. And when we look at how those values fit together, we felt really it makes a lot of sense to keep the assets together for our future. And Red and his team just do an outstanding job in running this business.","The Grasberg mine in Indonesia is a real special asset. I mean, it is special in many ways because of its physical location, but extraordinary because of the high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore. It's a tough mine to run, but we've done it for a long time now. We began the development, we've been there since the early 1970s in Indonesia and Papua and we've developed the Grasberg during the 1990s and now operate it, so we can see the end of the life of the open pit, the transition to an underground. We got issues to deal with. We've always had issues to deal with there, operationally, managing the environment, working with the local community, working with the changes in the Indonesian government, but underlying that is an extraordinary asset and we want to work cooperatively with the people of Indonesia and its government in a way to generate benefits that are mutual for both of us and that's what we're doing.","Now, where are we today with copper markets? The surpluses today are relatively small in the marketplace and lower than people expected not too long ago as to where they were, the new supply that people like us had initiated with projects following the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, some have been delayed, some have been deferred. But the new supply is basically coming on as expected. A recent feature is that there are significantly lower disruptions than had been experienced in the industry, disruptions from labor issue, disruptions from mine and operational issues, from equipment issues.","So we've had a case of where the mine \u2013 the industry has been producing basically what was available to it. And even with that, even with the new supply, the lower disruptions, the lower growth in China, the lower growth globally because of all the economic issues affecting the world, the projected medium-term deficits \u2013 in the projected medium-term, it looks like we're going to be having deficits even with very modest demand growth. So, rather than the market being overwhelmed with supply, there is ample copper around the world today. So, the market is fully supplied. But it's not being overwhelmed with new supplies and continued production even with very modest demand growth. And as you go forward, existing mines will produce less. People aren't investing in new projects. There is barriers to project development that relate to environmental, community, country issues. And as we've shown in this process that we've had about selling property, there is a significantly higher than current price required to develop new production.","You just simply can't do it, and we know because we've got huge resources to develop, and we are working on plans to development. It will require higher copper price and absent a complete deterioration or significant deterioration, collapse in China market or global market, we're heading for a time when copper prices are going to be higher. That is illustrated on page eight.","Now I want to say what this is and what it isn't. This shows projected existing supply before any disruption allowance from existing mines. It doesn't take into account new projects, even those projects that today look probable. But it just shows that over the next 10 years, existing mines' production is expected to decline on the order of 20%, that's roughly 4 million tons. Today the top 10 mines in the world produce about 5.5 million tons per year. And according to Wood Mackenzie, the incentive price for new development is $3.30 a pound. We know how long it takes to develop new mines. With all these resources, 100 billion pounds of reserves, 100 billion pounds of mineralized material, more resources beyond that, if we were to start today to say, let's develop an [AFE] to develop a new mine, it's on the order of 10 years before we have new production and that can't be changed, that's not economic, but that's reality of getting permits, getting mine plans, getting things organized, that's just the way it's required.","Now we did this with Cerro Verde. Cerro Verde is a tremendous asset. It was started many years ago, it was discovered in the 20th Century \u2013 in the 19th Century and it was started as a very small SX\/EW operation. As we acquired Phelps Dodge, they were completing a major drilling expansion in 2006, a little bit rough start off as Red and I know then, and now we've done this $4.5 billion project on budget, we've taken our mill rate from a year ago from 116,000 tons a day to 352,000 tons a day, think of that. 352,000 tons through the mill. We're mining over 600,000 tons a day. Our sales have gone from 100 million pounds to 270 million pounds. Our unit costs have gone from $1.87 to $1.22.","It will be a very long-term contributor to the future of our company. This is an asset that we could sell at a very attractive value. We could conduct just a formal auction of this, it would raise a lot of money. But we believe that this is kind of core asset that we need to keep and our financial plan now will allow us to keep it. We weren't sure we could do that going into this year to build our company around for the future.","We went back and looked at three of our key mines, Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg and before we really started on this process, we wanted to show just how the districts that we operate in have changed over the years and what we have to continue to build on. In 1988, Morenci, as you went into the 1980s and 1990s and early 2000s, there were reports talking about the death of the Southwest copper district in the U.S. and Mexico. Morenci had relatively small reserves. We've had significant production since then. We have significant remaining reserves and potential beyond those reserves. There will be a time not in the very near-term, but we'll be announcing a major further mill expansion at Morenci to develop the sulfide reserves.","Cerro Verde now is essentially full developed, but as we look below the existing outline for the fifth that will support the expansion, there is further resources there and at Grasberg, Grasberg was discovered in 1988, developed during the 1990s to become one of the mining industry's great assets and we've got 25 years left on our contract and a great future there.","Then when we look broadly and as I said, we look at this set of assets in North America and South America as a set of assets managed together to take advantage. We have very large copper sulfate opportunities that have been much better defined since our Phelps Dodge acquisition through our core drilling and exploration analysis, and it's a consistent story.","In mines like Baghdad, which is our mine and for the long life, operational challenges because of principally water availability and some land for tailings and so forth, but has a very significant resource. Recently, at a 100-year-old mine in New Mexico, Chino, which has been viewed as being at the very end of its life, we've been able to recently produce some incremental volumes, through our understanding of the ore body better, and then identifying the potential for large scale sulfide future development at Chino.","El Abra in Chile, I mentioned earlier, as we first got into this after the Phelps Dodge acquisition, we saw this as a project with a very limited life. Exploration, drilling, and analysis have shown a enormous sulfide resource that requires some investments to get water and power to it, and to develop the mine, but this is a Cerro Verde type project for the future. And we're doing the work to position us far. New Morenci has a mine called Safford which was also developed by Phelps Dodge right before our acquisition. It has an adjoining ore resource that's been known for years.","As we now approach the completion of the mining oxide material at Safford we're looking at this Lone Star resource, which has the opportunity to provide additional oxide awards to extend the life of the facilities at Safford, but a huge, huge sulfide resource underlying it. We're doing work to see how to take advantage of that. I mentioned Morenci, Sierrita is a mine with significant molybdenum resource, but again very large potential resource development. All of these developments, I want to talk about them because of how it fits into our near-team financial strategy.","We're retaining these opportunities to grow our company in the future, very simple. We are not going to start spending money on these capital projects until the market justifies it, so we'll have that underlying our company. In our short term, Kathleen and I talked to Red and his team about what could they do to mitigate production declines without doing major capital expansion projects, how to do it with minimum capital. And they are undertaking a project to deal with steepening pit walls around our company.","By optimizing slopes, it will allow us to target opportunities, to minimize stripping and add ore. And this would result in lower cost and adding ore available for current production without having to do major development projects. This is a process that we're approaching very carefully, because we want to do it by adhering to our established safety factors for protecting pit walls, but it allows us to have the potential to accelerate ore in the medium term, add incremental ore to our reserves.","We're in the early stages of this, but we're very encouraged about what we might be able to do with it, we'll be reporting to you as we go forward.","Now at Grasberg. We are at a stage of this mine, where we're completing the mining of the open pit. And if you can see the schematic of the ore bodies, we are producing now from the DOZ, we've developed the DMLZ extension of the DOZ and it has commenced production and it will provide significant ore to us going forward.","We are continuing for the development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the extension of the ore body beyond the pit limits and we're prepared to do that. It would allow us to continue operations beyond the depletion of the pit and began ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave by having this infrastructure development. We can't mine from the Block Cave until the pit is complete because we use block caving methods, which results in surface upsides.","And an ongoing issue we've had is the need to have an extension of our contract because the funds we're spending to develop a block cave are for production that will largely be produced beyond 2021. And so, we've been having this ongoing assessment about whether to continue these capital expenditures; if we were to defer those, there would be significant adverse consequences, both for our company and for the government of Indonesia because it would defer the initiation of the ramp up of the Block Cave going forward in the future.","Today we have access to the ore at the very lower limits of the open pit. That means we're not doing much stripping at all. It has very high-grade ore. Our mining rate is two-thirds lower than its maximum 43% lower. There is limited access to the pit, so that means it creates some operational issues for us. And in this quarter, we had a couple of things to deal with. One, we had as we talked about on our last call, a mechanical issue to repair with one of our big SAG mills, that was done more quickly than we anticipated. And we have experienced some issues with part of our workforce and this is the workforce that actually operates the big trucks and shovels in the Grasberg open pit. They've had some grievances. There's been some slowdown work there and it had an impact on this quarter's volumes.","Couple of points to emphasize. Well, let me start by saying, we are working with the union and the workers to resolve these grievances, and we're making progress with that. And we believe that we will be successful in dealing with that. But it was lower volumes now, but that ore is not going away. It will be mined and produced in the future. It's a matter of timing. It may mean, it will likely mean, it will mean, let me \u2013 it will mean that we will be continuing to mine from the open pit into the early part of 2018 rather completing in 2017. So it's a short-term timing issue. We believe we have it solved. We're really focused on executing there and believe our team can do it. We do have with the Indonesian Government an export permit that will be required by the first week of, roughly the first week of August, it's August 8. We have been given assurances from the Mines Ministry and the highest levels in government that we would be able to get that permit and we expect to obtain it on a timely basis.","Longer term, we are having ongoing discussions following up on our letter from October of last year about the long-term extension of our contract. Those discussions have been constructive with the senior officials of the government clearly recognize the need for investment more broadly within Indonesia, and to achieve that goal, they have commented publicly on the need to treat existing investors like Freeport fairly.","There's been some political realignment within the President, the parliament in this first quarter \u2013 first half of the year, we believe all that's going to be positive for getting a resolution, and feel that the timing for doing that now as opposed to where it's been over the last six months is much more positive and we are going to complete following up on that. So, that's kind of where we are at Grasberg and I'll be prepared to follow your \u2013 answer your questions.","Slide 14 just shows how really good our mining business is. It shows in 2015 when copper price averaged $2.42, our EBITDA matched our capital spending. Now in the first half, with the completion of Cerro Verde, the drop off in CapEx even at a copper price of averaging $2.16, EBITDA is significantly higher than CapEx, and as we look forward for the full year in 2016 with copper prices averaging for the remainder of the year at $2 to $2.50. We have substantially higher EBITDA than the $1.7 billion of expected CapEx for the year. The adjustments for EBITDA reflect the changes that are previously talked about in Grasberg, the sale of the interest of Morenci and other factors there, but it shows how profitable our business will be now and as we go forward.","In the oil and gas business, we really had a focus on managing costs and enhancing, protecting the asset values. We reduced costs \u2013 outside capital costs by roughly $150 million, that's about a third or more reduction in G&A costs and resulting other costs. We've restructured the really large commitments under the three deepwater drill ships that we had contracts for. We talked about that last time and that's in the supplemental slides if you want to go back and review it.","We have established production in the deepwater from five new wells that we drilled to tie back to our production facilities. There were three wells that hosting deep and two wells in the Horn Mountain area. I'll talk about the Holstein production because those wells, the production results have been disappointing. Disappointing for factors related to the quality of the oil and the nature of the reservoirs, and that's just what it is. But overall, the production from wells that we've previously drilled have come on as expected, unfortunately, these did not. But we have had favorable results from the development of the outside operator in large projects at Lucius and Heidelberg.","The \u2013 we have achieved our goal of ending the subsidy of our oil and gas operations from the mining business. And you can see that on page 16, where we show the oil and gas EBITDA at various prices, CapEx in 2017 has been reduced to $600 million. And you can see that what kind of EBITDA we would have at various prices ranging from $500 million at $35 to $1.5 billion at $65.","The deepwater business is built around these three assets, three production facilities formally owned by BP and Shell, and they are 100% owned, they have significant processing capacity and significant unused processing capacity, which creates value for both us and prospective purchasers of these assets.","Our outlook for 2016 updated for our experience in Indonesia, continues to show copper sales of $5 billion (sic) [5 billion pounds].","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Pound.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","5 billion pounds. Our Sierrita mine, which we anticipate at closing, went to work and found ways of finding some volumes at a very attractive cost level that offset the lower production in Indonesia. Gold production reflects the Indonesia issues that we talked about. Molybdenum increased just because of \u2013 principally because of Sierrita and because of markets that have improved some; and oil production is lower. We have sold our interest in the Haynesville gas field and so those barrels equivalent are out. There has been an operational issue because of the gas plant problem in Pascagoula, Mississippi that's limited some of our production as well as a startup production at the \u2013 with our three new wells.","Operating cash flows at $2.25 copper are modeled to be $4.5 billion with substantial leverage of $260 million for each $0.10 change in copper price. Unit costs are consistent with previous guidance and on this basis $1.06 per pound and capital spending is couple hundred billion dollars less than previous guidance.","Our sales profile, as we look forward, from 2015 to 2016, we got the 5 billion pounds that I just talked about, that would drop in 2017 principally because of the sale, Tenke is the big factor there. That is expected to close later this year and would reduce volumes. You can see the gold coming out of Grasberg as we mine the end of the pit, and what our Molybdenum and oil sales would be.","Our chart that we show each quarter for our EBITDA and cash flows show it over a range of $2 and $2.50. It shows operating cash flows ranging from $3.5 billion to $5 billion over those copper prices and then capital expenditures and we're going to manage this in relation to market conditions would be dropping from $6.350 million in 2015 to just over $3 billion this year to $2.3 billion in 2017. So, the cash flow numbers that we talked about earlier reflects substantial cash coming out of the operation of our business.","Kathleen went over with you the 3(a)(9) exchanges, in which we were able to retire roughly $370 million of debt. We had a cost in terms of the share price of $311 million. We'll continue to look for opportunities like this. And then when we look at our balance sheet and our ability to manage it, not only do we have a plan of getting our debt down, which we would believe be by the end of 2017, we'll be at an acceptable level to allow us to focus on growth as market conditions allow. We also have ways of dealing with our near-term maturities of half the proceeds of the Tenke transaction will be used to reduce our bank term loans, pursuant to our agreement with the bank. The remaining half will then be available as cash to retire the deal with our 2017 maturities.","So, we've dealt with 2016, 2017 and we're going to continually looking at capital market transactions to \u2013 with \u2013 let me just say non-equity capital markets transactions in a way to deal and maximize the maturity picture going forward. So, this is a little chart we use as we talk about proving our mettle for this year in an enthusiastic and resilient manner. And I'm pleased to report for the first six months we've had a great track record of doing that and moving our sales forward on a really clearly defined business and financial strategy. So, thank you for bearing with me with all of that. It felt like it's an important quarter to cover these things and now I look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if we could get a bit more color on Grasberg, specifically your five-year outlook for production really hasn't changed that much the last couple quarters, I'm just wondering how we should think about that production profile as you differ CapEx spending given the uncertainty on the COW extension. I mean at some point I would think that's going to have some impact on that, sort of post 2017 outlook, any color there would be extremely helpful. Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Orest. Yeah, yeah, that \u2013 you know, that's a good point. While we have found some ways and we continue to search for ways to differ capital, we changed the mine plants and have done certain things. What we have not done yet, what we have not done yet is differ the necessary steps that would allow us to begin ramping up the Grasberg block cave production once the pit is completed, now that would be early 2018. So the balancing act and this has been a major point of focus for us in the first half of the year. I went to Grasberg and I sat down with our team, we did a detailed review of what it would mean if we were simply to defer the spending of the $1 billion a year that we've been spending recently to develop this underground resource.","What would happen, it would be significant layoffs and we're over 90% of the economy in Mimika. The resulting social disruptions there, which is \u2013 which are a significant concern are unknown. If for sure we do what you just said, it would result in a deferral for the ramp up of the Grasberg block cave. And once you did mobilize the team that's working on this, remobilizing that team and coming back in would be a significant exercise beyond just the time of spending it. And that would have a major negative impact as I said, both on us and on the government.","Now we are basing our decision to do this on the assurances we've received from the government in recent years, but most clearly articulated in the October 8 letter last year that they will extend our contract. And recent \u2013 my recent discussions with the highest level of officials in the government reaffirmed that commitment to doing that. So, we are saying that we need to have that done in the near-term, explaining to them the consequences if we \u2013 to them as well to us of deferring those expenditures but to date we have not made that major decision. So, we're online \u2013 that work by the way has gone exceedingly well. And the underlying economics are strongly in favor of us doing what we're doing.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank","Is there a specific sort of drop dead date in your mind that if you don't receive the COW extension by a certain point in time, you will sort of be forced to pullback the CapEx spend?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There are some important dates along that line. One had been this August 8 this year, in the near-term for getting the extension of our export permit. We've been given assurance we'll get that. There is also an existing regulation in Indonesia. It's a government regulation, not part of the mining law that prohibits exports beginning in January 2017. That regulation is going to have to be changed or else that would be a major trigger point for us.","And our contract provides that if the government takes actions in any way, but through large regulations that provides \u2013 that is inconsistent with our contract, then we have legal rights to pursue damages against that.","We do not want to do that, we want to find a cooperative way of working this out with the government. The government is telling us they want to find a cooperative way of doing it so we're going to take advantage of this common ground that we now have to deal with it. But those, in response to your question, Orest, so that are the real trigger dates for us.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank","And just so I remember, so the beginning of 2017 officially the Indonesia has banned all non-processed exports, is that correct?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. That was \u2013 they had this 2009 mining law that was aimed at Indonesia exports of ore. We originally thought it didn't apply to copper concentrate. Two years later, there was a regulation passed that extended it to copper concentrate, and there was a regulation that said, no exports of this ore would be allowed beyond January 2017.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There is a lot of pressures economically in Indonesia right now for them to relax that. The country financially would be harmed significantly by banning exports, and we don't think they're likely to do that.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank","Okay. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. The reduction in Africa sales guidance for copper this year, does that reflect an actual reduction in your volume or is that just the closing date, affected by the closing date of 10-K, i.e., you think it's going to close before year-end?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. That's what it is. We've forecast through a fourth quarter kind of middle fourth quarter closing date. So, we've just forecast what we would have through that closing date.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank","Yeah.","Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining","Second quarter was a record that I think we've never produced more copper in a quarter than we did last quarter.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Red. In terms of \u2013 that was great. Yeah. Now the operation there is going great. Our team is cooperating, our work with China Moly as we plan transition is going very well. China Moly is committed to maintain the quality of operations, the standards of environmental, and social programs and so forth. So we're working very cooperatively with them, everybody \u2013 I think everybody knows this but China Moly is a non-state owned Chinese company.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank","Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Hi, guys. Just had a couple questions on operations and also the balance sheet. Maybe just start on slide four, where it's good to get the progression I guess in the net debt, does that include the $1.5 billion equity raise, just to be clear on that...","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, it does not.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, it does not. And it doesn't include, it doesn't include ATM proceeds, it doesn't include any sale of oil and gas assets, it does not include any sale of additional shares in PT-FI.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. Thanks very much. And then just I guess a broader question on your CapEx and cost reduction targets you've been able to achieve and I saw that you mentioned another $150 million, are you able to just step through how \u2013 the composition of that and how you look at 2017 and beyond and whether the cut now in your CapEx have to be caught up I guess in 2018 and beyond or whether they are sustainable?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the $150 million you referenced is a cut in non-capital cost with oil and gas group, that's G&A and other cost that might be reported as lease operating expenses, for example. That reflects a major reduction in employment there, and we're still working on cost for office facilities and other support facilities, so that is sustainable. We had previously, beginning in 2015, although we've had a culture of doing this all along, have been very tough on managing costs in our mining business.","Part that over time where we may end up having to increase some cost is \u2013 Kathleen has been work really strongly with Red and his team about reducing maintenance capital in the mining business. And we've done a great job in cutting that back. Over time, we may have to spend a bit more capital in maintaining our facilities and so forth. But other than the Grasberg investments that I just talked about, we don't see major new capital projects in the mining business until the market warrants it.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. And we're managing \u2013 what you might be referring to, Chris, is the CapEx budget that we've reduced from $3.3 billion to $3.1 billion in 2016 and we've got slightly higher, about $100 million higher in 2017 than the previous estimate. But we're continuing in this market environment that we're in to emphasize deferring spending, our team has done a great job in finding ways to use equipment that we have, we talk about buying at home. And so the real focus is on cash flow net of CapEx and we've got the whole organization measuring on those bases.","So we're working on lower for longer and we hope that that turns, but we do want to try to have sustainable long-term cost savings, both operating cost and capital savings as we go forward.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I just want to say this, we had all of our mine managers that work under Red together week before last and we have a great team, everybody is highly motivated, understands the issues, working to achieve these objectives. And I'm really proud to be part of the team.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. Thanks \u2013 thanks for the color. And just one final one, I guess, maybe even over the last three months or so if we really want \u2013 there, it seemed to be more about doing another asset sale whereas now just hearing the tone of the conversation seems like if you'd complete the equity raise and copper stays about where it is, you can get through without that, but you continue to assess it, is that the right way to read it?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It is. I mean, we started off the year saying that every asset we had was up for consideration for sale. And we made progress. We continue to have discussions. But we're still telling the market and tell bankers if you got ideas for our business, come share them with us. And we've had a lot of interest and a lot of discussions. And that's what I talk about the balancing act, the balancing act is what we could raise, what will we be left with to build a company around, and \u2013 whereas at the beginning of the year, we didn't know, we thought we might have to sell some of these core assets, we thought we might have to sell Cerro Verde. We had a lot of interest in it.","So, you're exactly right, with the plan we have now, as I said definitely now, if you like, we've turned the corner, we can see the way forward, without further asset sales, without further equity sales. We still have strategic decisions to make about the oil and gas business and about PT-FI shares as part of our arrangements with the government and we've got market uncertainties that we're going to have to monitor as we go along. But as I said, we see clarity now that we didn't have before and that clarity shows us the way to get to where we wanted to get to without having further asset sales.","And so, if we can have an asset sale that would be less dilutive than an equity sale, that's the way we evaluate it. We want to do the \u2013 we want to get to where we need to get to in terms of having good balance sheet and do it in the most, the least dilutive fashion that we could get to.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Thanks, Richard. I appreciate it.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, Richard and Kathleen.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Evan.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, first question just on 10-K. I was hoping you could address I don't know if I'd call them red flags, but a couple of issues with the closing, one is DRC has obviously raised some objections to the deal. And I was wondering how are you \u2013 what's behind that, do they have any sort of legitimate claim and what that might cost if anything to push that aside, could that delay the deal? And then the second point was recently Lundin got a five week extension on their right of first offer, what was behind that, and could that similarly potentially delay the deal, I know you have to get this thing closed by December 31.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. We have had just a great relationship with the \u2013 Freeport with the Government of the DRC. I mean, it was rocky at the start, but we've built a great relationship. We've operated the mine in a first-class fashion. We've had a great relationship with G\u00e9camines, it's a state-owned company that owns an interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining and an exceptional relationship with Lundin, our partner there. We sold Lundin, our Candelaria mine in Chile. So \u2013 and we love the asset, I mean, we really like to having this part of our portfolio.","So when circumstances required to sell it, everybody was disappointed. We were disappointed, Lundin was disappointed, G\u00e9camines was disappointed, the government was disappointed. So, we've had it and this was not unexpected. So we had to deal with that disappointment. We have confidence that CMOC, China Moly, is a good partner and they are going to be a good partner for the country, and they're taking steps to explain that both to Lundin and to the G\u00e9camines and the government. The government would obviously like to get some financial compensation out of this, but legally, this is a transaction that does not relate to Tenke Fungurume Mining, which has the contract with the government, it's had a higher tier company, and there is no legal basis for anything other than continuation.","So, the China Moly and Lundin are having discussions together about the future, Lundin has certain transfer rights that are publically known, and they mutually made a decision that they would like to have some additional time to consider that those transfer rights in their partnership going forward. We don't expect any delay. China Moly is reporting to us the approvals that they are getting in China and they have a strong economic interest to getting this thing closed, and we expect them to do it.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for that.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And they really emphasized in their communications process that the benefits to the government of the Congo and employees and the community will be sustained going forward. There is no changes in that.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then second question just on leverage, I appreciate that slide that you put out there where you thought you'd be from a net debt perspective at various copper prices at the end of 2017. I was wondering, if you roll that forward in 2018, I know that's going to be a year where some of the production drops off at Grasberg. What is kind of a debt level as far as a ratio goes on a net debt to EBITDA? Where do you want to be at the end of 2018? What's kind of the minimum or, say, maximum leverage ratio that you would like to be at by the end of that year?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, as we go forward, because we're constraining capital so much, we continue to generate even at the lower Grasberg volumes excess cash flows. In 2018, it's essentially breakeven, but if you look forward beyond that, as Grasberg grows and ramps up, we have a future of generation of excess cash flows. And we will continue moderating the time that we start reinvesting in our copper resources based on market conditions then. And as we look at what the debt levels would be, there won't be any arbitrary ratios and so forth, but it would be based on a then assessment of what market risks are, market conditions are. And I'm looking forward to the time when Freeport returns again to thinking about increasing dividends and returning cash to shareholders. So we have a future that allows us to look forward to that day, based on the rectification of our balance sheet now that we've got the clear line of sight after dealing with the losses we had from this oil and gas deal.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Richard, Kathleen, thanks very much for the update. Just a couple. First on gold at Grasberg, obviously, it's heavily weighed to Q4 this year. Looks like the grade's going to have to jump up almost to 50% from our numbers. Looking into 2017, obviously, there's a big jump in gold. It's good for grade. Is that going to be evenly spread next year or is it going to be similar to this year and backend loaded?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","There will be variability from quarter to quarter and a slight change in grade can have a big impact, but we expect, as you see, with 2.5 million ounces that's our share, we'll have a strong quarterly gold volume throughout 2017. There will be some variability, though.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is it going to be frontend...","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And...","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Andrew, this is something we've been seeing and talking about since the production of the \u2013 going back to 1998 when we first set out on this. We designed the ultimate pit limits and so forth, this has been in our plans ever since then.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the thing that Kathleen's talking about as we get down to the bottom of the pit, there is only one access road. And so depending on how things go, just a little bit of change in where we mine or production issues can push things from quarter-to-quarter.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. And then on CapEx guidance for 2017, looking from Q1. It's pretty steady, the $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Does that include Tenke, or has Tenke been taken out of that? And how does that remain constant?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yes. We resumed the Tenke sale in the fourth quarter, so that does include any CapEx from Tenke. We had scaled back way back the CapEx from Tenke in 2017 following completion of the asset plan this year. So we had very little capital in any case projected previously for Tenke.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So that's what for next year in 2017?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Correct.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's out, but it wasn't large.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yes, it was less than $50 million.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then is there any hedging on any of the oil and gas?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, Richard, Kathleen and Red. I wanted to start off with a question on oil and gas. I see the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has set up some new requirements as it pertains to plugging and abandonment liabilities. And I'm wondering if you can discuss the ramifications and does this shrink the pool of potential acquirers of the oil and gas business?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question, Tony. These are new rules and the process was started mid-year last year, rules have been published, but how the rules would be administered is still unclear and our team is monitoring this, prepared to work with the government on it. And all can say is we're going to work with them and deal with it as best we can. We've had experience with this, as you well know, Tony, because we have to deal with financial assurance obligations with states in our mining business now and the Federal government through EPA is talking about this. So this is a growing area of emphasis and globally with events that have happened has put this on emphasis for.","So we just have to deal with it. We've got uncertainties and we'll report to you as we go along. But you're right, Tony, this has had an impact on potential buyers. It's a different situation from an established operator in the deepwater to having either a smaller company or a financial buyer, which would have to deal with these in different ways because the way the government has historically administered, and we're unsure exactly how it's going to go forward, but they've provided some waivers into these kinds of obligations depending on the scope of an operators' operations in Gulf.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Richard, I want to make sure I understand a comment you made when you were talking about turning the corner with all that you've done to date without the need for further \u2013 I wrote down copper asset sales, but did you say without the need for further asset sales in total including oil and gas?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","No.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let's see, to make sure I can address this in a right way, without a need to do it, but strategically beyond just meeting the financial objectives of balance sheet management could lead us to make decisions about selling interest in PT-FI shares or doing something with the oil and gas assets. But we're not forced to do anything now to meet our financial objectives. We've got a plan that allows us to do that and now we can step back and deal with these other things strategically rather than as financial imperatives.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. To garner the best valuation possible type of thing?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just if I can go back to Indonesia, with so much complexity there, I was hopeful that the government would treat you guys more kindly since Newmont basically announced it's going to be selling out of Indonesia. And I'm wondering, has there been any change in tone since we saw those developments? And obviously, it's not a done deal and there's probably a lot of complexities involved there. But I'm just wondering, how all these moving parts could play out?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I would tell you the tone we've had with the senior government officials has been good for some time now. I've had the chance of watching President, Joko Widodo closely, as he's been in United States and as he talked internationally about foreign investment and so forth. And there is not an issue of tone there. Within the country politically there is a feeling of resource nationalism, which is true of lots of places around the world today. And with us what's going on here in United States, but I'm convinced the President and senior advisors understand the issues from an Indonesia standpoint.","We've had some complicated political circumstances in Indonesia over the past, say, nine months or so. And those have made progress. And I think that's had more of an impact on my sense of where we are. The Batu Hijau Mine that Newmont managed and had a significant interest in, it's apples and oranges to Grasberg in terms of size, grade, profitability and so forth. And I think the country is taking pride that an Indonesian group is stepping up to buy it. Many people there would like to see Indonesians own more of PT-FI. Biting off, managing Grasberg is a whole different situation than managing Batu Hijau just in terms of its complexity and its location in Papua and the development of the underground resources and environmental management, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the other factors are more of encourage to me than the Batu Hijau Mine.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. It did look like it was \u2013 I mean we can believe what we read. It looked like a pretty good price for an asset that's got a much smaller reserve base, well one-twentieth of what I think of what you guys reported at Grasberg though, but that's one thing that that kind of caught my eye in that as well?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm afraid that Newmont...","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Lower quality too I think.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm afraid that Newmont were pleased with the transaction. We are working with the government to have them understand the fair value of our asset.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you. Thank you very much, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations. Looks like you've just about made a profit from not counting the $291 million impairment. Could you talk a little more about the six copper sulfide projects you're studying, El Abra and I guess five in the U.S.?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","And if there is one or two of them, it really seems to be a barn burner with a lot of upside, maybe a better grade or a lower strip, and if the better one or two of them are, say, 120,000 ton a day grinding mill expansions as opposed to the 240,000 ton a day at Cerro Verde.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. So, let's start at El Abra because, John, these are like Cerro Verde, relatively low-grade deposits that are very large. And so to make them economic, you need to have substantial grinding capacity \u2013 processing capacity. So Cerro Verde, what's good about it is the exploration work we're doing, the core drilling has to find the resource, so we don't have the risk of the resource. The issue is and it's things that we do. Execution of the plan is something we're very confident about. It's just the capital to build the desalination plant and then transports that water form sea level up to \u2013 Red, what's the...","Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining","To 10,000 feet.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","10,000 feet, and then build the processing facility. That's a lot of capital. So that's basically what you have there. In the U.S. there is similar situation at Bagdad. It's very large low-grade deposit. And we have those similar situations in Chino in New Mexico, Morenci. The one project that really looks exciting in the U.S. that has a little different characteristic to it is the Lone Star deposit. And we've talked about Lone Star since 2007. But now we are reaching the end of the oxide life of Safford. We have those facilities. And we can work our way in the Lone Star by mining the oxide cap there, which will allow us to use these facilities that are available in the adjoining Safford mine, and that would ultimately expose an enormous sulfide resource, big, low grade, which would allow us to take a step towards getting the benefit from it and then have the opportunity to do a large scale concentrator development. There is also a sulfide deposit at depth at Safford. And so how we deal with those together gives us a way to phase into it that's not available with other projects.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","When you say there's a sulfide deposit at depth at Safford, you're referring to the prior pits, not Lone Star?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. This is the sulfide below the existing oxide.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","So there's a lot of fun you could be having with grinding mills over the next five years or 10 years?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, and I want to tell you, that's been the strength of our company. The early development of the SAG mills at Grasberg was a big deal. The development now of high-pressure grinding roll mills at Grasberg and Cerro Verde that's one thing that allowed us to do Cerro Verde in such an efficient way. And then Red, talk a little bit about new mill at Morenci. It's amazing.","Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining","John, at Morenci, we're doing 75,000 tons a day through one high-pressure grinding roll. And we've had days that approached a 100,000 tons. So those are low-energy consumption, high-efficiency, and they also help with recovery more than what we see in SAG mills. So we're very pleased with all of that.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it's brand new technology and it's amazing to see how much material can go through it at such a smaller size than the big SAG mills that I was used to at Grasberg and at what energy efficiency. So it's fair to say that we're at the cusp of technology and operations throughout the copper mining industry and that's what we do. We're going to be very disciplined. I want to call everybody else, we're planning at this point, John, to work on it and our team is really excited about it. But we're going to be very disciplined about spending capital and we're going to be confident that the market needs this copper we're producing. It will need it, I'm confident of that. It's just a question of time.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Hi. I just have a question on slide 16, when you talk about the CapEx profile for the oil and gas business and the various amounts of EBITDA that can be generated at different oil and gas prices. I guess, my question is to what degree is that run rate of EBITDA sustainable with that level of $600 million CapEx, and will there be an eventual reinvestment cycle, so to speak, in that business in terms of having to invest more CapEx in order to be able to maintain the same amount of production from those wells? I guess, what's the life of production with the 2017 run rate as it's indicated on slide 16?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's what we're spending a lot of time on with our team in Houston. I was just there last week. And that was the key focus of what we're talking about. You're right in saying the nature of oil and gas production in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico involves inherent declines. But we have the benefit for several years now of wells that were drilled since we acquired Plains in 2013 that we have hooked up and have begun production on. And the effect of that is deferring the time when the decline hits us.","So sort of like what we're doing here in the mining business, we're looking at different scenarios of where can you invest over time at the lowest risk, minimizing capital kinds of investments to arrest that decline. So we have several years to deal with that, but looking out in the long-term future would require reinvestment to maintain these levels of production.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And respectively for buyers, there's ways of growing, because we've identified a number of potential drilling opportunities that don't require new platform development, because we have all this unused capacity in the existing platforms. So there is great opportunity here. It does require capital and in the deepwater a significant capital, time lags for it to bring production on stream. In this Vito basin area, there is tremendous opportunities, and that's what I'm saying is strategically we're saying, our focus is going to be on the copper business. We want to make sure that if we talk to people about buying the assets or joint venture relationships or people we might want to come in overtime and invest with us to help minimize our capital, these are good assets and there is great opportunities for it.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Will there be an auction, say, to run the assets for cash flow at these kind of levels as indicated in the slide? And then if that were to happen and the wells were to deplete, per se, would you still then be able to maintain the optionality of having those reserves in the ground, or is there a certain point in time where you would have to spend in order to be able to maintain that optionality?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There is certain things you have to spend. One of the things has to do with partner commitments. In other words, you'll have other partners in some of these opportunities and you'd have to participate or not. And if you don't, you lose the opportunity. There are some timing on lease requirements. So we have some flexibility, as I said, for several years, but long-term to be in this business, you've got to have a reinvestment opportunity and you've got to have a view for growth.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","So we've restructured the business in a way where we don't have required commitments, but we are working with the team to develop capital allocation strategies that allow us to retain value in the assets, while not requiring CapEx above the cash flow being generated. So we're developing plans to allow that business to continue to generate cash to cover its CapEx. And because of the money we've spent historically, the lease acreage position we have, the strategic position we have around these strategic platforms, we do have organic inventory that we can manage over time, and that's what we're really trying to do. Like Richard said, if another buyer came in, they may do things differently than what we are doing, but we're allocating capital to the business in a manner that protects the asset values but doesn't require cash above its internally generated funds.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I'll say this, in \u2013 my direct management of this group really started this quarter, and we have a really good professional team of technical guys running that business. They are impressive. They're recognized within the industry. My biggest concern was safety, as you can imagine, and everybody is committed to having safety as a first priority. They're really good guys, really know what they're doing. And we've worked out arrangements with them to be consistent with our corporate strategy. So I feel very good about the way all that's working.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay, great. I mean do you think we should see an updated capital allocation strategy, say, by the end of this year or the end of 2017? is that...?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we're going to give you a quarter-by-quarter update of where we are...","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We here at Freeport have a tradition of every quarter assessing where things are. We don't wait for any annual planning session. It's a continual basis of allocating capital, making decisions and we're going to inform you guys of how we're doing that.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of them have been addressed, but I may have missed one thing. I wanted to ask a little bit more. Just on the oil side, what was the reason for the roughly 16% decline in the guidance for 2017 versus three months ago?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Well, the big issue had to do with these three new wells that we had at what we call Holstein Deep. These wells were drilled. The logs on the well, electric logs that analyze the reservoirs prior to getting production were very strong. Unfortunately, there were limits because of the nature of the wells, the depth and so forth of where certain aspects about the quality of the oil, the permeability, the viscosity were simply not available and the initial projections were based on analogists' data from the area, from other experiences, and so there was just limited data.","This is common in the industry. And when these wells came on-stream, it was readily apparent that the crude oil quality, the in-situ permeability throughout the field was different than expected. The viscosity was measurably higher than pre-test expectations. And so, it was just a case of where the wells weren't able to produce what they were expected to produce. And it was fairly significant. At the outset, the three wells, we were looking at 24,000 barrels a day, that we had lowered it a bit for our second quarter plans, but they're producing at 8,500 barrels a day, 9,000 barrels a day now.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Dave, and another factor is the sale of the Haynesville gas which impacts volumes, but not really cash flows. So, you have probably two-thirds from well performance that Richard talked about, but a one-third of it is related to this Haynesville transaction which we report on equivalent basis, but it really had very little impact on our cash flow for 2017 net of capital spend.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Industry standards have this equivalency at six to one, relatively sales prices today are 15 to 1. So, we were calculating barrels equivalent to six to one. And I went back and looked and since we acquired Plains, we've had basically zero cash flows out of Haynesville. And yet that's going to show up as that number of barrels equivalent is just a problem with the way the industry reports stuff.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just stepping back for a second, the bigger picture commentary that you made throughout the call regarding turning the corner and really addressing the balance sheet issues. As you look ahead now to 2018 and beyond, Cerro Verde is ramped, Morenci expansion is done, obviously pretty significant drop off here at Grasberg that we've all known about or should have known about. But still, where do you see the best \u2013 what do you \u2013 I'm trying to figure out where the growth is going to come from basically in 2018 and beyond, do you turn to investments outside of Freeport, that's a bit capital constrained obviously, but I don't really have a good source of growth, I'm wondering if you could help me out there?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's what the market is leading us to right now. We could well have a period of time of where we will have announced new projects to develop and being engaged in developing them, just like we were in 2011 to 2016 with Tenke, Morenci and Cerro Verde. If market conditions improve by then, what you could hear us say is, okay, we're going to start on these projects, we're going have this capital plan to execute it and it's going to take time to execute it.","And so, the stock at that point will be reflecting that growth plan, we might depending on market conditions have excess cash flows. I'm fine with having those excess cash flows go to shareholders. We clearly could be in a position of being re-engaged in the market looking for other opportunities, but that's an option. We wouldn't feel any imperative to do anything other than focus on building our business long-term and if we have cash flows returning to shareholders. To me philosophically, that's what a natural resource company ought to do, not feel compelled to invest just because you're having money, but have the opportunities to have capital discipline, good rates of return, show how growth would occur through that process.","I keep telling all these people who are sitting on the other table about negotiating right now, I wish I were in your shoes, I wish we had a company where we could be buying assets now rather than selling, but we're not, we can't wish that away, we are what we are. But look, Dave, I'd be fine to be in that condition, to have good markets, long-term investments and if you generate excess cash, overfunding those investments, get a right capital structure to the earlier question about what would be a good debt level to have in that environment; if you got excess cash, pay your shareholders.","David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Richard, I just want to go back to something you said early on in the call where you noted that you were open to everything essentially. And if I heard you correctly, I think you said including the sale of the company. Just trying to interpret this, is this a process that's sort of actively ongoing or is it more along the lines of somebody brings you an attractive offer, the board is obligated to consider this as usual?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Well, you're right. There are legal obligations that as a public company board is saddled with. But look, there is one thing that we share with our board now and our management team, we're all in this to build shareholder value and I mean we're all committed to it. We're all trying to find the best way to do it. My only point was, that's what we're about. That's kind of like my response to Dave's question about investment in growth. So, we've told the world that you know if there is some way of generating shareholder value now that's reasonable and attractive, there is not going to be barriers to our company considering it.","Jeremy Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC","Understood. That's very helpful. And just the only quick follow-up I have. The $1.5 billion ATM to reduce I think \"ongoing indebtedness.\" Is there a particular focus such as some of the shorter dated maturities or how should we think of the proceeds here?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, it's going to be used as an overall management process of what makes sense. We had a later slide that showed that we basically covered our maturities through 2017. And so, we're going to be examining how to manage those maturities for 2018 forward and this will be part of the ingredients that go into that analysis for it. But there is nothing specific that we've targeted for right now.","Jeremy Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC","Understood and good luck. Thanks very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeremy. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR & Company. Please go ahead.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, good morning, everybody. Richard, earlier in the call you mentioned trigger dates in Indonesia in fairly short order, August 8 and then January again, I wondered would you also expect kind of a final word so to say on the smelter and also the progress on the divestiture within that timeframe of call it six months or so?","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Lucas. Those two specific issues are part of a package of resolving our contract situation. We've been very clear with the government. We can't build a smelter without a contract extension. I mean that is a major construction progress. We've done a lot of work on it, we've got site selection done, we're working with preliminary engineering, design, we've got a real clear view of what it would be required. But we can't spend significant capital on it without having a contract extension, just think about it. We start today, the smelter construction period extends at least into 2019. And if you don't have assurance from your contract, you're not going to build a smelter and not have that assurance.","The same way with divestiture, we've indicated a willingness to invest even though our contract award has no requirements that we do legally in terms of trying to meet the aspirations of people of Indonesia and its government, we've said we would divest an incremental 20%-plus. But again, that would only happen if we have a contract extension. The valuation of this business, if you just say we got a contract through 2021 is unreasonable based on the investments that we make. The investments we've made has been to develop this resource for the next 25 years. And for our shareholders, we couldn't sell it without getting a return on those investments and a fair valuation for operations extending over the next 25 years. So, that's conditional in the contract as well.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is regarding 2018. I wondered if you have maybe a date in mind for issuing that initial guidance, I'm kind of looking forward to how production would evolve longer term given Grasberg and then also on the O&G side there, your investments there. So, do you have any date in mind for disclosing that 2018 production outlook?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, we do disclose the five-year outlook for Grasberg. So, you can see the impact in between 2017 and 2018 in Grasberg principally on total volumes. And we'll be updating our numbers in a little bit, we haven't set a date for disclosing 2018 on a consolidated basis, but the biggest impact you will see is the decline at Grasberg in 2018.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that's slide 30, Lucas.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, yeah. Yeah, got it. Cool. Well, thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just say one thing about slide 30. It's out of perspective because we've always, as I mentioned this earlier, we were always going to have these exceptional years in 2016, 2017 because we're down at the bottom of the pit, high grades, no stripping, et cetera. So, historically, we never expected as we first got into this expanded operations at Grasberg in 1998 to be able to have this level of production of copper and gold after the pit expired. The resource has grown so much, the way that we process it has been established. So, these numbers are pretty \u2013 relatively consistent with what we had before these exceptional years in 2016, 2017. So the resource is very large in terms of both the copper and gold production, the unit cost will be low, it's a world-class asset beyond 2017.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah. And I think also, just one follow-up on that. It also is going to be market driven as well. We still have some production curtailed. And so, that will be, our mine plans will be reviewed on an ongoing basis depending on market conditions. So, both in North America and South America we've got some production that's still curtailed.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And just as a point of information, this is net of Rio Tinto's interest here. After 2021, Rio Tinto has 40% as a joint venture partner in this. These numbers which you see on slide 30 are not consolidated, but net to Freeport.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, got it. Great.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","And I will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We could go on forever and some might say that indeed we have today. So, at any event, we wanted to try to answer your questions, we appreciate your attention and we are available to follow-up through David Joint if you have further questions. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"10190":["Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer. We also have several members of our senior operating team in the room including Red Conger, Mark Johnson and Mike Hendrix (1:40).","I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after the prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for questions and answers.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $217 million, or $0.16 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Our results for the quarter included net gains totaling $39 million, or $0.03 per share, which reflected non-recurring tax credits, partly offset by the impairment of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for this net gain, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $178 million, or $0.13 per share.","Our EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $1.35 billion. Our consolidated sales, including the volumes from Tenke Fungurume which is being reported as a discontinued operation following our agreement to sell our interest totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper in the quarter, 317,000 ounces of gold, 16 million pounds of molybdenum and 12 million barrels of oil equivalent.","Our copper and gold sales were lower than our July estimates, principally reflecting lower mining rates at the Grasberg mine, which affected the timing of access to higher grade ore, which we expect to recover in future periods. Our average copper price during the quarter was $2.18 per pound. That was below the year ago average of $2.38 per pound. Gold prices averaged $1,327 per ounce during the quarter, which was above last year's third quarter of $1,117 per ounce.","Our average net unit cash cost net of byproduct credits totaled $1.14 per pound of copper in the third quarter, we continued our trend of reducing cash cost, they were $1.52 per pound in the third quarter of 2015. Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $980 million, those cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $494 million during the quarter. As we previously reported, we commenced a registered offering at the market equity offering of up to $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter, and during the quarter, we sold 33.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $415 million, which averaged $12.39 per share.","We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $19 billion and our cash grew to $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. We had no borrowings under our revolving $3.5 billion revolver credit facility and as you'll see in the slides we have very little in the way of near-term maturity. We had $1.36 billion common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter, as you'll see in our release and as Richard will be discussing more in depth in his presentation, we have significant asset sale transactions that we expect to complete during the fourth quarter, a total of $5.2 billion which includes the previously announced transaction for our Tenke Fungurume stake as well as assets, oil and gas assets including the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our onshore California properties.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to materials, slide presentation materials on our website.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks, Kathleen. And good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sunrise here in Phoenix and that's a good way to start our call off. We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago, when our board acted to restructure our board and return our focus to our global leading copper business. And during 2016, we have made some significant accomplishments and we've positioned our company for the future with these significant copper resources and with an improved balance sheet.","But, before I really talk about that, I want to address right at the outset the reason why our copper production volumes in this quarter fell short of the estimates. As you know, we are mining in the last phase of the Grasberg open pit. Some ways it's hard to believe, but we started developing it in 1990, and here we are at the very end of the pit. It is at this point, physically a very confined area right at the bottom of the pit, the ore body extends lower but we're going to mine that as an underground operation. But we have current mining in an area that's constricted but it has extraordinarily high grades of copper and gold, and these grades are increasing as we mine.","During the quarter, our planned mining rate, the actual physical material we moved that was about 15% short of what we had planned. And as a result of that, we simply did not access as much of this high grade ore as we expected and what our plans projected. We'll talk more about this later and we're certainly disappointed with this mining rate. A lot of it has to do with some worker issues that we're addressing and we believe we can manage as we go forward. But we have the equipment, the mine designs, the people and the ore grades to allow us to mine this material, and so what we're faced now is the fact that we didn't get to it this quarter means that it's a timing issue. We will get to it as we go forward, we'll make up a lot of it in 2017, it will have an impact in the fourth quarter and we should finish mining it early in 2018, so this is not a valuation issue or a really significant economic issue but more of a timing issue.","Now looking back fourth quarter of 2015 was a very difficult time, but as we went into 2016, the first half of the quarter was really, really tough as you'll remember. We set out on a path to cut our debt. In response to one of your questions in our year-end earnings call, you pressed me to say what was our target for debt reduction and I said $5 billion to $10 billion. At that point, to be really candid with you, the market was tough that we didn't \u2013 I really didn't have a clear cut view that, of how we were going to do it, but we were committed to do it.","So we set on this path, now we believe we have clear sight to reducing our debt by $10 billion. And we executed this plan in a way after looking at a lot of alternatives that will enable us to retain a core set of assets that we'll build a great company around. It's characterized by long lives, good cost positions, long-term growth options when markets indicate that future investments will be needed and it will be and a balance of geographic diversity. And so we're really pleased here that we are \u2013 we have a clear path now for achieving these objectives.","As an organization, we were already on a solid path to cut our cost and our capital spending and our global team has really stepped up to this challenge. We delivered completion of the Cerro Verde project on-time and on-budget. It was a very big complicated project and we moved quickly to adjust our operating plans and our capital spending at each one of our operations to respond to the situation. And our teams had a long history with this. The organization had operated at low grade mines in the U.S. for over 100 years and this has made the team that Red leads and Mark Johnson leads really good operators in dealing with this kind of environment.","We operate all of our mines and so we can benchmark our operations and share best practices and people and resources around the company and across the portfolio. Our net unit cost averaged $1.14 per pound during the quarter and this is 25% below last year's third quarter, and before byproduct credits costs were down 20% over the year. And at each one of our sites, we have really focused on cash flow generation and we look at our performance net of sustaining capital cost and we've been very tough on capital at this point. And despite these low prices, our team is very enthusiastic and focused and energized to maximize cash flows.","During 2015, our CapEx exceeded our cash flows. That was primarily because of the oil and gas business. We worked hard to reverse this and generated $500 million in cash flows above CapEx in the third quarter. And we expect to be able and are confident we can continue to generate free cash flow over the next several quarters, even at low prices, because we're going to constrain capital spending, until the market warrants new investments, and that will contribute to our debt reduction \u2013 achieving our debt reduction targets. Year-to-date, we've announced $6.6 billion in anticipated proceeds from asset sales transaction.","This does not include potential additional consideration of $680 million. We've to date received proceeds of $1.4 billion and expect to receive $5.2 billion by yearend from transactions that have \u2013 are under contract, which we expect to close. So these steps will enable us to achieve our delevering objective of cutting our debt in half by the end of 2017, but keeping a really strong set of assets that over the long run will enable our shareholders to benefit as the market recovers.","Slide four, is a summary of our recent announcements of our oil and gas transactions. You'll recall that at the end of 2015, we announced a process to evaluate options for this business. Our board engaged special financial advisors, and we went into the marketplace to see in the first quarter if we could find a buyer for the whole business. Now that was a really tough time to try to find someone to buy a set of assets like we had in the oil and gas business, couldn't have been worse. And by the end of the quarter, in the first quarter of this year, we had concluded that we would likely retain these assets for a longer period of time. And that we'd hold onto them and wait for a market recovery.","At that point, we reorganized our management of our oil and gas business. We changed it from being a standalone separate business to being a division of our company. We put together from the existing group a really effective operating management team. And so that was the plan going into it.","After the first quarter and after we had announced what we were going to do, parties emerged with renewed interest, who are talking to us about buying sets of those assets. And so, we continued our process of discussions. I can assure you that we gave everyone in the marketplace the opportunity to come in and talk with us; people knew it. Bankers were out knocking on doors. And so, we really had a process that exposed these assets to the marketplace. And at the end of the day, we had a competitive process, and we reached a transaction in September to sell our production in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Anadarko. And then, in October, we've now announced a transaction to sell our production onshore in California.","In the aggregate, we will receive $2.6 billion in gross proceeds and $300 million in contingent consideration. And I will assure you we thought long and hard, and had active discussions with our board about selling these assets during this period of weak oil prices and taking into account the current outlook for oil prices.","And \u2013 but the nature of this oil and gas business is such that, because of depletion, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, it would require over time continued reinvestment to maintain the assets. If you didn't do that, they simply go away. And then, you have very significant reclamation obligations, and the government's rules for providing financial assurance for those reclamation obligations are being \u2013 are changing and requirements are likely to be more significant.","And so, we took all that into account and concluded that these transactions were consistent with our strategy, and would allow us to focus on what our future is going to be.","Now, I can tell you I've read analysts who assigned a much higher value to these assets than what we sold them to, a theoretical value. Buyers weren't willing to pay that. After a very extensive process that we went through I'm convinced we got very attractive prices for us. The purchasers will likely do well with these assets because they're good assets. But for our company, considering the total implications financially of continuing to be in that business and hold them, I'm very comfortable with what we did and really pleased that we were able to get that done. So, that is summarized on page 4, and I'd be happy to answer any questions about it.","Now, we continue, looking at page 5, to progress the sale of our PT asset. You've all heard me say that this is an asset that we sold with great reluctance. It's a great long-term asset and fit very well in our portfolio, and I'm very proud of our team. When we started out in 2008 in developing it in a very challenging environment and going through the financial crisis and working on all of the issues of doing business there, it's been a real pleasure to do business in the DRC and work with the people there and see what our team has done. But it's also an asset that values are going to be realized over very long periods of time. And we were able to find a buyer at a valuation that's attractive in relation to near-term cash flows.","And China Molybdenum, a privately owned Chinese company that's making global investments in the mining industry, is progressing their transaction. The process has gone smoothly. It is a public company, not a state-owned company, and they have gotten their shareholder approval and other regulatory approvals within China that was necessary to go forward with the transaction.","And where we are today, there is still a condition remaining to close is resolving a transfer right that our minority partner, Lundin Mining, has in the property in contract. It's called the Right of First Offer or ROFO, and we've been working with China Moly and Lundin to resolve this. We've currently extended the timeframe for resolving it to November 15. You've also read that G\u00e9camines, the state-owned mining company in the DRC, has asserted that it has preemptive rights to this transaction. The transaction itself involves entities outside of the DRC at a different corporate level.","We disagree with G\u00e9camines' assertion on this, and our legal advisors support our conclusion. But we're working with China Molybdenum, with Lundin, with G\u00e9camines and with the government, so that we can all find a way forward to work together to resolve this issue. China Molybdenum has strongly expressed their commitment to closing the transaction as soon as possible, and we're working together to find the appropriate resolution for the Lundin ROFO. We still expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter.","It's $2.6 billion in proceeds and $120 million in contingent consideration, and we're also giving them exclusive rights to acquire an exploration property we have in the DRC and a downstream cobalt business. So all of that is working to get closed in the fourth quarter.","So, putting this all together on slide 6, you can see the aggregate steps that we have taken. If we look at the completion of these asset sales transactions, completion of the previously announced $1.5 billion after-market offering, which to-date we have completed about 25% of that $1.5 billion amount. Execution of our operating plans, we expect to achieve our debt targets by the end of 2017. And we are well on our way of doing this.","We have the portfolio of remaining assets that we want to keep. We're not planning additional divestments. We may take some steps to deal with the remaining assets in our oil and gas business, and we are prepared to divest at Grasberg an additional roughly 20% interest pursuant to our discussions with the Indonesian government. That is contingent on, conditional on getting our long-term rights extended on the basis of giving us fiscal and legal assurety, but we've \u2013 we're committed to the government to sell an additional 20% interest. That's not in these numbers.","So, at the end of the day, we will have a reasonable balance sheet and industry-leading portfolio of copper assets that would be available for long-term development. And these are the sorts of assets in the copper business that at best are very, very difficult to replicate if at all possible.","So, looking at those assets, on page 7, is an overview. We have \u2013 we will have seven copper mines, which will be led by Morenci, seven copper mines in North America, which will be led by our flagship Morenci mine, which is a fabulous operation. These mines are very long lived. It gives us long-term optionality on copper prices and future investment opportunities.","We will have two mines in South America: the Cerro Verde mine, which today has the largest processing facilities globally and is operating very well; and the El Abra mine in Chile, which has very significant long-term growth opportunities for us as well as Grasberg. We've managed these assets successfully over a long period of time in different price environments and within these mines, we have significant growth opportunities that we'll be prepared to pursue when the time is right.","And we show this on page 8 and this is our copper sulfide development opportunities, in alphabetical listing not a priority listing, we're still assessing from a priority standpoint, which ones we would attack first and even though we're not spending capital on these projects, we are spending effort to develop plans for future investments. And they are sulfide opportunities that we have identified through our exploration drilling and exploration analysis on very large ore bodies, where we can take advantage of existing infrastructure to add on to processing facilities that will allow us to develop these in a profitable way.","Now, copper market commentary, copper price at today's levels is still very low and reflects the global economy and slowdown in China, but stepping back, the surpluses that were previously predicted are lower than what was expected. We've had recent supply growth and there is still a couple of projects being completed, we were a big part of that. We had three big projects that we started in the 2010 timeframe that have been completed now. And with the current projects being finished, the recent supply growth is not sustainable. These long periods of low prices will impact future supplies.","Wood Mackenzie is showing a 4 million ton decline from existing mines in the next coming years, 2025. The top 10 mines in the world today produce less than 5.5 million tons of copper a year and Wood Mackenzie feels the incentive price to develop new mine supplies on the order of $3.30.","Inventories have risen during the quarter, the reasons for that, the level still remains relatively low by historical standards. And when you look at the total marketplace, relatively or just say absolutely small increases in demand or supply disruptions could well move the market to deficit in a short period of time.","Page 10 is a slide, I don't think we've used recently, but we've used over the years, which shows the 10 largest mines in the world in terms of reserves. In copper production, we have three of those mines at Grasberg, Cerro Verde and Morenci. You can see what I referred to earlier these top 10 mines in 2016 are, will be producing less than 5.5 million tons a year.","So to replace 4 million tons in the future, in terms of what you're looking at is really a significant challenge for the industry. Other than Oyu Tolgoi and Los Pelambres, Grasberg is the most recent discovery in 1988, many of these mines were discovered back in the 1800s and here where on Grasberg completing mining of the open pit this year. So the point is, finding world-class mines is extremely rare. And now we're in a period of time where and this is where we've gone through over the last 15 years, extensive exploration when prices were high and companies were investing. So, even with all these investments, finding big new mines is really tough. And having these kinds of mines in our portfolio is going to prove very valuable 100% over time. We haven't had any big technology revolution in the copper mining business.","We've made progress with technology and so forth, but copper as a commodity is very tough to replace. We haven't seen any shale oil type developments in our business. In fact, we're seeing SX-EW opportunities dry up, new opportunities are low-grade sulfide opportunities which require lots of infrastructure in the development, mining a lot of material to get the copper like we're doing at Cerro Verde.","Now, what are we going to be doing in the meantime before we start reinvesting again, we're going to look for every opportunity we can to continue to reduce cost and increase production. One of these things and our challenge now, you see in our data we will have a fall off in production at Grasberg in 2018 as we make the transition from the pit to the underground at the Grasberg Block Cave. And so, we challenge ourselves to mitigate these production declines while we spend a minimal amount of capital. In the meantime, one of the things we are looking at is Pit Wall Design to optimize our slopes, to steepen pit angles to minimize stripping and add ore, and this can reduce cost as we add ore, and we're having a strict adherence to doing this in a safe way. But this is just one example of what we're doing to see if we can find ways of maximizing production safely, at a time when we're going to be making this transition and we'll be reporting to you on this as we go forward.","I mentioned, page 12, talks about Grasberg, we had to deal with labor grievances, it had to do with some bonus issues and some issues about management supervisor relationships with the workforce. We had a 10-day work stoppage in late September, but this had caused us issues relating to worker productivity for a longer period of time, and was a principal reason why we had a shortfall in our mining rate.","As I talked about earlier, this is a timing issue. The ore remains there, we're not seeing any questions about the grades in the ore or it's availability, and so, we've developed new plans which we've shared with you for how we will make up for this ore that we have failed to mine in the third quarter, and this carries over, because grades are increasing and so forth as we delay this, it has an impact on the fourth quarter. But, and it will extend by some period of time how long we'll be in the pit, it now goes into 2018. But we will mine this ore and the economic impact will not be significant.","We continue to have discussions with the government, there are two really key issues. One is an existing regulation in Indonesia that prohibits exports of ores and the government has defined copper concentrate as an ore, even though it's a commercial project \u2013 product, which captures more than 90% of the value of copper metal, but under their regulations, they call it an ore, existing regulations prohibit the export of ores beyond January of 2017. There is a recognition in government that this needs to be addressed and I believe it will be, and we're working actively with the Ministry of Energy and Mines and other government officials on this issue.","And then beyond that, the key issue for us is having the extension of our operating rights beyond the primary term of our existing contract, which extends to 2021. Under the terms of that contract, we're entitled to two 10-year extensions on the same terms as in the contract, and the government has agreed that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold approving that extension, but it hasn't been approved yet.","So, those are the two things that we're working with. There's been a lot of political changes in Indonesia that have affected this, but we have a \u2013 we're committed to having a good working relationship with the new Minister, the new Vice Minister and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and with the President and other government officials.","And so we are working amicably to address these issues. It's important for Indonesia as well as for us and particularly important for the province of Papua.","Page 13 shows our adjusted mining plan. We see the schematic of the pit in the underground Grasberg Block Cave, the existing underground production coming from the DOZ and the DMLZ mines. So we adjust this every quarter and you can see what our new outlook for copper and gold production is coming out of Grasberg, we give in the appendix longer-term projections, so you can see that.","Our outlook for 2016 now is for 4.8 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.26 million ounces of gold, and 73 million pounds of molybdenum. For the year, site cost net of by-product credits of $1.20, operating cash flows at $2.10 copper in the fourth quarter would be $3.6 billion, each $0.10 change in the fourth quarter of the delta of $150 million. And our CapEx for the year of $2.8 billion including over $1 billion for oil and gas which was actually a carryover from spending that was done in 2015.","Our sales profile going into 2017 is shown on slide 15. You can see both our copper production now this takes out Tenke and the incremental interest that we sold at Morenci to Sumitomo earlier in the year, but the gold carry over from lower volumes in 2016, into 2017 and into 2018.","Page 16 shows 2017 EBITDA and cash flows. This excludes all the oil and gas business, so essentially with the Deepwater and California sales, it excludes Tenke and it excludes the incremental interest at Morenci. And you can see EBITDA at $2 being just under $5 billion, $2.25 just under $6 billion, $2.50 million just under $7 billion. And operating cash flows of $2.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion within this range of copper prices. It excludes working capital changes, we expect a positive working capital impact in 2017.","Capital spending. You can see just how our efforts we undertook to cut capital is unfolding. I mentioned the $2.8 billion for 2016 falling to $1.7 billion in 2017. That's essentially the spending that we'll be doing developing the underground at Grasberg as well as the constrained sustaining capital for the rest of our business.","18 summarizes where we are with our debt structure. You can see at 9\/30, we had $19 billion of debt and $1.1 billion of cash pro forma for the asset sales transactions. But with no additional equity from the ATM offering, we would end the year with $3.3 billion in cash and our maturities for 2017 are $1.3 billion. So, we'll have ample cash to deal with our near term liquidity, and a good set of assets for dealing with our longer term balance sheet issues.","So, we talked at the beginning of the year about execution and we are continually focused on that, as I mentioned we're disappointed about the mining rate issues at Grasberg, but are working on that every day, we're working on securing our long-term rights in Indonesia every day. We feel good about our plans for debt reduction, building long-term value and safety in our business is a challenging part of it. We certainly had our challenges in the third quarter, but that is the first thing we talk about whenever we meet with our team and that overrides everything that we do.","So, thank you for bearing with me on this overview, and I look forward to your questions.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.","Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi good morning, Richard and everybody.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, let me ask on this, you had the mining rate issues this quarter, you had the labor stoppage, and the implication seems to be that the problems over the third quarter that you saw are going to hamper production in the fourth quarter, effectively pushing some of that back into next year. Can you clarify are you more constrained in what you can produce over fourth quarter, because of these lingering issues or is this move around out of any kind of conservatism?","I'm just trying to understand how much of the shift is you responding to conditions at the mine? And how much if any \u2013 is any market conditions positioning as you negotiate with the Indonesians, et cetera?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay. There is just a physical aspect to it. As we progress our mine plan at this stage, we get to higher grades as we go forward. So, the fact that we were not able to mine the material that we planned to mine in the third quarter, means it's just simply going to take longer to get to the higher grade material that we had originally planned to mine in the fourth quarter, and that gets pushed out. We can't do more to get to it quicker, because we're constrained by physical space.","So, our plan calls for us to do everything we could do all along, and when it gets pushed back, it gets pushed back over time physically. So, it's not a \u2013 it's really not a strategic or tactical decision, but it's a physical consequence of what we face now.","We know we've got to be diligent about keeping our equipment operating and available and so forth, because delays in that can have an impact in the future. We're working hard to address these issues of concern by our workers, we made some responsive steps to the issues they raised in terms of the bonus, in terms of the relationships between supervisors and the workers and that's an ongoing process that we'll have to work with, it's a complicated labor situation there in Papua with the nature of the workforce, and how it's changed over the years. All of this requires a lot of attention and a lot of work.","What it doesn't change is that high grade ore that's there. I mean that remains there and it's a question of getting to it as quickly as we can. We want to do it \u2013 safety is the first issue, but we're not trying to do any of this in terms of positioning with the Government of Indonesia. We want to operate in an efficient straightforward way, that's been our history, and that's going to be our future. While we're doing this, I might add that our work in underground development is going extraordinarily well, I mean, we're meeting our targets in terms of development and putting things in place. We're getting approvals from the government to do what we need to do, that's a big project, that just kind of gets out of the spotlight here, but it's in total over time a $15 billion investment project, and we're spending roughly a $1 billion a year, and that's the future for us, and our partner Rio Tinto as we move forward, so, as we're dealing with these important issues near term in the pit we're also giving keeping great focus on the underground development and it's going very well.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And Matt you can see on \u2013 this is Kathleen, on slide 12, we show the grades of both copper and gold in the open pit. And because of the variability in the grade, we'll be mining in the fourth quarter, material that previously had a higher grade. But because we got the behind in the third quarter, we'll be mining material that we thought we were going to mine in the third quarter that has a lower grade. But we do expect to get to all of it because the open pit will be transitioned to the underground in 2018. So, that, as Richard talked about, it is shifting now by a couple of months the access to the higher grade material, and that cascades into 2017 and 2018.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, Kathleen. I appreciate the clarity there. Let me follow-up with a question for you, if I could. Looking at the language in your filings, there is the springing collateral trigger, and if the $3 billion kind of threshold in asset sales isn't reached, you've been very clear expecting \u2013 in laying your expectations for things still moving for the fourth quarter. But in a bad outcome, let's say anything happens with Tenke, anything happens with Deepwater, what kind of collateral would we be talking about? What would be that actually look like numerically?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, the terms of our amendment that we did with the banks in the first quarter of this year have a springing collateral really for all of the assets. And so our plan was if we didn't get to the sales proceeds, the $3 billion, that we would sit down and discuss with the banks the nature of the collateral. But as it reads right now, it's basically all the assets. But we're very confident that we'll be able to meet that test. We've got three transactions. We've already completed a significant amount of proceeds already in the first part of the year. So, we're confident that we'll be able to meet that test and avoid the need to grant the collateral, that the springing collateral test that you referenced.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much, folks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And Matt, I'll just say, we have great relationships with our bank group. And this goes back for years of how we managed things historically after the Phelps Dodge deal, deleveraging that, how we managed the financial crisis in 2008\/2009, how we dealt with the situation following the oil and gas leverage, and so we work very well. We have a lot of credibility, and so we'll continue to work together to represent each other's interests on this.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions from me. Just following up on Grasberg. I'm thinking about that the transition period between the open pit and the underground. And so your latest mine plan, does that have the open pit finishing at around the end of 1Q 2018. Is that correct? And ...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","...that transition would be sort of 2Q 2018, and is the underground all on track for that?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The answer is yes. Mark Johnson is here. He can...","Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, the Grasberg Block Cave development has gone on without any interruption. We expect to have the ore flow system, which is one of the main systems for the Grasberg Block Cave to come online, that will be available to us at the end of 2017 well in advance of the start of the block cave. By the nature of the block cave mining is such that we will not initiate the cave, but we can do a lot of the preparation for the cave prior to the pit completing. As soon as the pit is complete, then we start a process of initiating the Block Cave and then that ramp up process will take place with the capacity coming online as we develop more draw points. So, it's on track. The Deep MLZ, we initiated the cave earlier this year, and that continues to advance, and we're well positioned for that mine to continue to grow in capacity. By the end of the year, we'll be at 10,000 tons a day. Coming out of the Deep MLZ by the end of 2017, that will be up to 25,000 tons a day. So both of these mines would be in a ramp-up process over the next five years to six years to get them up to full capacity.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","All right. Thanks. Thanks for the color. And then the last question from me, just on the SG&A, thinking about that going forward post the two transactions in the oil business: have you got any more updates on that or thoughts about how 2017 into 2018 might look?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes. We're going through that process now and obviously taking the steps to deal with the significant SG&A we had in the oil and gas business. But we're also continuing to look at our corporate G&A and so forth, and our overall target is to return this to levels that were in place before we did the oil and gas deal and try to find ways of reducing that.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. Thanks, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Hi, Richard, Kathleen, Red and Mark.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Hi, Tony.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. First of all, congratulations on all the progress so far. You've really been doing some tremendous things, so kudos. My question is I really wanted to drill down on Indonesia, and I was wondering, Richard, how would you describe the overall tenor of your negotiations with the government these days? Obviously there has been a lot of moving parts with the cabinet officials, et cetera?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Okay. And Tony, I know you're well aware of all this, but I just want to be clarifying. We haven't really been engaged in negotiations. We set a plan in the mid 2014 when we signed a memorandum of understanding about how to go forward, and that's when we agreed to pay higher royalties, to divest up to 30%, to develop the smelter in return for the government approving the extension of our contract beyond 2021 on the same fundamental terms as our existing contract and agreed to allow us to export.","So since that time, it's been more of a question of talking with the government about getting that approved as opposed to continuing negotiating terms. And that MOU was extended once in early 2015, and in October of 2015 we received a letter from the government, basically affirming all of that. And so there has been lots of political changes in Indonesia. But we haven't been engaged in negotiations. It's just been more of a question of working with them to put in place the agreement that we've previously reached.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess I'm trying to get at has there been \u2013 in your discussions has there been a change in the tone, or are they becoming a little bit more accommodative, do you think? And would it be your expectation that we could see tangible progress on the export situation? Obviously, you've got the license right now, but would your expectation be that the 2017 situation would be resolved maybe in advance and not having to go down to the wire again, or is that...?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, I went back and I read my \u2013 the transcript from last earnings call, and we talked then about need to getting the August extension of our export permit at the time. We got that. Now, we're faced \u2013 as these all have done, that's has gone down to the wire. Now, we're faced with this January 2017 broader issue. It's not just a question of getting a permit for our company, but it's a regulation that affects a number of industries. It's not just copper, but it affects other industries as well. And the tone has been a recognition by the government that that needs to be addressed.","How they address it is a matter of great interest for us. And as has been the case, there are a lot of different views expressed publicly by members of the DPR and certain members of the government, but we believe in our discussion, there is a recognition that this needs to be addressed and will be addressed. The discussions that we've had, the President has been very positive about the need for foreign investment and the need to treat existing investors well.","The Vice President recently made some comments along this line. We've had this \u2013 the situation of reshuffling of the cabinet and the unusual situation of \u2013 with respect to the minister and so we are just having to deal with all of that and we keep emphasizing with the government our history of investment, the fact that we're providing work for over 30,000 people in Papua, the benefits that our operations have provided, and will continue to provide to the government and the government's fiscal situation is such that that this is important and then moreover the role we play in Papua. We're over 90% of the economy in the region, in the region where we operate, a majority of the GNP in the province itself. So all of these things are things we talk about and have talked about from a long period of time, and that's what's going to lead to a positive resolution of this for us. But the timing of it Tony I...","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It will happen, but it may go to the wire.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. And then just the new mining law, while I understand the new mining law is being drafted and I would imagine the export ban is obviously part of that, that's going to be addressed. And would it also be conceivable to see the government has indicated that you got the 2021 expiration of the current CoW that you really wouldn't be able to negotiate that until two years before the end of that initial term. Would this conceivably be part of this new mining law that's being put together at the moment?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, there is actually \u2013 I can identify three principal ways for the government to deal with this. One is changing the mining law, as you point out. That's complicated the present law in 2009 took several years and it was very complicated to get negotiated. The government can deal with these issues also through changing regulations. The existing mining law has the flexibility of extending our contract of allowing exports and so forth without changing the law, but changing regulations, which is in the authority of the administration. There is also a process of where the president can issue executive orders called purviews (55:31). So, the government has alternatives of how to deal with this. It's going to be a challenge to get a new mining law done by early January considering what's happened to date. So we're just prepared to work with the government in whatever approach they decide to use.","The challenge of not addressing our contract until 2019 is, one, we are simply unable to invest in the smelter without having our long-term contract assured. I mean that's a huge investment, a significant investment. And we simply just can't do it without knowing that we will continue to operate beyond 2021. We've also agreed to divest an additional 20% which is a significant amount of value. And clearly we could not invest with having uncertainty about our position to operate beyond 2021. So offsetting this and that's a regulation, that's not in the law this two-year deal, is these things that resolution, there'll be pressures to have a resolution with that before 2019.","Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for all the color, Richard. I appreciate it.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. I still have a couple of follow-up questions on Grasberg. If the export ban is upheld as it currently stands, can you give us an idea of what percent of the concentrate would be unavailable to go to Gresik next year, i.e. could be impacted?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. It's a very large amount. I mean Gresik is no more than, could absorb no more than 40%, probably a little less than that. And as a practical matter, with today's copper prices \u2013 I think most of you know that we were surprised when the government put in place an export ban in January 2014, that lasted seven months.","We continued the total operation at that time, it ended up costing our company and the government. The government gets a bit more than 50% of the cash flows out of this operation, it cost each of us $1 billion during that timeframe.","Well. At today's copper prices, we simply could not continue our operations like we did in that timeframe. We would have to make very significant adjustments to employment and spending and so forth. So, it's just a very important issue for us.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","So, if the export ban stays in place, you'd reduce production pretty quickly?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","We would have no choice.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And in terms of the guidance for CapEx, I assume that 2017 guidance excludes any smelter spending. Is that correct?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It does not include smelter spending.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then in terms of your long range plans at Grasberg, it sounds like you're suggesting that you'll continue to spend the $1 billion a year, developing the underground even without the CoW extension. Is that the right way to think about it and it's really just the smelter that's, you're holding back on?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. That's correct. We've gone through several assessments over time, about whether to continue spending or not. We've done it on the basis of assurances that we've received from the government in the MOU and in the October 2015 letter, I mean that gave us assurances, which we've taken into account, as well as the negative aspects of suspending spending. To suspend spending would result in delays of the development that Mark Johnson went over in terms of having the Grasberg Block Cave ready to go onstream when we complete mining the pit, it would involve significant employment reductions and we operate in a very sensitive area in Papua that would have unknown consequences and putting a lot of people out of work. It would require dismantling our team that we have there and the time that would require to put that team back together. So, we've relied on the assurances from the government to keep that spending going.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","And if you decide that there is no resolution on the horizon and you do decide the pull back the spending, where would we see that in terms of the production profile like would it be 2018 or 2019 where we would see the impact?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No question. I mean if we don't have the Block Cave ready to start ramping up, it would have you just push that ramp up back. You can see the timing required to bring a new mine at Oyu Tolgoi upstream we would have that same ramp up issue that's just fundamental for Block Cave development. We can't start caving until we finish the pit.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Just got a couple of quick ones. Mainly on the \u2013 just on net debt. You guys obviously have flagged the $5.2 billion in gross proceeds. I just wanted to make sure I'm reading this right and that sort of includes the preferred dividend and if we take that out more like a $4.6 billion that you guys would expect to receive in Q4?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes. We would \u2013 we have a $582 million requirement, a redemption of a preferred at a subsidiary level that would net out of those proceeds.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that's obviously included in page 6 when you're talking about your net debt next year at different copper prices?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Correct.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. And then my last one is just obviously you also talked about you're about 25% of your upmarket equity offering, given the price that you guys have disclosed in your average share price. Is that something that we should sort of look forward in the next sort of six months that you guys would be more comfortable transacting?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It's just a question of one of the reasons that it attracted us to this kind of equity raise is that, we can time when we go in the market and not and so we executed it, we backed off and we expect over the next six months or more to be back in the market when the market is \u2013 when we feel better about doing it it's totally at our discretion.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And one more, so you guys obviously \u2013 the balance sheet is well on the way to where you want it to be. Does that mean that there's no more asset sales over the next 12 months?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, I think I was clear about that we like our assets that we have in our mining business and we would not expect to have sales there. We have some relatively minor oil and gas assets that we may find ways of doing transactions there, but no we're basically done with asset disposals.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Hi, everybody. Just a quick question on the copper sulfide opportunities. Is \u2013 would this essentially entail if you were to go ahead with these just a modification to the back-end of the plant and then laybacks on your current pits? Is it similar to what you did at Morenci? And then, what copper price do you think you would need to incentivize the development of these sulfide opportunities. And like, for example if your balance sheet were \u2013 if you had no net debt for example, would you even potentially proceed with some of these projects now?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","I think it would be unlikely to do it now...","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...because \u2013 I'll answer that, but it's just because we're at $2.10 copper and there's still significant questions near-term about where the global economy is going, where China is going. So, it's not just us. I mean, you're not seeing others doing new projects. Some are completing projects that they started sometime ago, so even if we had all the cash in the world, we wouldn't be pursuing these projects as we speak right now. Now, the development itself varies depending on the ore bodies. Let's take for example El Abra which has \u2013 and we didn't know about this when we acquired Phelps Dodge but subsequent exploration has shown an enormous, sulfide resource there and to-date, that operation has been an SX-EW operation...","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","... bauxite, sulfide. So this would be a Cerro Verde type project with a very large mill required. You would have a desalinization plant and the transport of water to more than 10,000 feet. So, it's a big capital project. At Lone Star, we have an existing operation there at Safford, and that would be done in stages of where we would have an oxide development, which would actually be stripping this down to a sulfide project which would require major mill investment. At Bagdad, we have a big sulfide resource, it would require a mill expansion, tailings expansion and investment in water access. So, everyone of these has its own story and there's trade-offs. Lots of advantages in the U.S. today that weren't there historically in terms of energy cost, labor, flexibility. And so it's really a matter of trade-offs, we're doing technical work, so that we'll be in a position of doing it, it would require long-term copper price of $3 or better to have us make these sorts of investments.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Okay, great. So it's a kind thing of where \u2013 we should just think of this as optionality. And when you do \u2013 when the copper price does eventually reach $3, you'll start potentially thinking about deploying the capital to exploit all the vast resources there.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Right. It's going to be an outlook. So we'll aggressively do steps to prepare ourselves because all of these are very long timeframes.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","We're a view of the industry, this is just not us. This is the way the copper industry is and so these delays in spending are going to match up with declining grades, depletion of existing production, and I am not saying this is this year or next year, but a looming shortfall...","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Right.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Is just, unless you see the world really turning upside down economically, it's clear that there is going to be a need for copper that's going to require a significant price increase to justify the spending, and that's why we feel very good about our long-term strategy.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Blunden with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to focus just briefly on the balance sheet, you've announced a lot of actions over the last couple of quarters. One thing that a lot of other mining companies have done is issue debt now that the markets are relatively favorable and extend their maturities. Is that something that you consider at all just to get a bit more cash on the balance sheet as you head into a time when in 2018, 2019 and 2020, you have quite a few maturities coming due.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, Karl we've really been focused on taking debt down. Once we achieve our debt level that we're targeting, we'll look to what makes sense in terms of any refinancing, but we've really have been focused on taking absolute debt levels down as opposed to refinancing existing debt, and that's really our priority is to reach these targets, which we're well on the way to. And then we'll look opportunistically as to whether we should take steps to expend out maturities, once we get to the targeted debt levels.","Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That makes sense.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The cost of our debt has changed significantly over the last six months to nine months too. So, that's been a factor, and we believe as we improve our balance sheet, we could well be able to do what you are suggesting at a lower cost.","Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. And, I think that makes sense. I think one other low cost option just kind of nearer-term is, as you look at to your credit facilities, I saw on page 18 and appreciate the clarity you provided there, that pro forma for the asset sales, it looks like it's your intention to pay down the bank term loan and the revolver as well and keep those paid down.","At some point in time, would that be kind of something that you'd consider going to, to get a bit more funding there? Presumably you can do it much more cheaply than in the kind of the open bond markets. And, do you think you could do that without having to provide a security to those lenders? So, in other words, could you get unsecured bank lending to kind of bridge you through this period while you're continuing to repair the balance sheet?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, the slide that we show repaying the full term loan is really just essentially math, the 50% of the proceeds being applied to the term loan. In terms of whether we could get unsecured bank debt today, I think that's a difficult question to answer. The banks are all under a lot of pressure in the sector about regulations, and I think they would be looking, for a new deal today, looking for security given the company's credit rating. But what we're working to do really is to improve the whole balance sheet and to allow banks and others, as they're looking at the company, to look at it as it is pro forma for all these transactions. And as we continue to de-risk the balance sheet, we think there are going to be additional options available to us to finance the company long-term, and that's what we're focused on.","Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay I appreciate that. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, everyone. Just wanted to ask a couple, one \u2013 one sort of more question on Grasberg, and then a bigger picture question to finish it out. Given where we were three months ago with the mine plan at Grasberg and where we are today, it seems like there is a lot of a shortfall. And I know that production stoppages for 10 days are sort of unforeseen. But it seems like you would have anticipated that the physical area of the bottom of the pit would be smaller and that the \u2013 it seems like the shortfall in production that you're anticipating is more than just unexpected stuff. So, my question is sort of what happened that you weren't expecting, and is there a chance that that could happen in 2017 as well?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well. I mean the \u2013 our talk about the physical constraints is to explain the consequence of these unexpected things happening. And so, we built all that into the plans that we went into the third quarter with. We absolutely knew that we had limited amounts of area, and we projected, based on our past experience, on equipment availability, and worker \u2013 workforce productivity, what we would achieve. Then we were faced with these issues related principally to the workers, and that had the consequence that it had. So, we took it into account. Yeah, we said we were 15% short of our mine rate. So, that's what it was, and it had a consequence of changing our production profile.","Do we have risk going forward? Yes. I mean, going forward, we will need to operate our equipment well. We've had a long history of doing that. We will have to deal with our workforce. We've been doing our utmost do that. But yeah, I mean that's always one of the risks of our business. We have a great history of meeting those risks, but it's particularly significant in terms of near-term cash flows because of the grades and physical situation in the Grasberg pit. But yes, it's a risk.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The -- normally and historically with Grasberg and other open pits, you'd be mining in multiple sections. So, you'd have a lot more flexibility to make up things. And here it's a very focused area, very high grade area. So even a small amount of downtime on a truck or a shovel can have more impactful variances than what you would have seen historically in another pit or historically at Grasberg.","So, but we're very confident that while we could have lifts in the volumes, we're very confident that over this period of time, relatively short period of time, we'll be able to access very significant volumes of both copper and gold. So it's not a question of day-by-day predictions or forecast. It's really looking over this period, and we feel very confident we'll be able to \u2013 we have the plans in place to obtain these volumes.","Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Something I'd like to add -- this is Mark Johnson -- is that, even though we've had some production delays or deferrals, a couple of things that we have accomplished is that the high walls of the mine are very robust. We implemented a very comprehensive final pit blasting, final wall blasting process, which is \u2013 will provide us possibly some upside on the feeding (76:18) the pits similar what Richard had shown on one of the slides. That can provide some upside as to the amount of metal we get from the pit.","We also put into place a pit de-watering system that essentially we're keeping the pit completely de-watered right now without pumping. And that's kind of unique within the mining industry. It's going to provide some opportunities for us. As we are in the pit bottom to have that water managed in the way that we have is going to provide some upside.","So one of the other aspects that we're dealing with is that the workforce is aware of the upcoming transition of the workers from the open pit to the underground. I think it's created a little bit of apprehension within the workforce, that we're working closely with the workers and the union to make sure that everybody understands that they're all going to have an opportunity elsewhere within our mining areas. We've got jobs opening up in the underground with some of the other logistics and levy construction. But that's one aspect too that we're dealing with is we've got about 1,600 people in the pit. We'll need about 600 people beyond the finishing of the pit mining for restoration effort for a number of years. So we're working very closely with the workers to explain what their future looks like within PTFI, but it's another aspect of some of the issues that we've had over the last couple of quarters.","Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So is that maybe some of the disparity between the mine plan from three months ago and this mine plan is that sort of more worker instability in the fourth quarter?","Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","We've \u2013 the Grasberg is quite a \u2013 we've been able to demonstrate the mining rates and what we looked at a lot is our sinking rate. How many push backs we mine in a year. I'd say, we've historically been very aggressive on that. We've had push backs where we do over 18 benches a year. We based a lot of our mine plans based on that ability, which takes into account the limited mining space, and we're looking at somewhere to 15 benches to 16 benches as we complete the pit, 15 benches to 16 benches a year. So that's something that we've been able to do before that accounts for space and equipment sequencing. We feel comfortable, we did make some adjustments to our mining rates in the fourth quarter. Our previous forecast had slightly higher mining rates. We're currently projecting that for the remainder of the quarter that we're going to do in the order of 180,000 tons a day. We feel comfortable with that plan. We have some things that we'll manage on a day-to-day basis. We're working closely with our supervisors on communication plans with the workers. So, it's \u2013 there is multi-elements of how we are approaching the productivity issues in the pit.","We've also brought some resources from Red's team over there, we've got a group of guys there now that are helping us just look at sequencing and making sure that the pit blasting is going on as scheduled. So, we're throwing a lot of resources at it and we understand the importance of it.","We are, like I said, focused on the quality of mining. We want to ensure that everything we're doing doesn't limit our ability to complete the pit in a safe and efficient manner, we are one of the deepest pits in the world, very steep high walls. We've been able to manage that well and we're continuing to focus on that also.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, let me just summarize this. We have to execute these plans, and that's what we're working to do. We have to execute these plans, if we don't execute these plans, some of the ore gets deferred. It's not a big economic issue, because the ore is there and we'll get it over time. But, we have to execute the plans to meet these numbers. We give you our best outlook on what we're doing, and now we've got to go try to do it. If we don't do it, it just means, we'll mine it over time. So, you said you had one last question, Matthew.","Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. So, sort of you touched on the sulfide expansion opportunities earlier, I'm just wondering longer term after sort of that, the really high gold years at Grasberg and longer term down the road when you give it more economics to Rio Tinto in 2021, what's the sort \u2013 can you maybe rank your sort of best expansion opportunities to get copper back up to 4 billion a year sort of longer term, whether it's the sulfide expansions or some new development project or even some M&A down the road?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, the M&A down the road is just going to depend on circumstances as we go forward and that's always out there. We're not counting on that but we'll be in the marketplace and see what it is. So \u2013 but, really it's the sulfide projects and how we time them, how we go after it. We have \u2013 we talk about 4 billion pounds, 5 billion pounds a year, we've got 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves, we've got more than a 100 billion pounds of resources in addition to that, so we've got a huge set of resources to work on to plan. And so we've got opportunities for long-term growth in this business as far as you can see.","Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Richard, I have one last question. Do you have a cameo in the upcoming Matthew McConaughey movie?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, I am interested to see it because I was certainly living it all and we'll just have to wait and see. They haven't signed a release for me, so I don't know, but I will say in listening to Mark, I made my first trip to Grasberg as they were drilling the second drill hole out there in early 1988, and so I've lived through this great ore body and what our team has done over the years and I'm amazed every time I go out there. In the early years, when we'd fall short we always had another place to go mine to make it up. And so we had all, a lot of these same issues but we just had a lot more flexibility. Now that flexibility is gone and that's why we're dealing with these quarter-to-quarter issues that we have. So....","Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. Well, thank you very much for the update.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slide materials for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today, Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger, who heads up our Americas business; Mark Johnson, who oversees our Indonesian operations; Mike Kendrick, who heads up our molybdenum business. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook using the slide materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $869 million or $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2018. Excluding net credits of $16 million recorded in the quarter or $0.01 per share, our adjusted net income totaled $853 million or $0.58 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was just above $2.1 billion, and we've got a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculations on page 29 of our slide materials.","We sold copper in the quarter of 989 million pounds, our gold volumes were 676,000 ounces and molybdenum sales totaled 24 million pounds. They were higher than our estimates in terms of copper that primarily reflected higher mining and milling rates and higher ore grades in Indonesia. Gold sales were slightly lower than our estimate, primarily because of quarter end timing of shipments in Indonesia, but they were substantially higher than the 2017 sales of 432,000 ounces, reflecting the high grades of ore that we're mining at Grasberg.","At the second quarter 2018, average realized price for copper was $3.08 per pound. That was 16% above the year ago quarter average price. And gold prices averaged $1,274 per ounce. Those were also above the year ago period average price of $1,243 per ounce. Our average net unit cash costs for the quarter, and that's net of byproduct credits on a consolidated basis, was $0.96 per pound of copper for the quarter. That reflected strong performance from our global operations and continued focus on productivity and cost management.","During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flows. Those were cash flows net of taxes, net of interest costs. And those exceeded our capital expenditures, which were just below $500 million. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter. Our consolidated cash totaled $3.9 billion at June 30 and our consolidated debt totaled $11.1 billion. That total debt number is down $2 billion since the start of the year.","Net debt at June 30, approximately $7.3 billion, and that was over $1 billion less than at the beginning of the year. As you saw in the first quarter, our board reinstated a cash dividend on common stock and we declared a dividend of $0.05 per share under this new policy that will be paid on August 1.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our results and outlook and referring to the slide presentation materials on our website.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I'm briefly going to go through this overview material and then address your questions. The positive second quarter results that Kathleen referred to reflected our team's focus on productivity, cost management, capital discipline, well ahead of last year's quarter when we were affected by regulatory issues from the government on exports and labor issues, but we basically met our targets. We would have exceeded them, but for some weather delays and shipping concentrate out of PT-FI, which happens to us from time to time. Kathleen noted our positive debt reduction activities. You may recall that 18 months ago, we set a target to reduce our $20 billion plus debt at that time by $5 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2018 and now, we're at $7.3 billion.","We previously announced this Heads of Agreement that we've entered into with the state-owned company in Indonesia, Inalum, and Rio Tinto on July 12, which establishes a way forward to resolve our issues related to the long-term stability of operations in Indonesia. And we're going to talk about the advancement we're making with our Lone Star project here in Arizona.","First, couple of comments about copper markets. Sentiment in mid-June turned significantly negative for commodities including copper, all tied into this trade issues that we're dealing with internationally now. Copper is down 14% since June 15 after rising, many other commodities are also down. As we sit here today, there is an anomaly between market sentiment and fundamentals in the marketplace. We're continuing to see real demand being very positive for our global business, including our business in China. The physical markets are broadly balanced globally. Exchange stocks are actually down since mid-June, and supply growth continues to be muted.","Wood Mackenzie said today's copper price is 15% below the real price that's needed from an incentive basis to develop new production, so we're likely continue to see underinvestment continuing, which this continues to build this long, mid-term positive outlook for copper. And increasingly, it's clear that future copper demand is going to benefit significantly from the development of renewable energy projects being undertaken all around the world and the development of electric vehicles.","All of this is in a context of declining ore grades from producing mines and a real lack of actionable projects expected to be contained in the \u2013 for future supply. So absent having some sort of global recession or major setback in China, market deficits in the copper appear to be inevitable. And I'll just make a quick note on China's actions in the last few days to loosen its fiscal situation in this country to continue to support continued investment.","We don't do this very often, but I'm going to give a call out to Wood Mackenzie on their June 2018 report. It is excellent. I mean it sounds like I'm talking in an echo chamber when I read this thing, so I refer that to you and just answer any questions that I might be able to offer to any questions you might have.","We previously announced this Heads of Agreement on July 12. It points to a new long-term positive partnership between our company and the government of Indonesia and that's a long time coming. It does not represent a final resolution in that we have to have a consummation of a series of agreements. But all of this is envisioned by the agreements, understandings that we've reached in the Heads of Agreement. From our standpoint, it would achieve our long-term, our goal for long-term stability for our Grasberg operations with stabilized fiscal and legal terms that would be legally enforceable, and importantly with the way this thing has developed over the past year, this structure allows us as FCX to retain our current existing economics. It preserves our share of cash flows and our net asset values, is not diluted to FCX shareholders. You may recall last August, we were looking at a situation where we're going to have to divest a significant part of our interest with Rio Tinto's decision to exit. This allows us to avoid that, and it will allow us to continue to manage the operations.","This is something that I'm really looking forward to. It would create a strong alignment of interest between the Indonesian government, through this state-owned enterprise, Inalum, the local governments in Papua, and our company. So going forward, we'd all be working together. Now what does that mean? Regulatory issues are likely to be much less of a barrier, issues dealing with local communities are likely to improve, issues related to security, to regulatory changes, to all the things that have been distractions, sometimes barriers to us, and it would be positive for all the parties. We're working on definitive agreements. We'll say expect it to close in the second half of 2018. Indonesian government officials are talking about a quicker closing.","Our operations were really exceptional. Our team in Papua has just done a great job in dealing with all the issues there. Our mill rate was 188,000 tons per day with plus 1% copper and 1.77% gold which shows you the quality of this ore body. We are \u2013 while we're continuing the construction of this underground infrastructure to allow us to move forward beyond the Grasberg open pit, we've had really strong reduction, the second quarter unit net cash cost was a negative $0.77. That means the gold component of our concentrate more than funded our total operating cost and we paid $1.6 billion \u2013 PT-FI paid $1.6 billion of dividend.","Now, we have some mine plan adjustments that are reflected in the numbers we'll be talking about. Part of this has to do with our efforts to deal with the seismic events in our Deep MLZ mine, which we commenced last year. We've run into some harder, more competent rock there that's led to these mining into seismic events. We're being very cautious with these about safety, and so we're undertaking a remedial program to be able to mine this resource in a safe way. And our current plan calls for us, and we're underway with this right now, to drill holes to allow us to use water to frac this competent material, which our plan indicates would lead to the initiation of caving in a normal way. It's going to take some time, and so we have reflected that in our plans. But we've got a global team working with us. We're confident this will be done. It's been done in South America successfully. And so it's not affecting the resource itself. It's just a question of starting it up and ramping it up.","In light of that, we undertook a study of our open pit operations and we're announcing today that we're going to extend operations from the open pit through the first half of next year 2019, attractive economics and allows us to accelerate production that otherwise would have gone through the Grasberg Block Cave. I want to make sure that everyone understands that this Deep MLZ mine is a separate mine from the Grasberg Block Cave. The Grasberg Block Cave is an extension of the same ore body we've been mining from the surface that we now will be mining underground in block cave. We know that ore body very well and its rock characteristics are similar to what we've dealt with in the open pit and will not be the same as this competent rock we're operating with the Deep MLZ mine.","The Deep MLZ mine is an extension of underground mineralization that we started mining into, and there's a schematic on page 23, that we began mining in the early 1980s actually, but now it's at significant depth. The Deep MLZ mine is at 1,500 meters to 1,800 meters underground. The Grasberg Block Cave is 300 meters to 400 meters underground because of the pit being taken out of it. And we just run into some harder rock. It's going to take us longer to ramp it up.","Think of it this way. We're basically completing a mine, Grasberg open pit, and now we're starting like a new development with the underground ore bodies that we have at the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave. Over a five-year period, the amount of copper and gold that we'll recover is virtually the same, but it will delay the start-up of the Deep MLZ. The bulk of the capital will be spent in developing new infrastructure during this time period, and so this is where we are on page 7. You see that we will have a transition years in 2019 and 2020, and ramp up beginning at the end of 2020, so that by 2022, we would be in full production from our underground mining system with over 200,000 tons a day through the mill.","Volumes are high this year as we complete mining in the open pit going into next year. And after transition years by 2022, we will be up to sustainable rates that would last through 2041 with little capital to be spent on infrastructure development, and the only capital then would be in the ongoing development of the underground caves.","Now, we're going to be talking more in the future about the resources that our company has available to it outside Indonesia. Understandably, investor focus has been on the issues in Indonesia because of the size of that asset and the situation we've had with the government. But we want to make sure everyone understands just how great this company has in resources in the Americas, and the level of profitable production we're having now, and also the future that we have for our development in North America and South America.","We are currently engaged as we've previously talked about in developing a oxide resource at the Lone Star deposit, adjacent to our Safford mining infrastructure and very near our big Morenci mine in Eastern Arizona. We have 4.4 billion pounds of copper reserves, only oxide. We're spending capital over time that will aggregate $850 million. We commenced pre-stripping earlier this year and this stripping is going to provide us exposure to a very large sulfide deposit that lies underneath this oxide deposit, very low execution risk. It's basically almost like strip mining, stripping of a resource, but it's going to be profitable and that oxide ore can be taken to our facilities that are in existence and underutilized at Safford and we'll make money out of it as you can see on page 8.","Now, we have continued to drill the sulfide resource underneath this oxide deposit that we're developing. We have six rigs going there now. You can see the results of core holes that we had during the second quarter. And this is very attractive mineralization for this area and for North America in general. This resource continues to get larger. It has the potential over time of becoming another Morenci. I don't say that with anything other than seriousness and we are very excited about this. It will take time to get to it, but in terms of looking at what's ahead for our company to have this opportunity right in the midst of our existing operations in Arizona with a favorable regulatory environment that we have here in our established positive relationships with the local communities and the Native American community, this is a real positive for our company.","Outside of Lone Star in North America at Bagdad our Chino\/Cobre operations in New Mexico. The Morenci mine itself and at Sierrita, we have significant undeveloped resources and we're evaluating those for future development. In South America, we're focused on a tremendous opportunity we have with our partner, Codelco, at our El Abra mine where we have again a very large sulfide resource to look at. We have this large footprint at Cerro Verde. In our meeting last week, you guys gave me an exciting piece of core from Cerro Verde as we do in drilling there. We're studying this now. We have no plans to commence a major project in the current environment, but we're preparing for that and we have a very large portfolio within the company with many options to consider what's going to be our future steps for expanding the company's resources.","Turning to Slide 11. Our sales outlook for copper, gold, molybdenum are unchanged. Our unit cost are essentially in order in line with what we had predicted earlier, what we forecast earlier, and our operating cash flows at $2.75 copper would be $4.3 billion if we meet our plan. Obviously, this is affected by what we reported last quarter at $3.15 copper. We're very levered. I mean that leverage goes both ways. It's for each $0.10 change in copper price for the remainder of this year to $185 million of operating cash flow to this. Capital expenditures are unchanged.","Page 12 shows our profile for our copper and gold sales. For the year, you can see, 2019 will be a transition year as will 2020. And at the end of that, our plans call for us to be in full productive mode as we go forward.","Page 13 shows the EBITDA and cash flow slide that we show each year. We've done something a little different each quarter. We've done something a little different this quarter. In the first block, we show what those numbers, EBITDA and cash flow numbers, would be at different copper prices, ranging from $3 to $3.50. That's in line with the current forward sales prices, and showing what the average would be for 2019 and 2020. And then showing what the average would be as we transition to the ramp up of our underground mines in 2021 and 2022, and you can see the significant difference that that makes. But we want to make sure you saw the full range of this at varying copper prices and $1,250 gold and $11 molybdenum.","Capital expenditures are shown on the left, slide 14. They are not changed from previous quarter. Our financial policy is still focused on strengthening our balance sheet. As I mentioned, we've made significant \u2013 more than significant progress over the past 18 months. And we believe we'll be in positive markets going forward and we continue to improve our balance sheet. We have a disciplined approach to invest in attractive growth projects. We're going to be driven by value. I mean we're not growing just for the sake of growing. That makes no sense. But we have the chance to invest over time in a way that will add value to our company.","These resources receive very little value in today's stock prices. As we are successful in finding ways to invest in a disciplined way in low cost expansion projects, that's going to create cash flows and values for our company. We really have a strong team to execute this strategy. We're focused on all aspects of the copper business. And our team has proven itself throughout the world in being able to develop and operate resources in challenging circumstances across the breadth of investments and operations in the copper business.","We're going to be driven by returns to shareholder. Our board and management team is totally focused on creating value for shareholders, and I want to emphasize this, in a disciplined way. The industry has learned a lot of lessons in recent years and that discipline extends across the industry, and all of that does is add for more support for future supplies.","So we reinstated a dividend. We expect to be in a position over time to increase that dividend. We have to see what these trade issues mean for the world's economy. My hope and the hope, I think, of a lot of people throughout American industry is that it's a strategy to deal with specific issues and it doesn't result in an all-out trade wars that results in serious implications to the economy, but we have to see what happens with that. It's uncertain. We view this financial policy at every board meeting.","There's a number of reference slides here that are available for your future review. We may use some of them in answering questions. But with that, Regina, I'd like to turn the call over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Hey, Matthew.","Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs","So we noticed in the guidance changes here in Grasberg, we noticed a little bit of a pushback tilting away from 2021 or from 2019 and 2020, a little bit towards 2022. Is that largely DMLZ? Are there other challenges? Is this essentially tied to the slide 7, where you look through and you're showing us the changes in the ore milled per day? How does that all fit together?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It's Deep MLZ. I mean, if you go back for several years now, we've been developing this Deep MLZ with the expectation that it would be ramping up actually in 2016, 2017, and it has very high grades available to us. And as we got into mining that ore body, we encountered unexpectedly harder rock than we had experienced as we've mined the same ore mineralization area for years. And the original mine, Mark, was the GBT and the Intermediate Ore Zone, the Deep Ore Zone, and now the Deep MLZ. We got the Deep MLZ. It's much further underground and the rock is harder, and we started running into these seismic events, which happen other places in the industry. It causes us to be cautious.","We've got a plan now to use water to frac this ore body to prepare it for caving. And so that whole thing is driven by that one factor. Everything else is going fine, everything else. But as we saw this being pushed out now to 2021, as always, we start looking at ways to mitigate that. And we found a step to mitigate that by extending the life of the Grasberg open pit, mining some very high-grade ore into the first half of next year, and what you see is the net effect of that. A deferral of the Deep MLZ and a continuation of mining from the open pit and the numbers you see are the net of those two. And I want to just keep coming back and emphasizing this because I read articles in the press as we all do and we want to make sure that people understand that this is a different rock environment, different rock characteristics than the rock it will be mining in the Grasberg Block Cave. As I said, that's just an extension of the same ore body that we've been mining since the early 1990s and we've drilled, Mark, thousands of holes into it?","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And so we really understand that and don't expect this problem that we have in the Deep MLZ to be experienced in the Grasberg Block Cave.","Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs","Got it. I appreciate the clarity because we saw, when you listed your near-term objectives there in the block cave over the next year, all that seemed like that had held in place. Let me ask you...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, I just...","Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Let me just mention one thing. We've had a series of milestones in the development of Grasberg Block Cave including this week. This week for the first time we've delivered ore from that block cave through our ore delivery system that is using a train system, first time we've done that and we've actually this week delivered ore from the block cave to the mill. So through all of this stuff with export bans and negotiations with the government and all these other things, this team has just been relentless in developing this infrastructure and has achieved milestone after milestone. So we're ready to go. And like I said, it's like finishing up. It happens to be mined in the same mineral district. But this is like totally finishing up one mine and starting up a new one. And that ramp up is just like people face in starting up new mines in Mongolia or in Arizona or anywhere else. So it's \u2013 you need to think of it in that context.","Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs","All right. Got it. That's very clear. Let me then ask in context of all that's been negotiated with the Indonesian government, still needs to be finalized, how does this work with the aim to maintain the cash flows through and over the next five-year period as they were under the existing JV. For example, if there's more issue with the Deep MLZ, you're still working through, you're still developing the mine plan. If there's more slippage and some of these mined areas that are part of the plan you don't get to until 2023, is there a risk that you would lose some of that attributable copper or would it still be based on, no, we're not in the mining sections yet in which the additional stream under the JV would activate if that makes sense?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Matthew, this is Kathleen. The economics of the Rio Tinto deal, joint venture will carry forward under the new structure. So there's a certain quantity of metal as you know that is 100% for PT-FI's interest and then the increment produced above that is shared 60-40 between PT-FI and Rio Tinto. And so that would continue that PT-FI, the existing shareholders of PT-FI would continue to have the 100% of specific volumes whenever they're produced. And currently that's expected to be produced by the end of 2022. So we're not expecting a change in this new structure and we're working with our new partner to make sure that those cash flows go to the existing PT-FI shareholders. And then the new shares that they'll get, they'll have 40% after a certain period of time.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So let me \u2013 thanks, Kathleen. Let me tell you how we're doing that. With Rio Tinto, there was a joint venture that was going to continue 2041. Rio Tinto never owned shares in PT-FI, never talked about owning shares in PT-FI. The government wants to own shares in PT-FI. And so in a step to cooperating with the government achieving its interest, we agree to convert that to 2041 \u2013 I mean to shares, but there would be a dividend agreement that we will receive dividends with respect to those shares until this Rio Tinto cutoff date would have been reached.","Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks very much, folks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everybody.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Hey, Lucas.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","I wanted to follow-up a little bit more. I know you spoke about this both in your prepared remarks and just in the previous question, but can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what's driving the increase in 2022 from that $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion on the gold side?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","It's just the \u2013 it's the ramp up. It's the ramp up and whether that ramp up was going to start earlier, it's going to start now. It's very high grades of copper and gold in this Deep MLZ, and so we just shifted the ramp up time. It's nothing more than that.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","And then so \u2013 but can you explain to me what's driving the specific, the increase from 2022 out, should it continue to operate at this higher level or is it really kind of a one-year balance in 2022?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, we show a five-year estimate on that ramp up slide, so you can see what the next five years look like on an aggregate basis, and you can see it's pretty similar. In 2022, we reached 103,000 tons a day average for the Grasberg Block Cave. That'll increase to the 130,000 ton to 160,000 ton range. So the Grasberg Block Cave will become the largest part of our production profile after that. But really what you're seeing in terms of this shift to 2022 has to do with what Richard just said that we have higher grades at Deep MLZ earlier on and those have been shifted from 2020 to 2021, 2022 and then Grasberg Block Cave kicks in and will start increasing. That's why you see on a five-year average after 2022, it remains very similar.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","But in the aggregate, there's not any spike here. There is not a spike here like you suggested. We build up to full production level, 200,000 plus tons through the mill that essentially extends through 2041 and with very high grades of copper and gold and all of this will now be within PT-FI. We'll have 50% of the shares of PT-FI. So half of it is ours, half of it is government.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe one more follow-up. When I look at the transition year 2019 3.3 billion pounds and then that kind of ramping up, on an average 2020 through 2022, to 4 billion pounds, could you maybe disaggregate a little bit, I know you break down the Grasberg production in greater detail in the later slides of the presentation, but from an aggregate production level, would it be possible to break down 2020, 2021 and 2022 in a little bit more detail.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","2021 and 2022 are similar, and this is PT-FI, this is FCX consolidated under the current scheme at about 4.2 billion pounds and 2021 at this stage, I mean 2020 at this stage is 3.5 billion pounds.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it. I very much appreciate it and best of luck. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So just to give you a quick flavor on that. The Deep MLZ in 2020 should be around 300 million pounds of copper and more than doubling that the next two years, the Grasberg Block Cave would be 200 million pounds in 2020, and by 2022, it would be over 800 million pounds. So that's the \u2013 we got two ramp ups going here...","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","...with the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave which is going to be the cornerstone of our future.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, good morning and thanks for the call. My question is also around the Deep MLZ, the hydraulic fracking technique. Is this something that Freeport is currently familiar with? I know a couple of other mines, block caves that are doing the hydraulic fracking, but I wasn't sure if it's something that you're already doing at Grasberg? And then the second part of the question, if I may, how confident are you that this is going to resolve the seismic issues and I guess how concerned are you overall about the Deep MLZ and the risk that there is a significant problem there rather than a minor problem? Thanks.","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","This is Mark Johnson. As far as the hydro fracking, it's not something that we've ever applied to an ore body before. We've had the equipment for, since the end of 2017. In the first half of the year, we've been doing testing that was required to calibrate the density of drilling that we would need. So we've had a period of time where we've gotten familiar with the equipment, the geologic setting. Our drill crews have been trained and we've had vendors and we've met with various consultants. We also collaborated with others in the industry that have been using it for some time. So we feel very confident that we have the crews, the equipment, and understanding of the geologic setting, and the density in which we need to drill it.","So it's new to us. It's not new to the industry. Codelco has used it. Newcrest has used it, and it's been very effective in their setting. The consultants that have worked with Newcrest and Codelco are the same consultants that are working with us. So we have a high level of confidence in their judgment and their guidance, the modeling that they're doing on how it's going to affect and allow us to advance the cave and the Deep MLZ. To us, it's not a matter of if the Deep MLZ is going to cave, it's how do we cave it safely, how do we cave it in a controlled manner, and that's essentially what we're doing. We still have some unknowns. As we drill these holes, we'll be starting, as Richard mentioned, we've already started drilling wells. We'll begin fracking within the next couple weeks and it's not really a very complicated technology. It's fairly simple equipment. It's high pressure pumps. It's packing. It's been used in the \u2013 it's a much different type of application in the oil industry, but from a pumping standpoint, it's not that different. So we feel very confident that we're taking the right next step.","And as Kathleen mentioned, we've given ourselves some time. We've built in some contingency in our schedule for some of the unknowns. And I'd say that three months from now, we'll be able to give you much more accurate estimate as to how that cave is going to start up.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So our company's had experience with fracking and oil and gas business and so we spent a lot of time talking about the differences. This is fracking over a much narrower area and so forth and is so much simpler. But a lot of that fracking technology is \u2013 has been developed extensively in the oil business. So I think Mark's point was it's not a question of if, it's a question of when, safely.","Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Mark and Richard, very helpful.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Two questions. First of all, I was wondering your revised mine plan here for Grasberg, I mean how aggressive do you think this ramp-up schedule is now when I look at the ore milled in terms of throughput? And I'm just curious if you see potential more downside risk to that in terms of the level of the ramp up, where your comfort level is? And then the second question just had to do with Richard's comments in the press release about the company willing to adjust \"your plans\" if necessary to respond to market conditions. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate about what you mean by that and whether that implies potential production cuts or what in terms of \u2013 if copper prices weaken? Thank you.","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","This is Mark again. As far as the ramp up of the GBC, we feel very confident of the geologic setting, what we call the hydraulic radius, that's required for us to cave. The Grasberg Block Cave is very similar to what it was in the DOZ. It's around a number of 30. We feel that we took a central estimate on our ramping up of the GBC. We've got much better access to the ore body. We have a lot more flexibility than we had in the DOZ. We feel very confident in the ramp up and that there's, like I said, a central estimate. There's, obviously, some downside and we also see some balancing upside. So that is a much different, it's much similar to what we've seen in the previous caves, in the Deep MLZ, IOZ area.","The one thing that we have to manage there, and we've got a very good start on, is the managing of the water going from the pit to the underground. And we've got extensive efforts there to ensure that we don't build up any inventory of water before we start the block cave. Having access in the pit, we've got extensive monitoring much more than we've ever had in the past. And I just believe our caving knowledge as a result of some of the issues that we've had in the Deep MLZ that we've learned a lot globally on how to cave. It's also lent itself to more confidence and more robust GBC plan.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Sorry. Does that imply that you expect to reach full kind of nameplate throughput in 2023 based on the 2022 level?","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. We'll be ramping up, obviously, from zero, starting at the beginning of 2019. We have essentially two DOZ-sized mines that we're establishing in the Grasberg. And we're going to be ramping those up to 130,000 tons, 140,000 tons level in that timeframe up to 2022, 2023. Grasberg by itself will be in the 130,000-plus range.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, in terms of...","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So, Orest, that comment was kind of stating the obvious. I mean, here we've \u2013 mid-June for the past month, we've seen the price of copper go from $3.20, $3.25 to $2.75 and we got all these uncertainties overhanging the world's economy because of the trade talk and the trade actions. And we're showing operating cost numbers that are based on this current situation and we really haven't taken the steps that we would take if the global economy gets disrupted or China turns down. We've got a great track record. All you have to do is look back at what we did in 2008, 2009 and then what we did again in 2014. We have the flexibility to adjust to a lower price environment if we have to. A lot of our input costs are correlated to the price of copper.","So we just want to make sure the obvious was there. We're not locked into this cost structure. If prices deteriorate, we have and would again adjust our operations to make sure that all of our mines are cash flow positive. We would defer expenditures. We would adjust operating cost as well as deferring capital expenditures and we'd hunker down again, for a period of time, and our company would continue to be cash flow positive.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Great. Appreciate the color.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And that's strictly a contingency plan.","Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Please go ahead.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Hello, Oscar.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Sure. Just getting verification (00:47:59) on Mark's last statement in terms of reaching the Grasberg Block Caving capacity of 140,000 tons, was that 2022 or 2023?","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","2023, and our current plans were at 130,000 tons.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And we have a potential of going up to 160,000 tons.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. So the nominal capacity of the mill is 240,000 tons per day, so is that still the case or are you running that a little bit higher or could you?","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. Well, as it's shown there in that one slide that Kathleen referred to...","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","215,000 tons.","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","... we're 215,000 tons in 2022. Between now and then, we put about $300 million of capital into the mill. One of the things that we have to do is add additional horsepower into the mill to get up to that capacity. One of the benefits that we lose when we move away from the Grasberg pit is that we currently drop the rock down, these 600-meter high ore passes. That has an impact on breaking the rock. We essentially fill that capacity up by adding more horsepower in the mill, but we do have plans in place of what would be required to get the mill back up to a 240,000 tons based on the rock types that we'll be mining in the future, the grinding capacity that we would need to get the recoveries. And that's all part of our long-term mill expansion plan.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then, if you could \u2013 like, I mean, it seems like there's still a lot of really good grade on the Grasberg open pit. If I remember correctly, you said that once the block caving starts, then you cannot have access to that. So would it be possible to just mine some of that 2% copper equivalent grade at a later date or is this something that is just going to be left there for eternity?","Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","No, it's the \u2013 what we leave behind in the pit gets picked up very quickly in the block cave. I wish it was as easy, and what we're doing with this pit extension is about two-thirds our way down the pit along the ramp, we have the opportunity to re-mine the lower portion of that ramp. It's a relatively minor volume. It's about 5 million tons, but a very good grade, and it makes an impact, as Richard mentioned, this pit extension. We've had further modeling from our geotechnical experts that indicate that we can have six months of concurrent block cave development along with this re-mining of the ramp. We have some additional opportunity, if for whatever reason that the interaction didn't happen as quickly. We have some capability of continuing on for several months, but it's not a long-term pit extension. We would have to really go up to the top, mine through extensive waste stripping. That's a much bigger multi-year commitment. That's not what we're embarking on right here. It's relatively simple, relatively straightforward, the re-mining of a ramp.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That just wouldn't be economic. I mean we've known that since the 1990s to continue to widen and deal with it. Mark, correct me, but, Oscar, it's not you leave that there forever. That ore is going to cave into the block cave, it's just going to be diluted with lower grade material.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Lower grade, yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So from the pit, we can get directly to the access. All that ore is going to come down, get mined, but it's going to be mixed with lower grade material and ultimately processed.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","I think regardless, it's pretty impressive, guys.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Right. And Oscar, also we want to just keep in mind, even though we're talking about these transition years at Grasberg, we're still going to have very low cost. Grasberg will continue to be a low cost mine in the portfolio even during the transition years and then getting to 2021, 2022. By 2022, we're back into a net credit position from a unit cost standpoint. So even during the transition years given the high grades of copper and gold in the ore that we're mining, our net cost will still be our lowest cost and then we'll have significant improvements as we get to 2021 and 2022 with the volume increase.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","And while I've made a comparison to completing one mine and starting another, Mark just said something, we're going to be able to develop these new mines by investing $300 million in the mill. And you all know how much new mills cost these days. So we're going to benefit from all this infrastructure that's been developed since going way back, but especially during the 1990s to be able to achieve these levels of volumes.","Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much guys and good luck.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Thanks, Oscar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, Richard. Thank you for taking my question.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Sure, Chris.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","If we look at your unit production costs in North America, South America and Indonesia, the production delivery costs in North America have been steadily and somewhat materially increasing. I think over the last year, unit costs were up around 30%, whereas in South America, they've been more flat, and Indonesia has been pretty good as well. So the first question is, why have you experienced this pretty significant steady cost inflation in the U.S.?","And then the second question is, how should we expect that to trend over time? Where do these assets sit in the cost curve in five years' time? Obviously, if the Grasberg Indonesia deals get done, you'll be relatively less exposed to the Indonesian asset and more exposed to the North American and South American assets. I think they'll become more of a focus, just trying to understand the competitive positioning in those assets, longer-term. That would be my first question. Thanks.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","The \u2013 Red can add to this. But the big change we've had in North America has been more driven by ore grades changes during that period that you referenced and also an increase in our mining rates. During the downturn, we did take steps to park trucks and do what we could to reduce costs as much as possible and mine different shapes. Now we're mining more in a sustainable sequence. We're not showing in our numbers any step change in North American costs from where we are now. We have experienced here in recent months some inflation dealing with energy prices, freight cost, sulfuric acid cost. But in terms of the big change, that was more volume ore grade related and an increase in our mining costs to give us a sustainable level of future production and ensure capacity going forward. But if you project out our cash costs leaving commodity inputs flat today, we're not showing any significant changes in our North American cash costs from where we are now.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, one other thing I would add, North America is very sensitive to moly prices, so movements in moly prices change North America quite a bit as well.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Right, yeah, I guess I was looking more at the production delivery cost before netting out to byproducts and I know that part of the reason for that cost inflation obviously lower grades also higher input costs, higher copper price as well, but I was a little bit concerned about second quarter cost being somewhat materially higher than first quarter even though the copper price fell a little bit from first quarter to second quarter, so it just sounds like it's a function of grades and maybe just some inherent industry wide inflation. Is that right?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's correct. And I'll just comment, it's still a very profitable, profitable business for us, high volumes with cost with good margins. The industry, I mentioned earlier, a lot of input costs are correlated to copper prices. Now, we've had this unusual situation over the last month where we were at $3.20 and now $2.75. So it's really kind of a distorted situation currently. But at the end of the day, whatever economics globally results from what's going on right now is going to affect all commodities. And so our cost will track what happens with copper prices. We think our price is going to go back up. We have to fight this increased cost of energy and transportation and things like sulfur. I mean we just had a meeting last week as we do the week before every earnings call where we had 65 of our mine managers in and all we were doing is harping on this issue of fighting this \u2013 fight to maintain our margins, fight to maintain \u2013 how can we be more efficient, how can we use \u2013 we're using all this data analysis now. We're putting sensors on all of our trucks and trying to get more and more efficient and we're making progress there. But that's an everyday fight in our business, every day.","Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Co. Please go ahead.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.","Hi, thanks guys. Quick question on \u2013 a couple of questions on Grasberg. In terms of the CapEx, is it around $1 billion per year until the end of 2022 when the underground is mostly developed and then should it \u2013 should the sustaining capital at that point drop down below that $1 billion level? Just trying to get a sense for CapEx going forward.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yes, we're spending on the order of $800 million a year over the five-year period and that's $700 million net to PT-FI.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.","Okay. All right. Great. And then I assume, right, it should drop down to a sustaining level which should be materially below that once it's all fully developed?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, we'll have another mine called the Kucing Liar mine that is currently contemplated to be developed. We'll have to look at the economics on that one as we get closer to it. But as Richard said earlier, the infrastructure, all the money that we've invested today is largely in place. We've got some mill enhancements to make, but going forward, it's more the development that you do over time in the block caves. So, in terms of the infrastructure cost, those are largely behind us.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.","Okay. Okay, great. And then also, Kathleen, you're talking about the mine continuing to be a low unit cost mine during this kind of ramp up period in 2019 and 2020. Is that \u2013 so I mean, can we assume then that the total operating cost at Grasberg will decline as you're mining less ore, mining and processing less ore there, so meaning that it seems like the production costs at Grasberg are somewhere around $1.8 billion a year now and should we assume that in 2019 and 2020, those production costs will decline as I guess as the open pit labor \u2013 I mean labor in the open pit declines and you're spending more on capital than on operating costs?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah., and the mill rate will also go down in 2019 and 2020 from where we are today. So we will have lower absolute costs than we have currently. And then what I was referring to is really looking at our net unit cash costs after the gold credits, will still be our lowest cost operation in the portfolio, and then get to this net credit position that we're enjoying in 2018.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.","Right. Okay. I mean, and could you give us a sense as to what you expect the cost to be once you're fully ramped at Grasberg in the, say, in the 2023 to 2027 time period?","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah, well, we've given a number before being less than $0.60 a pound.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.","Okay.","Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","In these earlier years, it'll likely be less than that. Like I was saying in 2022 currently, we're projecting it to be a net credit. So that was the less than $0.60 a pound was more of a life of mine, but in this period, you're talking about it's likely to be lower than that.","Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.","Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America.

Is it fair to say that if Escondida is delayed or hits a snag that that could have a knock-on effect on the Cerro Verde negotiations or do you think those are separate?","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Well, I've always said strikes are contagious diseases. So it's clearly union people communicate, watch what's going on.

Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","That's correct.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. Okay. I'll let it go there. Thanks very much.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","Yeah. You got right through the bottom of it, so.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Richard, just quick on Lone Star, where do you stand relative to equipment orders? How much is first copper produced in 2020 first half, second half and have you hired EPCM to look at the sulfide and the potential there or any help on like pre-feasibility on that type of investment.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","So that's divided between the two. The oxide project is now underway. We're actually, I mean, it actually looks like a mine now. Beginning earlier this year, we began transporting material. So that's underway. There's not really (01:05:25) any real significant equipment to go. We still have...","Kathleen L.

Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","By year end 2020.","Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.","By year end 2020. And so then you turn to the sulfide and right now, it's understanding what it is. I mean, we're \u2013 like I said, we got six exploration core oil rigs working out there now. We're analyzing these recent results of our drilling we've done to-date. We're defining \u2013 the ore body keeps being extended, east and west and in depth. And so, right now, we're in that stage of understanding what it is and our development team is beginning to think about what this would be, how large would the initial development be, and how you stage that in terms of making sure you have access to the total resource. So it's in the early stage of definition.","Michael S.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and presentation material for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our Web site homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today is Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer. Red Conger's here, Mike Hendrix's here, as well as others from our management team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who'll go through the slide materials located on our Web site. As usual after our prepared remarks we'll open up the call for Q&A.","Today FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $292 million, $0.21 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. As detailed in the press release the fourth quarter net income included net charges of 59 million or $0.04 a share reflecting estimated losses on assets held for sale and oil and gas restructuring related charges partly offset by gain on a redeemable non-controlling interest in plains offshore. After adjusting for net charges fourth quarter adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled 351 million or $0.25 per share.","Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter totaled 1.7 billion. As you'll see in the press release FCX took aggressive actions during 2016 to restore its balance sheet strength and we had an active fourth quarter. We completed $5.2 billion in asset sales during the fourth quarter of 2016 bringing the full year asset sale transactions to 6.6 billion.","Importantly, our net debt was reduced by 8.4 billion during the year and currently approximates $12 billion. Our sales for the quarter totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper, 405,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum. And we sold 4.65 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.1 million ounces of gold and 74 million pounds of molybdenum.","During the quarter we completed the Tenke sale in November and our previous guidance had reflected Tenke volumes for the full year. Excluding that variance copper sales were approximately 7% below the October 2016 estimates reflecting lower mining and milling rates at PT Freeport Indonesia. Our fourth quarter realized copper price was $2.47 per pound that was 13% above the year ago, average of 2.18 per pound.","Gold prices averaged 1,174 per ounce and were about 10% above the year ago quarter of 1,067 per ounce. Our unit net cash cost for the quarter was a $1.20 per pound, that was lower than the year ago period of a $1.45 per pound, that reflects the higher byproduct credits and also the improved volumes and efficiencies from the Cerro Verde project and higher volume for PTFI.","We generated operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the quarter which exceeded our capital expenditures of roughly 500 million. For the year our operating cash flow totaled 3.7 billion which is in excess of our CapEx for the year of 2.8 billion. As previously reported we completed the at-the-market offering of common stock during the fourth quarter and raised a total of 1.5 billion in gross proceeds through the sale of 116 million shares of FCX common stock.","Our consolidated debt totaled 16 billion and cash balance at the end of the year was 4.2 billion, net debt was below $12 billion at year end. We ended the year with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. At the end of December we had 1.44 billion common shares outstanding.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard who will be talking our outlook and updating you on current developments in referring to the slide materials on our Web site.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning everyone, as I started thinking about my presentation today I recall a comment that Jack Welch made several years ago and it was, 'don't be giving bows for Act I when the audience is looking for Act II', and I know everyone here is focused on Indonesia. It's the focus of our senior management team as we go into 2017, but having said that I'm very proud of what our team did during this past year. A year ago at this time our share price was well below $4 a share, our credit revolve swaps were 2,700 basis points, we were announcing a plan to reduce that and sell assets. There was a lot of uncertainty about our ability to do that and the values that we would realize.","We were completing the construction of our Cerro Verde project and ramping it up and it was a big project, $4.6 billion and big projects in our industry have been challenging in general. We're very pleased that we successfully executed that construction project and ramped up Cerro Verde in a very effective way and today it\u2019s a long-term cash flow generating asset for our company and a core asset.","We've had a year of really strong cost and capital management, 19% reduction in consolidated copper unit site production and delivery cost year-to-year, 56% reduction in CapEx year-to-year, 17% below our year ago estimate for CapEx as we manage our capital spending. This call last year in response to a question I indicated a goal of reducing our debt by $5 billion to $10 billion, I didn't really set a time frame on it at that time, but we have reduced our net debt from last year to the end of 2016 by roughly $8 billion.","We refocused our business under the direction of our restructured Board of Directors to focus on our mining business and on the copper industry and we were able to come out of this process of selling assets and raising capital with that high-quality copper portfolio that situates our company for creating long term values for our shareholders.","Kathleen mentioned our asset sales, they're detailed on Page 4. In the first quarter soon after our year end conference call last year we announced the sale of an incremental interest in Morenci to our long-time partners Sumitomo for $1 billion and in the fourth quarter it was a culmination of a lot of work that went on throughout the year with the closing of the Tenke Fungurume transaction, the resolution of uncertainties of that transaction within the Democratic Republic of Congo, and our partner G\u00e9camines is there.","We closed oil and gas transactions to sell the deep-water assets and the California production price is well below what our company paid for them, but at prices that were very reasonable in terms of the current marketplace. Took a lot of work, each one of these transactions was very complicated and beyond that there were a lot of alternative transactions that we put a lot of effort into to give us a set of alternatives before we settled on doing these particular transactions.","Page 5 looks at the management of our cost and capital, you can see the 19% decline in our unit cost ending the year with a unit cost net of byproduct credits of a $1.26 for last year, our free cash flows increased, our capital expenditure is decreased as expected, as a result of the completion of the Cerro Verde project but moreover by the in-effect exit from the oil and gas business where we had spent roughly $3 billion of capital in 2015 and over a $1 billion in 2016.","Copper market, in the fourth quarter, all of us have been pleasantly surprised by the recovery in copper prices as you know copper lagged behind other commodities. During 2016 it was up roughly 17% for last year, but as we ended the year we improved market sentiments supported by fundamentals in China and the U.S. and the global marketplace and global economic conditions improved.","Supply growth continues to be constrained by yearend, we were seeing more impact of supply disruptions which had been uncharacteristically low during the first half of 2016, the price required to develop new supplies is $3 a pound or better the incentive price that Wood Mack points to is $3.30 in real terms. So even at these prices, the industry is still not undertaking new supply development projects. When those projects are undertaken, it takes years to get them to the point of developing supplies, so we're in an inevitable move of reduced supply.","The question mark is demand, demand has been better and that points to a bright future for copper today we have relatively low inventory, clearly deficits in the marketplace are in our future, the question is what will the timing and extent of those deficits be and that depends on the global economy and particularly events in China, but we remain -- throughout all this, we remain very optimistic about the outlook for copper and to position our company to take advantage of it.","The world's leading copper producers are on Page 7, you can see that we rank in terms of net interest of production behind Codelco, this is excluding Tenke and adjusting our ownership interest in Morenci, if you looked at the operations that we manage, we're roughly equivalent to Codelco taking into account minority interest in the operations that we manage.","Our assets include seven copper mines in North America where we supply roughly 40% of the downstream copper to the U.S. economy, two copper mines in South America with the Cerro Verde project in Peru, El Abra with our partner Codelco in Chile, which has a potential for a massive expansion in the future and then of course the Grasberg operations in Papua and Indonesia.","You can see in terms of reserves, they're basically equally distributed among those regions, so we got good diversity in terms of copper resources. Our molybdenum only mines are in the U.S. We have byproducts in the U.S. and in South America as well and then our gold sales are associated with the very large gold byproduct in our ore at Grasberg. Cerro Verde commenced operations in September 2015 and achieved operating capacity in the first quarter of 2016. The large-scale long-live reserves net unit cost decline 19% year-on-year, this is a great project and is operating very well and we're very proud of our team for accomplishing it.","Our reserves are shown on Page 10. I mentioned earlier when you look at our proved and probable reserves, they are equally distributed by region and beyond that we have substantial mineralized material that we\u2019ve identified in conjunction with our existing mines of substantial amounts, 100 billion pounds of contained copper and then beyond that there is potential that we are qualifying now of very large amounts. What this shows you is that our company is situated with reserves that provide for a very long term future in the copper business.","We will have a steady stream of growth projects that will only be initiated when the market indicates a need to for it and we can be very disciplined about where we spend capital looking for attractive rate of return projects and looking for projects with relatively low execution risk, other brownfield expansions. So, our company is well situated. We don't have to make -- enter into the M&A market, but with our balance sheet improving with copper price outlook improving, we\u2019ll be positioned to participate in that marketplace either as buyers or as sellers.","Now, we have our large development projects listed on Page 11. They're in alphabetical order, this is not an order that we might pursue them, but it includes six projects with major sulfide opportunities which would be each major expansion opportunities for concentrator projects.","Interestingly, five of the six are in the United States and as we look at the relative economics of investing in the United States or outside the United States, in recent years, investments in the United States have become increasingly attractive. The energy situation here with the abundance of energy and the cost of energy, because of the shale oil and gas developments in the United States has provided us low cost of energy.","We have a work force in the United States that is much more flexible. We have a none-union work force, we have communities that support our employees, whereas outside the United States, often we have to provide all the community support. So, it\u2019s an interesting situation, what a change over the last 15 years, when this industry was thought to be dead here and now it\u2019s a place for great investment opportunities.","Also, El Abra is on this list and it\u2019s got a very large resource that we are doing advanced planning on with our partners looking at potential consolidation of interest in the area and it would be a very large project, but potentially an attractive one and I believer one that ultimately the industry will need to meet the world's needs of copper.","So, we've had a great Act I, turning to Act II. At Grasberg from an operations standpoint we have had continuing issues with, I'm going to say an element of our workforce and that is the workers in the Grasberg pit itself. The Grasberg pit has a known depletion point, it's been moved out to now where it will be -- we expect it to be completed in 2018, upon completion we will continue mining the Grasberg ore body as a very large block cave -- is located -- the ore body extends below the limits of the pit. We are currently operating underground in a significant way in our DOZ mine and our deep MLZ mine.","We have been operating large scale block cave operations since early 1980s at the Papuan operations of PT Freeport Indonesia and we're very comfortable about technically being able to do that. But as we've approached the completion of the pit, workers have been raising complaints, grievances and have simply not been meeting productivity standards.","We're taking steps to respond to that, the effect of this is not a loss of resource, this resource will be realized through mining activities, but what's happening is we're having lower production now which is extending the life of the pit and we're working with the union, with the workers, with our management team to take steps to rectify this and in our outlook, we give you the best estimates that we have going forward.","Now I want to spend some time going over matters that many of you are familiar with, some of you may not be, but I think it's appropriate to do it now because the Indonesian government has just issued new regulations for mining operators broadly, and it has implications for us, but it's for the industry as a whole. So, I want to take a few minutes and set the stage for putting this in perspective with what our situation is given our current contract with the Indonesian government.","Freeport signed its first contract in 1967 and then after the discovery of the Grasberg, signed a new contract of work in 1991. And this contract provided legal and physical certainty through 2041. And it was on the basis of this contract that Freeport has made a multibillion dollars of investment and we began that on signing of the contract.","In the mid-1990s we formed a strategic partnership with Rio Tinto to advance the development of the new Grasberg resource. We had a major mill expansions, we undertook underground mine development and expanded the mine capabilities for output significantly and Rio Tinto remains our partner and we have a great relationship with them.","In connection with that original contract we had a commitment to build a smelter in Indonesia, provided that was economic. And we fulfill that commitment. We\u2019ve aggressively went out to find a partner, we found a partner in Mitsubishi, which had new smelter technology at the time and we\u2019ve constructed a smelter in eastern Java at Gresik. And we have an equity interest in it, the majority owner the Japanese and Mitsubishi is operated -- it's operated very effectively and safely over almost 20 years of operations. Been one of the world's best smelters, have not made any money because of the economics of the smelter industry.","In 2009, the Government of Indonesia passed a new mining law and implement new regulations over, the law was passed in 2009 and it took time to put regulations in place and really the governing regulations were not completed until 2012. The law provides specifically that existing CoWs remain in effect until they expire. It also instructed the government to seek amendments to the CoW make contracts of work more consistent with the new mining law within one year.","We actually, began discussions with the designated senior representatives of government in 2011. And in 2012, the government established an evaluation team early that year to review CoWs. We\u2019ve been in discussions with the government since 2011, 2012, but have never been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on reconciling the contract of work with the new mining law. The law says that the contract remains in effect.","In early 2014, concentrate exports were halted for more than six months following a troubling January regulation on exports. We didn\u2019t export for more than six months. It cost the government roughly a $1 billion in taxes and royalties, it cost us slightly less than that. But a very substantial amount. In that year, we resolved the ban on exports by entering into an MOU with the government, in July, that covered six main points. Exports, smelter development, divestiture, all of these were subject to negotiation of legal and physical certainty and an extension of our operations from 2021 to 2041.","It was contemplated that that MOU would be resulted amendments to the CoW in six months. The government changed in late 2014, the MOU was extended in 2015 and we continued discussions with the government. That led to the government providing our company a letter of assurance regarding extension of the CoW, regarding legal and physical certainty beyond 2021. And it was that assurance, in that letter and in the MOU and in the CoW, the government has, in Freeport have honored this CoW since the first one was signed in the 1960s, and the new one signed in 1991, that has given us the confidence to make the ongoing level of investments that we\u2019ve been making and developing our underground resources.","Now just in January of this year the government has introduced new regulations and these new regulations require CoW holders to convert to licenses called IUPK in order to export, and with a license in and of itself there is no assurance of legal and physical certainty and we have been unwilling to give up our CoW to go to strictly a license. And so, what I want to do now is, and this is in our slides and so you can review this and follow up with questions, but I want to point out what our contract of work actually says.","It says that we shall have initial term of 30 years from 1991 going to 2021, and that we shall be entitled to apply for two successive 10-year extensions of this term subject to government approval and that government approval cannot unreasonably be withheld or delayed. So, we have the rights to extend the CoW on its existing terms for another 20 years beyond 2021. We made application for this extension and have not yet received approval.","With regard to export, there is a specific provision in our contract that says without in any way limiting the Company's basic right to export, that we shall be -- we'll be subject to a reporting -- administrative reporting and non-monetary provisions. With respect to taxes the CoW at specifically that we shall not be subject to any other taxes, duties, levies, contributions, et cetera, except for those expressly provided in this CoW, which provides for an income tax rate of 35% which is higher than the standard rate in Indonesia and provides for royalties.","With respect to divestment, there's a specific provision that said, if after signing this agreement the effective laws and regulations of the government's policies impose less burdens on divestiture requirement than those that were in the CoW, those less burdensome requirements apply to our -- to the parties of the CoW. And what happened after CoW was signed in 1991 Indonesia in general adopted new laws and regulations that eliminated requirements for foreign ownership that triggered this provision and we have a letter from the government through its investment board called BKPM in 1997 saying that we have no future divestiture obligations.","Then there is general provisions that says the government will take no action inconsistent with the CoW, adversely conductive to the enterprise and including without taking any action or condemnation or nationalization of the enterprise or any parts there under. Later on in this CoW is an act of expropriation and nationalization. So, that's a matter that's strictly covered in the contract. The CoW also said the agreement shall have the full force and effect of law and the law that governance is the law that was in effect at the time of the contract 1991.","So, that is what our position is, is that this contract establishes rights and obligations of each party, Freeport and the government and that the government cannot change its obligations by adopting new laws and regulations. And this is part of just the general rule of law, you can\u2019t do that in the United States or other countries around the world. If laws or regulations are changed, then any government has the right to adopt laws and regulations.","You can\u2019t avoid obligations under contracts by the government by doing that. And if they do do that, then the government would be responsible for financial losses or damages from the breaches of these contracts. And so, as we enter into discussions with the government, that\u2019s the basis for our position, and the government points to the 2009 mining law, and that\u2019s the element of disagreements that we\u2019ve had.","I mentioned this October 7, 2015 assurance letter. And it\u2019s very important because in that letter, which was issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, it talks that the government warrants -- now this letter is in Bahasa Indonesia, and warrants is a term that we\u2019ve translated to. I\u2019ve been advised by our people that the law itself could -- you could use the word guarantee or warrants or assures to reflect it.","But it says that we would be able to submit proposal of contract extension immediately on implementation of the regulatory amendment and the government will not reasonably withhold or delay it. It is further understood that the approval will ensure, and this is really important, the same rights and the same levels of legal and physical certainty as contained in the Contract of Work.","So where are we today? The government issued these new mining regulations on January 12, 2017, which under previous regulations was the date that prohibited exports beyond that date. The regulations that allow our continuation of exports, subject to conditions, including conversion of the CoW to the special operating license called an IUPK. We are working with the government to deal with the reconciliation of these regulations with our contract. And what we\u2019ve agreed to do is convert our contract to an IUPK subject to obtaining an underlying investment stability agreement, similar to what we have in other countries, which provides us this legal assurance of physical terms and other rights.","The CoW remains in effect until it\u2019s replaced by a mutually satisfied alternative. And we have requested the government to allow us to export, while we immediately begin to discuss with the government this new license and stability agreement. Our recent discussions, we have not yet been given an export right, our very recent discussions with the ministry indicates that we will be given that right, and we will target dealing with the conversion to the license and the stability agreement within a three-month period.","So, we\u2019re committed to start working immediately on that. We\u2019ve been given indications that we will be allowed to export, but I want to note specifically, we have not yet been approved for that. If in fact, we are not allowed to export, the significant impact on our company. Each day, it\u2019s 70 million pounds of copper and 100,000 each month -- 70 million pounds of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold for each month.","The nature of copper concentrate is that it's bulk material and we don\u2019t have the ability to inventory this to any great extent. We would be allowed to ship domestically to the smelter at Gresik and we would have to restructure our business to allow us to do that, but it would be a major curtailment of our business. Unlike 2014, at this point where our company is not in a position to maintain the existing operations without being able to export.","So, we would have to take steps to curtail operations, curtail costs, that means very large layoffs and the cutbacks in capital spending, and we have developed plans to do that. I will say we don\u2019t expect to have to do that based on very recent discussions with the ministry. But we -- it still remains for us to get these exports approval and we've been given assurances that we will.","I just want to close this discussion of Indonesia to make just some very general comments. We are one of the oldest and largest foreign investors in Indonesia. And over the history we have had a very positive relationship with the government and together we've done great things in Papua. This is I would suggest the most technically challenging mine to operate in the world, because of its physical setting and the nature of its ore body and how we have to deal with environmental issues and disposals of tailings and waste material, and the development of underground resources.","And we take great pride in what we've accomplished there, and we take pride in the positive relationship we've had with the government and our goal is to remain a positive partner with the government, but while we firmly represent the interest of Freeport's shareholders. We take pride in the benefits that our operations have provided to the government and local communities over our long histories.","We produce over $50 billion of economic benefits to the Republic of Indonesia and our future impacts would be even greater. Under our current physical terms, Indonesia receives more in taxes and royalties than any other country would receive if we were to take this mine and put it into U.S., Canada, Chile, Peru. The deal for Indonesia is very fair by international standards.","In summary, it is in the best interest of both Freeport and the government to reach a mutually accepted resolution and I believe both sides recognize this and I have confidence that we will reach this resolution that is fair to all parties and we're going to commit all of our time and resources to achieve that goal.","We'll answer questions, but I want to just point out our 2017 outlook is for over 4 billion pounds of copper, 2.2 million ounces of gold, 92 million pounds of molybdenum. The copper and gold presumed we will continue to export in Indonesia. Our site production and delivery cost before byproduct credits would be about in the range of $1.50, after credits this is a $1,200 gold and $7 molybdenum would be a $1.06 for the year, this upcoming year, the year we\u2019re in and about $1.15 for the first quarter.","At $2.50 copper, we\u2019ll have $4.3 billion of operating cash flow each $0.10 change in copper, plus or minus $2.50, is $385 million. Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion, which $1.1 billion is for major projects. The vast bulk of that is for the underground development in Indonesia and then our sustaining capital is $700 million.","Our sales profile for the next three years is shown on Slide 19, net of Tenke and Morenci transactions, we were at 4.17 last year, this year would be 4.1 and roughly 4 in 2018. And you can see our gold increases as we complete the mining of the Grasberg pit [ph] in 2017 and 2018 and our molybdenum sales, which we manage to a certain degree in response to the marketplace, and we\u2019ve done a great job, by the way of processing our molybdenum and our downstream operations to reach a chemical grade where realizations are substantially higher than from metallic molybdenum.","Our models for EBITDA and cash flows are shown on Page 20. EBITDA between $2.50 and $3 is $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion. Operating cash flows are roughly $3.5 billion to $5 million between $2.50 and $3, with limited amount of free cash flow. This gives us a clear path for making our debt targets.","The sensitivities to price changes for our business is shown on Slide 21 and capital expenditures on Page 22 were without oil and gas now we will significantly reduce capital this year and next and continue to constrain capital until market warrants moving forward with new projects.","This balance slide is something that looks great to me. I mean, we went from $20 billion to $12 billion net debt from last year, from year before last to the end of last year. And then if we look forward next year with the range of $2.50 to $3 you can see our debt dropping below $10 billion. And that\u2019s a big positive change for us.","And we\u2019re committed to a strong balance sheet now. A strong balance sheet in this industry allows you to be protective of your Company\u2019s shareholder values. It allows you to make investments when their warranted, it allows you to take into account operating risks and risk such as the one we\u2019re facing in Indonesia. We\u2019re much, much, much better prepared to deal with those risks today than we were a year ago. And it\u2019s a major accomplishment for our company to have met the challenges of having a massively overleveraged balance sheet and getting down to where we have a strong balance sheet.","I\u2019m really excited about our future. I mean, we\u2019re industry leading copper, and copper in my view is going to be a great commodity to be in. We\u2019ve got a great team of operators and developers. We\u2019ve done all these different projects, spanning the globe, there is not a project in our industry that we could not do effectively. We've got this long-lived geographically diverse attractive cost structure resources, and now we are financially strong to be able to run our business in an effective way. So, Act I. We are working every day on Act II, as we work to keep our business safe and produce volumes and control our cost.","So, thank you for your attention and I felt -- I know I've taken some time on the call, we'll answer your questions, but I felt under the circumstances reviewing some background was needed.","Kathleen Quirk ","Operator, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.","Chris Terry","Hi Richard, couple of questions from me, just trying to cut out a few of these more details on Grasberg. Maybe to start on the underground development you're going through with the deep MLZ zone and most of it the Grasberg block cave. At this point has there been any slowdown on that? I'm just looking further out to some of your guidance and comparing it to past periods. I think the 2019 guidance for example has changed a little bit, have you changed anything there or are you still waiting for resolution on the near term before you make any decisions.","Richard Adkerson","It\u2019s a good question Chris and there's two factors here. First of all, with the fact that the pit has been extended because of the labor productivity issue that we faced, then that pushes back the ramp-up of the Grasberg block cave. We are proceeding with the development of the block cave and that has gone very well. These labor issues and so forth have not carried over to our underground operations or mill operations. And so, we are on schedule now, we slowed things down a bit to conserve capital and to make this fit in with the startup following the completion of the mining of the pit.","With respect to the Grasberg block cave development, we will not get to the point of initiating cave activities until we get the contract issue settled. But that is scheduled to occur in the future in any event, between now and 2018. Because once you start the caving, you got to stay with it or you lose resource.","So, we're progressing with the underground development, we're timing it to coincide with the completion of the pit and to a certain extent we're looking at the contract situation before we go forward with it to get to the point of actually beginning caving operations leading in production. The deep MLZ mine development is complete, we have one cave that's in operation with a number of draw points on that cave. We have had an issue related to underground stresses associated with the advancement of the cave. And that has caused us to have to put in more extensive ground support than we had originally contemplated. And that has resulted in a delay in some of the production that we had originally projected for 2017, '18 and '19.","So, we\u2019ve had a bit of a slowdown in the development of the mine itself to make sure that we\u2019re comfortable with the safety factors for their underground support, and that\u2019s taking some time and pushing out some production. No lost resources, it does involve some incremental cost, but it\u2019s something that once we identified this and this occurred during the fourth quarter, then we are taking the steps to ensure safety and the ability to produce this thing over the long term.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks, Richard. And then just in terms of the now, so you\u2019re continuing to produce. So, can you just give us some guidance may be on how much storage capacity you actually have, and then when you have to make decision on that? Is that early fit that you can keep operating until before you\u2019d need to get to losses?","Richard Adkerson","Yeah, coming into this January 12th date, we scheduled shipments to take into account the potential for a delay in granting of the export license. So, by mid-January, we had shipped our exports out under our previous license authority and shipments for the upcoming weeks are scheduled for the Gresik smelter.","Now Gresik smelter is undergoing a strike and is currently having to deal with that. So, that has an impact. We have a limited amount of storage spaces, as I indicated, and we would need to take steps no later than mid-February, if in fact we're not granted for license. So, it is something that looms in a very short time horizon.","Chris Terry","Okay, thanks. And then just the last one for me on the CapEx. Just noticed into 2018 the part that\u2019s not the growth capital, I assume that's the sustaining capital, the 0.9. Is that representative to the business now that you\u2019ve divested most of the oil and gas, or is that still work in progress? Are you under-spending there or can we look at that as more of a steady-state number?","Richard Adkerson","Well, we are aggressively constraining spending. And our team was just here last week with all of our mine managers, and necessity is the mother of inventions, but it\u2019s -- we\u2019re sharing inventory, sharing equipment, sharing people and doing every step we can do. This is not going to be sustainable at that level forever, but we're not having to increase it in the near-term horizon. But this is an aggressively constrained level of maintenance capital spending. But it is what -- we can meet our production targets with this level of spending.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS, please go ahead.","Andreas Bokkenheuser","Thank you very much and congratulations on the fantastic job on deleveraging last year. That was certainly quite impressive and I don't think it was a small thing at all. At the risk of you know being slightly predictable I also have a question on Grasberg. You've obviously highlighted your willingness to potential convert to an IUPK assuming you get the fiscal and legal certainty attached to a CoW.","If you assume for a second that you get this fiscal certainty but the government digs their heels in and says, no, you still have to divest 51% ownership. Would I be right in assuming that you will not commit the vast amount of CapEx to Grasberg if you can't be no have majority control of the mine, is that the right assumption?","Richard Adkerson","The government currently owns 9.36%, and that goes back prior to the 1991 CoW. In terms of negotiating with them over the past five years and it was an element in the 2014 MOU, we agreed to divest up to 30%, which was another 20% roughly over the current government's ownership, with the proviso that that divestment be at fair market value. And a year ago, in January we supplied to the government a valuation of PTFI based on valuation parameters of that time, consistent with the negotiations we were having with Morenci and ultimately with China molybdenum on the Tinke sale, which valued PTFI at that time at $16 billion.","We have not had any interaction with the government to review that valuation and clearly today copper markets are more positive than they were a year ago. The government has expressed over time an interest in having Indonesian ownership over 51%, but they have indicated they would want to see Freeport continue as operator and to be in control of operation. And so, the thought process as I understand it with the government, is to have Indonesian nationals in some form owning 51%, but not to be in control of the business.","Now we believe we have gone a very long way to meeting their aspiration with agreeing to this 30% and at current time we've just noted our opposition to the regulation that requires 51% for all companies, but in our case our contract requires no divestiture. And we have documentation from the government supporting that. There's no question that had we had a requirement to divest 51% from the start of this contract, we would not have invested in the way that we did.","While there has been indications that government officials, certain government officials accept the fair market value concept, my point is, you just don\u2019t develop an asset and sell it to somebody else at a fair market value at certain point in time. And so, that remains a matter of disagreement between us and the government. And clearly, if that were a requirement, it would affect negatively our future investments for this business.","Andreas Bokkenheuser","That\u2019s very clear. Thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson","Let me just say, while I expect that we will get the approval to export and some time to deal with developing this IUPK investment stability agreement, we will still have to deal with this regulation for 51% divestiture and the government\u2019s intention to impose export duties and the level of those duties has not yet been published. So, we have work to do.","Andreas Bokkenheuser","Right. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. That was good.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Tony Rizzuto","Thanks very much. Hi, Richard and Kathleen. I also want to congratulation on Act I as well. And Richard, when I listen to you detailing the articles in the contract of work in the specific areas, I couldn\u2019t help but think that I was hearing increased frustration as to be expected in your voice. And my goodness, you look at all these -- the details in the articles and how it\u2019s been violated over time and just your response to the last question about this 51% divestment stake and so on and so forth and the question is about operate control and all these types of things.","And I clearly heard you say earlier about this kind of very critical date, as you come up upon mid-February, which is not that far away. If these issues in Indonesia persist, would you consider, in addition to reigning in investment there, could we see Freeport look seriously at perhaps restarting some of your [technical difficulty] idled capacity elsewhere in the world? ","Richard Adkerson","Well, I really think that those are independent decisions. And I don\u2019t think we would start idled capacity just because something was happening in Indonesia. We\u2019re going to look at the idled capacity in investment of developing new resources based on market conditions. And Tony, one of the advantages of having a stronger balance sheet, which a year ago, we were really dealing with the situation in Indonesia and other potential risk in places we operate outside of Indonesia from position of weakness. Now, our canons are loaded, and we can represent our shareholders much more strongly then we could have then, and that\u2019s really important.","Tony Rizzuto","Okay.","Richard Adkerson","We have the rights to pursue claims against the government in the form of international arbitration. And our legal team advises us that our case is very strong in doing that. We have consistently represented to the government that we don't want to do that, I don't believe that would be advantageous for us, but I also think it would be very negative for the Government of Indonesia.","So, we have and as long as we have the opportunity to try to resolve these matters in good faith we'll continue to do it through trying to reach an amicable mutually agreeable situation. But if we get to that point where we can\u2019t and that point would include not being able to export, then we would be left no choice and we're prepared to do that.","Tony Rizzuto","Richard just on the labor situation you mentioned, I was unaware that the Gresik smelter was dealing with a strike situation. Your own situation there as it relates to the mining operations, is there a labor contract which expires there this year? It seems like the two year -- I notice every two years.","Richard Adkerson","It's every two years and we have to again this summer begin the negotiation of a new CLA agreement with our labor union at Grasberg and that's -- under Indonesian law that's required every two years, as you pointed out.","Tony Rizzuto","Is that the expiration on that Richard, is which date?","Kathleen Quirk","September.","Tony Rizzuto","End of September, and that's to all of the workers at the mine, mill, everything?","Richard Adkerson","Well, there is you know -- our total work force, is 30,000 to 34,000 people. Half of those roughly, little less than half are employees, and a majority of employees are members of one union, and that\u2019s the contract we're talking about. The others are contractors and certain of those contract companies have separate unions and separate negotiations, but for the major employee union, that is the contract that we've just been talking about.","Tony Rizzuto","Got it. That's very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotia Bank, please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw","Hi, good morning, more questions on Grasberg, specifically your guidance for 2017. Just curious what throughput rate that assumes at Grasberg, because obviously, it\u2019s been tracking kind of below expectations given the productivity rates that you talked about.","Kathleen Quirk","Orest, this is Kathleen, the big driver of our metal in 2017 comes from the Grasberg open pit and we are using an estimate -- an average of 140,000 tons a day of mine rate and during the third quarter of 2016 we averaged a 170,000 roughly. We had forecast 160,000 going into the fourth quarter and we had some work stoppages and some productivity issues that we dealt with in the fourth quarter and so we averaged 122,000. The 140,000 that we're estimating for 2017 is very doable, but it is at risk for issues related to productivity and work stoppages, but we think it's very much achievable and potentially we could do better than that.","Orest Wowkodaw","And is that -- in your guidance reduction for '17 is that driven purely off of the productivity issues or is there an impact from the ban in the current -- the export ban in the current change?","Kathleen Quirk","It\u2019s principally related to the lower mining rates and to the delayed start up or delayed ramp-up at deep MLZ that is affecting 2017. We do have some allowance for the concentrate delays, but we\u2019re expecting under this plan to be exporting in February.","Orest Wowkodaw","I see. And just finally on Grasberg, Richard talked earlier about your relationship with Rio Tinto. But can you just please outline, I think to everybody, how the 40% interest is going to work with Rio Tinto starting in 2021 and how that pertains to -- whether that pertains to their stake in PTFI or at the asset level and how we should think about that? ","Richard Adkerson","Okay. They do not have any stake in PTFI. The operation, even though we call it all Freeport, is actually a joint venture between PTFI and Rio Tinto\u2019s Indonesian subsidiary. And so, they own no shares of PTFI. The numbers we present are proportionately consolidated. So, it excludes Rio Tinto\u2019s interest in current operations, which is very small. But it also, when we report reserves and resources that\u2019s net of Rio Tinto\u2019s interest.","And they have an assignment of our CoW, and so it is really a joint venture and they had a varying level of participation from the time it began in -- the production began in the joint venture in 1998 until 2021. Now there's been some extensions of that date for force majeure items. And after that date, they have a 40% interest.","Orest Wowkodaw","And if you, like last time you previously talked about selling down 20% to the government, did that -- so would that have included pro-rata share from Rio Tinto or was that strictly Freeport share?","Richard Adkerson","That\u2019s strictly Freeport share. We only negotiate with the government with respect to Freeport\u2019s interest. So -- and for example, when I referred to this $16 billion of valuation, that is exclusive of the valuation attributed to Rio Tinto. There\u2019s only one CoW, they have an assigned interest in that CoW, we cannot make any amendments to that CoW that\u2019s adverse to Rio Tinto\u2019s interest.","And we\u2019ve been great partners since the start of this operation, and we\u2019re in very close communication with them on all aspects of our business, technical, safety issues, the government relations issues, and so forth. So, it\u2019s that partnership and I want to be clear, we represent PTFI, we have a joint venture partner Rio Tinto that represents their interest.","Orest Wowkodaw","I see, and is Rio funding it\u2019s proportionate share than of the underground CapEx and the future smelter? ","Richard Adkerson","With respect to the CapEx at Grasberg in the underground development.","Several years ago, we reached an agreement on how those capital expenditures would be shared. Certain of those costs are deemed to be replacement capital and there are shared on the same basis as operating costs. Some of the costs are considered to be expansion capital and their share 60:40.","Kathleen Quirk","Like the deep MLZ.","Richard Adkerson","Like the Deep MLZ project for example. Certain projects that -- for example the access -- there is a common access deep MLZ and to Grasberg and we have an agreed upon sharing. So, the capital that we report, that all these numbers in our presentation we report are report only. They don\u2019t include cost share by Rio Tinto, those costs are relatively small right now, but will grow to 40% once the conversion to the 40% interest comes in play.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Andrew Quail ","Good morning Rich and Kathleen. Thank you very much for the update. Just got a couple of few questions, I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but I'm talking about Grasberg again. Obviously, from that mine rates in Q4, and it probably had something to do with labor as well as mine sequencing. Can you just give us some context about what -- how much does the workforce flex down as you guys transition to the block cave?","Richard Adkerson","It's more of a transition than a flex down. Because actually underground mining is labor intensive, and over time as the open pit moves towards completion, the mine rate drops, we're moving much less waste material now than we did in the past.","So, there is less equipment, less people and we sought to transition workers from the open pit to the underground through train where we could, we also will have ongoing after the pit is completed, material moving activities associated with the waste management of the waste material that will -- that\u2019s been taken out of the pit and placed around the pit. And we have to manage that for long-term environmental reasons.","We have activities in the loans, where we have a tailings disposal area that\u2019s quarantined off with dikes and there is a constant effort on-going to build and maintain those dikes to execute our tailing management plan. So, I would say, Andrew, that is more of a transition than -- what was the word you used --.","Andrew Quail ","Flex down.","Richard Adkerson","Flex down.","Andrew Quail ","Okay. Second question was about, you guys obviously are talking about a surface water tax. Which was about 470 million. Can you give some color on that and if that was to be paid would that come this year? I realize you guys haven\u2019t made any provisions for it, but what's the background of that, is that the government sort of playing games?","Richard Adkerson","This is a clear-cut example of why we have to protect our CoW.","Andrew Quail ","Yeah.","Richard Adkerson","Our contract says we\u2019re only subject to taxes that are specified in the CoW. And what happened here is the provincial government, not the central government, has sought to impose a water tax on us, that we\u2019ve resisted paying because it\u2019s not part of the CoW. And we didn\u2019t pay it, and the provincial governors sued us. It\u2019s gone through the Tax Court now and there was a very recent ruling in the Tax Court that was in favor of the provincial government. And it\u2019s one of these kinds of things that we face in other countries, whereas the amount of the tax I think was on the -- was less than $200 million.","But there are penalty provisions in the law that are very aggressive and so that\u2019s where it\u2019s grown-up to the $350 million, $400 million level. We have made -- we have taken steps to appeal this Tax Court decision. We believe it\u2019s wrong. We are considering submitting this matter to arbitration. But that\u2019s what would happen to us if we went to a license without having an investment stability agreement. Under a license, you\u2019re subject to prevailing laws and regulations. And any government can\u2019t come in an impose taxes, fees, import duties, export duties, et cetera, et cetera, water taxes, surface taxes, vehicle taxes. And so, obviously, governments around the world needs funds of these days, and operational like ours is an attractive target, so we had to have some protection against this.","We have made very significant voluntary contributions to the Papuan community, beyond what we\u2019re required to pay under the CoW. We began in 1996 to voluntarily contribute, along with Rio Tinto, 1% of our revenues to a Papuan development fund and that\u2019s accumulated, the last that I saw was $650 million, it's one of the largest community development funding activities on the globe.","Freeport was just recognized in Forbes by being among the Top 50 civic mining companies, and that\u2019s part of it. The fact that we voluntarily make this contribution each year for Papuan community development. So, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to ignore our neighbors in the province, but we have to resist opening the door to being -- to having taxes imposed on us that\u2019s not part of our contract. There is a real danger of that being a never-ending stream.","Andrew Quail ","Richard, thanks very much. I've got one more, and it\u2019s not in Indonesia, how about that. Switching to North America, Look, obviously copper prices have rebounded. Is there a some -- is there a price in your head that you guys will start looking now that balance sheet is pretty much fixed? You guys have done a great job there in the last 12 months. Is there -- how much of the capacity do you think is in North America that you guys could sort of may be flexing and maybe bring back on in time?","Richard Adkerson","We had an interesting situation with our scale back. operations. We went through and evaluated each project and Red Conger's here and led this effort with Kathleen looking over his shoulder. But we reviewed every operation, every segment of every operation when copper prices dropped so low to see what would be cash flow positive. And we talk about cash flow positive, it includes maintenance capital as well as operating cost and really, we did this in 2008-2009 adjusted some operations and this time when we reviewed them like operations in New Mexico, they withstood that. We shut down production that was really reclamation activities in the Miami-Globe area, the Miami mine, that's not going to come back on, that's done. And we've adjusted it to make it purely a reclamation management effort.","At our Serrida mine in Arizona it is a very, very low grade copper deposit, but a significant molybdenum component to it. And because both prices dropped, we started a plan to curtail productions significantly, we're targeting 50% or more. Well as we got into it the team there started finding ways of reducing cost to such an extent that we never cut it back as much as we initially intended. And so now we're just monitoring that. We're not making plans to take steps to invest right now to increase it, it does have future investment opportunities. But we're just managing production to meet cash flow objectives.","We did in South America, I know you asked about North America, but we did cut the mining rate in half at El Abra and that remains curtailed. And we're looking at the future development opportunity there, but we don't see stepping that up at the copper prices expected for 2017.","Andrew Quail ","There's something about [Multiple Speakers].","Kathleen Quirk","We have and I think we've commented on this in previous reports, but we have ongoing work that Red and his team are doing looking at each site to see if we can change pit designs to get more -- to reduce costs and to get more production. That's not an easy exercise, but that's the kind of thing we're looking at. It's things that don\u2019t require significant investments, that maybe we can do on the margin. But we're doing those kinds of things right now which would have a very high return.","Andrew Quail ","Thanks very much guys, good luck for 2017.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Evan Kurtz","So, I just had a question on divestment valuation, I've heard all sorts of different conflicting reports out there and I know at one point you were hoping to get some sort of clarity on whether you could use an IPO on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and it seemed like maybe that wasn't going to work out and today there was a report out that kind of suggested that maybe that could be an option. I've also seen some other reports about the government only having to pay for replacement costs and none-entity [ph] ore and that sort of things. So just wanted to get your views there. Is that something we could see; how likely could you get most of the acquired divestment done through an IPO do you think?","Richard Adkerson","Well, Evan we believe an IPO would be an attractive step in achieving divestment plan. Because it results in a market based valuation of the business. And the Indonesian Stock Exchange is growing to be a fair market and I know from discussions with investors there would be people interested in investing in an asset like Grasberg. So, we and others in Indonesia are supportive of that. It would not be a sort of thing that we could do a 20% investment in one step on the exchange, simply will be too large. And so, we think an IPO would be maybe 5% or slightly more than that and we would work with the bankers and all of that would be dependent on market conditions at the time we launched it.","So, we think that with respect to these comments about replacement costs, there was some articles earlier this week about somebody saying we wouldn\u2019t get any credit for underground reserves, which was a pretty wild statement. All of those things are just press comments. As I said, we have not been approached by the government to sit down and review our valuation. But with the government officials or financial advisors and we prepared to do that at any time. But we are -- there was a prior regulation that they had, they talked about replacement costs. But our agreements with the government in the MOU and other discussions have always included a requirement on our part that it be at a fair market value and we wouldn\u2019t be prepared to enter into any kind of divestment without achieving that.","Evan Kurtz","Thanks for that color. And maybe just one follow up, if I may. Just with respect to Rio Tinto and them taking their 40% stake as you look out past 2021. How is that kind of -- how discussions evolve between you and Rio as far as if you were to pursue a path with the IEPK and maybe one of the -- those paths includes having to divest up to 51% of company in exchange for some of the other protections that you\u2019re looking for.","How would Rio Tinto fit into that picture? I mean assuming they take 40%, would that come out of their stake, I know it\u2019s 51% of the assets and not a PTFI that they\u2019re looking for. So how do they fit into the picture and have you had any discussions with them on that front?","Richard Adkerson","Well, the way they fit into the picture is, there one CoW, they have an assignment in it and for any changes to that CoW, we basically have to reach an agreement with Rio Tinto on it. And we talk with them constantly, we've had good positive discussions with them, so any decisions we reach would be within. I want to go back and repeat what I said earlier about divestiture.","We only can talk about divestiture with respect -- we at Freeport, can only talk about divestiture with respect to PTFI and our interest apart from Rio Tinto, we can\u2019t represent their ownership and that's their business in dealing with the Indonesian government on it.","So, the divestiture discussions that we\u2019ve had to-date and the $16 billion number and all the other things strictly relates to PTFI, which is an entity that Rio Tinto has no interest in. They're a joint venture partner just like Sumitomo is our joint venture partner at Morenci and Codelco is our joint venture partner in El Abra. Rio Tinto is our joint venture partner at Grasberg and even though it\u2019s commonly referred to as, the total operations as being PTFI because we manage them, they have certain rights with respect to operations, which we work with them on and reach a meeting of minds on plans and investment and things of that nature too. So, it is a true joint venture.","Evan Kurtz","And would they have say in the conversion from a CoW to IUPK? Since most of their rights are with the CoW? So, you have to get their sign off as well?","Richard Adkerson","Absolutely. ","Evan Kurtz","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I'll hand it over.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos","Thank you very much for taking my question. Richard, could you clarify the production rate at Sierrita, is it more like half the capacity, 75% or 100%?","Kathleen Quirk","It\u2019s about 75%.","Richard Adkerson ","It\u2019s about 75%, John.","John Tumazos","Could you tell us among the six possible sulfide mill projects which one or two are more likely to go forward first, and whether we\u2019re talking about things that are [technical difficulty]?","Richard Adkerson","Okay. I think the first one, John, that we would pursue would be the Lone Star project, which is adjacent to Safford. This is an enormous sulfide resource with an oxide cap and the Safford operation itself is facing the end of its resource life. Although there is a deeper sulfide project there.","But what we can do as an initial step at Lone Star is mine the oxide cap using the Safford oxide production facilities and that would serve as a stripping of the material for a long-term sulfide project, which conceivably could include the sulfides at Safford as well as the sulfide at Lone Star, but that would be a major mill investment. So, I think the first thing you\u2019d see us do is move to start mining the Lone Star oxide, which would not require the kind of major capital expenditures that a sulfide concentrator mill would require.","Kathleen Quirk","It's essentially a stripping project and would use the infrastructure that is currently in place at Safford.","Richard Adkerson","Then beyond that, you start getting into these trade-offs between Bagdad and El Abra, would be I think the two that would be right now competing for that first step.","John Tumazos","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Chris Mancini","Just a quick question on North America, how would a change in corporate tax rates in the U.S. potentially affect your cash taxes paid out of your North American operations. And then also would a change in Republican administration -- but with a new Republican administration change your decision process regarding any of these potential expansion projects going forward, make it easier or would it make it more likely that you would go ahead with any of them?","Richard Adkerson","Hi Chris, that's a very complicated question, it's got really broader implications in Freeport. But let me just talk about a couple of things that applicable to Freeport. You start out by saying, because of losses that were triggered by this oil and gas activities we had, we're not paying cash taxes in the United States, and we have a very large carry forward that would shelter cash taxes for a significant amount of time in the future. And so, one thing we're watching is, in this tax reform are they going to do anything with carry forward. There is just a lot of questions about it, but I don't want to get into this because we could talk forever, and we a conversation at the business round table, but this border adjustment provision that they're talking about could really have interesting implications.","Right now, we supply 40% of the copper to the U.S. market and we pay -- it results in taxable income which right now is being sheltered. Under the way this thing is structured as I understand it, if we export that copper we pay no taxes on it. But right now, if we buy a Caterpillar haul truck and we'd use it in Bagdad, Caterpillar would have to pay taxes on that. If we bought a Caterpillar haul truck and use it at El Abra, since it\u2019s exported, Caterpillar has to pay no taxes on it.","If we bought all the big -- right Kathleen's telling me to stop. If we were to buy all the big grinding equipment made in Germany, under this cross-border thing if we bought it for Bagdad, we'd get no tax reduction for it. If we bought it for El Abra we could deduct it in determining taxes in Chile.","So, we're just one example of it, and so this debate over tax reform and particularly this cross-border situation is really going to be an interesting one to follow.","Kathleen Quirk","But the bottom line on a change in the corporate tax rate in the U.S., right now given our situation with NOL is just a simple change in the corporate tax rate, wouldn't impact us.","Chris Mancini","Right okay and the border, it's all just so complex that it's tough to really say what the net effect will be.","Richard Adkerson","And we're also not one of the companies that\u2019s affected by having cash off shore that has been taxed, you know repatriation issues and unified tax structure cuts, we pay more taxes outside the U.S. than we do in the U.S., the typical case is reverse of that. So, we don't have that issue facing Freeport.","Chris Mancini","Okay, okay great and then I mean right and I guess that a new administration -- I mean that in Arizona it's very favorable to mining and expansions of mines and this kind of thing and so the new Republic Administration would necessarily change your minds and I don\u2019t think relative to expansion projects, but I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt -- there is the potential to stop them going forward, might be a little bit lower or does it really matter?","Richard Adkerson","Well, I would say we\u2019ve been here in Arizona for 10 years. 10 years ago we acquired Phelps Dodge and Arizona is an excellent, excellent state for us to operate in. We\u2019ve had Democratic governor when we first moved here, we\u2019ve had two Republican governors now and they through both administrations have been very supportive of our business. We do things the right way for communities and the way we run our mines and so they appreciate that. So, we\u2019ve got tremendous support by the state.","The area that we\u2019re watching that could have a big influence on us is EPA regulations. Because we inherited legacy environmental obligations all over this country from historical operations that go back into the 19th Century. And we just entered into a settlement that you may have seen with EPA and the Navajo Indian tribe in the Four Corners area with some significant historical uranium clean-up sites. We were very pleased with that, the government I going to pay significant part of that and we\u2019re going to deal with some of those obligations on behalf of our company. So, these EPA regulations which is a big focus of the new administration is important to us.","Chris Mancini","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Gagliano","First of all, I\u2019d actually like to start-up by saying, I agree with some of the comments earlier. It\u2019s unreal to me how the Indonesian government is constantly changing agreements and rules over the year. But nevertheless, I guess it is, what it is. So unfortunately, I actually two -- I have two Indonesia follow-ups. Both I think are probably more clarification.","But first of all, does the investment stability agreement that Freeport would propose to the Indonesian government, which my understanding is would be the core to converting from the contract of work to this IUPK. Would that investment stability agreement include basically the same six articles that are included in your slide deck, that are included in the contract of work now or if not how with those differ? That\u2019s my first question.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. We go back to this October 7th letter, this is a slide deck as well. And in that letter, the government gave us assurances, warranted or guarantee that under the new regulations, we would get the same level of assurances on legal and fiscal matters that we had in the CoW. So, that's the starting point and the endpoint in our view of where we go with that.","So, the answer is yes, it would continue all the important provisions related to fiscal and legal certainly that are in the CoW, they would now be in the stability agreement. And our analysis shows that the government has authority under the law through its investment laws to enter into this sort of an agreement.","David Gagliano","Okay, great. Thanks for clarify. And then back to the Rio Tinto discussion, just for a second. Another clarification question, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way. If Freeport was required for whatever reason to divest down to that 49% ownership. After Rio Tinto comes in beginning in 2022, does that essentially mean the net result for Freeport would basically be that the company goes from having the rights to essentially 91% of Grasberg\u2019s volumes today down to about 9% by the beginning of 2022 or am I thinking about that the wrong way?","Richard Adkerson","Well, if you would look through it, after what is the net Freeport interest in this, today, as we sit here today, PTFI has let\u2019s just say virtually all the interest through 2021. Rio Tinto has a small piece of that. After 2021, Rio Tinto has 40%, PTFI has 60%. FCX owns 90% of PTFI, so it would be 90% of 60% would be 54%. If we divest --.","Kathleen Quirk","Half of our interest [ph].","Richard Adkerson","Well, if we divest, let\u2019s say, 30%.","Kathleen Quirk","So, it's still the 20%.","Richard Adkerson","Yeah, so if we divest 20% in Indonesian interest, we'd own 30%, FCX would own 70%. So FCX would own 70% of 60% or 42% net interest. If we divest it half, FCX would own 50% of 70%, or 35%.","David Gagliano","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that.","Kathleen Quirk","And David, I know your speaking questions more from a big picture standpoint, but because of metal strip adjustments, the 60:40 split will probably be more like a 2023 event.","Richard Adkerson","Yeah, because that\u2019s been adjusted for -- for example when we had the almost seven months inability to export. And we\u2019ve had some other interruption in operations over the years that triggered an adjustment to the effective date of Rio Tinto\u2019s 40% interest.","David Gagliano","All right. Appreciate. Thank you for clarifying.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR & Company. Please go ahead.","Lucas Pipes","Yes, thank you very much for taking my question and sorry to belabor the point, but it\u2019s about Indonesia. Richard, I think you mentioned that you are prepared to go to arbitration. And I think you also mentioned that it\u2019s a function of whether you obtain the export license. Could you clarify as to what is the timing, let\u2019s say, a month from now, mid-February, you don\u2019t have an export license, would that be the time that you go to arbitration?","And then secondly, you also mentioned that arbitration would have negative consequences or there are a number of downsides for Indonesia. Could you tell us what those are? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. To coin a phrase, I don\u2019t want to draw a red line here. I mean, we are -- if we got to the point of where the government is just arbitrarily saying they\u2019re not going to grant us export license unless we convert to an IUPK without conditions, then we would have no recourse other than going into arbitration. But we believe we -- I want tell you what I believe, I believe we will be granted export, and we\u2019ll have a period of time to negotiate these things. That's what I believe is going to happen.","But the point that would trigger it, Lucas, is if the government just said no we're not going to talk with you anymore, we're not going to negotiate, you either have a choice of going to the IUPK and not exporting, then we're not left with any room on it. So that's the key.","And then, from the Government of Indonesia's standpoint, you see advertisements here of the government encouraging foreign investment. They had a section in the USA Today, you can their ads in the Charlie Rose most nights. You know they -- the country needs international investments to achieve its economic goals and I've listened very carefully to President Joko Widodo on his trips to the U.S. and at APIC and I feel very positive about his philosophy about investments and so forth. So here Freeport is among the oldest and largest investors in the history of the company -- country, and it's almost history of the company too, but I meant to say country.","And so, for us to have to a very public dispute over things like this would be negative for both of us.","Lucas Pipes","Okay, thank you, thank you very much for that clarification, I appreciate that, good luck.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you very much Lucas, and listen everyone long call, for those of you still on, thank you for your interest and I appreciate that you have a lot of questions about this Act II. You can tell just how focused we are on it. It's good to be in a position of our company, where it is -- it was a priority all during the year, I made five or six trips there year in the midst of all this other stuff. I was just there and we're going to stay with it and work to resolve this problem and then next year I think we're looking at Act III and hopefully that will be looking to invest in all these great resources that we have from a very copper market.","So, good luck to all of us and thank you for your interest.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today, thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect."],"10304":["Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

[Operator Instructions] ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Red Conger, and Mike Kendrick. We also have Mark Johnson who has dialed into the call from our site in Papua, Indonesia.","I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who'll be reviewing our performance and outlook and using the prepared slide materials that are available on our website.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $140 million, or $0.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $2.3 billion or $1.55 per share for the full year 2018. We had a number of special nonrecurring items in the quarter, these are detailed on Page \u2013 Roman numeral VII of our press release the charges netted to a net charge of $21 million or $0.02 a share. They included $331 million in charges related to disputed Cerro Verde royalty claims and some charges at PT-FI. These were largely offset by $310 million in tax credits and gains on asset sales. Excluding these net charges, our adjusted fourth quarter net income totaled $161 million or $0.11 per share.","Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, for fourth quarter 2018 totaled $885 million and we've got a reconciliation on Page 33 of our slide deck providing the EBITDA calculation. Our fourth quarter production totaled 841 million pounds of copper and 334,000 ounces of gold. Our production was higher than our sales which totaled 785 million pounds of copper and that was similar to our October 2018 guidance, but our gold sales of 266,000 ounces were about 64,000 ounces below our 2018 guidance.","And this is purely a timing issue related to a delay in shipments at PT-FI late in the quarter associated with some unscheduled maintenance at the third-party operated Gresik smelter in Indonesia. So these sales were deferred from the fourth quarter. They will be shipped in the first quarter, but they had an approximate $80 million impact on our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, this was just for the gold deferral.","For the year, our sales of copper totaled 3.8 billion pounds, sales of gold totaled 2.4 million ounces and we sold 94 million pounds of molybdenum. Our fourth quarter realized price for copper was $2.75 per pound and that was 14% below the year ago quarterly average of $3.21 per pound. Gold realized prices in the quarter was $1255 per ounce and that compared to $1285 per ounce in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our unit cost net of byproduct credits on a consolidated basis averaged $1.54 per pound of copper and a $1.7 for the full year.","Operating cash flows for the year totaled $3.9 billion and those exceeded our capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year in a strong position from a cash liquidity position. We ended the year $4.2 billion of cash and consolidated debt totaled $11.1 billion. We have no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials, the slide presentation materials on our website.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning everyone in a very complicated world today, politically and economically and we have a lot of excitement here to report among our management team and globally across our organization. We had a very active year in 2018 and it was culminated by the completion of our transactions with the Government of Indonesia on December 21st. And this is a - frankly a heavy load lifted off as we've been dealing with this for a number of years and in this process, particularly over the past three years in such a positive way is very gratifying.","Now we're focused on 2019 and the years beyond that. Some of our accomplishments in 2018 start with the fact that globally we had a very safe and productive year in our operations. If you look back three years ago, 2015, 2016, when commodity prices were very low, the outlook was very weak. As a company we had a heavy debt burden and it wasn't clear how we're going to deal with that, but in the Americas at that time to conserve cash we ramped down our mining operations and this past year we restored mining operations to establish ourselves for our long-term future of productivity in those mines.","We ramped up our mining activities by nearly 20% and this is going to support our long-term mine plans and preserve our optionality as we go forward. That's like building a new mine when you think about the 20% of an operation this size. We advanced the construction of a new mine at Lone Star. This is an ore resource that joins our Safford mine. That mine was just getting started when Freeport acquired Phelps Dodge in 2007.","It has processing capacity that we're able to utilize productively with developing this new resource. And we continue to drill the Lone Star ore body and resources and really are identifying a massive new resource which will be good for the future of our company, be great for the future of our company. This mine is located just across the mountain ridge from Morenci in Eastern Arizona.","Our mill at Cerro Verde continues to hit new records. This is not the largest milling complex in the world, one of the very largest since we began its operations it has just performed magnificently and continues to do so. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we have a very interesting process this year where we completed an efficiency project using Big Data and artificial intelligence models its lifted productivity with this mine in a low capital-intensive way and now we're going to take that experience and carry it forward to our other mines.","We increased our reserves in the Americas by over 35%. For too long we've held on to using a $2 dollar copper price to determine reserves, we increased that to $2.50 and while this increases the proved and probable reserves that we'll report to the SEC it is also going to be very beneficial as we look to the future when we develop these assets to create additional value for our shareholders out of these operations.","In Indonesia, we made really important progress in preparing our underground mines for the future. This is the future because we will complete mining from the Grasberg pit this year in 2019 the first half of this year. For over a 15-year period now we've been developing this infrastructure including the installation of the state-of-the-art underground rail and overflow systems and we've developed the infrastructure necessary for large-scale underground mining. This is \u2013 we are addressing the size seismicity issues for mining that we've encountered at the separate Deep MLZ mine and the results with that data are encouraging and we're gaining increasing confidence about our ramp-up plans for the Deep MLZ.","Over the next two years now we've been foreshadowing these two years for ever since we developed our long-term mine plans at Grasberg in the mid-1990s, we've been foreshadowing the fact that there would be a transition period as we complete mining in the pit and ramp-up production from two large-scale high-grade underground mines. And we expect production in the Grasberg district will double between 2019 and 2021 and this has always been our plan, but now we got \u2013 we've de-risked the infrastructure development. The transition years are here. This is equivalent to a new startup operation for our mine. We've completed the open pit here and now we're in the underground area. It's a major undertaking that our team has carefully planned over the years and is now executing and it is all going on schedule.","I personally cannot be more pleased with the outcome of our negotiations with the Indonesian Government, all three parties, the Government of Indonesia, our former joint venture partner Rio Tinto and Freeport accomplished each of our fundamental objectives. And for those of you who follow us, you recognize this was no easy feat in the complicated circumstances we faced. But at the end of the day, all of us were happy.","We were successful in maintaining for Freeport the basic economics of this ore body and the deal that we have going forward is roughly equivalent, approximately equivalent to the economics we had under our contract work and it maintained, sustains our exposure to this world-class asset, world's second largest copper mine, and world's largest gold mine, it's a remarkable asset and really worth all the effort that we poured into it over the years.","Really important in this process is we ended the tough, tough negotiations on a positive note. We now have a new partnership structure that strongly aligns Freeport's interest with the Government. For all these years we've been on the opposite side of the table in really an unproductive way. I'm convinced that this will mitigate political risk as we go forward and other major risks related to everything from security to labor relations, community relations. We now have aligned interest. We are partners with a state-owned company. That state-owned company has incurred significant debt to finance this transaction. Just like we, they will be looking to have positive cash flows coming out of this business over time to service that debt and to provide dividends of substance to the Government for years to come.","As a company, I look back three years ago and think of just about how bad our situation was then with markets and with our debt position. Over that time we've reduced our debt. We're in a strong financial and liquidity position, and the steps taken to reduce our debt by nearly two thirds were way beyond the targets we set at this call two years ago, position us now to manage this transition in Indonesian and deal with the market uncertainties that we may face.","We'll talk more about this, but on the call and answer your questions. You know, the fundamentals even today with all the confusion economically in the world and with all the risk that we hear about every day, the fundamentals of the copper market point to a very positive future. In our company and our management team are managing our company's assets to enable our shareholders to benefit significantly from what I'm confident will be strong copper markets ultimately in the future.","With today's uncertainties in the global marketplace, neither we nor anyone else can predict short-term movements in copper prices. But our management team is confident and we have the right portfolio of assets, the right structure and we've de-risked so much of our business over the past three years and particularly in 2018 that we can deliver significant values over the long-term to our shareholder.","So, we are going to now answer your questions about the past if you have any, I'm sure you will, but we are going to focus on what's ahead of us in the future. It's all about execution now. Our team recognizes that. We are focused on it. We have a great track record of executing in project development and operations and now we're going to use those capabilities to build success.","When I sit back and look at it today's world is confused in many respects and dysfunctional. We're not confused at Freeport and we're going to be functional. We know what we need to do and we're going to set out to do it.","So, turning to the slides now, Kathleen has reviewed the 2018 highlights, just a couple of comments. We had this problem with the smelter in Gresik being down. We had 130,000 tons of concentrate that we had produced at Grasberg that was in inventory in our concentrate bonds at Grasberg, normally it is 20,000, so 100,000 tons of concentrate that was produced, otherwise would have been sold if Gresik had been up. We had 60 million pounds of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold that's not in our numbers this year.","Copper prices dropped $0.12 in December. Much of our production for the year is priced at December prices. We've put out a guidance note for our analysts who publish earnings guidance in December. I would encourage you to read that note and apply it. Several analysts didn\u2019t do it this year and that resulted in the expectations about earnings being higher than it otherwise would have been.","So anyway, past is past. We're focusing on the future, Slide 4, summarizes the transaction with the Government of Indonesia. Importantly for our financial reporting purposes, because of the structure of our shareholders' agreement with Inalum, the state owned company, Freeport will continue to consolidate PT-FI and PT-FI is now larger because previously we separated the interest in the joint venture between Freeport and Rio Tinto, now all of that is part of PT-FI. All of that will be in our consolidated results. And our consolidated reserves will be higher as a result of that report. FCX's equity interest in the reserves will be equivalent, will be the same. But those are details and if you have questions we will answer about it.","Now, turning to priorities, here's what we're going to do. We're going to ramp-up production from our large-scale underground mines at Grasberg. Two basic mines, although the Grasberg Block Cave has two headings in some ways could be viewed as two bonds within the Grasberg ore body and the Deep MLZ mine. We're going to focus on productivity and cost management globally in the Americas as well as in Indonesia. We're going to advance this Lone Star development and continue to look at the very exciting long-term expansion opportunities of that ore body. And then we're going to look at other future growth opportunities from our large portfolio of reserves and resources.","We have a great opportunity in Chile with our El Abra mine and then we have a number of opportunities in the U.S. mines. We're going to be evaluating them and ranking them and be prepared to go forward when markets give us the comfort to go forward. We're not going to be spending capital in those in the near term.","So copper markets, you know in the face of all the investment - investor uncertainties that come about for obvious reasons that still retain their concerns about the ultimate risks to the economy in China and the global economy from a number of items, including the unfortunate trade policy issues that are being considered now. The fundamentals in the marketplace remain very strong. China set records for copper imports. They are continuing to invest in smelting capacities. They are reducing scrap going into China. There's just a lot of things about China.","China as a country has enormous financial resources. They are looking at stimulating their economy, investing in one road initiatives. China has lots of alternatives of dealing with issues it faces in the current marketplace. Time will tell whether this will develop into a serious problem and we'll be prepared for that. But today, the outlook going forward is good.","In the U.S. it is really amazing, we supply maybe a third of the copper to the downstream market. We're stretched. We're not being able to commit - to meet all the commitments of our U.S. customers. We actually have to go out and buy some copper. Can you imagine that Freeport, the world's largest operator of copper mines is having to buy some copper to fulfill customer demands in the U.S. All of this is really contrary to investor sentiment, investor sentiment is what it is. We live with it. But the market is fundamentally continues to be strong and then we look forward. We look at the declines in base production, you know experts are analyzing that to be over 5% over the next 10 years.","If you look at modest demand growth, if we use 1.5% over the next 10 years you end up needing almost 5 million pounds of new copper per year, 5 million tons of new copper per year. And today it takes prices well over $3 a pound to justify new investments. So there's coming times when copper prices will simply have to rise. And then you look at where is today's copper coming from.","And on Slide 7, the slide you've seen from us before you see the reserves in production from the top 10 copper mines in the world today, we have three of the five largest producing mines in the world. In aggregate those mines only produced 5.4 million tons a year in 2018. So you come back having to replace all of these mines 10 years out, it's a good outlook.","So here's what our reserves are. We have \u2013 I've been talking with our team for some time now about why do we continue to use $2 copper. So we've changed to $2.50 copper in the Americas and that resulted in about a quarter increase in our reserves just by using that price. And that's not just an accounting exercise. That's helping us as we look to see where we rank these investment opportunities going forward. That's proved and probable reserves under SEC industry standards.","Beyond that we have an equivalent amount of mineralized material associated with our existing mines that with additional drilling analysis, engineering planning and so forth could well come into reserves. Half of these resources roughly are in the U.S. So we are positioned as a company to benefit from this coming positive copper markets and have the ability to deal with it if in fact we have to deal with economic weakness.","More information on reserves are shown on Page 9 and most of the additions that came about are in the Americas. We doubled our reserves at Bagdad which is a really attractive future investment opportunity mine for us. We've added significant reserves to Morenci. We've added reserves at Cerro Verde. Our reserves will also grow because the consolidation, the inclusion of the former Rio Tinto interest into PT-FI and the continued consolidation of PT-FI, big reserves, big resources.","Cerro Verde, the operations are really going well. This is really a great mine. So glad we buckled up and made the decision to do the major expansion that we completed and started ramping it up three years ago. And the concentrator facilities, leading - industry-leading in size are performing well exceeding nameplate capacity and so this is a great mine, really pleased it is part of our portfolio.","Lone Star, I mentioned there is a picture here. We're minding leachable oxide ore now, doing stripping. That's going to be a very profitable project for us. 5.6 billion pounds of copper, it's strictly leaching using the facilities that are already in place at the adjoining Safford mine. So that going to be a good project, but what's really exciting is beyond those 5.6 billion pounds of reserves now, we have 50 billion to 70 billion pounds of resources, enormous opportunity driven by the sulfide resources underneath these oxide resources that we're producing.","We also have a sizable sulfide opportunity at Safford which has been to-date strictly a leaching operation. And so this has the opportunity of being a Morenci class mine as we go forward right in the heart of our operations in a community where they are welcoming mine activities part of the Brownfield expansion really exciting.","Grasberg underground, this is just really going to be amazing. In the future as we look out beyond the ramp-up the primary asset is going to be the Grasberg Block Cave. Now this is the same ore body that we've been mining from the surface since early 1990s, not a different ore body. It is just physically, it is more economically to access it underground now from the surface. We'll be ramping this single underground mine.","It will have two headings and Mark Johnson is on the call with us, it's late at night. He is in \u2013 came back for, but it's really in effect like two mines because it's two headings, ramping up to 130,000 tons a day from this ore body by 2023. We had our first drawbell blast on December 15. I was in Jakarta and that was exciting to be late at night at the Fairmont Hotel and watch that first blast go off on the screen and that's just one evidence of the progress we've made in developing the infrastructure.","Now, it's important to note that his is an ore body we know. The Deep MLZ where we've had the mining and do seismic activities and separate mineralization area, an area where we began block cave mining in the early 1980s and have extended the depth, it is 1500 meters below the surface with 300 meters below the surface with the Grasberg Block Cave mine, different rock environment. We know the rock. We're comfortable that we won't have to deal with the conditioning exercises we're having to do at the Deep MLZ with the fracking operations.","The Deep MLZ will be ramping up we feel confident to 80,000 tons a day by 2022. We began the fracking operations in 2018 to manage the seismic events, precondition the cave. This is not first time it's been done in the industry, first time we've done it and results to date are very encouraging and giving us increasing confidence about our ramp-up schedule. We have an inventory of 70 drawbells. So we are prepared to have this ramp-up going and we're giving you our estimate as to how we'll achieve which is shown here on Page 13.","First half of 2019 we've basically finished at the bottom of the pit. We're looking out for opportunities to in the pit to get some incremental high grade ore as we finish mining in the pit. And one way we're doing that the primary way is we're mining out the ramp roads that have led down there is very hard grade and that will be the bulk of the source of our ore production during the first half of 2019, and then you can see in these schedules are the other mines will ramp-up.","So we're into this transition period 2019-2020. We have an increasing confidence about our ability to meet our targets and we will end up with the Grasberg mine operating with totally underground feed with the mill of over 200,000 tons per day of very high grade copper and gold ore. And now the decks are cleared of all these issues that we've had with the government for us to proceed to do that in a business like fashion and it will be our primary focus.","So we've got a global footprint of course are key parts of the companies that we operate all the assets and we have ownership interest in, you know we're not minority owners, we're not joint venture participants, but we have the ability to benefit from having a common operating group managing all these operations and that gives us lot of synergies to deal with both in supply chains and people and mine planning and so forth.","The large part of our resource and reserves are in the Americas, 70%. We got a great team, real hot around here. Everybody is excited. We are ramping-up the operations today. We're planning for future development and all of us are happy about it. The leading position in the United States, you know looking back a number of years ago, mining the Southwest copper district was dead. Now it's really exciting. We got favorable tax situation. We have a huge operating loss carry forward from oil and gas investment.","So taxes will be minimal in the U.S. going forward and improved regulatory environment. We have really good relationships with the states where we operate. And the energy situation in the U.S. with shale oil shale gas, flexibility of labor. We don\u2019t have labor unions here. We have communities that support the families that work at our business. So anyway it's \u2013 we're really excited about our business in the U.S. Great opportunity in Chile with El Abra, world-class mine in Peru and of course Indonesia being historically tremendous asset.","We showed this I think last quarter, but I want to come back to it, about just how difficult it would be to replicate what we have here at Freeport. You know, if we look at the copper equivalent capacity of our company, 4.5 billion pounds of annual production extending for as far as you can see, the cost to develop Greenfield capacity is $8 to $10 a pound, that indicates that to replace what we already have now could be in the order of $35 billion to $45 billion. Time will justify this and we are focused on giving the market the bases to do it.","So we got our 2019 outlook. It is very consistent with what we had before. Unit cost will be higher the next two year than they have been or will be because of the volumes with the transition at Grasberg and then will affect our cash flows for our two-year period, but this is just like someone starting up a new mine, whether that mine is in Mongolia or Africa or Panama or whatever. It is a ramp-up period and that's what we have.","Capital expenditures are consistent with what we've got it to before. A large portion of these were related to projects, it'll be adding significant future production. You can see our sales profile which will be increasing as we go through the ramp-up years. And then gold sales is particularly evident of course that's Grasberg and that's where we're having the transition. Slide 17 shows the volumes in cost by region. Our cost in the Americas has been fairly consistent. Each mine will be affected by some volume differences, but the fundamental cost situation is under control and remaining the same.","Consolidated cost we're showing at current commodity prices for 2019 to be a $1.73, but that's with Grasberg being at $1.55 a pound. We think Grasberg after the transition will be no more than $0.30, maybe lower depending on commodity prices and if we pro-forma for that our cost would be a $1.30 versus a $1.73. We just keep willing to drive home the fact that we're in a transition year. ","This is page 18, and it shows what our average EBITDA and operating cash flows will be on average for 2019 and 2020 and then after the ramp up how much it will grow. So I'll let you look at those numbers and I think they're evidence for what we're doing there.","No significant changes to our capital expenditures. The bulk of our major mining projects are Grasberg underground development. And our financial policy, we are going to be studying and ranking future investment opportunities. We're not planning to commit major amounts of new capital to those projects. We're going to continue with Grasberg and with Lone Star, but we're going to be looking at attractive projects for the future.","We're going to continue to be focused on improving our balance sheet to the extent we get the period where we're generating excess cash, maintaining our current dividend and what we're really looking forward to is having production ramp-up, more positive copper pricing environment and that will allow us the ability to pay cash dividends as has been our tradition at Freeport.","So, that is where we are as I said in a complicated dysfunctional world in many respects. We are very excited about where we are and we are focused on moving forward to make our company really successful for our shareholders. So, Regina we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry","Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Two questions from me, the first one in your slide deck, Slide 27 where you've got the quarterly sales forecast for 2019, just looking for a little bit more color on the ramp-up of the two headers at the Grasberg underground presumably the first quarter of 2019 guidance the 825 million pounds includes a little bit of the sales that did not come true from 4Q 2018, I think 2Q 2019 from what you've said includes some of the open pit material at the slightly high grade is that really the second half of the year where we then more reliant [ph] completely on the underground, just trying to step through the profile there? That's the first question and just on your projects beyond Lone Star, can you rank at this stage what the order of preference would be for any new projects including El Abra or North American options? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Okay, so Chris, you're exactly right. I mean you're reading the slides, the first half of the year the bulk of production at Grasberg is going to come from the open pit ramp mining and then by the end of the year the Grasberg Block Cave will be commencing production. We also over time have developed stockpiles of material that we will use to maintain as much throughput through our mill as we can, but that's been a long term plan to stockpile some lower than average grade material and that will be available for us as well.","Kathleen Quirk","And for the year Deep MLZ represents about 12% of our production, so relatively small percentage in 2019 and Grasberg Block Cave is under 10% for 2019. The rest of it will come from the open pit. The DOZ mine which has been operated for several years now is the other piece of this in addition to stockpiles and a small amount from Big Gossan as well.","Richard Adkerson","Mark, do you have anything to add to that, we [indiscernible]?","Mark Johnson","No, that's perfect. We've also ramped up the Big Gossan and it'll be at full production of 7000 tons a day by the third quarter and it will consistently supply about just over 10% of the copper and about 4% to 5% of the gold.","Richard Adkerson","So Chris, with regard to ranking I'd be careful because we can get some fairly heated discussions internally about that. We started out with a base I think with El Abra. It's \u2013 for a mine that felt by this time would be depleted and when we acquired Phelps Dodge almost 12 years ago now, our subsequent core drilling and exploration now since it gives a really exciting opportunity. We own 51% of that mine. Codelco is our partner and Codelco is very positive about expansion.","On the other hand, the U.S. has the benefits of the - that I mentioned, energy cost, labor flexibility which Chile is recognizing is an impediment to that country's future in the mining industry now and we own 100% of the mines. We own the land and sea here. And our workers drive their pickup trucks to work and carry lunch pails and send their kids to community and state schools and have hospitals. So there are a lot of advantages in the U.S. Leading the pack right now in terms of timing would be Bagdad. We\u2019ve invested in water resources which is a constraint there.","We've done some work on land rights for tailings disposal and it's less capital intensive, smaller, easy executional project. And then longer range we've got some very large projects to consider, Lone Star and at Morenci and even in New Mexico where our mines are very old, but as we can continue to keep drilling these old ore bodies we get excited about what we're seeing there. So it will be a horse race to decide what to do, not a decision we will reach. We'll continue our work throughout the year and report to you how that analysis is going. ","Chris Terry","Okay, thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Alright, thanks Chris.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Gagliano","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just, I had a quick question first of all on the capital spending for the Indonesia smelter, the slides obviously are before CapEx for the smelter and I know it's early days, when do you expect to start spending?","Richard Adkerson","All right, so we have been spending some planning money to date, we will continue with that. Significant capital spending won't come into play until 2020. And we are now engaged in conversations about potential partners, about financing structure and how that will be dealt with. So we've deferred that until we got our deal done, the deal is done. We're now actively pursuing that project and you can expect updates through 2019 as we go forward, but not much in the way of capital during 2019.","Kathleen Quirk","And David, we will just point out on Slide 19 where we show capital expenditures, those are consolidated. And now we're bringing in all the aggregate capital from Indonesia whereas the previous structure was Rio Tinto. Their contribution was not included in our capital. So our capital spending really from what our previous guidance has not changed. We'll get under the economic arrangement we have with our new shareholder we'll have them make a contribution similar to what Rio Tinto would have otherwise done, but that won't be netted in our capital like it had been before.","And with respect to the smelter, as Richard said, we are focused on, we're doing the front end engineering right now and while we're in those planning stages, we are going to work to try to find partners that may be interested in off take or other participation in the smelter. Ideally we'd like to structure the smelter similar to what we did with the original smelter we build in Indonesia where. PT-FI provided a contract to a smelter, project company that used that contract to finance the smelter, but we don't know yet. This is all new in terms of getting the deal done in Indonesia. So as we go forward, we're going to look to minimize equity contributions from FCX and look to try to find financing for the smelter as long term as possible to reflect the long term nature of the assets and the amortization of the smelter will have over time.","Richard Adkerson","And Dave, let me make a couple of side comments on all this. All of the issues related to capital allocations in the smelter were settled with Inalum during our negotiations. Rio Tinto was a great partner of ours since the mid 1990s, but there were some issues related to the smelter and cost allocations in the final years before they went up to 40% that were unresolved. We resolved those now and those are settled with Inalum in a fair way and in a way that was consistent with the Rio Tinto deal.","And when you think about the smelter, Indonesia really is exposed to roughly 50% of the economics of the smelter through taxes and royalties. Now they have a 50% equity interest. So 70% to 75% of the economics of the smelter will be borne by the Government of Indonesia and Freeport's exposure to the smelter which in today's world and perceivable world will have an economic impact is limited to 25% to 30%. I think that's obvious, but I think it's something I just wanted to point out.","David Gagliano","I appreciate the extra details and color, it's always helpful. Just one other quick question, if you could just take a step back, obviously commodity price is down, all the big producers are out saying there's really not any good projects out there and so I just wanted to ask if you could give us an update on your thoughts regarding M&A activity in the sector in general and where Freeport shakes out?","Richard Adkerson","So Dave, you and others read what other companies say and there is a consensus across the industry among the diversified companies that puts copper as a top priority of every company. I mean every company talks about that. And yet, as you point out the opportunities for investments are very limited just because of geology and politics and the nature of the ore bodies that are available to the industry right now. So over time I think there will be a strong desire for companies to try to expand their copper business and they're going to be limited by their ability to do that through exploration and development activities and I think that will add to the value of Freeport's assets.","We don't have any strategy about M&A that's been formally adopted. We're going to be in the marketplace, looking for ways to increase shareholder value and that is the total focus of our company as we go forward. My long career in this industry, my observation is M&A opportunities emerge, people get in trouble when they try to force M&A ideas into a company's strategy, but they tend to be more, the good ones tend to be more opportunistic like our acquisition of Phelps Dodge wasn't a strategy that we planned. It was an opportunity that emerged because of the circumstances of Phelps Dodge, the circumstances of Freeport, the circumstances in the financial marketplace at the time and I think that'll drive, what we do in the future, opportunities.","David Gagliano","Okay, just to clarify, is Freeport would you say more of a buyer or a seller?","Richard Adkerson","I can see strategy working either way.","David Gagliano","Okay, thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Well, having said that to be a buyer would be faces an uphill challenge with us because we have all these resources where we're not getting any credit for in our current valuation and if we create values in those undeveloped resources all of that goes to benefit our shareholders. If you buy anything you have to pay the other company shareholders something, so it would be a real uphill battle for us to find an acquisition opportunity that makes sense for us.","David Gagliano","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Chris LaFemina","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just first a couple of quick questions on the transition to Grasberg and then one on costs for the entire company. So it looks like you actually slightly increased your production guidance from the Deep MLZ for 2020 and 2021 is that just a function as being more confident in the results of the hydraulics fracturing or something else going on there?","And I guess kind of along those lines, what milestones should we be looking for are you looking for at the Block Cave and at the Deep MLZ through 2019 and 2020 that would give you even further confidence in the kind of successful transition to the ramp-up and production from those assets.","Richard Adkerson","Okay, so the changes at Deep MLZ are just part of the natural updates of outlooks and here at Freeport we don't have an annual planning process. We update our mine plans every quarter. Before - at the end of every quarter we have a meeting where all of our mine managers globally come in, analyze what\u2019s happened in the past quarter, how their plans were changed. And so it's a dynamic real-time updating and when you see adjustments like that that just reflects the information that came into the quarter. You won't see having these big adjustments based on annual planning process. Anyway, my experience has shown me it's best to stay on top of these things real-time and that's what we do.","Kathleen Quirk","Mark, do you want to comment on its roughly 2000 tons a day, more in 2020 and 2021, do you want to comment on some of the progress we're making at Deep MLZ?","Mark Johnson","Yes, really the only difference on that is that with the hydro fracing success that we've had, we\u2019ve began to pull the ore body now. We have them for the last three months and what's happening is, as we frac the ore body, we watch very closely the air gap between the muck pile and the cave back where that's very small in a lot of cases it's less than 5 meters. ","We pull the material to continue to open up the space for the ore body to continue to propagate. And so that came on quicker than what we had previously forecasted, so we're continuing to do that today. We have days now on the Deep MLZ with the developments material that we, that is in ore grade also and the pulling of the cave were up over 10,000 tons which is marginally above what we had forecast last quarter. So we're very optimistic on that. We continue to frac in that area that's going to be one of our key milestones.","We just recently commissioned our second hydro fracing pump. We've got six drill rigs, supplying the holes for the two hydro fracing pumps. So for me the deep MLZ it will be continued, the milestones will be continued success on the hydro fracing and we'll begin undercutting. We're forecasting to begin undercutting again in the Deep MLZ in April. So that will be driven by this continued success on the drill holes in the fracing, that goes along with them. In the Grasberg it's, there's really, it's just a matter now of undercutting and blasting drawbells and we've gotten off to a good start there were slightly ahead.","And we don't see any issues there we've got a lot of development already in place in the undercut that we'll be developing over the next three years really. So it's just a continued ramp up of that, the trains and ongoing state of commissioning, but we see good progress on that. The ore flow was commissioned back in 2018 and really nothing that we need to do with the ore flow system in the next couple of years to meet the increasing production.","Chris LaFemina","So aside from the, aside from the seismic, the mining of the seismic activity in the DMLZ you haven't really had any significant operational surprises at the Block Cave or at the DMLZ it seems like things are going pretty well recently, is that fair to say?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, that is, the fracking, we've seen a much better response than we first had anticipated the case propagating better than we anticipated vertically and were establishing this fracking along the perimeter of the cave to where we'll be able to successfully and safely advance the undercut, so it has gone slightly better than what we anticipated in the last forecast.","Chris LaFemina","Thank you for that. And then, sorry, Richard just one last question from me on the pro forma cost guidance of a $1.30 per pound, obviously the reduction 2019 into that is due to Grasberg. But what should we, how should we think about unit costs in North America and at [indiscernible] I guess over the last five years there's been some pretty stiff cost inflation in both of those regions and is any of that reversible or are we kind of looking at knew, the current kind of cost rates are going to be the normalized run rates of those assets, how is that going to change over time?","Richard Adkerson","So, part of what you've seen in recent years was this ramp up of mining activity that we were restoring these curtailments that we put in place back in 2015 and 2016 for financial reasons. Had we not done that Chris, we would have seen volumes fall off because we weren\u2019t mining at optimal rates to maintain production. So we've incurred some additional costs, I mean 20% ramp up involves a lot of people and equipment and so now we believe we've got it at roughly here red right. We've got it at really a stable operating rates and then we'll be just subject to the normal factors that affect call structures and to date we're not seeing anything like that, that's a major concern for us. We've done this great job with truck rebuilds. Red, was the last time we bought a haul truck?","Red Conger","2008, a brand new\u2026","Richard Adkerson","A brand new\u2026","Red Conger","We bought 150 of them over the last 12 years.","Richard Adkerson","We've added 50 of them and so we're doing things like that. Our entire age is going great, so when you look past all the issues at Freeport have been related to the Indonesian contract and the transition underground. We've had a big part of our business has just been focused on nuts and bolts and doing a great job of that.","Kathleen Quirk","So in that one third we\u2019ve got relatively stable costs in the Americas forecast.","Chris LaFemina","Perfect. Thank you for that. Good luck.","Richard Adkerson","I appreciate it Chris.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Korn","Hi, good morning everybody. The question, when you think about your potential growth portfolio beyond that of Lone Star, the prospects you've outlined for Cerro Verde, Bagdad, Safford, et cetera. You laid out this incentive price of $3.30, I know it's probably the most challenging question for a mining company when you have a long lead time between cash investment and incremental revenues. But what does the market look like where you make that decision saying, yes it's time to put in this capital. Price is 3.30 it stays there a quarter, two quarters, you know practically is that enough and if not what is?","Richard Adkerson","I don't think you can simplify, it it's not just like the price, the current price or whether it will last couple of quarters or not. We don't allow ourselves to focus on a price. That's what history has taught me. We look at a scenario of prices. We don't think that you're going to get to a price analysts used to get upset when because with me, because they said what's your long term price and I say we don\u2019t have one.","What we would do as we look at these projects is look at the market, see what the opportunity would create for us if we did the project and got those volumes and had the benefit of the prices that were available and then we would risk it. We would say okay, if you make that investment prices drop not on that project alone but how would that fit in to your total portfolio of assets? What would that do to the company? Is the company financially strong enough and we're so much better now than we have been.","And how we fit in? We've benefited back, we undertook three projects at once coming out of the 2008, 2009 downturn. We did an expansion of thinking expansion at Morenci, the major expansion at Cerro Verde. And we looked at all of those and strategically we come back to the fact that you've got Grasberg there with this high volumes and significant cop a go component giving you this long line, low cost reserve. That was the whole basis for the Phelps Dodge deal.","So as we look at future opportunities, we go this base for the company of Grasberg there is now de-risk in a major, major way to support our company and that will allow us to be more aggressive in terms of looking at those investments. It s not looking at them on a standalone basis. So, I can't give you a formula, but is we hopefully get past these trade issues and the Brexit and the government shutdown and get some clarity on what the Fed's interest rate policies are going to be and what the global economy is going to be and how China deals, all these things they'll come together and they'll give us a view as to what's the time to start these.","You correctly pointed out they are very long term investments. The price of copper jumped to $5 today, we would have significant incremental production for six, seven years and so there's going to be a coming time, unless there's some really disaster economically in China and the world where you're likely to see really, really high copper price. I mean it's just, you just read the tea leaves, look at these basic numbers and say, how are you going to replace the top 10 mines in the world in 10 years. That's not going to come from what's on the schedule right now. The prices have got to go way up. People are going scrambling to produce copper. We've got the resources to do it in a productive way and that's what the future is going to be.","Kathleen Quirk","The other thing we're doing in for our North American projects is, we're going through some work right now, some technical work to try to bring down the capital intensity of investments and that we\u2019re working on some of concentrator designs that may allow us to bring in projects from the lower capital intensity standpoint than what just a conventional technology would bring.","So we want to get the results of that, those studies done and in the meantime we're doing some value engineering on the El Abra feasibility study so that we can be in a position to make decisions and rank these projects and sequence them in a way that drives the most value for our company. So we've got the inventory, but we want to do them in the most economic way that we can and so we're going through some time during this market uncertainty to study ways to bring down the capital intensity of the projects.","Matthew Korn","Thanks Kathleen.","Richard Adkerson","And this is a team that was a world leader in [indiscernible] and SAG mill development, high pressure grinding mill development, the development of Tinchi [ph] was technically industry leading and now with this new mill design that we did at Morenci. All of that's coming together to allow us to look at the next stage of how do you do these things with less capital, less energy, less carbon emissions, all the things that better recoveries. Better recoveries and now using this big data analysis project that we've done at Bagdad, that's what we've got to this company is going to be about and I really look forward to having earnings calls talking about these things rather than negotiations with governments.","Matthew Korn","Thanks, I appreciate that. That leads to my next question. I wanted to ask a little bit on the CapEx side, Slide 19 we see the other mining creep up a bit $800 million to $1 billion by 2020. The major project holding at $1.5 billion over 2019 and 2020 although, price per call did $900 million, Lone Star declines by $200 million. So given what you just said, could you break down what regions which mines are driving a little bit of a pop and the other mining whether we should be thinking about a $1 billion consolidated as the standard capital going forward and then as you're getting to 2020 what else is popping into that major projects bucket?","Richard Adkerson","Well, so with the sustaining capital some of that affects this ramp-up effect that we talked about. Not only you can constrain operations we choked by necessity, maintenance capital, and I mean these quarter meetings we had was, back and forth between the teams and our Kathleen and the financial staff, and so now we're having to go back and do some things that we had deferred and that's all that that is. And so, I think the sustaining capital that you see in those years should be more normal and we'll find ways to try to reduce it. There won't be any unexpected increases right, all right write that down. That won\u2019t be coming in there.","And then by 2020 we may well have clarity on where we're going next with El Abra, Bagdad and other things that we'll be dealing with. So we'll just, we'll be updating, the milestones will be apparent to all of you now, because every quarter we're going to be talking about it. And that's the way this will unfold.","Kathleen Quirk","There's not anything major besides the underground and Safford, Lone Star. We do have some capital at El Abra that we're doing the next phase of the new leach pad at [indiscernible] to extend the life of our software [ph] project there. So it's the bulk of it is coming from Safford, I mean Lone Star and Grasberg underground.","Matthew Korn","All right, best of luck guys.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead.","Alex Hacking","Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. I guess, just following up on Indonesia, my first question, I noticed that the mining rights have been extended through 2031 at a 10-year period, not 2041. Was that always expected to be the case? And then secondly, the extension there was contingent on building the smelter and I guess paying taxes and royalties and any other contingencies on that extension? Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Okay, no we always knew that because of Indonesian mining law and regulations that we had to do 10 by 10 two 10-year and part of the negotiations were and that was the case with old contract, that was a primary term to 2021 then we had rights to 2041 in two 10-year increments, past 2021. So we always knew we had to deal with that, a focused area of negotiations where what was going to be the contingencies for that 2031 to 2041 and we ended up agreeing that there would be very specific criteria and we said that with those criteria met it would be automatic and those criteria are simply this.","We pay our taxes and royalties, pay what's due, we build a smelter. Other than that, there's no environmental review or other administrative, no - we thought we could all come with our rights on to the cab, but the - the Indonesian Government had to grant those extensions without unreasonable - without any unreasonable delay. There are no reasonableness on this. It's measurable, specific criteria is totally expected by the government and by last that we will extend and now our partner Inalum well had to be extended. So we're in a much better position than we were under our [indiscernible] in many respects and this is one of them.","Alex Hacking","Okay, thanks Richard, that's very clear. And then once Grasberg is through the transition it's going to be a big cash cow, do you have any kind of guarantees on your ability to get that cash out of Indonesia? Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","We do, and one of the things that was again a focus point of negotiations was that within the shareholders agreement is an agreement on financial policy. Dividends will not be set by the Board of Commissioners or Board of Directors. There's an agreement that to the extent that cash is generated from the operation beyond in excess of its capital expenditures and other cash requirements, that's going to be distributed as dividends and there's no restrictions on that. So we have a set financial policy that goes to 2041. The entity can't incur debt without mutual agreement so\u2026","Alex Hacking","Okay, thanks. Again, very clear and then just one final one if I may. On the Cerro Verde royalty dispute, do you anticipate any midterm cash flow impacts from that and does it affect your 2019 cost guidance in anyway? Thanks.","Kathleen Quirk","We've got some payments worked into our plan where we are paying some amounts in installments under protest. We're going to continue to pursue legal strategy to get those payments back, but we do have some amounts going through our cash flows over time to pay on those obligations for those claims.","Alex Hacking","Okay, thanks Kathleen. Best of luck. Thank you again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Murphy","Hi, I had a question, another one on the Grasberg Block Cave ramp up. I'm just wondering how major this first drop point blast, is this is being followed up with like mocking and this cave is propagating or is it still very early days, so I'm just wondering how you look at the de-risking of the project over the course of the year and what stage do you think you feel more comfortable with kind of with the proof of concept here?","Richard Adkerson","Okay, Mark.","Mark Johnson","Yes, it's the first step, so it's significant in that the blast went well, good fragmentation. We are not - right now what we do until we hit a hydraulic radius in this area of the Grasberg Block Cave as we continue to do the same thing. We continue to undercut blasts and follow it up with a drawbell blast. We are about 50% of the hydraulic radius and that's the span with which the cave we had expected to start caving on its own. We expect to be at hydraulic radius late second quarter, early third quarter this year and at that point you can start to muck the drop points that you've already blasted while you continue to add new drop points as Richard stated the Grasberg Block Cave is - we've got multiple work areas there it's essentially \u2013 it's mineralization, but the geometry is essentially, we have two mines that we're developing concurrently that share the same infrastructure.","We have two fronts right now that we already established with the undercut sequencing on the very southern portion of the ore body. And within this quarter we start to develop the northern limb of the ore body and that will continue on in a similar fashion. We don't see any surprises. Like Richard said, we know this ore body very well. We're not deep. There's the geology and mapping is indicated the same fracture frequency and consistency of the rock that we had initially modeled. So I really don't see any issues there in fact. You know we think that there's potential for upside, we've got a lot of the construction ahead in the Grasberg Block Cave a lot of the drawbells have been constructed and are ready to be blasted.","So we've got a good inventory of development ahead of us. The infrastructure is in place. We continue to add ventilation and pumping systems as we need to, but we're in very good shape in the Grasberg Block Cave.","Matthew Murphy","Okay, thanks for that. I mean not to get too bogged down on details, but I'm just trying to picture, I mean you've got a big open pit and a lot of rainfall above this area, just wondering at what point do you start seeing some of that water flow and how do you deal with it? Thanks. ","Richard Adkerson","Yes, we've got extensive drainage within the grasp of blockade development. We end up fortunately for an underground mine our failsafe is that gravity drains out to the rich camp area. We've got the attics that are at a lower elevation. If the pumping systems were to go off the failsafe would be is that the access drifts are built to handle the peak flows that we've modeled. We put a lot of effort into deep watering along the periphery of the Grasberg Block Cave to keep the groundwater away from the cave and that's going well.","We've got surface training systems at the Grasberg around the pit that will continue to maintain to minimize the amount of surface water that gets into the cave. We've done a lot of work on this we've looked at a lot of contingencies and we feel very good about the system that we have and essentially the pumping system that we put in is purely to more economically provide the mill with water. If it wasn't for the mill needing water we could essentially let gravity do its thing at the GDC with all the drainage systems that we're putting in as part of the Block Cave development.","Matthew Murphy","So Mark, when do we put in the [indiscernible] attic?","Mark Johnson","Yes, it was in the 1990, actually this was probably about 1995 because we found the big [indiscernible] with that.","Matthew Murphy","So the only point of that is this water management issue is not a new issue associated with the current development. It has been something that's been part of this operation from the very start and what we've done in the past will allow us to deal with these issues that you raised.","Mark Johnson","One thing, as big as the pit is right now and if you look at what we're doing, we've been very good at being able to manage the pit bottom. We're only pumping about 2000 gallons a minute from the pit bottom and we have access to this [indiscernible] drift that Richard mentions, we still use that for pit dewatering. So we've been able to get keep the pit dewatered with a very minor amount of pumping infrastructure because we can use the access that we have underground and we'll continue to look at those sort of approaches with the GDC.","Matthew Murphy","All right, thanks Mark. Let's move along.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.","Orest Wowkodaw","Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if we could get a bit more color on the cost outlook and I appreciate the long term pro-forma cost guidance you\u2019ve given us here of a $1.30 a pound. Does that imply that we should anticipate costs in North America and South America close to the $2.00 a pound range before thinking about Grasberg?","Richard Adkerson","No, I think it's a $1.70 range not $2.00.","Orest Wowkodaw","That's 70?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, $1.75, that's sort of where we are now and that's what our current outlook is unless there's some major changes in the input cost.","Orest Wowkodaw","But what drives down from I think you're guiding this here in North America cost of a $1.86, so what, in the future I would think rates declined, what would be driving the long term cost per pound down?","Kathleen Quirk","Richard was talking about a blend between North America and South America\u2026","Richard Adkerson","I was talking about the Americas combination. So if you look at South America, North America combined which we look at is kind of one business unit, that's where the combined rate was.","Mark Johnson","But in general, the maintenance costs that Richard referred to that we've been incurring catching up those all level of get back in sequence. And we get back to those historical rates","Richard Adkerson","This is not - the nature of these ore bodies, they're low grade, but they don't have significant declines in grade over time. They'll change year-to-year, but it's not a question like a big open pit war free where you mine the high grades first. I mean the highest grades remind you of 100 years ago. So it's more consistent grades than you might see at other mines, and you would see at other mines.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay, and in terms of the reserve increase, how much, can you give us a rough idea what percent of that increase has to do with the copper price change versus additional drilling?","Kathleen Quirk","A big portion of it is related to the copper price change. We did do some drilling at Lone Star and actually have done more drilling that isn't reflected yet in 2018 reserves that will be incorporated into the mines in 2019, but most of that is really dealing with the price assumptions and what we'll do is look at how to develop those reserves over time at the lowest possible cost. And really just expanded the footprint brought in pounds that would meet the reserve criteria 250 or less.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, so what we do is, we look at our current operations that we've got planned and we're just removing this artificial constraint on the footprint of the cone of the reserves that we previously limited to $2 and now it's extended to show what would be economic in $2.50.","Kathleen Quirk","And we'll be likely mining in our $2 reserve plan for a long time. So we try to keep mining in a plan that keeps the cash cost as low as possible. But this gives us more optionality to look at expansions or bringing metal forward over time.","Orest Wowkodaw","Great, thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos","Thank you. Your reserving mineralized materials very interesting with the Americas Reserve going up 23.7 and the mineralized material gone up 42 billion pounds. In addition to that 66 billion pounds is like two times Grasberg, but smaller than Escondida. Could you give us a little more explanation how much of the mineralized material was new drilling at El Abra and new drilling at Lone Star versus the $3.00 resource price was that the same $3 price as a year ago?. Maybe it will be good if you just posted the reserve and resource pages of your 10-K on your website today, it might be more interesting than the rest of it. [Indiscernible] it deserves more than some antiseptic legal summary that your SEC attorneys write.","Richard Adkerson","Right, but John with the exception of Lone Star it's mostly price change, there's not a lot of new drilling that that drives that change.","Red Conger","But having said that John, over the past 12 years we've done an enormous amount of drilling. I mean previously when we walked in here Phelps Dodge and not, I mean had really management decision had limited drilling. They just hadn't done it, so we came in, we drilled out El Abra and added significantly drilled Lone Star, we did drill more at Morenci, Bagdad.","So it is not just what happened this past year, but the cumulative effect and then by releasing this artificial constraint at $2.00 we were able to take into account, previous drilling results and expand the cones of these reserves to some that was more realistic to $2.50. But we're going to continue to drill and understand what the resources are and that will go into our ranking of future investment opportunities.","John Tumazos","Did the higher copper price for mid molly resources to come into reserves from the properties that are copper with a molly credit is that how the molly went up a 1 billion pounds?","Mark Johnson","Yes, exactly because of expanding the cones for Bagdad, Sierrita, Cerro Verde, all of those byproduct molly operations, it took into material that was once outside the reserves and now it is in reserves.","John Tumazos","I just hope you explain the 66 new billion balance, wonderful.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, that's what we're going to be focused on now John.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Chris Mancini","Hi, thanks. Just a quick question on the North American operations, are you experiencing any labor inflation due to the low unemployment rate just generally in the U.S. and are you having any trouble say finding skilled workers to drive the trucks and things like that and does that kind of play into your analysis relative to building these big new projects? We've been hearing just broadly speaking even trucks you know difficulty finding long haul truck drivers in the U.S. and things like that just wondering what are you guys experiencing from that perspective?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, Chris. In North America we brought out 2500 new employees last year in a very tight market. Truck drivers, equipment operators we've been very successful with. We're still a bit short on skilled craft, people, mechanics, electricians, those kinds of things were in type demand. We're very pleased with how our team has approached that and attracted great new employees to come work with us for the future and we don't see that as a deterrent to spending going forward.","Mark Johnson","Having said that we're working with states and local communities, and craft training and trying to encourage people. We've invested a lot in facilities for our employees, particularly at Morenci it's a challenge to get people to live in these remote rural communities and we're working with universities. We're looking beyond just truck drivers, but we're working with universities now to define future leaders in engineering, metallurgy, geology and technical skills. So it's a real problem. It's coming problem and we've given it a lot of thought, investment and community activity work to try to deal with it.","Chris Mancini","Okay, yes that\u2019s great. I mean guess you been in Arizona for such a long time and it's that you're in an advantageous position I guess relative to some others? Thanks a lot.","Richard Adkerson","All right.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Dudas","Thanks for getting me in and I hesitate to bring up a football analogy given what happened on Sunday.","Richard Adkerson","We're going to have a moment of silence at the end of this. Terrible.","Michael Dudas","Yes, good luck with the lawsuits. I would characterize since the 2006 to 2018 timeframe, you've had to play a lot of defense, especially with the balance sheet and such but prices being low and maybe any negotiations with Indonesian to resolve the issues are you set up to be play more offense here and is your balance sheet structure do you think to do that given what you've done and in that context if you were to see much lower copper prices are plans in 2019 and 2020 pretty much set in stone and conversely if price were to spike and get more generation of cash flow is that poised towards balance sheet, is that towards CapEx or other issues?","Richard Adkerson","Okay, so you're exactly right. I mean, I really liked the analysis of switching from defense to offense, Tsunami. Three years ago the defense was survival with $20 billion of debt and not a clear cut path as to how we're going to get out of it. But we took some bitter pills, we sold assets, raised some capital, got that dealt with. Then we had the struggle with Indonesian, and three years ago we were at the point of filing an arbitration claim. And I stood in a press release in Jakarta and you know basically drew a line in the sand and now we work cooperatively to where you know the last press conference I had in Indonesia we were shaking hands and smiling and everybody was pleased to report we ended up with, so you're exactly right now.","If you look at our debt repayment schedule, we don't have any near term debt requirements, and so as we look at the next two years if we do have to face a severe downturn in commodity prices, we can weather that, we can weather that without having to alter our long term mine plans. We will tighten again where we have to tighten and we'll respond to it, but it's not the critical situation we were in three years ago and so we can manage through that. If prices get higher during that period of time in that timeframe we're not likely to change our capital spending and to the extent we generate if they do allow us to generate excess cash, we'll use that for the reduce debt for the time being and that will accelerate our plans for future spending.","Michael Dudas","Thank you, Richard.","Richard Adkerson","All right. I appreciate it.","Operator","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard Adkerson","All I'm saying is, I'm not watching the Super Bowl.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks everyone. We\u2019re available for any follow ups.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call.","In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today: Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas; and we also have a number of senior executives in the room today with us.","I'll briefly summarize the financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials located on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.","Today FXC reported net income attributable to common stock of $821 million or $0.79 per share for the third quarter of 2013 which compared with $824 million or $0.86 per share for the third quarter of 2012. The third quarter of 2013 results included net charges for unrealized mark-to-market loses on oil and gas derivative contracts totaling $98 million to net income or $0.09 a share.","As you\u2019ll see, in the third quarter our results benefited from a return to normal operations at Grasberg and we had a significant contribution from a full quarter of results from the recently acquired oil and gas business. Our consolidated third quarter copper sales totaling over 1 billion pounds were 13% above the year ago period. We had higher production throughout our global mining business. And our gold sales were 50% above last year\u2019s third quarter because of anticipated higher ore grades in Indonesia. Our third quarter sales of oil and gas totaled 16.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. That was about 10% higher than our July 2013 estimate of 15 million barrels of oil equivalents. That primarily reflected, as Jim will be talking about, strong performance in the Eagle Ford and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields.","Our third quarter 2013 average recorded copper prices of $3.28 per pound were below last year\u2019s Q3 of $3.64 and gold prices of $1329 were approximately just over 20% below the year ago quarter. Oil prices were strong in the quarter with rent pricing averaging almost $110 per barrel and the realization by oil and gas division oil realization was $106 per barrel before hedging impacts.","Generally strong operating cash flows of $1.9 billion in the quarter, that was net of about $300 million in working capital uses and our operating cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $1.6 billion during the quarter. We ended the quarter with total debt of $21.1 billion, which was similar to our June 30 balances. Our consolidated cash balance totaled $2.2 billion at the end of September and that was reflecting a $1 billion dollar supplemental dividend which was paid during Q3.","I would now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be going through the slide materials.","Richard Adkerson","","Good morning everyone. You have heard us talk about all throughout 2013 about the word execution and that\u2019s been the theme for our management team as we\u2019ve combined our new oil and gas business with our existing mining business and what\u2019s so good about this quarter as you saw the first full quarter of oil and gas operations. We had strong execution across all of our business. And that's really what we're going to be focused on going forward.","Kathleen talked about the strong margins and cash flow for the quarter. And that reflected solid operating performance from our global mining business and particularly important was the improvement at Grasberg and its operations as it is now returning to more normal grade access because of our mining sequencing and improved operating performance at that important asset. Really happy to report that today in Indonesia, our last night, we signed our CLA agreement for the next two years.","The good news with that is that we avoided any kind of work stoppage, the strike two years ago was a major negative for all the stakeholders involved there, and with this new CLA agreement, we are going forward on a more positive basis with our workforce in general and with the union. Both sides are -- while neither side got everything it wanted, both sides are very happy with the results, and it\u2019s an important step for our company.","The quarter reflects a significant contribution from our oil and gas business and that's very exciting. Jim is going to be talking about the details of that in a few minutes. Our expansion projects and our mining business progressed. The Morenci expansion is on track for completion in the first half of next year. At Cerro Verde, we have completed 70% of the engineering; construction is in progress. I visited the operations a couple of weeks ago and it was good to see the groundworks making great progress and we are starting physical construction, ordering equipment and going forward with that project.","In the oil and gas area, the Lucius development is progressing so that we would have first production next year, and that's a very exciting project and really a precursor for other things that we can be doing from an exploration standpoint, the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.","We are continuing to emphasize throughout our operations the need for cost and capital discipline, and that is a theme for all of our efforts in these marketplaces and the cash position, debt position that Kathleen talked about reflects the fact that we paid $1 per share supplemental dividend 1st of July.","And looking at the financial highlights, which for your information, are included on Page 4 and that Kathleen talked about it, reflects the strong volumes, the improvement in our unit cost situation from a mining standpoint. Net unit cost was now -- for the quarter was below $1.50 a pound . So we have high margins there, down from $1.85 in the second quarter. And then we have strong volumes, very strong margins in our oil and gas business, 90% of that revenue is driven by oil products. And that gives us the kind of strong margins that we have.","From copper market standpoint, I was at APAC and Bali and then LME week and there was a lot of talk about Asia, economic activity and the levels of demand. China remains, of course, the important global user of copper and the source of copper growth globally. The demand in China during this year has been stronger than many people expected. The Chinese are confident about their economy going forward, and all our indications from our business there is optimistic. What we're also seeing is improvement in the U.S. demand in sectors that are important to copper usage.","Construction, both residential and commercial, automobile activity is very positive and despite all of the political uncertainties associated with economy, our business and our customers\u2019 business in the U.S. in the current conditions is progressing well. And we're seeing some initial signs of improvement in Europe through some demand activities. Globally premiums for our downstream copper usage are strong. Consumer inventories remain low and the demand side is positive. Many people are pointing to copper supply issues, and as Grasberg and Escondida have returned to more normal levels of operations, that's providing more copper, there are some development projects that are going to be coming on stream in the next two years.","But the projected surpluses that people are pointing to are small in relation to the overall marketplace and lots of things can happen that would change that outlook, as it has over the past 10 years when we've seen copper supply continually underperforming expectations. And longer run, the delay in projects, companies cutting back capital points to a supportive supply situation for copper in the long run. And we remain very optimistic about that.","The Slide 6 shows our unit costs by region and our sales by region. During the third quarter, we saw improvements in every region where we operate, most notably at Grasberg, as it has returned to high grades and more normal operations. And as we look forward, the higher volumes at Grasberg as we complete mining from the open-pit over the next few years will be very supportive of our overall cost structure.","Volumes performed well, particularly in North America Red Congress here, as I mentioned Grasberg. We had a very strong quarter in Africa, even though at the very end of the quarter we and other miners there were affected by power deliveries. That's something we're working with the government on to rectify but our team there is doing a great job in running the business and managing the mining and logistics operations there. We were short of our expectations even though volumes are up in South America, because of ore characteristics both at Candelaria and El Abra. These are kind of short term issues that we manage our way through. It was a good quarter with our volumes up, just weren't up as much as we had initially expected. And we are working to deal with that as we go forward into 2014.","The oil and gas business has its regional operation results summarized on Page 7. You can see very strong margins. California, historically, a high cost place to operate, with the kinds of levels of global oil pricings and the nature of our revenue realizations there. It is a high margin business and then you look at the Eagle Ford, the onshore South Texas shale play and the Deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, you can see just how attractive operations are in that business.","And then from operating results, California was on expectations, Eagle Ford which with its gas liquids production averaged 46 million a day. The operations there went very well and the deepwater outperformed. We benefited from the fact we didn't have -- we had a quiet storm season through the end of September and no interruptions there. But overall it\u2019s really gratifying to see just how well our new business activities operated there.","Grasberg, you can see on Page 8, the details of my comments about returning to more normal levels of operations where our mill rates was 200,000 tons a day. Copper grades were essentially at our reserve grade levels, and our unit cost levels were down from that. We expect a strong volume situation going into the fourth quarter. We're going to have some unusual sales activity in that quarter. We're expecting we'll have a fairly large intercompany sales deferral because Atlantic Copper had been engaged in a turnaround that occurs every eight years. That's been completed but it will result in some deferrals of inter-company sales during the fourth quarter that we think will have an impact of about $0.05 a share. But operationally, we are anticipating a good quarter and we are certainly off to a great start this year -- I mean, this quarter in October.","Our projects, which I mentioned at the outset, are going well. The Tenke project is essentially complete other than adding a new asset plant there that was project was own time and within budget and it's a very difficult place to achieve that kind of performance and Cerro Verde is progressing as is Morenci.","Our exploration activity continues. It reflects what we've been doing over a long period of time. We are analyzing results from the extensive amount of core drilling that we've done over the past six years. Our actual budget for next year is down and that just reflects the nature of where we are in the process -- lack of emphasis owned exploration. The real underlying strength of this company has to do with our prudent and probable copper reserves, which $2 mine plans are over 100 million pounds and then resources beyond that which have already been identified beyond those proved reserves is another 100 million pounds and that gives us the ability to have very a long life continuing production and the opportunity to develop new growth projects to run the beyond the ones that we're working on currently.","Jim, why don't you take over and let you talk about our oil and gas business.","Jim Flores","Right. Richard, thank you. Good morning everyone. Looking on Page 11, looking at the oil price curve. It's always a great place to discuss the oil business, especially when it's a strong curve. Like what we've seen in the market we feel is pretty stable. You've got a lot of political unrest, you've got a lot of market swings in WTI that we are not experiencing because of our location of our reserves being on the coastal areas of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico where we are pricing at our California spot or LLS off [ph] the Brent pricing. And as you hear more and more about the increases of production coming out of Bakken, the Permian and so forth, they're really going to have widening differentials in the Mid-Con for the United States. And our projects won't be -- have to suffer those differential widenings and therefore we will be able to maintain the margins that Richard and Kathleen alluded to in their talks and so forth, because we believe oil and gas business is a high margin business reflective in the numbers that came out here in the third quarter.","We expect to protect that. One of the interesting things when you grow production 10% above your plan, your cost go down because we have a large fixed cost of component to our oil and gas business on the operating side, just like on the mining side. And as production goes up you divide those costs by fixed number and that's why you see our costs going down from $19 BOE to $1680 for the quarter, which is a real big improvements points to the statements Richard made about execution. Execution, execution, execution is where the oil and gas business is really turned on.","We have obviously had stronger oil prices to help that margin out as well and the disciplined capital spending and so forth, we obviously stayed within budget. We were able to execute in spite of the awesome task of putting two companies together with a third one in our three-way merger that closed in June 3. So I can't tell -- say enough about the guys and gals in the oil and gas group build a rally, have an outstanding quarter in spite of all the disruptions of who report to who and who's email worked and who's email didn't. So great job all around there.","Looking to Page 12, the operating assets are very consistent as far as we talked about in the transaction and also as far as going forward. You can see where our oil business in California, Eagle Ford and Gulf of Mexico is the focus of our company with almost 98% of our assets. Obviously the gas business is large but with prices impaired where they are like we had forecast, it's a small piece of our business until that market has price recovery sometime in the future. We got the details here with the lot of strong attributes. I'm not going to go through to save everybody some time but the third quarter 2013 operating cash margin of 1.1 billion is a great place to start for this important growth business for the company.","Flipping to page 13. The Lucius Deepwater project is one of our significant projects coming on next year. Besides the initial drilling starting in the fourth quarter at our Holstein field in the Gulf of Mexico. This is going to be a very large production add. Our operator Anadarko is working to make sure we have this production timely in the second half of 2014 and all indications that we're going to be able to accomplish that. So looking forward to our 23.33% interest at 80,000 barrels a day and the gas production related to it.","On Page 14, you can see more of a pictorial depiction of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico business. You can see our production facilities in red. Those are our large facilities that have a quarter of a million barrels of production capacity running at about 25% right now or 65,000 barrels a day. Remember, our intent here is to take our -- that infrastructure and fill it, and fill it by drilling new wells on adjoining prospects, adjoining leases and our existing field by redeveloping it. That's what our business plan is all about and those are the projects in blue that we plan on subsea tie-back into our infrastructure.","Great rate of return projects, 50% to 60% rate of return projects. This is the cornerstone of our CapEx budget in the oil and gas business. On top of that we have our Lucius project in green, our Phobos discovery that we will be looking at developing for the later part of this decade. Those are both Anadarko operated and there\u2019s a little star over in the left called Terra as an exploratory project that's very high potential like Lucius that we're going to be drilling mid-year with one of the drill ships show up about the second quarter. So stay tuned for some exciting results from that.","Speak of exploration on Page 15, our ultra-deep activities. We continue to lead the industry here with several great partners like Energy XXI, Moncrief and Chevron. We are in the process of moving in the completion mode. The production test of Davy Jones 2, Lineham Creek and Blackbeard West in 2014. We're drilling a very significant exploratory well in Lineham north and we're looking forward to getting those results hopefully by year end.","At same point in time we've got one to two wells planned next year to really capture the exploration phase of this project. And then we'll have to evaluate how we want to develop it and at what timeframe basins to be more responsive to what the gas price is doing. And we've got plenty of time, we've got the resources obviously to do it. ","Richard, that's brief but it is of my kind of taste [ph] and I will turn it back over to you.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks Jim. All right. Putting this all together and seeing what our outlook is for 2013, our sales outlook continues to after adjustments around the 4.1 billion pounds of copper. Our goal is 1.1 million ounces for 2013. Again, this is essentially rounding for adjustments of 92 million pounds of molybdenum and 37.5 million barrels equivalents for oil, that's up a bit from our previous guidance.","Kathleen reminds me, which I think Kathleen, we are always doing when I was talking about Eagle Ford, I said millions rather than thousands. So make sure that we are talking about thousands of equivalent barrels there at Eagle Ford earlier. Our unit cost continues to be the same. We are working to try to constrain costs, increase volumes and our unit cost for oil is down a bit with our positive operation results. At 3.25 copper, that would give us operating cash flows in the range of $6 billion and that's after a $300 million working capital use. That number always moves around till we get to the end of the quarter and each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of 2013 is a $90 million variance in operating cash flows.","Capital expenditures continue to be estimated at $5.5 billion. Then as we look forward to production volumes over the next two years beyond 2013, you can see increasing volumes for copper and the 2015 reflects the target that we've had with our three expansion projects and the restoration of Grasberg more normal levels to get up in the 5 billion pound a year range. Gold volumes reflect again the positive situation at Grasberg and the growth in oil production reflects solutions and other improvements in activities there in the offshore.","And then if we go beyond 2015 we see really significant growth continuing. Unit production cost situation on Page 18 we have shown the details of where that is. It\u2019s essentially really in line with where we gave guidance in the second. And then our sales by region are outlined at the bottom of the page. Again the volumes are consistent with previous guidance, we have worked to beat it.","Our EBITDA and cash flow models are shown on Page 19, showing variant copper prices from $3 to $4 and then with for '14 and '15 averages EBITDA ranges from $10 billion to $15 billion and operating cash flows from $8 billion to $11 billion. Then the increases that comes into play in 2016 which is very significant, shows 45% increases there as we get our projects on stream and get those additional volumes in place. And you can see how that varies with copper prices going with EBITDA $15 billion to $21 billion in operating cash flows, net of taxes and cash interest of $12 billion to $16 billion.","The sensitivities that we present for your use are shown on Page 20. Big sensitivity, of course, is copper prices where $0.10 means $325 million of operating cash flows on an annual basis. Our capital expenditures are shown on Page 21, showing roughly $4 billion a year for '13, '14, '15 and oil and gas CapEx 2.7, 2.9 for the next two years, again in line with our funding from its cash flows.","After 2015 mining projects will drop off with the completion of Cerro Verde to our CapEx will drop off, our volumes will increase and we'll get the benefit of our expansion projects. We remain committed as our Board has instructed us to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have a good track record of doing that. We have set a target of reducing our debt to a $12 billion level and that's approximation over the next three years. That includes continuing our common stock dividend , it's current $1.25 per share annual rate with our large resource base, our strong cash flows and capital discipline, we can do this.","Our board has challenges, find ways of advancing our debt reduction target and we have a great set of assets that allows us to consider a range of alternatives for doing that. That could include things like asset sales, joint venture arrangements, special purchase financing. We are looking at the opportunity for master limited partnership involving additionally some of our oil and gas assets. All those are alternatives that we are working diligently on to see how to advance our debt reduction target. We are in a position where we are not -- we don't have to do anything and anything we'll do will be to achieve \u2013 and achieving that target will be done in a way to enhance shareholder value and so that is something that we are working on.","End of the day, we have a strong, focused organization on execution, focused on returning -- on generating shareholder returns, managing our base operations to achieve our production costs, manage our costs and do that in a way that provides a safe working environment for our employees and positive results for all stakeholders and communities where we operate.","We are looking over the long-run to find ways to invest and grow our business because we have the resources to do it. We\u2019ll do that in a disciplined way that recognizes the market realities, the best uses of cash, the ones that give us our strong returns and where we can execute in a positive way. We\u2019ll protect our balance sheet and our dividends. And I\u2019m very pleased with this first quarter start to achieving all those goals.","Jim Bob, we are ready to take questions. If you have comments you would like to make now or we\u2019ll go straight to the question-and-answer session.","James Moffett","Let\u2019s just go right to the question.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Well, operator. If have a queue here. So, let\u2019s start with questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","First question, Kathleen, quickly on interest expense, it appears to be a little lower than at 4.4% average cost you mentioned. Should we consider that as going forward or was there anything special this quarter.","Kathleen Quirk","I don\u2019t think there is anything special in there, Sal. There is some interest that gets capitalized but I think the quarter is reflective of where we are with our current debt position.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So, if we assume that remains the same, we can use the same ratio going forward.","Kathleen Quirk","Right.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you. On the Grasberg, Richard, you had given some number in the past, what was the cost of labor was in that total production. And I know you have a new contract where, obviously, you probably offered some incentives. I\u2019m just wondering if \u2013 how should we look at the cost for next year and the Grasberg side?","Richard Adkerson","Well, our base rates that we agreed to was to increase base salary rates by 10% this year and 10% next year. There were other features that were built into our package that aren\u2019t included in this package this year. Our labor cost are roughly 25% of our total cost and so they will be somewhat higher. That deals with our union workers. There is a ripple effect that it goes into our non-union workers, our staff workers and some of our contractors. But we reached a level that. There is a press release out talking about how the union is pleased with it, we\u2019re pleased with it. And considering, Sal, where we came from with all of the very tough issues that we had in 2011 that really carried on all through 2012 in terms of getting people to work together in a positive way this is really a big thing for us, for all, the workers, the community, the central government, everybody there. So, we\u2019re very pleased with it and so our labor cost are going to go up some but within a reasonable level.","And what is the opportunity here is that now with a harmonious working relationship with our workforce and with the union \u2013 I was out there directly engaged in discussions this year \u2013 we\u2019re all committed to finding productivity measures which are certainly there that have the potential for far offsetting any increase in wage cost and we all shook hands on a common effort to achieve that.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you very, Richard. I\u2019ll get in the queue again. Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Alright, Sal. Thank you.","Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with Barclays.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital","I just have a quick one. The production profile beyond 2013, can you just talk a little bit about the slight decline in the copper and the gold sales expectations for 2014.","Richard C. Adkerson","Strictly rounding, Dave. I mean","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah, Dave, this is \u2013","Richard Adkerson","\u2026from our previous guidance.","Kathleen Quirk","Yeah. This is Kathleen. We rounded to four, five last time. And I think the volumes are like \u00a330 million lower to a combination of Grasberg and North American volumes but I just round it down to four rather than four, five.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, could you give us a little more information about the thoughts around the MLP, obviously there\u2019s been quite a bit of chatter. I\u2019m wondering, given the work you\u2019ve done so far on it, if you could give us a sense in terms of types of assets.","Richard Adkerson","David it's a work in progress. So we're looking at this among other alternatives and it's really too early to give specifics on it. There is a range of opportunities of what we could do with it MLPs have performed so well in the marketplace and of course there are different types of MLPs going from mainstream infrastructure type assets to upstream assets. We have a large asset base that gives us lots of opportunities Jim and I are talking about it we're getting input from people experienced in that business. And so we will report on it as this thing evolves. It's an opportunity and we are going to look at it to see if it makes sense for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman with Omega Advisors.","Richard Adkerson","Okay operator. Let's see if he comes back. And have the next question.","Operator","Okay, your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JP Morgan.","Michael Gambardella \u2013 JPMorgan","Congratulations on the excellent operating performance in third quarter. Have a couple of questions. One to the follow-up on Sal's question on the new labor agreement of Grasberg. I understand, Richard, you expect to get productivity enhancement but just assuming you had the new Grasberg contract for the entire third quarter as you just put up. How would that have affected the $1.46 per pound cash cost that you have companywide for your copper operations?","Kathleen Quirk","Mike, this is Kathleen. We spend currently about between $550 million and $600 million a year on our total labor in Indonesia. So if you take 10% you can see what the impact would be in the first year and then another 10% in the second year. We've also got some exchange rate movements as well, which offset some of that. But that will give you a feel for the annual impacts","Michael Gambardella \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay and last question I think back in 2001, you had acquired about a 9% additional interest in the Grasberg mine from local Indonesians that ran at some financial distress. Can you talk about the potential? I know you've said it's for sale for past several years. But could you give us any idea in terms of the real potential of selling that in terms of really accelerating your debt repayment program.","Richard Adkerson","Mike, actually it was half of that 9.6% that we acquired it was originally that level but back in the 1990s we'd acquired half of it in the earlier transactions. So it was half of 9.36% roughly 4.7% that we acquired back in that 2001 timeframe, probably seven years ago or more, the government asked us if we would make that interest available to Indonesians on a business-to-business fair market type basis and we have. Over time we've worked to find a structure that would provide the opportunity for the people of Papua, the province and some appropriate structure to acquire that. Those transactions haven't been done.","Now in connection with our current contract of work discussions, the government of Indonesia undertook a review of all contracts of work following the 1999 mining law. And we are in the process of obtaining an extension, which we have the rights to for our contract of work beyond its primary term which ends in 2021. We have been engaged for over two years now in discussions of various aspects of our contract with the government of Indonesia and included as part of that package of discussions is discussions about the potential of our entering into two divestiture of additional interest in the PTFI shares. We're looking and think it would be attractive to have a listing of those shares on the Indonesian stock exchange and the government feels very positive about that and potentially transaction involving a sale to the province.","And obviously the listing on the stock exchange we provide cash for us and that would assist us in our debt management a sale to province we probably would be some sort of structure where we would assist with financing and wouldn't generate near term cash to us to use. But those are all part of it. I want to emphasize, those aren't independent steps but part of our overall discussions with the government about reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the government's review of contracts and our getting an extension to give us surety of our contract through 2041. And we are confident we are going to get there on both scores.","Michael Gambardella \u2013 JPMorgan","And would this be a sale of the entire 9.63% or...","Richard Adkerson","Well, no, we're looking at -- that's independent of the 9.36%. This is an overall package that could involve a sale of that -- of the roughly 5% would be one of the largest IPOs in the history of the stock exchange. So it's an overall package that involves something independent of this 9.36% interest. And as I said we already own half of -- I mean we already owned half of that before the 2001 transaction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup","Congrats on the solid quarter to you guys. First is Rich, FCX guys are typically measuring their language and on the oil and gas side with the shelf assets you changed the wording from initiated process to divest to evaluating alternatives including possible divestment. Does this signal a change in plans? And then as a follow up to that, you did your second half oil and gas volume guidance what's the thought or how should we think about you guys maintaining the 2014 volume at 57?","Richard Adkerson","Okay. I'm going to let Jim comment on it, but we have in the process of looking ourselves the shale properties. Given the marketplace out there it's a set of assets that doesn't have a huge number of buyers and we're looking at what make sense for us going forward. The volumes going forward do not include the shale volumes just as a point of information. But Jim -- and so we're looking at a number of different possibilities there. Jim you want to comment on it?","Jim Flores","Sure, Richard. Thanks. On the shale sale, one of the interesting aspects of it is basically the companies [indiscernible] smaller and the financing constraints are there. There is a lot of behind pipe reserves and upside that we're trying to drive some type of value structure to get what we think is representative, what we know is representative value. Basically re-completions are not flowing right now. And so we are debating entirely whether we just might be better to continue to operate those fields a little while and get those big wells on and then look at selling some other later date. I mean a later date within months or maybe next year type thing. So nobody is in a distressed situation but we are trying to make sure we representatively look at the value from a standpoint of what's best for the FCX shareholder. So that debate is going on, at the same point in time we did have a robust process.","We have got several people that are flipping documents to try to push towards getting something done this year. So that's going to be also chairman discussion -- board discussion later this fall, what we exactly do. Now as far as the guidance for '14 going forward, there is a lot of operations that we are going to be doing in '14 that provide volatility to our production numbers we're going to shut in a couple of platforms for a period of time to do platform modifications to prepare for a long-term production growth for all set fields coming into those fields in the Gulf of Mexico.","The actual start date of our Lucius production, obviously we have our storm shut-ins put in our planning. So, we think while it\u2019s a pretty conservative number, as far as growth and so forth, we think with the volatility in operations it\u2019s a number that we feel comfortable with putting out. But with operations going smoothly and a quiet storm season, our numbers could obviously be significantly higher next year in actual but as far as the planning process, you know, this business is one-quarter all of its part being part of Freeport, so I would say we\u2019re conservatively modeling and awarding, we just kind of have to enjoy the upside on a quarter-to-quarter basis going forward.","Richard Adkerson","","Thanks. Brain, as I indicated with all these things, we\u2019re in the fortunate position of not having to do anything. So, as we look at these alternatives, we want to generate cash, reduce debt, we\u2019re challenged to do it and we\u2019re going to work to meet that challenge but at the same time we look at the fundamental economics and make decision on what creates the best values for shareholders.","Brian Yu \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. That makes sense. Great. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura.","Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura","Richard, you commented that your sense of the market surplus next year in the copper market would be relatively small in relation to the overall market size, I\u2019m just curious what do you view the level of surplus to be next year or what\u2019s kind of the, you know, over\/under, if you will, what would be manageable for the market in terms of surplus?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, Kurt, as I think most of these people on here know, one of the things that all my experience in this natural resource business has been is to not make predictions like that. And literally, as a company, we don\u2019t run our business on any sort of particular predictions on short term movements. You know I read the same analyst reports that are out there. I was at LME. And I was sort of struck by the two different views at LME, a lot of people with investors and who follow the investor community were really pessimistic about metals in general and about copper because of this expectations of supply coming on stream, then as I talk to end users and customers and traders and other company CEOs, you know, the theme that came back was, hey, demand is stronger in 2013 than we expected, premiums are strong. When you get and look at a number of these projects, you know, while Escondido and Grasberg are performing well, the timing of when other projects come on is uncertain, that\u2019s been a feature of the industry forever. So, when I look at the most recent book on CRU outlooks, I see relatively small surpluses that could swing one way or another depending on what happens.","So, I think the story is, is even as the situation of where there\u2019s as much concerns about the global economic market, about new supplies and we see a copper market in fundamental that\u2019s relatively tight. We\u2019re prepared for whatever comes down the pike. I mean, we have a flexible set of assets that allows us to make a lot of money if prices are strong. And as we\u2019ve shown in the past we can adjust to deal with prices that are weak, if that is something we have to deal with. My point is, that the longer-range story about the copper business is intact. Demand from global development and global economic growth over time will be strong and supplies will continue to be challenged.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. That\u2019s helpful and then just a follow-up for Jim regarding Davy Jones and Blackbeard in terms of going to completion in \u201914. Can you just give us an update on where you are currently and maybe more specifics around the exact timing in \u201914 you expect for those two?","James Moffett","It\u2019s pretty much fun and loaded. I think all three, Davy Jones, Blackbeard West and Lineham all are scheduled in the first half of the year, the only thing is if we have extensive testing in one area it may delay West Blackbeard because it\u2019s a Saskatchewan rig operation between Davy Jones West, it should start right at the beginning of the year and if we do extensive test here in Davy Jones too it may much likely toward the second half of the year but that lineup is scheduled for the first half of the year as well.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Today's results seem to suggest that the performance of the four geographic regions of FCX copper operations are improving. And also most of the regions of the oil and gas group. Looking forward to the December and March quarters, should we expect each of the four regions of the copper business and the energy business to improve more? This is my first question. And second, can we infer that you're spending about $100 million a month at Cerro Verde based on the third quarter spending rates or will they accelerate a little more?","Jim Flores","Okay, with the copper business we have given you the guidance for the fourth quarter. So you can see that. We'll still have some issues in South America that we are recovering for in terms of some higher -- some ore at Candelaria that's harder than expected. We've had some issues in managing our leaching operations at El Abra that we're working away through that it will take some time. So you'll see that going into 2014, which we will give more specific guidance on at our next call. We have some unsequencing issue earlier in the year at Grasberg so that, that will affect first quarter operations there with significant improvements as we go throughout the year there.","So John, the overall situation is very good. My top off the head things says you number it, at Cerro Verde it\u2019s pretty good. We are 80% complete with engineering. We've ordered a lot of the equipment. We spent about -- over $1 billion and we've got commitments for another $750 million or so on a $4.5 billion project. So that -- some of that spending is not smooth but chunky but now we're going to be incurring labor costs for construction. So in general terms there and then we've got our new mail [ph] coming on stream in 2014 and Morenci that will be a very positive for us.","And Jim, do you want to respond to the oil and gas side of question?","Jim Flores","The oil and gas side John is again like a volatility and operations next year, we're in the process of starting our drilling rig and our Holstein field but waiting on three drill ships to show up. And so, we can really get into our need of our development and our offshore business and that will be shown up on the next 18, 20 months. And at the same point in time, we'll be correlated with our platform modification. So I think what you'll look for is a year that's hopefully got a quiet year operationally other than some exploratory wells and some beatings from production guidance because operational execution is going very well. But starting May '14, '15 a tremendous production ramp up in the decade to our Mexico business is basically what I saw at the analyst meeting back in June, will become realized very quickly. So a lot of work being done in 2013 and '14 to prepare for '15 through 2020 to realize the value.","Richard Adkerson","Our business across the board is a long-term business. We operate on long-term plans, we execute on a long-term basis, quarter-to-quarter fluctuations occur for any number of reasons. It's great we have a very good quarter across the board this time and we feel very good about our outlook and about our progress we are making for achieving our long-term plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Richard, it is great to see a strong execution across the board and all the businesses. Just wanted to get back into the Grasberg contract of work. Believe last conference call you mentioned that your expectations of resolving or reaching an agreement with the Indonesian government by the end of this year. I was wondering if that's still the case.","Richard Adkerson","Well, what I have said and I still say is that a number of people of the Indonesian government are targeting getting this completed by the end of this year. I'll also say a number of people we are targeting for getting it complete by the end of 2012. So, we are anxious to get this resolved. We are going to work very cooperatively with the government to get it resolved and we hope that it will resolved by the end of this year.","Indonesia is facing a Presidential election next year and the closer you get to that election, political situation becomes more prominent and in many ways more complicated. We are going to represent our shareholders and we are going to work cooperatively with the government to find a common ground so that both parties feel that they are satisfied with the results of this. I would say the government is targeting this year we hope that it gets done and we'll work to achieve it. But we'll just have to see how what actually happens.","I will say we are very -- our contract has firm legal standing, nobody denies that. And so at the end of the day that provides the basis for our rights to operate there and our rights to go forward.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Yes, and just we still believe that that's one of the large portion of the catalyst for us though and secondly interested in your comments on the front page of your release where you talk about the opportunities to accelerated de-leveraging of the balance sheet, which I think is good. Joint venture transactions, can you just provide more color around this? You're talking about any type of asset, are you focusing more on the oil and gas side, any help there would be great?","Richard Adkerson","Well, joint venture structures allow you to have a lot of flexibility and creativities to how you can get together with someone who has some objectives and look at your own objectives and come up with something that would make sense for both parties. That would be opportunities across the board with our business and when you look back at Freeport's history, you can find cases. For example our partnership at Grasberg with Rio Tinto was a case study. We've had joint ventures with Sumitomo at a number of our operations. We have a partnership [indiscernible] and the same way with oil and gas business which joint ventures are featured across the board in that industry.","There is an interesting financing structure that Jim and his team put together for Lucius. The operator Anadarko has done things so that's it's such a broad range of ideas as that we mentioned that as a way of having the flexibility of bringing in someone with financial way with all and objectives that you can be very creative about how you can match them up. And there is no particular formula or no particular thing that you can say with the specific outcome but in the range of things, sometimes joint ventures are a way of bridging differences of views of values and gives you a way to deal with the potential interested and willing partner and bridge value consideration. So it\u2019s a feature of the natural resource business an opportunity for us.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes just interested in like there is more Chinese companies and SOEs getting into joint ventures in different parts of the world like the U.K. in uranium and now the potential purchase of Las Bambas. So would you consider Chinese partners in all these?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, we consider partners that would give opportunity to meet our objectives, and if the Chinese partner would do that then we'd certainly consider.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mitesh Thakkar with FBR.","Mitesh Thakkar \u2013 FBR","Just a quick question on your hedging strategy. It looks like you haven't done any hedging lately on the oil and gas side. Are you maintaining the original hedging strategy or it there any change to that? Should we see any potential hedging going forward?","Kathleen Quirk","There has been no change since the acquisition. It's something that we monitor. The oil and gas markets are much more liquid than the copper markets and we are -- sometimes the positions we have, we think are good positions as we are working on delevering. But as we go forward we\u2019ll look to see what makes sense for the combined company. We do buy \u2013 you know, we do have a lot of oil and gas consumption in our mining business. So, we\u2019ll take that into consideration as well but in terms of the structure we\u2019ve got a position through 2015. And like I said we\u2019ll continue to monitor the markets but for right now that\u2019s what\u2019s in place.","Mitesh Thakkar \u2013 FBR","Okay. Great. And just a question on the moly side. There are some comments in the press release that you\u2019re looking at maybe lowering your primary moly production; can you just kind of give us an update because I think you still make a little bit of margin on that business, any thoughts on that?","Richard Adkerson","There are lots of thoughts. We\u2019re the world\u2019s largest moly producer in the lowest-cost. You know, we have significant moly coming as byproducts out of our mines and as we look forward to Cerro Verde there is incremental moly volumes there, some at our other potential expansion projects, and there\u2019s other byproduct moly come into the marketplace. We\u2019re in a position with our Henderson and our Climax mines, which are sole moly producers, to monitor our production levels there to be responsive to the marketplace. And so that\u2019s what we do and what we are doing. Moly markets have been weak and we\u2019re heavily involved in the downstream side of that business, so we\u2019re right on top of what our customers want. We have a greater percentage of the higher volume chemical moly business in the industry as a whole. So, we\u2019re just going to be responsive to what the market needs. And that would come from swing production from Henderson and Climax.","Mitesh Thakkar \u2013 FBR","Okay. Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Duarte with Omega.","Adam Duarte \u2013 Omega Advisors","Good morning, guys. Given the completion schedule you have for the ultra-deep wells, when do you actually expect first production and first cash distribution through the royalty trust?","James Moffett","Adam, I think we can give you a better schedule once we have the wells tested. That\u2019s the thing, so. I mean, we are in a infrastructure prone area in the shallow part of the Gulf of Mexico, so I would hope that we have some completions in the first half of the year, we have production on by year-end \u201914, but that\u2019s just a guess at this point. There is a lot of engineering between me and that guess.","Adam Duarte \u2013 Omega Advisors","Understood. So, basically no change relative to what we\u2019ve been talking about for the last three months, call it, around these wells and their scheduling?","James Moffett","I think Richard said it best. These projects are long-term and we\u2019ve got a schedule and it\u2019s very, very hard for us to change those schedules because they\u2019re such \u2013 the size of the project that, you know, they\u2019re going to follow their own paths, that\u2019s the best that we can give.","Adam Duarte \u2013 Omega Advisors","Got it. Thank you. Good luck to you.","James Moffett","Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks a lot, Adam.","Operator","","You next question comes from the line of Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan","And, Jim, in terms of the production outperformance for the long gas assets, in the press release you mentioned some well stimulation activities, could you speak specifically to what you\u2019re referring to there and I guess some of the outperformance just came from no real hurricane activity?","James Moffett","Well, Joe, lot of us, like our Eagle Ford continues to outperform. You know, the premium 60,000 acres we got there right in the heart of the watermelon is continuing to be spectacular. We are reducing our rig count out there, just from the standpoint of trying to derive more free cash flow out of that and reap the benefits of the production climb to 50,000 barrels a day, so. But that was a spectacular quarter in the Eagle Ford.","And then on to the well stimulation, our hosting platform. We had a belief in the initial reservoirs at Holstein were impeded from their ultimate production because of basically migration of fines and skin damage on the wellbores and we \u2013 for instance, one well we had \u2013 it was producing about 1,200 barrels a day, we hit it with some xylene and acid wash and it started producing over 7,000 barrels a day and the tubing pressure increased about 50% as well. So, that\u2019s pretty spectacular. We\u2019re going to continue to maintain and go through the reservoirs that we have. But anytime you can take the production from Holstein from 9000 barrels a day to 18,000 barrels a day without drilling or re-completing the well, you've done some really good things. So hats off to the guys and gals involved in that project and we have a lot more to do out there. So excitement is running and confidence is running high.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan","That's helpful and then back to the MLP option. I know it's fairly early stage in thinking about it but what are you looking to achieve and in fact you do pursue an MLP option and what would be some of the negative especially in terms of -- I guess it would be difficult to get a tax basis step up if you just drop it down and have your own MLP?","Jim Flores","The aspect there is no impediments, the benefit looking for you've got a company here with a 100 year copper reserve, or 50 year reserve, 50 year oil reserve and we are trading at 5 times or something at that. So if we can capture value by driving we think a representative value for the assets, maintain we don't need more assets we've got plenty assets, we need the representative valuation. So that's what's driving all of our discussions and MLP is part of that discussion on all sides.","The extraction business does cover not only oil and gas, it covers copper and we've got excellent MLP-able type assets across the board. So it's -- Richard gave an insight of what our discussions have been like when he talked about joint ventures there. They are far ranging and we're going to find the answer here that will be visible in the market place as well.","Joseph Allman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Great. And then just lastly on the deep shale Lineham Creek, I think Chevron was looking at a primary target below 25,000 feet. It sounds as if maybe things didn't work out there and you are really focused on completing above 24,000. Could you just talk about that and then also Davy Jones 1 have you basically abandoned that well and just moving on to Davy Jones 2 at this point?","Jim Flores","I think what you are misreading in the press release about above 24,000 more of an engineering, trying to focus on that we are going to be able to get the well at Lineham pretty closer. We were very articulate that we found San Diego [ph] sands in the 23,000 foot is a new sand horizon for the ultra-deep play and the log indications look to our favor for establishing production. The aspect of drill deeper and we are having some drilling problems, we're all elected not to go deeper into the lower tertiary, we decided to take what we had right here.","And let's see if we can develop large structure and maybe that can develop a new trend for us. So, it's a geological engineering coordination discussion, it wasn't based on any kind of disappointment in the ultra-deep. Now on Davey Jones one, at this point we are not -- we don't have any operations planned. We are studying the operation of fracing the zone or whatever. We want to get the results of Davey Jones 2 and not only the lower territory but the cretaceous before we decide whatever plans we're going to have for Davey Jones 1 going forward.","We're really pleased to see all these interesting questions times going on so if we don't get to your questions or we answer them too shortly we will get with David and we will follow up with you. But let's say if we can take a few more very quickly","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Question for Jim, at Gulf of Mexico your production rates went up sequentially and you highlighted couple of reasons. Is there you should expect that to be sustainable in the fourth quarter also the current rate?","Richard Adkerson","We've got guidance on the fourth quarter, we're supportive of that guidance. It's an orchestra of lot of ins and outs. And we continue to have positive execution by our people. So at this point in time we're all confident of being able to continue to show their good stuff, the assets are certainly performing, the people are performing, so the outlook would be positive there but there is nothing more tangible than that.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. And at Eagle Ford, you still expect production to start declining because of some of the CapEx cuts you made, right.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, it\u2019s correct. We are going to start harvesting free cash flow out of that field and as our rig count drops it will be maintained somewhere I think around 30,000 barrels a day next year as what our rate is. And we can add -- average rigs if we want to add production volumes or cut depending on what our cash flow and our CapEx requirements are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS","I just want to follow-up on Grasberg. We've a talked a lot about you got -- you had a labor contract productivity you hopefully improve. With that, is there any possibility of accelerating the development going forward of the underground, because obviously post 2016, there is a big transfer and you give us long-term guidance about where production is going to go. But I imagine just with all the uncertainty there, I just kind of want to get an update on where the development is going forward for that.","Richard Adkerson","Well Mark Johnson is here but the development is going very well. We were able to -- we had some delays resulting -- following the Big Gossan training room incident. But we\u2019ve really actually to date made up for some of the down time we had there. And so we've got aggressive schedules to bring in the Grasberg Block Cave to be prepared to begin production as we complete mining from the pit. We are still looking at roughly the end of 2016 for that and then the Deep MLZ extension to the DLZ complex is scheduled to come on stream in advance of that. So, we are putting optimal amount of resources. There is just practical limits to doing that but it's all going well and our long-term plan is intact.","Brian MacArthur \u2013 UBS","And can I just ask -- should I still -- I think historically you used to talk about $550 million to $600 million a year to do that going forward. Is that still a reasonably good number?","Richard Adkerson","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just a quick one. Richard, you mentioned power deliveries running into problems in Africa towards at the end of the quarter. Are these the normal availability and volatility that we've seen in the past and if you can touch on whether or not industrial users have been asked to ration power in the DRC and what are those sort of September and October production numbers looking like?","Richard Adkerson","Well, actually we have had some experience with power problems in the past but they have been much more pronounced here at the end of September. We had invested in hydroelectric power supplies. We have a contract but there have been issues on the grid of power availability from Zambia. There is increasing requirements for mining activities in Katanga and the government has not kept up with maintenance activities and that resulted in curtailments. And so we have experienced those.","I spoke with the mines minister and he committed that everybody in government is working to resolve these. There are some longer term solutions that we and other miners are working for. Fundamentally, there is lots of opportunities of hydroelectric power development in that country and there are other alternatives being considered. And we are working diligently on it. But it is a challenging issue for the mining industry. In general, we think we are relatively placed in a relatively favorable position but we are working hard to see what we do it -- it's improved somewhat this month in October but it's an issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.","Carly Mattson \u2013 Goldman Sachs","My question is regarding the formal PXP bonds and the equity clause given Freeport's current cash balances and cash outlook for this year. Does it makes sense to think that the likelihood of Freeport considering either issuing debt or going down in the revolver to fund the equity cost on the debt have increased or how should we think about that?","Kathleen Quirk","Carly, this is Kathleen. We are very focused on those equity clause and the opportunities there and we are going to look at a variety of options to take those out, whether it be for modernizations or refinancing. So we are focused on taking advantage of the economics of those.","Richard Adkerson","Refinancing is a good option, not so much just drawing down on our credit facility costs, that's a cushion that we want to have available for whenever we need it.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.","Harry Mateer \u2013 Barclays Capital","I guess first just a follow-up on Carly\u2019s question. So there seems to a lot of confusion and different views out there about when you have to exercise that equity call out if you chose to do so. Can you just clarify for us is there a six month window you have to do that in from timing of the merger completion date which I think it could be end of next month or is that not the case?","And secondly on the potential MLP, do you consider an MLP to be a de-leveraging event given that often times it can just be moving debt from sort of one box to another? How do you think about that in relation to actually taking your debt balance down versus other options you have on the table such as asset sales?","Kathleen Quirk","Regarding the first question, the call expires three years after when the bonds were issued. And so, they are varying expirations. Most of them are in 2015. We've got one in a smaller piece in 2014 but it's three years from the date of when PXP actually issued those notes.","In terms of the MLP situation as we look at that we'll look at it as a way to enhance the overall credit profile of the company and so we'll look at how to do that in terms of bringing in proceeds in a value accretive way and looking to use those proceeds to retire debt at the parent.","So we're looking at both from a credit standpoint as well as an overall value standpoint.","Harry Mateer \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. And so the equity issuance that would count for purposes of the equity clause you can just do that anytime in the next couple of years.","Kathleen Quirk","Yes it's really the equity been put down from the parent to the FM O&G subsidiary that's the equity event.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Well thanks everyone for all your interest and participation and we look forward to speaking with you as we rest in the future.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at FCX.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We would like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K.","On the call today with me are Richard Adkerson, our CEO; Red Conger, who runs our business in the Americas; Mark Johnson, who oversees our Indonesian operations; and Mike Kendrick, who oversees our molybdenum business.","I will start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our performance of using the slide materials. As usual, after our remarks, we will open up the call for questions.","We would like to note that the results we are reporting today for our second quarter slightly better than the financial estimates reported in our July 1st update. Today, FCX reported net losses attributable to common stock of $72 million, was $0.05 per share in the second quarter.","After adjusting for net charges of $14 million or $0.01 per share, our adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $58 million or $0.04 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the second quarter totaled $465 million, and a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation is available on Page 29 of our slide deck.","Our second quarter 2019 copper sales of 807 million pounds were in line with our April 2019 estimate of 800 million pounds with higher copper volumes from North America and South America offsetting lower copper volumes from PT Freeport Indonesia.","Mine sequencing changes in the Grasberg open pit resulted in lower second-quarter 2019 gold sales of 189,000 ounces that compared with the April 2019 estimate of 265,000 ounces. This is a timing variance and we are affirming our 2019 sales estimates for both copper and gold of 3.3 billion pounds of copper and 800,000 ounces of gold for the year.","Our second quarter 2019 average realized price for copper was $2.75 per pound, that was about 11% below the last year second quarter average of $3.08 per pound, and gold prices were slightly above last year's second quarter; they averaged $1,351 per ounce in the second quarter of 2019 versus $1,274 in the year-ago period.","Our unit net cash costs were $1.92 per pound in the second quarter of 2019. Our unit net cash costs for the year are in line with our previous estimates of $1.75 average for the full-year. We generated operating cash flows of $554 million in the second quarter and our capital expenditures totaled $629 million.","We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.6 billion and our consolidated debt totaled $9.9 billion. We had no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility at the end of June. At the end of June, FCX declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its common stock and that dividend will be paid on August 1st.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to a slide presentation on our website.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning. We are enthusiastic today to report today with all the good things that are going on here at Freeport. Starting with Slide 3, in the Americas, our Freeport team delivered on expectations, way to go Red. Production exceeding forecast principally at our mines in the U.S., costs were in line, safety performance was good and we are committed to achieving safe production is our highest priority.","Our Freeport team is highly energized by new tools we have developed to increase productivity. The combination of data, artificial intelligence analysis and enhanced collaboration between our operators, IT team and business analysts, is creating these new tools. We have achieved early wins that give us some momentum and implement these tools on a larger scale.","The Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona is advancing on budget and on schedule. We are past a halfway mark and on-track for first production by the end of the year. The initial project, we had 200 million pounds of copper and we are assessing low cost capital incremental expansions to build scale for what could well become a significant asset for us in the U.S. longer term.","As reported, we modified our plans for final operations in the Grasberg open pit by adding a new area of mining that is enabling us to extend open pit mining beyond our previous expectations. These modifications delayed access to some higher-grade material, which we now plan to recover in the near-term.","Our current forecast has us mining in the open pit through September, but we are likely to have the opportunity to extend open pit mining further subject to have the open pit interacts with the underground development. Recall that our past plans envision completion of open pit mining in 2018,so everything we are doing this year is in essence land yet for us.","We are prioritizing safety as we proceed with mining and with the ramp up of the long-term underground mining, which is our future. The Grasberg is a remarkable ore body. We have now initiate right caving to allow the Grasberg to continue as a major contributor in the years to come.","In the second quarter, we achieved a number of important milestones in the development of our underground mines. After years of investing in underground infrastructure, we have now begun to ramp up production.","We exceeded expectations on key performance metrics in the second quarter. We are building momentum to meet our targets, which would result in high volumes with low cost and substantial free cash flows for the coming 20-plus years.","We are affirming our annual sales guidance for 2019 and beyond. Our global Freeport team is laser-focused on execution. We are very disciplined in our cost management, capital allocation by following in a clearly defined strategy. With continued successful execution, we are confident that our strategy will deliver large and meaningful value to shareholders.","Slide 4 represents the key metrics to bridge 2019 to 2021 and illustrates the benefits achievable over the next 18 months. Through execution of the ramp up at Grasberg, completion of the Lone Star project, stable performance in our operations in the Americas, we expect to increase copper sales volumes by approximately 30% and almost double gold volumes.","This will result in an approximate 25% reduction in net unit cost, with all things being equal, and double our EBITDA and cash flows at current commodity prices. I personally believe potential for higher commodity prices exists.","With a growing production profile at a time when copper markets could well be rising, our shareholders would have exposure to a positive long-term future in copper. Much of the capital investment needed to achieve this result has been spent. Ours are long-live assets that give us a strong base for solid cash flows for the future.","Moving to Slide 5, the Grasberg minerals district is one of the premier assets in the history of the global mining industry. Today, production from the Grasberg open pit and surrounding ore bodies has totaled 36 billion pounds of copper and 54 million ounces of gold.","This is notable since the district is one of the most recent major ore bodies to be developed in our industry and it still has a long life ahead as a significant producer. Our reserves are reported only through 2041, which is the date of our current mining rights, but currently identified resources are massive.","Significant production is highly likely to extend beyond 2041. We are now completing mining from the surface of the Grasberg, as it is now become more economic to extract the Grasberg ore underground using block caving mining. In block caving, the ore collapse under gravity and there is no stripping or mine waste to deal with.","Cave propagation in the Grasberg Block Cave is positive now, providing us increased confidence in successfully ramping up production. The rock type in the Grasberg Block Cave is very conducive to caving with no need for any preconditioning.","We are now undercutting through drilling and blasting in the Deep MLZ mine in conjunction with preconditioning rock in that mine using hydraulic fracturing to manage rock stresses in this ore body. Our Company is a leader in block cave mining with decades of experience in operating block cave mines in the U.S. but also getting back to the early 1980s in Indonesia.","With block caving, there is substantial upfront investment and we have been making these investments since 2003. Two-thirds of the underground development meters for these mines have already been achieved. We invested in underground infrastructure and a state-of-the-art autonomous underground rail system to deliver ore.","Most of the capital cost to develop Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are now behind us. The high level of upfront investment for block cave mines is offset by higher production volumes and low operating cost for an extended period of time. Block cave mining has a long life, which will benefit us as we go forward.","On Slide 6, we show the designs. Well, the designs of our Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ mines are based on world-class standards. We use our experience at the world-class DOZ mine in previous underground operations to enhance and improve infrastructure construction, mining equipment, facilities, autonomous loaders, remote controlled equipment, ground support techniques, undercut blasting in cave management.","The Grasberg Block Cave will be our largest contributor to copper and gold production following the ramp-up period. Reserves total at that mine about one billion tons of ore and high grades of copper and gold.","GBC will have a very large footprint spanning over 80 acres when it reaches full rate and extend to 180 acres over the life of the mine. The size of this ore body - the sheer size of it will give us the ability to produce simultaneously from five production blocks, giving a scale, flexibility and assurance of continuous production.","In substance, we have multiple mines in the GBC sharing the same infrastructure. We know the rock tides from our mining the same ore in the open pit for 30 years now and through drilling, the underground ore body.","We are assessing the ore about 300 meters below the surface, which is created by the open pit. As we continue undercutting and adding draw points, cave expansion is expected to accelerate to ramp up to 130,000 tons per day in 2023.","At the Deep MLZ mine, we commenced undercutting in the second quarter following our work to precondition the rock. Ongoing hydraulic fracturing operations with continued undercutting and drawbell openings in the two active production blocks in this mine are expected to enable us to achieve the ramp up schedule shown in Slide 6. We have a large inventory of drawbell openings at the Deep MLZ mine to support our ramp up schedule.","At full rate, the production of these two ore bodies is projected to average 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 1.3 million ounces of gold per year. Higher ore grades from these deposits will enhance production in the early years. Average net unit costs are expected to average $0.30 a pound in the first five years at full rates at current cost, and this is notable and rare for large-scale operations in the underground in the copper industry.","Slide 7 presents key performance indicators we are monitoring internally. We have included, for your information, a glossary of terms to assist you in reviewing this following the slides. We are now meeting or exceeding established milestones.","Going forward, there will be pluses and minus, that is simply the nature of planning, but we have confidence in our comprehensive plan based on our knowledge of these ore bodies and experience with underground ramp-ups.","We are now over the hump on the multi-year development meters needed to meet the ore bodies. The key for the future is to continue our undercutting to expand the mines, to open up new drawbells, to accumulate ore. We will be accelerating drawbell construction as the caves expand.","Looking at Slide 8, the Lone Star project near our Safford mine - adjacent to our Safford mine in Eastern Arizona is progressing is on schedule and on budget. The initial project is economically attractive and low risk in established mining area with access to nearby infrastructure and experienced workforce.","First production is expected at the end of next year. Initially, we are targeting 200 million pounds per year of copper production and expect to have opportunities to increase this target by debottlenecking with low cost investments.","We are increasingly excited about the longer-term potential for this asset. The drilling results continue to be positive. The grades are higher than any of our existing mines in the U.S. and the risks are lower than in many other jurisdictions.","We own 100% of this resource and the U.S., we now have a very highly favorable income tax regime, and for our Company, we face no income taxes for many years in the future in the United States. As we bring the oxides into production and as a result strip the deposit, there is a significant large and growing sulfide resource beneath that oxides, which will become economically compelling.","We are not only generating returns from the oxide reserves, but by mining, we are also enhancing opportunities to add a new large-scale cornerstone asset to our operations in North America.","Now want to move to Slide 9; we are undertaking a really exciting initiative that our team is very enthusiastic about, to use the power of expanding computing capabilities, to compile and analyze data in our day-to-day decision-making for our operations.","Red is leading this effort in conjunction with Bert Odinet, our Chief Innovation Officer, and the team of other leaders from throughout our organization. Real benefits have been achieved in the initial stages of this initiative and momentum is accelerating.","We are leveraging data analysis with collaborate across functions, arming our operators with tools and empower them to make decisions quickly based on real-time data. Results are measured in real-time to determine how they impact productivity. We initiated this process at our Bagdad mine in Arizona, as a test case, and the results are telling the story.","Since late last year, our mill throughput is up over 10%, recoveries are up 1 percentage point, approaching 90%, and unit costs are down 10% to 15%. Safety and retention is better and all of this was placed in service in a very short period of time. A key to expanding of this success, and this is a fundamental strength of Freeport is that we manage all of our operations in our global portfolio of mining assets.","We can readily and efficiently coordinate and implement processes across all of Freeport's global mining assets. Everyone has access to data and the results of the analysis. We have now begun to implement these tools and management approaches across the portfolio.","We have set an aspirational goal of adding 200 million pounds of copper in our Americas operations reducing our cost with minimal capital involved. This in effect is creating a new concentrator for us. This would add substantial value.","Typically a project to develop new capacity for 200 million pounds of copper might cost in the order of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We believe we can achieve this simply by increasing productivity without incurring any significant capital. Our unit cost would decrease, which is key to unlocking value in our U.S. assets.","Very exciting initiative, our operating teams are rallying around it. Their enthusiasm is high and contagious, which is - with our senior operating team last week in preparing for our earnings release. We will keep you updated as we expand this throughout our Americas operations.","Slide 10 addresses copper market. As you know, uncertainties resulting from the trade dispute between the U.S. and China have been impacting copper prices for a year now. These uncertainties are affecting confidence level at some of our customers and to a limited degree short-term demand. However, the global copper market remains balanced, fundamentally strong, inventories continue to be low in relation to historic norms.","Supply development our industry continues to be supportive of copper prices. Industry disruptions this year are at a higher rate than last year. Mine supply this year is expected to decline despite some new production coming on stream. We continue to see long-term support for copper prices from the issues in developing new suppliers.","High-quality ore bodies are increasingly scarce. Resource nationalism continues to be an issue around the globe. Current producing mines are aging, grades are falling. As economic uncertainties diminish and global economic growth improves, copper will be an important component of that growth.","We remain very positive about the outlook for copper long-term, underpinned by limited suppliers coupled with important and growing role copper plays in the global economy.","Before turning the call over to Kathleen, who will cover the financial outlook, I'd like to close with Slide 11, by just reiterating the inherent value FCX has in this asset. Copper as a commodity is one of the best position from a fundamental standpoint.","New discoveries in this industry are extremely rare and development opportunities and limited, any development requires multiple used to execute with substantial and unavoidable risk. All of the above is becoming more evident overtime, and all of this makes the existing long life of mine such as the mines we own at Freeport more valuable.","The current cost, as I mentioned earlier, to develop new capacity approximates $8 to $10 a pound. Applying this measure to our existing develop producing capacity, on a copper equivalent basis translates into a theoretical replacement cost value of $36 billion to $45 billion. In reality, it would be very difficult to replace these assets at any cost.","This replacement cost value significantly exceeds our current enterprise value with no value assigned to our large undeveloped resource position, which I believe will ultimately prove to be highly valuable for our Company.","We will continue to execute our plan, build our cash flows, deliver value from our portfolio for the benefit of shareholders. I'm personally looking forward to being part of the Freeport team as all of this unfolds. Kathleen?","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks, Richard. I'm going to go over the financial outlook, starting on Slide 13, and we show here the sales outlook for 2019 through 2021 and is broadly consistent with our previous guidance. You will see our copper sales growing by approximately 200 million pounds in 2020 and 900 million pounds in 2021 compared to 2019.","This includes the scheduled ramp up of production at Grasberg and the commissioning of our Lone Star mine in late 2020. In 2021, we expect just over two-thirds of the copper production will be produced from the Americas and the balance from Indonesia. This outlook does not include the opportunities being pursued with technology and innovation that Richard discussed earlier.","And as discussed, we are targeting an aspirational goal of adding 200 million pounds of copper through these initiatives. We are also ramping up gold production during this period with high grades available to us in Indonesia.","And as many of you know, Grasberg is one of the largest gold mines in addition to being a significant copper producer. Molybdenum sales are flat over the period that we have the ability to increase production rates from our primary molybdenum mines if market conditions warrant.","Moving to Slide 14, we have modeled our EBITDA and cash flows at various prices to provide you with a range of the cash earnings and cash flow generating capacity of the Company. And you also get a feel for the leverage we have to improving market conditions. At $2.75 per pound of copper around the current price, we are in a $2.8 billion range for EBITDA 2019.","This is a trough year for us, and as you see from the modeled results, we would generate approximately $4.4 billion to $6 billion in EBITDA in 2020 at this range of prices, and that would grow to $7.4 billion to $9.5 billion EBITDA for the average of 2021 and 2022.","This is more than a double of cash flow and most of the capital required to be able to achieve this is behind us. Now it's up to us to execute and over the next three to four quarters will continue to derisk the plan as we hit the milestones set out.","The story is the same for operating cash flows at the bottom of the page here on Slide 14. That is net of our cash taxes and interest costs. Our operating cash flows grow from roughly $2 billion in 2019 to over $3 billion in 2020, which is sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our dividends, and we expect the average of 2021 and 2022 at these copper prices from $3 to $3.50 range from over $5 billion approaching $7 billion at $3.50 copper. And we expect capital expenditures to decline beyond 2020, which will supercharge our free cash flow.","On Slide 15, we show our projected capital expenditures for 2019 and 2020. This includes sustaining capital of roughly $1 billion per annum and the projects we have under way that are allowing us to grow our cash flow so significantly. We are continuing to manage capital very carefully.","You all know the capital costs are up slightly from our April estimates. The primary driver for this is that we are ahead of schedule on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ work; our five-year average spend for the underground development is consistent with our previous guidance, but we have been a little bit more productive in 2019 and so we have adjusted the timing of our spend.","These amounts do not include the new smelter in Indonesia in which FCX will share 40% of the economics. We expect to debt finance the smelter at the PT-FI level and are having some good discussions with the group of banks to put a facility in place to fund these costs.","Moving to Slide 16, we show our financial position and liquidity. We are in a strong financial position. Our balance sheet is in good shape. If you look at our leverage relative to the expected EBITDA generation, our current net debt is around 2 times 2020 EBITDA and about 1 time 2021 using $2.75 copper. We also have a strong liquidity position with $2.6 billion in cash on hand and an undrawn $3.5 billion facility.","In closing, going to Slide 17, we are gaining real momentum in achieving our objectives, clearly focused on executing our plans in an effective way and have a line of sight for meaningful increase in our revenues, earnings and cash flows.","Thanks for your attention. And operator, we will now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Terry","Good morning. Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Three questions from me, quite quick ones. On the smelter, when can we expect any updates on the timing of that? Second question is just around thinking about the open pit to underground transition. Can you just give an update on mill stockpiles and also any port inventory that you have just on the differences between sales and production? And then the last one, just the timing of the Slide 9 that 200 million pound opportunity you've talked about, if you could talk about that a bit further? Thanks.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks, Chris. On the smelter, we started early works in ground improvement. We have got a site located in Gresik near the existing smelter in Indonesia and we are doing some front-end engineering work. So we will have better estimates at the end of the year in terms of capital cost.","As I mentioned, we are having good discussions with lenders about financing the smelter and expect - we are not expecting a significant cost of the smelter in 2019. It will start ramping up some in 2020, but the bulk of the spend will be later in 2021 and 2022. But we expect to have a debt financing in place that will allow us to fund those costs and essentially amortize them over a long period of time.","Richard Adkerson","Our commitment with the government was to do it within five years of December 2018. So that is the time schedule, that we are working on is to have the project running by the end of 2023.","Kathleen Quirk","Your question about production and sales; we generally sell what we produce. Sometimes, we will have shipping delays that extend over a short period of time, but we don't have significant board inventories. We have wound those down and we don't have significant stockpiles at this point. So we are basically in normal operations. Slide 9, Richard, your comment asked about the timing of the 200 million pounds of -","Richard Adkerson","So we expect to ramp up getting in the next year and by mid-2020 to be at that full production level. But as we speak in our recent meetings, we are seeing opportunities to be able to expand that with incremental oxide production with reasonable amounts of capital to go along with it.","Right now, we are being able to use available facilities at the Safford mine for processing, which that mine is ramping down is expected, but the opportunities for future growth in oxide is there and of course, we have spoken about the very large longer-term sulfide resource available to us.","Kathleen Quirk","And that is with respect to Lone Star, Chris. I think you were also asking about the innovation project, which we are moving very aggressively on. We have achieved the results at Bagdad. We have got more to come at Bagdad and the aspirational target that we have set of 200 million pounds, this is something we want to do quickly.","We are working on blueprints and designs and we don't have a - we haven't put it into our guidance. So we don't have a projection, but we have optimism that we will be able to convert that aspirational goal into results.","Mark Johnson","Yes. We have a full blown of team on the ground at Morenci right now, putting that one in place, and get ready to go to the next point after that.","Richard Adkerson","It's a very great opportunity for this and this, you know, what this does is and we didn't know exactly how it would work, we went to Bagdad, that really work quickly and now it looks to be sustainable . And so by increasing mill throughput, then you have to adjust your mine plans to feed that capacity in that, in effect shorten your reserve life and we have got enormous reserve life. So all of that so economically positive for us. And I can tell you the way our team has responded to see our long-term mining executives being excited about data analytics. It is quite an exciting thing to see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","Hi, good morning everyone. Just a couple of questions from me. On the undercutting, on the drawbells development, everything looks great. What exactly there is allowed the faster pace versus plan, and do you think you were very conservative at the outset? And then second, continuing, can you give an example of the concrete kind of process change that the data analytics at Bagdad have led to, and with really driven these op improvements you've shown? Thanks.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. So Mark, why don't you comment on this?","Mark Johnson","Yes. As far as the undercutting and drawbelling, I don't think we were conservative in the GBC. We have some upside. We try to use a central estimate when we put our forecast together. We look at opportunities to be slightly better and where the risk would be or the challenges would be on the downside.","We do have a lot of meters of development and in the undercutting right now, all of that drifting is well in advance of where the undercutting is taking place. So a lot of the undercut meters are essentially just the drilling and blasting the final stage of that. And so we are going to continue to use the central estimate way of forecasting, and this year, we are looking at having marginal upside on both the Deep MLZ and GBC in regard.","On the Deep MLZ, obviously, this year, a lot of it was driven by our ramp up of the hydrofracking. In the second quarter, we commissioned our third hydrofracking pump and that went well. So we are continuing to see the cave respond to that preconditioning, and that will be something that we continue to press forward on and it was a learning curve for us.","I'm proud to say that the group out there took that technology and ramped it up very quickly, and it's part of our day-to-day operations now in the Deep MLZ.","Richard Adkerson","And a point I'd like to make is, this is not a new plant. I mean, we have had a plan that we started on 15 years ago that envisioned during this time frame. In fact, it was envisioning starting in 2016, but because of issues at the surface in the pit, it was delayed. So we have had this consistent plan.","The guys have done a great job of being focused on it despite everything else that was going on at job site in Indonesia. And that plan just keeps get modified and improved as we go through time. So it's not like this is a new plan that is been developed, but consistent execution of a long-term plan.","Red will talk about this AI initiative, but for years now, we have been using measurement devices, own equipment, to get information to supervisors who then take it and feed it back to operators in the field. What this does is take that fundamental process, but gathers the data processes it immediately, compares it to what would be optimal conditions and where it's falling short and getting that data instantaneously in the hands of our team to make those adjustments in real-time and continuously. Red.","Red Conger","So it's a combination of many things using this model, but it's a great way to bring our people together around facts and data versus opinion. So, it allows us to challenge paradigms, any rules of thumb or conservatism that we might have in managing the processes before.","Now, we are doing it by fast and quick turnaround of information, as Richard mentioned, and it's truly a way to have your best day every day that you can take the conditions that are presented to you today and perform absolutely at the top opportunity available to us and see that every day. It also has our people working together much differently and collaboratively than they have in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.","Chris LaFemina","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I just have actually two questions. One is a quick one on Grasberg, and the second is on the data analytics and technology innovation. So first on Grasberg, I'm just curious as to why your full-year byproduct credit estimate is unchanged despite the fact that you are gold price that you are using in the byproduct has gone from $1,300 to $1,400 an ounce and your production of gold is unchanged for the year?","Is there a small rounding difference in the gold sales number for the year or I would have expected the unit cost number to be quite a bit lower actually being that using a higher gold price. So just wondering why the Indonesian costs are not lower despite high gold price? That is the first question, maybe we could start with that.","Kathleen Quirk","Okay. The gold credit will be a function of what the gold revenues are in relation to the copper volumes and there was a slight change in copper volumes for the year. It wasn't a big number, but we increased copper by - from [625 to 630] (Ph). So it wasn't a huge difference, it was $0.02 variance between the two numbers, but it's a relation of what the gold volumes are in relation to copper.","Chris LaFemina","And I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything going on with price realizations there? So that is helpful, thank you. Secondly, on the data analytics and technology innovation, we are starting to hear from other copper mining companies as well about their expected ability to begin to ramp up production from debottlenecking and using technology and innovation.","And historically, we have looked at copper as an industry where you have kind of a natural decline rate in production, which is obviously pretty bullish at pricing. Are there any reasons why we should believe that your ability to debottleneck effectively using technology is unique to Freeport or should we begin to worry about the ability of the industry to kind of deliver organic growth from very low capital cost projects using technology and innovation?","Richard Adkerson","I think the real distinguishing feature for our Company is this idea that we manage all of our operations as in a fact one business, and is not where you have joint venture operations or minority interest in other operations. So, it allows us to do things and share it from mine to mine to mine. Technology is going to drive things as we go forward.","We are working with our suppliers in applying technology to underground mining, which in reality probably is a more fertile area for application of this an open pit mining because of the more factory nature of that business. So it'll be a factor in the industry going forward.","You know other factors in my view are going to be more important in terms of looking at ultimate supply demand impacts for the industry and that is this whole issue of global growth and the things that overhanging the market from the demand side and just the issues of these things might help offset falling grades, but grades are falling and you see in project after project the challenges that are faced in terms of developing suppliers whether those relate to processing issues, ground support issues, government issues with resource nationalism.","So it will be a factor. We are certainly going to take advantage of it to the maximum extent we can. I don't believe big picture that this is going to be a game changer in terms of the fundamentals of supply and demand for copper.","Chris LaFemina","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC.","Oscar Cabrera","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone.","Kathleen Quirk","Good morning, Oscar.","Oscar Cabrera","Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. I was wondering if you can comment on the increase in site production and delivery costs in South America going to a $1.92 a pound from $1.73. I understand there was an issue with production, i.e. grades, but is there anything else like push backs or higher throughput that you putting through Cerro Verde where there are affecting costs?","Kathleen Quirk","Oscar, it was primarily - at Cerro Verde, we had some different ore types that we mined in the second quarter and so we had some issues to work through there. That is the main driver was the ore types in the second quarter at Cerro Verde.","Richard Adkerson","As we got to the bottom of the Santa Rosa pit, we had some slope issues that kept us from extracting the high grade pushback down there, Oscar, to finish that off. So where we are trying to stabilize that and get back in there and get that ore, but it's not lost. It was just a timing change in the mine plan.","Kathleen Quirk","Yes. It's a temporary change.","Red Conger","There is no fundamental change in the cost structure there and we expected to have stability issues quarter-to-quarter, but we expect long-term stability in our cost structure at Cerro Verde.","Oscar Cabrera","Right. Because I mean your throughput is well above the 360,000 tons per annum, so we can expect like increased production over the next 12, 18 months then?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, I mean we are having to - the mill is performing so well. I mean, this is the industry's largest mill and that we are having to beat that mill and find ways of adjusting our mine plans to move production forward and all that is very positive from a value creation standpoint.","Oscar Cabrera","Fair enough.","Red Conger","So that it was higher throughput, but lower grade, and Mark Johnson just reminded me we are recovering at El Abra from the flooding incident that happened in the first quarter. So there is a delta at El Abra on pounds as well.","Richard Adkerson","El Abra was ground zero for the floods and in Northern Chile and Peru and our team there has done a great job in not only recovering for our operations but helping nearby communities to deal with their problems.","Oscar Cabrera","Yes. Now that is forgotten about that. And then lastly, your comments on the debottlenecking of the Lone Star leased development. What sort of delta could we be looking at here as of 20 million pounds, 25 million pounds, 40 million pounds per year?","Richard Adkerson","It's too early to do that right now. We are focused on the initial project just is as we did that as we reviewing with our team, guys were brainstorm and saying, okay, we have this opportunity, this opportunity.","The next stage will be to evaluate how those new opportunities match up with capital requirements for processing and so forth. So, we are going to be alert to studying it. But here and throughout our operations, we have got two years of real disciplined. We have got a plan.","We are going to execute this plan. We are not going to get off course pursuing opportunities to aggressively right now. We are going to study things and make sure we get the benefits of this transition period behind us and then the world is going to open up to Freeport in a remarkable way.","Oscar Cabrera","Alright. Yes, it will. Thank you, sir.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.","Orest Wowkodaw","Hi, good morning. Just curious on the smelter as well at Grasberg. Do you anticipate that 100% of the $3 billion CapEx will be debt financed? And then secondarily, will you not have to add the CapEx or consolidate that in terms of the smelter CapEx to your consolidated financial CapEx?","Kathleen Quirk","Yes. We consolidate PT Freeport Indonesia and so the capital expenditures incurred by PT-FI are consolidated in FCX's results. So they will be part of our consolidated results, but the economics and we have a shareholders' agreement between FCX and our partner there, the Inalum, the state-owned company, where smelter cost are shared according to the ownership of 49% to FCX.","So we will consolidate it, but the economics and cash flows associated with it will be borne 49% by FCX and we do anticipate being able to finance substantially all, if not all the smelter. PT-FI doesn't have any debt. And so, it's in a good position and we have had some positive feedback from some lenders about financing for PT Freeport Indonesia for this project.","Richard Adkerson","In the past, we have look at alternative structures. In other words, we have looked at potential opportunities to create partnership and create an entity that might or might not be consolidated. So we have left ourselves this option.","It now appears that the best course of action considering all factors would be to debt finance it through PT-FI, but other alternatives may emerge as the reality of this thing occurring it's accepted in the marketplace.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay. So should we anticipate then at some point in the future, you will say update your 2020 CapEx guidance of $2.6 billion to include the smelter?","Richard Adkerson","Yes.","Orest Wowkodaw","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael Dudas","Good morning, everybody. Following up on the Indonesian comments, Richard, just wanted to maybe you can share how the joint venture from a personal corporate business level government level has gone over the past, I guess, from almost six months now, but more than six months and relative to your expectations and how you've been able to manage the successful transition that we looking at for the second half of the year?","Richard Adkerson","I'm pleased to say could not have gone better. It was a - as we talked about extensively to understated leading up to December and getting that step taken to resolve all the issues between us and the government.","The partnership with Inalum is going very well. We have established the corporate structure where we have a shared Board of Commissioners, shared Board of Directors. We have an operating committee that FCX controls, that run this is operations at site but Inalum participate in it on a partnership basis.","We have a total alignment of financial interest. Inalum financed the acquisition of Rio Tinto's interest in the joint venture through an international bond offering that we have facilitated. They need the cash flows to fund that. It's not government guaranteed. We are swapping ideas.","They have got people working in our organization. We had represents of Inalum that are FCX managers meeting last week; we are participating in their Inalum functions. It's gone well during that six-month period. Indonesia has had Presidential elections, which kind of dominated public focus there.","President, Joko Widodo, has now been officially cleared as having a new term. There is considerations we understand going on about the structure of government going forward. But, we couldn't be more pleased; the personal relationships are very positive. We have had the Inalum people visit us here in Phoenix to see our operations and meet our global team.","So I couldn't be more pleased with the way things are going, and I anticipate this is going to be very successful going forward. As I said, we finally are in a position where our interests are totally aligned with the government of Indonesia and through this partner.","Michael Dudas","It sounds encouraged to think, Richard, maybe just one follow. In the past, you observed how the ground business on the ground is relative to some of your the markets for copper and there is been a lot of negative data points especially in North America relative to the economy. Are you seeing any issues relative to demand, and you believe your copper and others and is the market maybe kind of soften a little bit given some of the macro data we have seen?","Richard Adkerson","It was incredibly tight throughout 2018. And going into 2019, we were literally - we supply a third or more of the downstream copper in the U.S. from our mines in the U.S.. We virtually do not import or export the copper in the U.S.. And we were having to back limited amounts of copper from traders to meet the demands of our customers.","So they are some pockets of softening which are evident in the general economy, but overall, the markets remain tight. Many of our customers are very positive going forward, others are concerned about the trade issue and the ultimate impact on the global economy. But inventories you see their publicly reported, they are what they are and they're low by historical standards.","So we continue to be at that crossroads and the crossroads are this trade issue going to result in broader economic impacts in China and the global economy or is this thing going to get resolved in a way that avoids those.","Within China itself, the government is working very actively to offset areas of softness in their economy by stimulating investment - investing in infrastructure, pushing this Belts and Roads initiative to use excess capacity and they're having some success doing that, but it's a question mark that we or nobody has the answers to at this point.","Michael Dudas","Appreciate your observations. Thank you, Richard.","Richard Adkerson","Yes. There is certainly no falling off the cliff situation with our customers. But as I said, there is concern and we are at a crossroads.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Good morning. And just two for me. So I know on the guidance that you gave earlier this month, there is some comment about potential upside to your forecast. So, I see that you didn't revise them and I'm just wondering at what point do you feel like you have conviction to comment further on your run rate or your ability to recoup additional volumes from the open pit mining extension?","Richard Adkerson","Alright. So this is very unusual mining for us. We are almost surgically looking at what remains in the open pit to see what we can capture. And so it's not like having a typical mine plan where you have mining areas designated in a specific plan to do. We are literally mining access roads that go down there. We are narrowing access roads from what to what, Mark.","Mark Johnson","From 40 meters to 50 meters.","Richard Adkerson","And all of that is just taking advantage because, obviously, anything we can get from the pit is accelerating it. That ore would ultimately be mined in the block cave, but for several years out. So it's real value added, but difficult to say where we are going to be able to get this ore, and at the same time, we are monitoring very carefully, the interaction of the beginning of mining from the Grasberg Block Cave and the safety of the pit itself.","And we have got a whole team with state-of-the-art measuring devices. And if there is there any question about safety, we are just going to stop, because the real value strategy for us is to develop these underground mines.","And so this - a year ago, we didn't plan to have any mining in 2019 from the pit. And we started finding ways of doing it. Right now, we have added in a quarter and we will see - I think it's likely it will go beyond that could go into 2020 now, but it's uncertain.","But I want to make the point, this is not like our traditional mine plans in the pit or for the underground. It's surgically finding areas that we can safely mine and taking the advantage.","Timna Tanners","Okay, helpful. Thanks. And then, I just wanted to follow up on something you commented on a couple months ago regarding plans for the dividend and I caught with interest Kathleen's excitement over cash flows as CapEx rolls off. But I just wanted to confirm, you are still waiting to get more certainty around the mine plan and your timing before thinking about any changes to your payout strategy.","Richard Adkerson","That is correct. As I said, we are going to stick with a very straightforward focused strategy. It was two years, not 18 months, as we ramp up and after we ramp up and get the benefit of these cash flows, my expectation is the dividend is going to grow.","Timna Tanners","Okay, thanks for that.","Kathleen Quirk","Thanks, Timna.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR.","Lucas Pipes","Hi, and good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the export quotas. It mentioned a few times in the release and I wondered if you can provide some background, is that still related to the mining law and the smelter requirement and ultimately I assume this is a formality to get amended, but would appreciate your thoughts on kind of the background of the quota and kind of where it goes from here and any limitations it may cause. Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","It is an administrative formality now. I mean the Energy and Mines Ministry has regulations and procedures to follow, and we have to adjust our plans as we adjust the mine plans for this limited open pit mining we are doing now. And so we had to follow those plans and the quotas get approved, and that is all it is to it.","Lucas Pipes","Got it. And what exactly caused the need for change in the quota, given that guidance is...","Kathleen Quirk","The way the process works is that we filed for the quota in like October of 2018, and they base it off of what your plan was then. Subsequent to that time PT smelting had some additional downtime and we ended up having more concentrate production in 2019 than what was in that forecast.","So the process now is, we have to resubmit that plan, which we have done. And so we will - and it's not a big driver of our second half sales. It's important, we want to get it. We want to have some options if we do have the ability to extend in the open pit, but we have given them an updated forecast and we expect in the third quarter to get approval for additional quantities of export.","Lucas Pipes","That is very helpful. Thank you. And then another question on the Grasberg Block Cave. You comment in the release about your increased confidence in growing production rates over time. How would you translate this increased confidence in numbers? Is it kind of a narrow range of potential outcomes around your guidance or how would you explain to them, where could we see that increased confidence? Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","Well, let's see. We went into the year saying we had a two-year period. We have now got six months into that period and things are meeting milestones, going along plans. So as that occurs, our confidence is reaffirmed. Let me just say, we had confidence in our plan going into it. But I think I used the term earlier show me.","Now, we have shown for six months. We are on target meeting targets, exceeding targets. So as time goes by, and we get to this ramp up; Mark and I had a conversation last week, I said, Mark, when we get this Grasberg Block Cave fully developed, how confident we are going to be in meeting quarterly targets and he said, well, Richard, we are going to have multiple draw points with ore available; if there is some mechanical issue in one, we can move to another and production blocks and so forth.","So I made a comment earlier, it's like having multiple mines with one set of common infrastructure. So there will always be issues in mining. But we got so much back up, so many alternatives that we are confident that we are going to be able to meet our targets.","Kathleen Quirk","Mark, you want to talk about cave propagation?","Mark Johnson","Yes. It's - obviously, there is a lot of moving parts in the block cave. We built crushing and conveying systems. We built the rail system. All of those - all the commissioning of that went very well. So that - as those developed and as we got the commissioning behind us, that led to this increased confidence.","The cave propagation, as you can see in some of the slides, we have got two separate areas that we are developing and undercutting right now. The material is very amenable to the caving process. It's - we have tried to identify and explain the difference between it and Deep MLZ.","So what we are seeing now in both of those areas are good. We are able to go in and pull the cave and it fills up the air gap and we are getting our processes in place when we do need to secondary blast, and all of those things are coming together.","We are really transitioning from a development project to an operating project. And as we increase that confidence in the group's taking on a new role, all of that is coming into place very well.","Lucas Pipes","Gentlemen, Kathleen, I very much appreciate all that detail, and best of luck.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks, Lucas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos","Thank you very much. I could ask two questions. Can you give us an update on the capacity for the Cerro Verde mill? You had another strong quarter. I think the original capacity is 360,000 tons and maybe that varies with ore hardness. Secondly, congratulations on the block cave development, July 16th, the good people of Rio Tinto announced some delays in their block cave. Could you elaborate on the better ground conditions you have at the Grasberg Block Cave, you are transitions going so much better?","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Red, do you want to comment on Cerro Verde mill?","Red Conger","Yes. John, we have continued to have real good performance there. We are at about 400 right now. And with this other analytics where that we have been talking about artificial intelligence, et cetera, we have even a higher target than that we are aiming for with this project. So that continues to go well and we are very upbeat about that.","John Tumazos","Are those metric tons?","Red Conger","Yes.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Richard Adkerson","And John, we - as you can appreciate, we are not going to comment on Oyu Tolgoi situation. But in our situation, we know this ground; this ore body at the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the biggest contributor to our future.","It's the same ore that we have been mining for 30 years and we have drilled, I don't know, thousands of drill holes in it, and we have done all metallurgical test. And so we are demonstrating that we know the rock and it's as we keep saying, it's amenable for block cave mining in a very positive way.","The separate or system, which literally started with the Ertsberg mine in the early 1970s and then is extended underground beginning in the early 1980s through - this is the fourth level of the same system that we keep going down again.","We know the fundamental physical characteristics of the rock, what we encountered there, because as we have gotten deeper in that ore body, below the surface was this need to precondition the raw, but it's something that is consistent with what we have done in the past.","Our challenges will be to manage wet muck which we've had in the IOZ, DOZ mines going forward, which we can manage, will have course material available to mix with ore so that we can manage that going forward. But we just don't have the same circumstances of unstable ground that others might face in commonly in the industry.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.","Brian MacArthur","Good morning. My question relates to post 2020. You've been putting in, you know, $750 million to $1 billion to develop Grasberg as you said since about 2003 to get everything ready. You talked about it dropping off past 2021. I'm just trying to get magnitude of drop-off and that ongoing, would we go down $500 million, because you still going to have earn so you could open up some of the other cave areas as we develop longer-term. Is it reasonable to assume that ongoing capital drops by $500 million in that ballpark?","Kathleen Quirk","Well, our current plans show that capital drops off pretty sizably beyond 2020. We are going to be looking at the development of Kucing Liar. That is not in our current five-year plan. We want to get Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ optimize and up and running and spend the capital needed to do that before going in and attacking other projects.","The KL deposit is not a big value driver for us, so we are not overly anxious, but we are - so we are going to be cautious over the next several years in how much capital we allocate and we are currently showing no capital falling off on the order of what you are saying, Brian.","Brian MacArthur","Sorry, great - had led to a second question.","Kathleen Quirk","Excluding the smelter, but putting all that aside, we see capital fall off.","Brian MacArthur","Right, which kind of me to the other question. So when do you actually I mean, you have lots of flexibility in the GBC once it's up and running. When do you actually have to start looking at KL, if you want to do that?","Mark Johnson","Yes. This is Mark Johnson. We are looking at the potential of starting development in that in 2021. As Kathleen mentioned, we are looking at different plans. We do have some flexibility when that starts up, as Kathleen mentioned.","It's not the largest - the recoveries particularly in gold right now are a challenge. We are doing some work on metallurgical studies to see if there may be a better sweet spot of the ore body to enhance the value. Some of those studies also may reduce some of the mill capital associated with the KL.","It's a work in progress and it lends itself, it also ties into the common infrastructure that we built for the GBC and the Big Gossan. So we are poised to start that development we know where we will start. We know what we need to do longer term, and we are just trying to refine the timing of that and the actual footprint of the ore body.","Kathleen Quirk","And again just to look at the options to have a case where we expose less capital and look at the trade-offs of that, because some parts of the ore body may require a lot more capital, and so we are looking at trade-offs of not mining part of the pyrite, for instance, and that has some pretty big implications on capital. So that will be studies that are in front of us.","There will be value-add studies. But as Richard said, we really focused on executing this first phase, optimizing in the first phase, and then looking at where we go from there. But currently, we don't have in our five-year outlook capital for Kucing Liar.","Richard Adkerson","Or any metal.","Kathleen Quirk","Yes, or any production.","Richard Adkerson","And it is fair to say current copper prices would be unlikely to do this project in the future. I mean, you know, because it's got to bear the burden of in-country processing, which is - so anyway, it's a future opportunity and it does meet reserve standards at today's value, but I believe others in the industry are going to be fundamentally careful about investments pending the way the copper markets develop.","Brian MacArthur","Great.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kathleen Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially.","I\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.","On the call today are, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and we have got other senior members of our team here with us today.","I will start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will review our recent performance and outlook.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $482 million or $0.46 per share for the second quarter of 2014. The next income attributable to common stock during the second quarter 2014, included charges totaling $130 million or $0.12 per share comprised of $58 million for environmental obligations and related litigation charges, $58 million for deferred taxes recorded in connection with the reduction of goodwill associated with the sale of the Eagle Ford during the quarter and $4 million for net non-cash mark-to-market losses on oil and gas derivative contract.","The second quarter results, we reported strong operating performance in Americas and Africa mining operations and from our oil and gas business. The results also reflected the impacts of reduced productions and sales from Indonesia associated with export restrictions imposed in mid-January.","Consolidated second quarter copper sales of 968 million pounds were above a year ago quarter reflecting growth in North America. The gold sales of 159,000 ounces were below the year ago quarter.","Our copper and gold sales volume were below our April 2014 estimates, primarily as a result of the deferral of exports from Indonesia, which reduced copper and gold sales by approximately 150 million pounds of copper and 240,000 ounces of gold during the second quarter. As indicated in our press release, we expect to complete an agreement with the Indonesian government immediately which would enable export to resume immediately.","The second quarter sales of oil and natural gas totaled 16 million barrels of oil equivalent that included the Eagle Ford reserve through the June 19th despite of the sales that exceeded our April estimates by 5% primarily as a result of higher production from Eagle Ford and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.","Our second quarter average realized copper price of $3.16 per pound, approximated the year ago quarterly average of $3.17. Gold prices of $1296 per ounces were slightly below the year ago quarter of 1,322 per ounce.","Oil prices remained strong during the quarter, with Brent prices averaging $110 per barrel and the average realization by Freeport-McMoRan oil and gas was $100 per barrel before the hedging impact.","Operating cash flows generated during the quarter totaled $1.4 billion, that was net of $400 million for working capital uses and changes in other tax payments during the quarter, and our capital expenditures totaled $2 billion during the quarter.","As previously reported, we completed the sale of the Eagle Ford field during the second quarter for growth proceeds of $3.1 billion before purchase price adjustments and also completed the acquisition of additional assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $900 million. Combine the transactions provided $1.8 billion of after-tax net proceeds before purchase price adjustment.","We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.3 billion and consolidated cash of $1.5 billion. We also reported today that we redeemed $1.7 billion of face amount of our senior notes and that was called for redemption last month that transaction has been completed.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the slide materials.","Richard Adkerson","Good morning, everyone. As Kathleen talked about results for the second quarter reflects strong performance from our mining operations in the Americas and Africa, and from our oil and gas business. It does reflect the impact of the restricted sales from Indonesia, because of this export situation and I will be talking more about that. Our outlook at the first quarter earning release was based on assumption of resuming production in the May and the export restrictions lasted throughout the quarter.","We did make good progress on our growth projects. At Morenci, we are commissioning of our new mill started in May and we are in ramp up process for that. The major construction project at Cerro Verde is progressing well towards the 2016 start-up.","Jim, will be talking about the Lucius development, the operator Anadarko expects first oil in the second half of this year and the Highlander project, onshore in South Louisiana is advancing towards completion activity is also in the second half of this year.","We completed the sale of the Eagle Ford asset and the acquisition of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest that enhanced our position for the focus area of our growth in oil and gas business for the future. We are actively in the process of pursuing additional asset sales transactions, all part of our goal of targeting a major debt reduction by 2016 -- by the end of 2016.","As a matter of information, we have changed the name of our company to Freeport-McMoRan from Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold to reflect expanded scope of our business. Our ticker symbol remains FCX.","The financial highlights that Kathleen reviewed are included on page four. The major difference from the data that we presented to you earlier has to do with the Indonesian restricted production situation. Otherwise, our operations performed in accordance with our previous guidance.","The current status of where we are at PT Freeport Indonesia is that since January -- mid-January that regulations were adopted -- dated January 11th. We have not had authorization to export copper concentrate.","In those regulations, the Indonesian government provided for a process to export concentrates, but they enacted a prohibitively large export duty, which is still in the regulations, but it is, we understands in the process export duty is -- in the process of being reduced.","The impact of this is that we have had deferred sales of 150 million pounds of copper and 240,000 ounces of gold. I used the term deferred because the resources are still there available for our production and sale in the future.","We also have a sizable level of inventory of copper concentrates at our site available for shipment. Year-to-date, these deferrals have accumulated 275 million pounds of copper and 380,000 ounces of gold.","We have been working with the Government of Indonesia for roughly two and half years now to try to reach a common ground on dealing with our long-term contract situation. Our ability to continue our operations post 2021.","That\u2019s a key date, because our current contract award signed in 1991 had a 30-year initial term and it provided for our having the rights to two 10-year extensions to 2041. Those extensions require approval by the Government of Indonesia. The contract provides, though, that the government cannot unreasonably withhold or delay these applications. On the basis of that contract we report reserves through 2041.","The complications that we face is that in 2009 the Government passed a new mining law that transitioned Indonesia\u2019s dealings with miners from a contract of work system, which is what we have to a licensing system.","The licensing system provides in general terms, that holders of licenses are subject to prevailing laws and regulations, and so you don\u2019t have assurance of fiscal terms that we and another contract of work holders. The law provides the contract of works will be honored to their terms.","And our discussions have been dealing with finding away that acceptable for us in terms of protecting our shareholders interest and finding a way that the government officials in Indonesia can feel comfortable with in terms of their view, their responsibilities under the government\u2019s laws and regulations.","Our initial objective in recent discussions with the government has been to find the way forward of getting exports approve and returning to normal operations. The financial consequences of not being able to export are significant.","Where we are because we have an interest in a smelter that we arranged to be built in Indonesia in the mid 1990 is we have the ability to ship copper concentrate to this smelter owned by a company called PT Smelting, which we own 25% and our partner Mitsubishi owns the majority interest and operate. We can ship there and so as a result, we can ship about half the level of normal sales of concentrates that we have the capacity to produce and we have been flexing our operations to deal with that.","We have not made major reductions to our cost structure today, because that has potentially long-term implications to our operations and potential for disruptions in the local community and with our workforce.","As a result of that the reduced margins amounts that we\u2019ve earned from our operations there have amounted to an aggregate of $1.4 billion and next year roughly half and half by Freeport and Government of Indonesia.","So we are working diligently to first find the way forward to resume export and normal operations, and doing that in a way that protects our position for the ongoing discussions about the arrangements for us to be able to continue operations beyond 2021 on acceptable basis.","Over the past two months, we have month and a half, we have been working with the government on a Memorandum of Understanding. We believe that we have reached an agreement with the government officials we\u2019ve been working with on the terms of that MoU. It is yet to be signed.","Indonesia had a Presidential election on July the 9th and the results of that vote were only announced on July the 22nd. The elections during the first half of the year for the President, for the parliament earlier have been a distracting issue in terms of our ability to reach this agreement with the government.","But we believe we have reached agreement on the terms of MoU. Under that MoU, which, as I said, has not yet been signed but we expect to be signed shortly. We have -- we would agree to provide for payment of an export duty over the next three years 2014, \u201915 and \u201816. But that significantly reduce rates from the regulations that were adopted in January.","In addition, we would provide $115 million assurance bond for the development of new smelter capacity in Indonesia and we\u2019ve indicated a willingness to meet the government\u2019s objective of developing this smelter capacity subject to further negotiations and those negotiations involve -- include having an agreement on acceptable terms for continuing our operations beyond 2021.","We\u2019re talking with the government and providing financial incentives because building a new smelter in today\u2019s world is financially uneconomic. We are also looking at involving strategic partners in the process, and so there is work to be done on this smelter issue that require further work but we did -- we are making this deposit of insurance bond, which would be release as progress on the smelters is achieved.","The new mining loan related regulations provided for increased royalties. We currently pay a royalty of 3.5% for copper. The mining laws regulations right raised that 4%, we pay 1% on gold and the new mining law is 3.75%.","As an accommodation to the government to achieve this MoU allowing us to resume exports, we've agreed to -- upon signing of MoU to pay the new royalty rates. Now, all of these issues are things that we've done that represent prudent steps in building good relationships with the Government of Indonesia, which we have had over the 40 years of operations there and building the basis, a bridge for our continuing good relationships for the long-term.","It's a situation that we've had a lot of experience with not only in Indonesia but around the world in terms of trying to find ways of protecting our interest of our shareholders, at the same time trying to meet the aspirations of the government officials and so that is the basis for this concessions that we\u2019ve agreed to making this MoU.","We are -- have agreed with the government that upon signed MoU we will commence immediate negotiations for amendments of our CAL on items that we will be addressing, including importantly the ability to continue operating beyond 2021 on the basis of assurance of legal and fiscal terms to support the significant investments in developing our underground resources.","Our current outlook numbers, if you see in our release are based on resumption of exports in August, any delays in obtaining these approvals result in monthly deferrals additional 50 million pounds of copper and 80,000 ounces of gold.","If for whatever reason this falls apart, we don\u2019t expected to, we think we have a way forward with these things then we would take steps to adjust our cost structure and reduce our CapEx, because it is not sustainable to go forward on the basis that we've been operating on since January.","Slide six, I won\u2019t just refer to in general, it talks about our long-term positive relationship in Indonesia. As you know this has been a fabulous asset for Freeport and for Indonesian, the workers and the local community. It\u2019s world class. It\u2019s been very profitable.","We made investments of significance during very risky times in the copper markets and risky times in Indonesia and Papua and we have all benefited over the last 10 years as copper prices, gold prices are risen so much and we got a huge reserve base to go forward for many years in the future.","We've been there for over 40 years, contributed over $60 billion to the country's G&P. We represented over 90% of the economy in the area that we operate in and a significant contributed to Indonesia's national GDP, 30,000 workers. We developed already the company's only copper smelter, which has capacity that exceeds Indonesia\u2019s national copper consumption, very significant investments today with $15 billion program to develop our underground resources.","We contribute significantly to the local community, including the voluntary contribution of 1% of our revenues to the Freeport partnership fund. And so we\u2019ve done a lot of things and you can see the government benefits from taxes, royalties and dividends, notice, bulk of that is trough taxes, which we have a fixed rate on.","And the government gets more than 50% of the financial benefit. So there is a lot of reasons, incentives for the government to work with us and we\u2019re going to work with the government to established, rebuild and maintain our long-term goodwill and partnership going forward. We\u2019ll be available to answer questions on this.","Turning to copper markets, first half of 2014 has been in some ways a mix bag, going into the year, there were lot of questions about the China's economy and growth rates and how that we are going to maintain that.","They had this unusual situation of apparently fraudulent activity at a port in China that spooked the market for awhile and some elements of China has been strong than people anticipated, but on balance, on balance China have had solid demand and has shaken off some of the earlier issues of the year and remains key to the marketplace.","In the rest of the world, there has been a degree of general economic recovery. Again that has been spotty with the mix data we\u2019ve had here in the U.S. Europe, we seeing our business in Europe, gradual strengthening, of course, there are lot of geopolitical uncertainties going around the world today that could have economic consequences.","But having looked at that to see the level of copper prices that we have today, I think demonstrates the long-term strength of the copper markets. Prices continue to be supported by supply side challenges which we\u2019ve talked about for so many years.","Exchange inventories are extraordinarily low levels. There is limited scrap availability, consumer stocks are low and the industry continues to struggle to maintain production levels from aging mines and to advance expansion projects.","There's a significant deferral of major projects around the world as companies look to cut capital, focus on return to shareholders, the supply side issue will continue to be a major supported back for the marketplace and we\u2019re very excited about the copper markets and where we stand in that market with our large and growing level of production and our very large resource base that will give us future growth opportunities.","The projected market surpluses that people reporting to are now appeared to be much lower levels than anticipated. So, we are -- we remain very positive on long-term fundamental of the marketplace.","Turning to our business, these slide, specifically the slide on page eight demonstrates that we have performed well, you can see in relation to our first quarter results, strong performance in North America, South America, Indonesia reflects the issues that I just spoke about and an Africa where we have had relatively good reliability of our power sources improves there, we really performed very well. So our businesses are doing well. You can see the results from a volume standpoint at bottom of the chart.","With are projects we undertook three projects to expand our copper volumes by roughly a $1 billion pounds a year. Last year, we brought the Tenke project online and did that in a very effective way and that expanded operations performing well.","We achieved another milestone in this quarter by executing the growth project with the start-up at Morenci and that is a significant high return project that will add 225 million pounds of copper per annum and Morenci is a resource that we are looking for future long-term significant growth.","We benefit with these projects by bringing talent from our global operations to supplement the work done by contractors, every project has it challenges. You see that throughout the industry but when you working with it, it\u2019s easy look at these numbers and see how we do it, but it\u2019s a lot of difficult work in getting the job done. We are very optimistic about our footprint of our business in United States, about our ability to repeat what we've done at Morenci at other site, go get Morenci and other sites.","Cerro Verde is huge project, when its completed this will be the largest concentrator milling operation in the world with 360,000 tons day. Our team is totally focused. It's a project that is have less risk than many other expansion projects because of the footprint what we have done in the past, we completed -- virtually completed engineering procurement.","Now we are focused on managing this very large scale construction project. None of these are without challenges and Cerro Verde has its, but it's really going well and we see a clear line of site start-up late 2015.","And despite all of the issues in constraining production at Grasberg, we continue to make good progress in our underground development and this is important terms of our being able to execute our mine plan of completing mining in the pit which will likely now extent until the first quarter or so early 2017.","The Deep MLZ mine, the extension of our current producing field design, it was targeted start-up in second half of 2015 and this just represents a continuation of block caving that PT Freeport Indonesia started in the early 1980.","So these projects are going well. What we are looking to is a portfolio of world scale mines that spend low with great growth opportunities, there -- just a handful of mines today that produce a billion pounds of copper per year.","We have Grasberg in that category, Morenci will reach that, Cerro Verde will reach that, Tenke Fungurume has the resources availability to ultimately reach it and we are looking at expanding our El Abra mine with sulfide resources that we put in that category. So we go right about having this portfolio of asset with potentially five world-class operations.","We are really pleased with Jim and his teams doing in oil and gas business and now he will give us some comment on it.","Jim Flores","Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. The oil and gas business continues to click alone quite nicely that with strong crude market, I think everybody has paid attention to the political unrest around the world and it\u2019s helped (indiscernible) not the near-term but the long-term tail of the crude oil market and so, it helps our transaction business but also for standpoint our realizations continued to hold up very well mainly in the Gulf of Mexico.","When we talk about sale of 60 million barrels, 5% above our investment and Kathleen said as, due to strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico and also our Eagle Ford with a $58 barrel margin and 50% of that comes from the Gulf of Mexico $73 BOE margins.","The results today do include our Eagle Ford production because actually we sold at the right end of the second quarter. So third quarter going forward we will not have the Eagle Ford in it but we will have additional resources from the Gulf of Mexico and it continues to replace those reserves that we sold to $3.1 billon.","Talking about that transaction on page 12, we sold to Encana it here, as we fully acquired. We rotate it. It\u2019s about $900 million of deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest. We consolidate more interest in the Lucius oil development, that\u2019s operated by Anadarko that we have significant interest and gives us just about quarter interest in that development. And this is on schedule for the second half of this year September, October start-up as far as we always bringing that nice oil reserve on production.","Our Heidelberg oil development is a new entry for us. Anadarko also operate 12.5% interest in Heidelberg. It\u2019s another significant Miocene play just west of our Holstein. It\u2019s very integrated into our geologic thinking and development thinking. We think there\u2019s lot of oil reserves there and that development is scheduled to come on second half of 2016. And we got some complementary oil and gas places to some of the resources we were capturing. So all-in-all, it was a good -- it was a very good swing.","By the end of 2017, we project these assets to be producing as much as the Eagle Ford assets were going to produce, once the client sets in there and after the drilling is finished in the Eagle Ford assets where we have engineer. So we feel like we\u2019re replacing with a lot more growth and a lot better margin in the Gulf of Mexico.","As an important step in the debt reduction program, we want to accelerate the corporate goals of getting down to $12 billion by 2016. It\u2019s been definitely value accretive on EBITDA basis and help refocus our portfolio, the strategic growth there is on the Gulf of Mexico. These will be our big areas of growth, higher investment returns.","Currently, we are on the eve of the beginning to start rolling with our mobile units out in the Gulf of Mexico. Next week, the Noble Sam Croft goes to work out at our Holstein facility. We\u2019ve got a rig on our Holstein platform that\u2019s drilling development wells and as of this morning, just drilled our second excellent-looking development well there, the first one cruising over 3,000 barrels a day.","So as we sell these onshore assets and redeploy the capital on our balance sheet and some of the capital in the Gulf of Mexico, we will not only be replacing the production but growing production much faster in the years to come, now as the rigs were replaced. We had a Noble Sam Croft starts next week. We had Noble Tom Madden started here in. And then we have a new relationship out there in deepwater but an old relationship in the drilling contracting business with Rowan Drilling Company, with the Rowan Relentless that\u2019s going to start first half of \u201815.","What you\u2019re going to see there is a tremendous amount of upside pressure to our production profile there in the Gulf. Our guys have done a great job at Holstein. For example, we bought the property that was producing about 11,000, 12,000 barrels a day. Today it\u2019s over 24,000 barrels a day after just drilling one well. It\u2019s a great production maintenance.","So with this activity, it\u2019s been a long time coming since the acquisition of 2012. That\u2019s what the genesis of our combination, was able to accelerate the development activity going forward on these properties. At the same point in time, further investment in Gulf of Mexico. So we project that we\u2019ll have $4 billion to $5 billion more of onshore asset sales to further accelerate the debt paydown, debt reduction plan here at the company. At the same point in time, we will be buying additional interest in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to complement our portfolio in the hundreds of millions of dollars.","So we\u2019ll be selling in the $4 billion to $5 billion range and will be buying in the hundreds of millions of dollars to add to our potential launch forward. This has been a very successful program so far. We spent about $500 million on the last two oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and including significant onshore effort of buying leases.","And we feel like we doubled the reserve potential or the resource potential of our business from 3 billion barrels to over 6 billion barrels that we capture and at the same point in time paying down significant amount of debt here at the company. So we\u2019re going to continue this process and going forward and the future looks like bright in all front, the assets sales as well as the Gulf of Mexico strategic position.","On Page 13 is just kind of get you the breadth of our operations. Now we are fully integrated in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We have operating producing assets with the great staff, great systems, topline operations and doing a great job out here with all the guys and all the partnerships with all out vendors as well that really stepped up. So we can get our jobs done on time and on budget. We\u2019ve major development projects that we\u2019re doing, the tiebacks to our existing facilities as well as the major development.","There are partners that doing like Anadarko that have done a great job at Lucius and also at Heidelberg and then with our exploration opportunities, here is the picture of the Sam Croft here. Now that we have top-flight equipment, we\u2019ll have three of this drilling by the end of -- by the middle of next year and we\u2019ll see some real action here on the development front on the wells and the production going forward.","Those three rigs will be situated between Horn Mountain, Ram Powell, Holstein, Heidelberg and Lucius areas on Page 14. Right now, at Holstein we have the rig running on the platform as I said before. We\u2019ve got the Transocean and Deepwater Champion drilling our copper well right now, exploratory wells south of Holstein that if successful, will be tied back to Holstein and then we have the Sam Croft as I said is moving on today.","To the west side of Holstein structure, we drill some of the discoveries we made few years back. Holstein is going to look like invaded but it\u2019s going to really see a lot of great production growth in \u201815 and \u201816 because of it.","Moving on to our development projects at Lucius and Heidelberg. As I said these are both on time and you see the net interest now about a quarter of Lucius, 12.5% of Heidelberg and then fall of this year, Lucius comes on and then the fall of 2016, the Heidelberg project comes on, both significant development assets that Anadarko\u2019s done a great job with.","On the emerging exploration plays in the new lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous activity, we continue to monitor activity out there. We moved -- we\u2019re getting ready to move the rig in on a Farthest Gate West project to work on Lineham Creek, would be a (indiscernible) 25,000 feet that is excited about. And we\u2019re moving forward on the completion of the Highlander that\u2019s on schedule for either late September or early October. Well tests as well as Blackbeard East and Blackbeard West, we\u2019re moving forward to complete those wells as well.","So there has been a lot of completion activity. We\u2019re going to have a lot of understanding of flow reservoirs, and hopefully some fantastic production coming, especially out of Highlander going forward. 2014 outlook, Richard, you want to take off from here.","Richard Adkerson","Okay. Thanks Jim. We\u2019re updating our outlook. It reflects the -- from our previous outlook the delay in getting restarted at Grasberg. This is based on a resumption of exports, returning to normal operations in August and shows sales outlook for our company as a whole of 4.1 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold, 98 million pounds of molybdenum. By the way the price of molybdenum is up over 30% this year and oil equivalents of 58.4 million barrels equivalents.","That\u2019s lower than previous because of the Eagle Ford sale. And as Jim said, we\u2019ve got investment activities to look for future growth in that area. We are now projecting at -- for the year, unit cost of a $1.50 a pound, that\u2019s $1300 of gold and $12 of molybdenum and $20 of barrel equivalent for oil. Operating cash flow is at 325 copper for the second half would be at $6.8 billion and capital expenditures now are looking to come in at $7.6 billion.","Our sales profile looking forward shows the significant growth for copper as we complete our expansion projects and see the effects of those expansions projects plus the year 2016 reflects in essence the final activities in the Grasberg open pit where we\u2019ll have very high grades of copper and you will note the planned gold sales for that year are exceptionally high.","Note also at the bottom right, the growth in oil and gas sales as these expansion projects, Jim just talked about coming on stream. Quarterly outlook is presented on Page 19. Again based on restart at Grasberg in August and having a very strong second -- particularly the fourth quarter is for copper and for gold that\u2019s our detail that would result on that basis of an improvement in our unit cost from the experience in the second quarter where we would look to bring in the year combined with what we had in the first half of the year at 1.50 per pound for copper and you can see how that breaks down in our different regional areas.","When we look at our models for cash flows on Page 21, you see EBITDA numbers at the top operating cash flows which take into account cash taxes and cash interests, excluding working capital changes and you can see this is an average for 2015 and 2016 and very strong cash flows between $3 and $4 ranging from over $10 billion to over $14 billion with that range.","So we\u2019ve got a business that generates great margins from cash flows that allows us to fund our expansion projects. You can see our current outlook for capital as our mining projects wind down going into 2016 and then as our oil and gas investments reflect the opportunities that we\u2019ve created there. So this is a really no changes in the \u201816 outlook for that. We referred a couple of times to our commitment to our balance sheet management when we announced the oil and gas deal.","We\u2019ve talked about targeting, reducing debt to $12 billion by the end of 2016. We\u2019ve had some challenges with copper prices have been weaker than they were prior to that announcement. We\u2019ve had the issue with deferred revenues from Grasberg but we still are committed to having this strong balance sheet. We sold a very good asset in the Eagle Ford asset in the second quarter.","We are working now directly on additional asset sales across our business. We are prepared to respond to market conditions. We can\u2019t predict near-term market outlooks but we will respond to those whatever they may be. And we look further opportunities to repay, reduce our debt, improve our maturity structure and so forth. We are committed to continuing to pay our current dividend of a $1.25 a share for a year until we get our balance sheet in shape and once that happens with our business, outlook for commodity prices will have a chance of paying additional dividend.","Beside asset sales, we have the opportunity of looking for participation by strategic partners in some part of our business to reduce capital expenditures. So we\u2019re looking at this at all angles, 2016 will be a very important year in terms of achieving this because of the nature of our business plans.","So the story at Freeport stays the same. We\u2019re working on shareholder returns, managing our base assets, investing in growth as we reduce our debt. We had a good discussion last night about the challenges of doing that and there\u2019s not many business that can do it but we had the opportunity to do it. We are going to protect balance sheet because we and our board and we, I should, say are convinced that matching up kind of assets we have and the nature of the markets that we\u2019re in, strong balance sheet is a key to success in our business. And we want to continue our legacy of returning cash to our shareholders and look forward to the time when we reach that dividend levels, from where we are today.","That completes our summary of our business. And now we will open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Good morning everybody. Yes, Jorge here from DB. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the comments Richard, maybe, that were made at the start on the presentation 5 where you had mentioned that there was a possibility of selling other assets and then just picking up as well on Jim Flores\u2019 comments about potentially even shrinking your oil and gas footprint further from potentially selling things in the $5 billion range and then rebuying stuff in hundreds of millions of dollar range.","So just kind of wanted to understand from a balance sheet perspective, how is Freeport feeling right now? Do you feel that on a go-forward basis, you\u2019re going to have to really do some asset sales to really make those to $12 billion net debt -- sorry debt target three years out. Just trying to understand really what\u2019s driving the divestiture landscape a little bit. There has been some rumours on Candelaria and now there is some talk of further oil and gas asset sales. So just trying to understand how you\u2019re feeling on your balance sheet right now?","Richard Adkerson","Well, we are facing the fact that we\u2019ve had lower copper prices than we had going into the acquisition of oil and gas deal. We had the deferrals at Grasberg. I mean that\u2019s just part of the nature of our business. We have issues that we face and those create headwinds to reaching that. We don\u2019t know what copper prices are going to be in 2015 and 2016, and we are not going to bet our business on predicting prices.","The way we\u2019ve been looking at assets to sell, and I think Eagle Ford is a great example of this. This was a very good asset. There was a very strong market of bars owning to invest in that as many companies are transitioning from a natural gas orientation to all orientation. We are looking at other assets where good assets but assets that don\u2019t have the growth profiles that our other assets have, and seeing if there is aggressive buyers who will step up and pay good prices for them, as we then focus on our assets that have good growth potential.","As a future of our oil and gas business, the strategy there is built around the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our gas exploration play, our deep gas exploration play. So we are continuing to do that. We are assessing the market, working with interested buyers. And if we can find transactions that in effect advance our ability to repay debt or derisk the ability to repay debt, as we don\u2019t know how things are going to unfold in 2015-2016. We will act to take place with that. These things require actions.","We look at assets and test the market at times and decide those assets even as it makes sense to sell those assets when we look at their underlying cash flows. So this is a dynamic process. We are focused on debt reduction. And if we find assets that don\u2019t undermine our ability to grow in the future and where we have buyers that will pay reasonable prices in relation to cash flows they generate, we will execute those transactions.","Jim Flores","Jorge, this is Jim. I would just echo what Rich talked about, the all of the above balance sheet management is the mantra across all sectors of the business. And with our large CapEx budget, we could manufacture more as we\u2019re going to do in the Gulf -- as we are doing in the Gulf of Mexico and so forth. And the fact of the matter of selling onto our oil assets, there is a premium market right now. The MLP market is very hot. Debt markets are very low. Oil prices are significantly strong. Even in the near term or long term, we can get representative value for those assets and then replicate those assets in an area in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater very quickly an area where we have higher margins the strength. It\u2019s a bad test to arbitrage that complements or accelerates our corporate objective of reducing the leverage companywide. At the same point in time, we are still hitting the same targets of about 200,000 to 225,000 BOE a day in 2017. And that\u2019s selling and then drilling our development wells to bring it forward.","So by meeting those objectives operationally and bringing that cash flow forward out of those assets sales to accelerate the financial standing of the company, I think what is kind of highlight is all the resources we captured joining our platforms and lease sales and so forth. And everybody is going to get used to growing production in the Gulf of Mexico and monetization of production elsewhere in the company that will go towards the balance sheet repair. And I think that\u2019s what Richard talked about earlier. That\u2019s a two-edge sword. That\u2019s very difficult to do, grow business rapidly and pay down debt at the same time, but we are in a position to do it, take advantage of the price and so on. So it\u2019s just more of a -- it\u2019s a strategic initiative than a defensive. It\u2019s been just to be a more aggressive and trying to get our balance sheet very, very strong and be in good shape to take advantage if any opportunity comes after 2017.","Richard Adkerson","And we have great set of assets that allow us to do that.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","And thanks. And Jim since you brought it up, the CapEx did increase for Freeport and it was mostly on the oil side about a $400 million increase for 2014. I was wondering if you could talk about, is that sort of accelerating growth in the Gulf of Mexico? Could you flesh out what that incremental growth CapEx is, especially just after a recent assets sale there?","Jim Flores","Yes. Number one, we added some CapEx from the Heidelberg development which we acquired interest there that obviously went in our portfolio before. But the main driver that is that due to the stricter terms on some of the lease expansion and delays that the federal authorities put out here, we had to go ahead and move some rigs and try to get completions on our Blackbeard West and some of the Inboard Lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous completion. So that was a more regulatory driven acceleration of that activity and we hope -- we surely hope it leads higher production rates and volumes. So it is to accelerate completion activity in ultra-deep. So in short term, either way.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Yes. Good morning. The question on Indonesia. In terms of the new agreement that\u2019s a Memorandum of Understanding that you have agreement to but waiting to sign. It seems like the government is undoing a lot of the terms of the Contract of Work and replacing it with what you call this license agreements. Will they also -- will your tax rate now revert back to the statutory rate? Under the Contract of Work, you are paying a 35% tax rate, which was in place when you signed the agreement in the 90s. And now I believe that\u2019s the rate or the rate is 25% in Indonesia. Will your corporate tax rate drop as these other royalties go up?","Jim Flores","Mike, let me -- I am going to go back over some things that I said earlier and just to make sure we got to stay set, with this MoU the basic terms of our Contract of Work are not being changed. And both our rights and obligations and the government\u2019s rights and obligations for the basic contract are not being changed now and we\u2019ve agreed to enter into a series of negotiations as to how to bridge this gap between our viewing the world with the eyes of our contract and the government viewing the world with the eyes of their mining law and related regulations, and that\u2019s the work to be done.","The only three things that are currently actions that will be taken as a result of this MoU are the agreement to pay royalties, the agreement to pay these duties for a limited period of time, and the agreement to make this escrow deposit. So the tax rate will remain the same. The government\u2019s expectation is that the tax rate would remain the same going forward. And in fact under their licensing regulations for the formal license that would apply to us if we were under licenses to situation, there is a current 35% tax rate.","So these things that we are doing now are in reality Mike concessions that we are making and our business judgment is that those concessions are warranted in terms of resolving the current impasse we have on the export bans. So it is a compromise to create a bridge for us so that we can return to normal operations, so that we maintain goodwill with the government to help us reach a resolution that it protects our shareholders interest in the long run and that\u2019s our reasoning for doing it. But all the other terms for the contract are not being changed with this MoU.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Okay. And another question just taking a few steps forward from here, in regards to the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia. Is it your expectation that Rio Tinto would be responsible for funding 40% or some percent of the CapEx to build the smelters since they will be achieving the -- receiving the benefit of it in the future?","Jim Flores","The structure of the ownership interest and how we deal with the smelters is yet to be finalized. Rio Tinto does have an interest in the operation as you mentioned in the long run, so they will certainly be at the table on this. We will also -- we\u2019ve had interest expressed by strategic partners about participating both in Indonesia and outside of Indonesia, and then the government we have noted in this MoU the discussion about financial incentives that the government would be able to talk about. So that is a work-in-progress like much of this MoU.","The first step is the agreement to get us to work. Then we got a lot of work to do in terms of the long-term situation, including the smelter. And the reality Mike is the Commission that managed the elections just announced the results of the vote. There is going to be a transition of a new government that will come into place at the end of October. And so as we go forward, we are going to have a period of time of dealing with the existing administration and then dealing with a new government that has a five-year term. So that\u2019s another factor that will come into play, as we begin these negotiations on how to go forward.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Okay. The last question on this and it\u2019s going to be a tough one to answer. But you have a contract with the government that suppose to supersede any changes in law in the country and the government comes in with the new mining law and basically changes part of the game. What\u2019s to stop the government from doing that again in a couple of years?","Jim Flores","Well, we are going to have an arrangement. We\u2019ve been dealing with -- you asked a tough question, we\u2019ve been dealing with real tough questions here for 2.5 years. And so this is not an easy answer, but if you read what we\u2019ve said in our release carefully, and in the MoU we\u2019ve carefully crafted an acknowledgment and understanding that however we come out of this, we are going to have to have a basis for assured operations on fiscal and legal terms that protect our shareholder interest. So we will have those legal protections and then the business judgment will come out as to how do you deal with that going forward. And experience has taught us that the best way to do that if it\u2019s achievable is to find a way to deal with it in a way that reaches common acceptability.","Indonesia needs foreign investment. Their economy has performed very well over the last 10 years. They have a very large internal economy that\u2019s growing. They become a member of the G20. The country has changed so much over the past 25 years I have been going there. And yet, they have a very large young population. And to put people to work, they don\u2019t have an internal saving rate as large enough to create investments, to create jobs that whoever presence is going to be have to have. So at the end of the day, they are going to need foreign investments. It\u2019s an emerging country and emerging democracy. They don\u2019t do everything as in the way that more developed country, more mature countries do, but there is going to be some imperatives for them to put people to work. It is a true democracy and so whoever is President, whoever is running the government is going to be responsible to these people because of the way that they can vote.","And so it\u2019s not an easy path, and we have to make business judgments. But again we come back to the fact that those business judgments reflect our desire to have goodwill and partnership going forward and not just dig our heels in and point to out legal rights. So we\u2019ve done this and you saw we went through in the Congo. We had a situation there where we had to make some concessions but as a result of that we kept our asset, its operating very well.","I believe, five years from now we look back and say we did the right thing and that\u2019s how we had to look at it from the long term because this is a very long-term asset, very valuable asset for our shareholders. You just look at those numbers in 2016 and it comes real apparent to you. We want to be operating there and take benefit of all this work we\u2019ve done.","Since -- actually, since 1988, when we discovered the Grasberg and all during the 90s to develop our mine plans. We\u2019ve been looking forward to that year for a long time and we made a lot of money in the interim through difficult times in Indonesia, through operational issues, through political, social changes there, through tough copper markets. You and I know that all too well, Mike. So anyway that\u2019s we\u2019re working on this in a way that we\u2019re long term shareholders and going to protect their interest.","Jim Bob Moffett","","This is Jim Bob. There\u2019s restructuring going on in the industry. People that have the concentrate want to have the smelters on there soil. So all this concentrate has been banned for export, mean that the smelters around the world are going to have reality. They are going to have develop smelters in the country where their concentrate is. That\u2019s what this whole export controversy\u2019s about. It\u2019s going to another country and that\u2019s why the strategic partners build this smelter, going to be coming because you can't take in and cut off as much concentrate, it has to stay on soil that is produced.","So if you take that into consideration and realize it as we are in these negotiations which is the government. Not only there are other changes in the social structure of Indonesia, but there is a definite change of policy around the world. So the traditional market has concentrate been smelted in other countries. It\u2019s going to change quickly. So, we\u2019re in the middle of that. We\u2019re in the middle of the social development in Indonesia.","But understand that we built this bridge with this MoU. To get in and take on the step that like what the tax rates are going to be and what kind of long-term agreement we have to have with the lease reserve in front of us. And we\u2019re converting this mine to an underground mine and the governments are well aware that we found the resource. We know where the traditional ore bodies are and so we have a long-term credibility with this government. And we will come up with something, especially with this restructuring of the whole market, when you talk about the refinery smelter requirements.","But you\u2019re going to see that around the world. There\u2019s going to be a lot of statements in that when they control asset, but if you look at the world and see people who have tried get too aggressive with their control of asset, look at what\u2019s going on in Venezuela today. Headlines that you\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ve got headlines yesterday, chaos in Venezuela as a result of the political decisions that were made. So we have work through this.","We\u2019ve been talking to this people a long time. And we have this partnership that was iced by our discovery of the Grasberg 88. And the government needs as to continue to have run that over. The government need us to build technical facilities. We\u2019re going to be building the largest underground mine in the world. So we have the latest global basis, when you\u2019re over there negotiated. So the contract is a big plus for us and that\u2019s why we can negotiate differently and think that they don\u2019t have it.","Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan","Thank you for those comments, Jim Bob.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Good morning.","Richard Adkerson ","Morning Sal.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Can you tell us again, what's the relationship between the expansion of COW torque and the MOU? Are they dependent on each other, or are they exclusively independent of each other?","Richard Adkerson","Well, they\u2019re not interdependent on each other that MOU is a bridge to further negotiations on the contract of work and the rights to operate beyond, including the rights to operate beyond 2021. The MoU has two components to it. One is a current agreement to take three actions that are described earlier. And then it sets up for further process for the renegotiation, extended negotiation, foreign extension and so forth. So, it does not. It\u2019s a first step and it was first step resolve this export situation and then lead into the further negotiations.","Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs","So would you be willing to -- so your terms would be that MOU, sorry, COW extension should stay, as is, where which is sort of post-MOU agreement, which is higher royalty and so forth, that it extends that those conditions just remain the same for the next 20 years for the extension? Is that where you would stand?","Richard Adkerson ","Well, I think is a practical matter. With this agreement, we are agreeing to these new royalty rates for the life of mine. And you saw that chart that we had on page where we show the benefits to the government of Indonesia. Page 6, you can see that royalties are relatively small part of what we pay to the government. And yet it\u2019s a lightning rod issue, meaning, publicly in Indonesia, many people think of Grasberg as a gold mine. We pay a 1% royalty on gold. It is an amount of money. But is not major in relation to our total financial situation.","So, this represents for the royalty I think, what our royalty rates going to be for the life of mine. When you get to this export duty, that\u2019s a short-term situation leading to the smelter development and that remains to be negotiated.","So that\u2019s the duties, the deposits, that\u2019s all part of the smelter picture. That\u2019s got to be a hot bucket target. The purpose of this mining law in large part had to do with the nickel industry and the bauxite industry, where Indonesia is a major global supplier.","And what Indonesia was doing, was mining raw ores, shipping them to Japan and China for further processing and for aluminum and nickel, the major part of the value is created downstream. And they have prohibited those and put a lot of small businesses and other size businesses in Indonesia, out of business.","And politically, people view copper, even though it's economically different to be in the similar situated. So that's the problem we\u2019ve been dealing with. In a country, Indonesia is not alone like this, where you have resource nationalism to think about penalizing Indonesian companies and giving different situation for foreign investors like Freeport, is politically tough deal to swallow and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing with.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs","And last thing for me is, Rio Tinto obviously has -- is going to be a major part of this Indonesian mine, starting 2021. I'm just wondering, are they involved in these negotiations and will they be part of it, and would they have a say in it or is it, you are dictating the terms?","Richard Adkerson ","We\u2019re certainly not dictating the terms. We have a participation agreement with Rio Tinto. We\u2019ve had a great partnership. It\u2019s started in 1995. They have rights under their participation agreement. We have been negotiating with the government directly having discussions with them. There are many issues that we\u2019re going to have to work with together as we go forward.","But we have a joint venture, it has participation agreement. They have rights under that and we will work with them consistent with their rights. But you're right, they are going to be a significant participant in the operations going forward.","Jim Bob Moffett","Hi. This is Jim Bob again. In 1988 we had the blessing find the largest ore body in the world. You look at the copper, gold, silver, paying on copper prices and gold prices. So to find the 100-year live mine in the middle of New Guinea, up at 13,000 feet, which is quite a challenge. In fact that you have evolving world and all the market forces it work from the day we found the mine, trying to get out there and get that copper down from 13,000 feet.","The remote area that has no infrastructure and no current employment base. We look at everything, aspects of this from the day we found the property. But the blessing is that it was the key measure and gave us an opportunity to build our business to what it is today. So the challenge of how you deal with the current year of mine in an ever changing world, we have to keep that in perspective.","But the good news is we have richest ore body in the world and that rich ore gives us gold and silver byproduct, especially with what happened to the price of gold and price of copper since we found the mine. Price of copper was $100 for all those years as we found the mine.","So talk about negotiations in looking forward and operations till 2041. We have to look back and say, we are blessed with the fact that we\u2019ve got something as probably when we producing till 2061. So that\u2019s what you have to do keep the mine on a pricing side having that kind of asset and we\u2019ve manage through to this just like we manage through all the other challenges.","Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Hi. Good morning, everyone. As I was listening to your comments, Richard and Jim Bob, about the sensitivities there. It seems like there's some similarities with what you all are dealing with in Indonesia, with what Rio's dealing in Mongolia and seems like the government kind of has an edge because the projects are further along, a lot of the value is underground?","And I'm wondering, how should we -- should we be unnerved by statements coming out of the press in Indonesia that the CAL extension discussions would not begin until 2019? And is that just, that's not true? And first of all, can you make me feel more comfortable about that, as you're going through this process and clearly you're making concessions here? Is that what's the guarantee that you will be able to take that next step here, number one?","Richard Adkerson","All right. Let me, first of all, just make a comment about this two-year situation. That is the result of a regulation that was adopted by the government. It\u2019s not a provision in the 2009 mining law. But the government considered -- the government that we have been dealing with considers that regulation to be important. And so that\u2019s been one of the barriers that we have had to get a completion of discussion on the contract extension.","We have spent a lot of time advising the government that we cannot wait until 2019 to understand our rights to operate beyond 2021. And the terms of those operations between now and 2019, our plans call for us to spend $8 billion of capital in developing the underground mine and then we have this smelter situation to deal with.","So there is important provision of this MoU is that we are going to -- we both agreed to deal with this issue over the next six months. So from the government standpoint, they have been looking at this regulation, our standpoint says our CAL makes us not applicable to that and the MoU says, okay, we are going to work this out. We didn\u2019t reach on it now. We are going to work this out over the next six months.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Okay.","Jim Bob Moffett","MoU, Tony, is a bridge. What that does is, it opposed to waiting until 2019, that was the mechanism, that\u2019s why we made the concessions so that we force both ourselves and the government to come to the table and realize.","The good news is, we\u2019ve gotten that forward to be producing way in beyond 2040, we won\u2019t. But having this smelter issue come up, this mining law versus the CAL and the license. That\u2019s exactly what we try to do. To get this MoU move this negotiation period from 2019 to today. So everybody can understand the reality.","We can be spend all those money underground. Our money on the smelter without having some financial assurance, doesn\u2019t do any good to build the smelter, if you don\u2019t build this underground mine, it actually not available to the smelter.","So this is a very complex situation. But as I said earlier, this mine is so rich and so big, again raise this kind of problems that we have in the negotiation. That\u2019s what the MoU does and it starts the negotiation there to solve this problem in 2021.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Thank you. And I guess that, I guess, my next question would be, I know you guys have been over there a lot and I just assuming a lot of your efforts these days? But have you been in direct conversation with the new President Jokowi or members of his team, the team elect there at this point and what can you tell us about his certainly understanding of the seriousness of this matters and his willingness now to meet you guys and his team at the table here as we go forward?","Richard Adkerson","Well, Tony, we stayed out of the political process leading up to the election, it was a very hotly contested election. The elections tend to be and it\u2019s split parties, it split people and government, and we always in the position of not trying to influence election or get involve with them. We work with whatever government, people of the country elect and so we stayed out of the political process.","The Vice President under Jokowi was former Vice President under first term of SPY and we have known him for a long time. He is business man. We had past relationships with people involved on both side of the election.","Jokowi has made some positive comments recently about working to resolve the mining issue and we are going to be prepare to work with them as their transition goes from the current administration to his administration.","Our hopes are that we will be able to engage with his transition team, his leadership team and working with the current government to help us began this process before they have come into office at the end of October.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Okay. Thanks for that Richard and Jim Bob. And I guess the final question I have is, I haven\u2019t heard any mention today of possibly to a sell-down provision and I -- is that, I know in the past you have talked about you would be open to possibly divesting a stake that was previously owned by some Indonesian interest, but has that come up, is that something that is likely to be part of a future contract or business license arrangement and what can you say about that?","Richard Adkerson","Yeah. It is one of the items, there were six strategic items that we have agreed to discuss in terms of the renegotiation our contract of work. This divestment issue is one of those and we have tentatively agreed on the process of divestment that would involve increasing Indonesian ownership interest overtime to 30% from the current 9.36%.","That would involve giving initially the government an opportunity to acquire interest we have talked about having a listing on the Indonesian Exchange, which we view positively and the government views positively.","Any divestment would be at fair value and but that is not something that is committed to under this or are the final agreement hasn\u2019t been reached under this Memorandum of Understanding. But that would be part of the amended CAL and but the current contemplation is that there would be divestment of fair value overtime to raise Indonesian ownership interest to 30%.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Jim Bob. Jim Bob, I am sorry, you were going to say something too?","Jim Bob Moffett","What I am saying is in the making out here is government understands the huge expenditure, first of all, underground and it actually talking in the government about a regulation that will come out and says that people will have underground, big underground mines.","We have been shared the 30%. So there is a lot of people, thinking about lot of different things, mine open pit versus underground, major expenditures for getting underground and getting those. So again there is a bridge with this MoU. We always have this under table and try to get them understood.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Thank you so much gentlemen. If I may sneak in one final question, I am sorry about this, I just want to ask Jim a question, and I noticed, I didn\u2019t hear anybody talk about this, but and I am sorry, if you -- if this is redundant? But the Davy Jones well test 2, I see that it was not a success? Can you make any further comments on that, just update us there?","Jim Flores","Well, it wasn\u2019t the commercial success. We have work. We have perforated log section of resistant log section plus also section of the log that was suspect. We produced lot of salt water and some gas out of it.","The only comment really that makes any sense, these are wildcat completion. We are learning from each on, the equipment worked flawlessly and so forth. We are merely took all the equipment we could and especially the tubing string and all the long we got out of Davy Jones No. 2 and moved expeditiously over to Highlander. And Highlander test is really going to be one of the definitive commercial moments in this whole play.","So from the technical standpoint and engineering standpoint, we learned a lot, it was, I would say, everything was successful, safe and so forth. But from the commercial standpoint it was a failure.","We are in the process of P&A in the No. 1 well, but we are unable to get the flow, I am going to take that equipment on No. 1 well and perforate the lower to tertiary Wolfcamp zone No. 2 well before year-end.","That -- those operations plus the operations of Blackbeard West and Blackbeard East, we are -- as I said, were regulatory commitment from the standpoint and we are going to learn out of these things hope to establish the production there but all eyes on Highlander at this point, Tony.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","And what\u2019s the timing of that, Jim, Highlander, what should we be looking forward over there?","Jim Flores","Highlander, my engineers are saying September, so I am telling you October, how is that.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen. Thanks everybody.","Jim Flores","Thanks.","Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company","Kathleen too thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ralph Profiti - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Most of them have been asked. If I can ask just one more relating to PT-FI in the state of the operation for when it\u2019s ready to go back to 100% because for the better part of eight months, Richard, the workforce has been largely kept in place. I was wondering would it be safe to say that you have say eight months of advance stripping and equipment maintenance in place. And to what degree could we see this as a positive impact in 2015 when you think about things like production strip ratio and mining costs, if everything goes to plan?","Richard Adkerson","You made a good point Ralph. We have been -- kept our workforce productive during this time and we have been able to mine some waste and low-grade materials that we would have had to mine in the future. We\u2019ve done a lot of maintenance work. We\u2019ve kept the DOZ mine operating in a way so that we\u2019ve kept the caving operation going in the effective way. And so we\u2019ve really had a period of time despite this lower sales of having safe productive operations from our workforce and that will benefit us going forward.","As I said we also have a substantial amount of concentrated inventory, that we don\u2019t have to work into the market place. Concentrated market is pretty well supplied already. It will take some time to do that. But we will be able to have very positive operations beginning immediately upon our authorization to export.","Ralph Profiti - Credit Suisse","And by this renewed guidance, would it be safe to say that timing to get back to that would be a matter of weeks?","Kathleen Quirk","Yes, Ralph, this is Kathleen. We\u2019re projecting in the guidance that you\u2019ve seen that we will start up operations in August. There will be a period of ramp up for the mill and a period of time to get ship scheduled to come in. But as Richard said we should get up to the capacity pretty quickly.","Richard Adkerson","As an example of that Ralph, our second quarter unit operating costs for PT Freeport Indonesia was $2.66 per pound, $1.53 in the first quarter. And if we return to normal operations, for the year, it will be down to $0.96 per pound. So that just shows you how we can recover from this.","Ralph Profiti - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just want to get back to, after you purchased the oil and gas assets from DXP and McMoRan. There was this notion of sales sustaining assets, meaning cash flow was from -- the oil and gas operations will be basically sustaining the development CapEx for oil and gas operations. We didn\u2019t tend to sell assets in oil and gas. Should we think about differently about that i.e. mining operations providing the free cash flow to -- for the development of oil and gas?","Jim Flores","I\u2019ll take this question because when you sell the Eagle Ford cash flow that was about $600 million a year of free cash flow of business declining. But it was there and you said that some additional asset size we\u2019re talking about basically we\u2019re going to observe the short, the CapEx, the efficiency of variance between the cash flow and the CapEx level through the asset sales. So we really -- we're going to -- the amount of asset sales that we\u2019re going to sell or bridge negative cash flow in \u201814 and \u201815 on into a flat to positive year at \u201816 and then \u201816 oil will be self sustaining. So within the oil and gas, including the asset sales, we\u2019ll observe any negative cash flow.","Richard Adkerson","We\u2019re consistent with that approach Oscar. Nothing has changed, it\u2019s just the CapEx where we\u2019ve funded from cash flow and asset sales of oil and gas assets.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America","On that too -- but with the additional sales as you mentioned between $4 billion and $5 billion, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s probably on the -- if its onshore California and that\u2019s where the vast majority of the free cash flow is coming. Would that still be the case?","Richard Adkerson","Yes.","Jim Flores","That will be the case. Remember this, those type of assets have zero tax basis. So the IDCs during the spending of \u201814 and \u201815 really helps for the tax basis offset and any kind of property acquisitions, smaller property as in iconic changes. There is a tax on product there that it benefits to have the negative cash flow on that year to offset the tax burden just by selling those properties.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then if I may on Indonesia, this statement in the press release that talks about the MoU and Freeport paying over reduced export duties, that would decline the smelter development progress. Can you give us an idea of what level of reduced export duties you are looking at because 2016 your mine plant for Grasberg, we still have significant increases in both copper production and gold production that would be impacted by an export tax.","Richard Adkerson","Yes, the process for completing the MoU will include the Ministry of Finance adopting new reduced export duties that will be declining rather than the current regulations which provides for escalating export duties. Currently, the export duty starts at 25% going to 60%. We expect and you know, it hasn\u2019t been adopted yet but we\u2019d expect the export duties to be initially below 10% and then they would decline based on progress with the smelter. Progress with the smelter would involve getting agreement on the long-term lives to operate. Our goal would be to work to get to zero export duty by 2016.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I may, I\u2019ll be quick with this one. Can you just remind me of your agreement with Rio Tinto with the divestment of 30% in Grasberg? How would that impact the 40% in case in production from the asset?","Richard Adkerson","Well we\u2019re talking about the divestment of shares in PT-FI. And that\u2019s what -- that's all we\u2019re talking about here. PT-FI would continue to own 60% in the joint venture with Rio Tinto.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America","And in terms of production does that affect the share production, Richard?","Richard Adkerson","No, it\u2019s PT-FIs what we\u2019re talking about.","Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America","Thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joan Lappin with Gramercy Capital.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","Good morning everybody. Jim, would you talk about, I assume, it\u2019s your domain about the Gulf Coast Royalty Trust because even that was an important part of the complete transaction a year ago. And when -- what of the properties that remain viable, are going to come online and when that will influence that and also I would appreciate it, I guess, it\u2019s a variation on the previous questioner.","On Slide 27, where you show your -- well 26 and 27 sort of fit together and you\u2019re showing your important areas going forward. I assume the big green, the biggest green dot shows the most oil in these new -- in the new areas that you have just expanded your position in and whatever and then my last part related to that as you\u2019ve shown us these different rigs that you will be using. Can you tell us how the cost of those relate to the drillship or whatever compared to the very expensive rigs that we were using in the shallow water ultra-deep gas project?","Jim Flores","Okay, Joan, good morning. The Gulf Coast Royalty Trust, I\u2019m going to point you toward Kathleen Quirk and also you promised me a trip to Houston to go over all this in person and you haven\u2019t shown us yet. So I\u2019ll take this as our meeting there. And the aspect of the Royalty Trust is not really driving the aspects at Freeport. I mean, Freeport was being commercial.","Decisions based on good engineering data in July, that\u2019s in the plan. The inboard lower tertiary that has grown beyond the Gulf Coast Royalty Trust footprint. But the most significant potential production asset we have today the Highlander project is in the Gulf Coast Royalty Trust.","I would focus a 100% on that and if we come up with some significant production in Blackbeard West, Blackbeard East or Davy Jones 2 in the meantime then that\u2019s a bonus. What was depicted on Page 26 is -- and 27 is our producing assets, our major operating producing assets. And I emphasize producing because we have not produced any gas or oil out of the lower Tertiary\/Cretaceous play. It\u2019s a frontier exploration play.","On top of that, to your rig question and so forth, the different operations onshore versus deepwater, they don\u2019t really relate as -- the jack-up market is pretty much right now but we continue to work with our partner willing to provide the premium equipment and it\u2019s worked out -- worked out fine. These are lot of integral operations. You got to have the top wide equipments. So as far as the rig costs are about flat where they were.","Jim Bob Moffett","Jim, as far as the royalty trust, rig was discovery in the (indiscernible) area and that prospects that were reflected by (indiscernible) and because of the mainland prospect which is a parallel structures just in the East.","So I guess those have tremendous potential in the (indiscernible). So those various bottom shales represent several structures, 25,000 maybe and you have Highlander which was -- we are focusing on that which led to the cretaceous discovery and you have the (indiscernible) area mostly in addition to the (indiscernible).","Jim Flores","Thank you, Bob. And Chevron operates Lineham Creek, that\u2019s why I have omitted it, because I was focused on our operations and the Lineham Creek completion is scheduled for midyear \u201915. And once again Joan I issue that invitation for you to come down to Houston and get up to speed on all the specifics. Thanks.","Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital","I accept.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Good morning and thank you for taking my question and for the presentation. I am a shareholder, and I am very happy, and I am impressed at the good moves that the company has made to pick up the Apache assets, the 20 new leases in the Gulf of Mexico, the reservoir joint venture in Europe, the (indiscernible) joint venture just announced, and other new opportunities that you may consider. I am concerned that some other people might be worried the company is obstructed by debt or distracted by Indonesia. And I'm very pleased at the progress you're making in new endeavors, in spite of all of the distractions. Please explain in a little more detail how you're slowing down the less productive activities, and reallocating -- things change dynamically, you get a good drilling result at one property, you have a roadblock at another. Tell us a little more how you are being disciplined with the weaker projects to make more room for more of the good new opportunities, please?","Jim Flores","Well, John, we have a great team. Rich here and just last week, we met with 50 or so of his managers in the Americas and reviewed every one of our projects there. Those guys are interested in what\u2019s going on in Indonesia, but they are not involved. They are playing different positions, and everyone is focused. We had our African team there too. Everyone\u2019s focused on their own business, and we sit down. We went through every one of our minds as to the operations they had done so far this year. What we are looking forward going forward? What were our growth opportunities? We have a separate group, that\u2019s working on going through our mining reserves and resources in assessing how we focused on the next stage of operations. That was a same process that we went through that came up with the Tenke expansion, the Morenci expansion and the Cerro Verde expansion. Jim and his team are very interested in what\u2019s going on in Indonesia, but they are really focused on running their assets well and looking for growth opportunities and divestiture opportunities, divestment opportunities and so forth.","Jim Bob works closely with [Rick Lodale] (ph) our exploration, both our Brownfield and Greenfield exploration. So ultimately we step back from that and say where is our business judgment for the greatest opportunity to put the development resources on? And they bring in our development team to focus on that. Dave Thornton and his team has been running our molybdenum business very well. Of course we did the expansion at Climax. We monitored that market, managed production to meet the demands of the marketplace. So while as investors of course you\u2019re going to focus on the things that are currently most important from a corporate standpoint. Underneath that we\u2019ve got out great team, that\u2019s working on the rest of the business. And what I like about our company as opposed to when I look at the way larger companies they are running mining business and then the oil and gas business is, because we\u2019ve got such a great team, it frees. When we do have a problem like we have in Indonesia or Africa, we can put senior management to work and working with our guys on that team and the rest of our business does just fine. So we\u2019ve come a long way, you\u2019ve been watching us for a long time and where we started to, where we have ended up now, and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the people we have and where our team works together to prioritize and deal with the broad scope of our business.","Jim Bob Moffett","John, this is Jim Bob. Just a quick comparison. If we go back 10 years, this export problem related to the Grasberg mine, how would you like to have been dealing with the issues that we\u2019ve dealt with in the last five year? The strike and the accident and the export ban, if we have been three, four like copper and gold with single is the best asset in the world. So when you look at the press release today that we\u2019ve got all these in our Greenfield prospect for instance in the Congo. I just reviewed that recently (indiscernible) kilometers of ore at the surface that we are going to tie them together and using projections and drilling some deeper. We have a chance to have again another world class ore body. When you think about the (indiscernible) used our deeper sulfide ore exploration drilling that reserves, we found the equivalent amount of copper and gold equals another Grasberg just by drilling the Brownfield projects. So we are blessed with not only some of the biggest world class mines in the world, but we are blessed with the prospects that are becoming world class mines because of our brownfield exploration effort.","Jim Flores","Thanks, John.","John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Hi, everyone. So I have a follow-up question on your potential sale of stake at Grasberg. In case of a direct sale to the government, is it possible that you may have to provide financing for the sale of that stake?","Jim Flores","Not for a direct sale to the government. What I am talking there is the central government and that\u2019s the way their regulations work. We have in the past -- we\u2019ve actually undertaken efforts to have a stake in the shares of PTFI owned by the province of Papua. We believe that could potentially be positive and we would consider providing some financing for that piece of the transaction. We tried to accomplish this several years ago and just wasn\u2019t able to get there. We would be really focused on making sure that any sale like that would be for the benefit of the province and the people of the province and not some third party investor, but that would be something that we would be considering as we go forward.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Got it. So I guess if there's financing, it would be only for that chunk, 8% or 9%. And currently you're looking at only either IPO or sale to the central government?","Jim Flores","Well, the 8% or 9%, the percentage that we would be talking about is not defined yet. 8% or 9% is a very large amount of money for an asset of this size, so that\u2019s uncertain as to where the -- any percentage that would come about and the process would be the central government under the way Indonesia works would have the first call. They had a call -- they had an opportunity to buy this interest that we reacquired from an Indonesia organization in the 2001 timeframe, and the government opted not to do it.","Then we have the potential to do with some of the province, then beyond that, and the listing the IPO in the Jakarta exchange. And beyond that then there would be an opportunity for potentially other Indonesian nationals to invest. So it\u2019s a process that\u2019s yet to be worked out, it could be a combination of all of these. The important thing is that our shareholders would get fair value out of it and it would take time to execute all of these.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. Just to be clear on the MOU, the day you sign it, imminently, whatever that means, the 115 goes into effect, the higher royalties go into effect, but then do the -- whatever the reduced export taxes on the concentrates go into effect, so if they were to be 10% going down to a lower number by 2016, that you will actually have certainty the day you start exporting on what those taxes are going to be, or is that something that still has to be negotiated in that six months comment you made about the MOU? ","Richard Adkerson","No, Brain, that would be defined and known and in effect upon signing of the MOU.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Okay. So when you re-export, that will all be laid out, so you have a clear runway for what you're paying?","Richard Adkerson","As soon as we sign the MOU, we would advice the market of what its terms are and what would be effective immediately and so we will do that.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Okay. Then my second question is, sort of putting this all together, and you've been very good over the years about giving forecasts of EBITDA and cash flow at various prices every quarter. With all the moving parts now, you give guidance for \u201915, \u201816. We assume the resumption of exports in August from Grasberg, but in that, as Ralph brought up, you probably have better costs in 2015 than we used to, just because you pre-strip. You obviously have a tax now on the smelter, going forward. We've obviously sold Eagle Ford and adjusted that. Can I assume the stuff on page 21 now, given all those pluses and minuses, because it looks like it has changed a little bit, include all of those assumptions? Or is it pre- the MOU, if I want to think of that way, because there's a lot of moving parts here?","Richard Adkerson","It does not include the impact of the MOU. Yet, it does conclude the Eagle Ford and the acquisition of the Apache interest and so forth. But it does not include the MOU since that has not yet been -- it said has not been signed.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","And would it have the benefit, fair to go back to Ralph's point, because I think it's a good one that you would have some better cost structure in \u201815 and \u201816 than you did before, all else being equal, because you have done that all extra maintenance and pre-strip?","Richard Adkerson","Well, this does reflect our current mine plan. Now we review that continually. And as you know Brian, over the years we\u2019re always looking for ways of incrementally improving it. And the guys will be looking at the ways of accessing higher grade material and with the pre-stripping the opportunities for that are much better than they have in the past. We\u2019re talking with our guys for example about having access to some very high gold grades in the pit that we might be able to access earlier than later.","Kathleen Quirk","But Brain, the projections that are in the cash flow model are consistent with the mine plan for PTFI in the back on page 29.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Right. And just on that, I noticed gold's up again in \u201917, I assume that's just flow back from the delay and everything this year, and it looks like maybe that can come back forward, things like that is what you're talking about? ","Kathleen Quirk","Right.","Richard Adkerson","That\u2019s right.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Richard Adkerson ","We\u2019ll have the chance for optimization and we\u2019ll keep you informed as we proceed with that. For everyone, we had a -- wait, we do have a couple of more. I\u2019m sorry. David is pointing out. Appreciate it. So operator, do you want to -- I think, see who else is on our list.","Operator","Yes. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.","Brian Yu - Citi","Great. Thanks for your endurance with this long call, Rich and team. On the duties where you said it starts less than 10 and it goes down to zero, does this apply to both the copper and gold, or just copper? And is there a portion of it that gets credited towards the smelter build?","Richard Adkerson","It is own copper concentrates. So that would include the copper and gold. I mean, we don\u2019t sell copper and gold separately. We sell copper concentrate, which has gold and silver in it and we get paid for that concentrate based on the prices of copper, gold and silver metals, but we don't actually sell those metal separately. That\u2019s sold to the smelting company and -- but we get paid for it.","So it is going to be only own exports and on concentrates, which will include all the metals in the concentrate. No, there is no credit on the smelters, that\u2019s a separate deal. But the way this thing works from a cost standpoint, is we only pay the export duty prior to the smelter, coming onstream. Once the smelter is build then we can reach agreement on building and so forth, the export duty goes away.","Brian Yu - Citi","Okay. And when it goes to 0%, or planned to go to 0% in 2016, that would coincide with the start up of the smelter effectively?","Richard Adkerson","No, not with the start-up of the smelter. These smelters are substantial industrial facilities and it takes time to build it. The scale down in the duty as contemplated by the MoU will be made on the basis of progress toward building this smelter. Progress is currently contemplated to be measured on the basis of cost expended and committed and the objective would be to say once you reach a point of no return, once you spin enough so that the government is satisfied that you\u2019re going to complete it then the duties goes away.","Their view, the governments view and they\u2019ve been vocal about this was that the duty was not designed to raise money for the government but is to provide an incentive for the companies to build the smelter.","Brian Yu - Citi","Okay. And what percentage in spend committed would 0% export duty tied to, is that like 50%, 75%?","Richard Adkerson","I think its best given the current stage of what we are. It is not that are very hot. Its not the majority of the cost is what we\u2019re talking about. Its something less than that. But given that this thing is -- has not been singed yet. Although, we believe the terms to discuss with the government wants that are going to be adopted but it still has to be signed. I think, Brian, its best at this point, not to get that specific with what the terms are.","Brian Yu - Citi","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Mitesh Thakkar with FBR Capital Market. Please go ahead.","Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market","Good morning, gentlemen and thank you for squeezing me in. Just on the oil and gas side? I understand, when in May you guys announced the acquisition of additional interest in Lucius. Your working interest was supposed to go up to 35%, but it looks like now it is at 25%. Can you explain on a little bit, give us some incremental color around that?","Jim Flores","Yeah. In the oil and gas transaction, the existing holders of the Lucius interest, additional partners have a preference for right of purchase to any sale that goes on within Lucius. And so we contracted to buy the Apache 10% interest.","Two parties, the original partners exercise their pref rights, which cause us to exercise our pref right. So we got a reduced interest where Exxon and Impact, Japanese company, both liked the price we were paying for Lucius and exercise their right to get their percentage and it reduced our interest to the 5.1% versus the 10%, so that\u2019s the reduction. And therefore instead of it being a $1.4 billion acquisition, it was $900 million.","Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market","Okay. Great. And just on Indonesia, the 2015 copper and gold guidance came down a hair and I was just wondering, if you are doing all the pre-stripping today, shouldn't it actually go up instead of going down or is the benefit just on the cost side?","Kathleen Quirk","No. There was some minor changes we made to the start-up of the Deep MLZ in 2015, which affected the volumes in a modest way. The open pit really didn't change significantly from what we had previously. But we will project in a couple of months delay from what we had before for the Deep MLZ and that\u2019s the impact you\u2019re seeing.","Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market","And that impact has nothing to do with the negotiations going on right now in the quarter?","Kathleen Quirk","Correct.","Richard Adkerson ","No. During this whole period we\u2019ve been proceeding with the development of our underground resources, including the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave. And so this is just an issue related to the completion of the Deep MLZ mine and it slipped roughly a quarter.","Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market","Okay. Great. Thank you very much guys and thank you for being kind with the time.","Richard Adkerson ","Okay. Well, appreciated everybody\u2019s attention and being kind with your time. We had a lot to talk about and we will have a lot to talk about as we go forward. And we look forward to that if you have any follow-up questions, please direct them to David and we\u2019ll get them answered.

(Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to over to Miss Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead ma'am.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com.","Our conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments, we would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today are, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board, Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and we have members of \u2013 senior team members in the room with us today.","I will start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be using the slide presentation to review our performance and outlook. After our comments, we will open up the call for questions.","Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $510 million, or $0.49 per share for the first quarter of 2014, which compared with $648 million or $0.68 per share for first quarter of 2013. Our first quarter results were negatively impacted by lower sales from Indonesia, attributable to the regulatory ban on concentrates imposed in mid-January and to lower copper prices.","We benefited from strong operating performance from the oil and gas business, and from our Americas and Africa mining operations, which partly offset the unfavorable impacts. The consolidated first quarter copper sales of 0.8 billion pounds were about 9% below last year's first quarter, primarily as the result of the deferral of exports from Indonesia, which reduced or deferred our copper and gold sales by approximately 125 million pounds of copper and 140 ounces of gold. We are engaged in discussions with the Indonesian government to work to resume exports as soon as possible.","Our first quarter sales of oil and natural gas totaled 16.1 million barrels of oil equivalence, which was above our recent forecast. The first quarter average recorded copper price of $3.14 per pound was below last years first quarter $3.51, and gold prices at $1300 per ounce were 19% below the year ago quarter. Oil prices remained strong during the quarter, with Brent prices averaging $108 per barrel. The average realization by our oil and gas division was $99 per barrel before the impacts of derivative contracts.","During the quarter, we generated operating cash flows of $1.2 billion, that was net of about $400 million, in working capital uses, and our capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $1.6 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.9 billion, and our consolidated cash position was $1.4 billion.","I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the presentation materials.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Thanks Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Looking at Page 3 you can see the cover of our new annual report, which we're just now beginning to distribute. It's got a band of a depiction of our resources like a rising sun coming over the earth, which I think is a good way of thinking about our company. We have this great long line of geographical diverse set of assets.","At today's commodity, prices you'll see that across our set of assets we have really strong margins, in both our mining and oil and gas business, and that generates good cash flows. We have, of course, exposure to what we believe will be improving markets for commodities over time.","And in addition to that we have the opportunity to grow volumes through our production profile. We've got good strong exploration leverage, both in the mining business through our Brownfield expansions and in the oil and gas business where we have Brownfield type growth opportunities from exploration, as well as Greenfield in the deepwater and in our gas exploration play.","We'll be talking about that. Our company is financially strong, and we've got a great team to do things in the right way. We're experienced, and we manage our environmental responsibilities and our community responsibilities in the right way. All through 2013 and going into 2014, our code word for our company has been execution.","And we have assets that we can benefit from if we execute our plans well, and we have another quarter where we've done that. We had solid performance in our mining operations in the Americas and Africa. We're going to talk about the restrictions that we have currently on our sales from PT Freeport Indonesia, because of these government export regulations. But we benefited from a very meaningful contribution from the oil and gas business.","This is our third full quarter of operations after closing the transaction in June of last year, and the oil and gas business had strong operating and financial performance during the quarter. We also will report that we've advanced our growth projects. The Morenci expansion expected commissioning startups in this current quarter. The Cerro Verde expansion is construction as well in progress towards the 2016 startup.","The Lucius development Deepwater Gulf of Mexico project has its first oil expected to be produced in the second half of this year and then we have very positive results from the exploratory results at our Highlander prospect in offshore in South Louisiana that Jim would be talking about.","Financially, our financial results were affected of course by the we're going to call deferral of volumes as a result of this Indonesian this pending resolution of the Indonesian export situation. That reduced our volumes in the first quarter by about 525 million pounds of copper and 140,000 ounces of gold.","So other than that, if you look at our actual volumes for the quarter, we were on target with the guidance that we gave you at our last quarterly outlook. So, we\u2019ve had a situation where we\u2019re affected by that we're going to talk about it, but other than, operation performance in terms of volumes produced and cost structure was really attractive. ","The situation that we have now in Indonesia is because of the government regulations that were adopted on January 12. We have had no export shipments from PT Freeport Indonesia. We are able to ship concentrate to the smelter in Indonesia that our company arranged to be constructed back in the 1990. It's operated by a company called PT Smelting, which we have a 25% equity interest in PT Smelting, the operator of the smelter is Mitsubishi.","So we have adjusted our production of concentrate to align the volumes of concentrate that we're producing with the requirements that can be processed at PT Smelting. That results in our mill operating at roughly half capacity, and of course the inability to sell concentrates at full capacity does have negative financial impacts, not only to our company, but to the government of Indonesia through reduced taxes, royalties, and ultimately dividends from that.","What we're doing operationally is we are putting priority on the operation of our DOZ underground mine the block caving operations, since that operation needs to continue to operate to preserve the caving activities that are part of it. We're mining lower grade material, and focusing on stripping in the Grasberg open pit. We're also doing maintenance activities so that we will be prepared to return to full operations when the government regulatory situation is resolved.","To-date, we have not made significant cuts in employment. We have not had significant deferrals of our ongoing major capital projects, which are important as we look at a transition from the open pit mine at Grasberg to mining underground at the Grasberg Block Cave beneath the pit, which we're looking at roughly at the end of 2016, 2017.","So essentially where we have today and you see reflected in our financial results also reflected in the benefits that government gets is maintaining basically 100% of our cost structure, but having sales at 50% or lower than the issue. We working with the government to achieve a resolution for this, the government \u2013 ministries are focused and are appear to be making progress towards reaching a resolution of it.","Indonesia had last week a major election of its National Parliament and also local bodies. It was a massive undertaking, and election situation took focus away from many people in government from resolving our issue, it\u2019s also created a political context, in which resolution of some of issues is complicated, but that election is behind us. There's a presidential election in early July.","We know that the government is focused on getting a resolution, and we're working to encourage them. One of the complications is that we're viewing this issue in the context of our contract of work. Our contract of work was signed in 1991. It defines our financial obligations and our operating rights there. Many in government are focusing on the 2009 mining law, which represented a change going forward in Indonesia from a contract of work environment to more of an operating license situation.","The government is looking to move cal holders more to the mining law requirements, and that\u2019s part of the complications we're having in how to deal with this issue. We have reached out to the government to try to be responsive to some of their aspirations. We have indicated a willingness to develop additional smelter capacity in Indonesia in the form of where their government would provide us certain financial incentives, because the economics of building a new smelter are really unattractive within global smelter economics.","We're talking potential partners, including Antam, the state owned mining company there, in terms of working with us on this project. When you see our outlook numbers Kathleen referred to, that's based on a resumption of beginning operations in May, and we're optimistic about doing that. But that is dependent on the government moving forward to change its regulations. Because currently under the regulations, we don't have the authority to export.","So we need to have this authority granted, and then we'll deal with the regulations that are adopted in giving us that authority. If we are delayed any further, the deferral would result at a rate of about 50 million pounds of copper a month and 80,000 ounces of gold. Our numbers reflect beginning to operate in May that we're going sharing with you, and that we shared with you in this release.","While we don't think this will continue for a long period of time, in the event that it does, we could operate as we are now physically. But economically, a continuation of this over a long period of time would require us to take actions to reduce costs. That means layoffs, and deferred capital expenditures. That's not really good for anyone.","And particularly, we have a particular concern about the impact of that on our workforce of having layoffs, and on our long-term ability to realize the benefits of this ore body, both for our Company and both \u2013 and the government of Indonesia and the local community. So there would be nothing good from laying off people or deferring projects, and that's why we've deferred doing this \u2013 to this point. But we would be required to do that if this goes for a long period of time.","Page 7, just reference how positive our work with the government of Indonesia at PT Freeport Indonesia has been over the last 40 years. We\u2019ve since our contract was signed in 1991, we've contributed $60 billion to the national GDP. We\u2019re 90% of the economy and the region where we operate, over 40% of the province's economy and a significant contributor to the national GNP. We have a workforce that includes employees and full-time contractors of 30,000 people.","We're one of the largest taxpayers in Indonesia. As I mentioned, we were the developer of Indonesia's only copper smelter there. It produces more copper than Indonesia as a country consumes, and we've invested to date over $10 billion. As we move underground, we have a business plan that provides for additional investments of over $15 billion. We contribute significantly to the local community, including a voluntary contribution of 1% of our revenues that has provided over $600 million since that fund was started in 1996.","That's an enormous social program for a relatively small population group, and we remain committed to being a positive partner with the government and with all stakeholders in Indonesia. Over the last five years, we've paid over $7 billion of direct benefits, and that is more than has been paid to Freeport-McMoRan as the major shareholder of this operation.","Turning to copper markets, we saw in March a downturn in the market in the copper price. It's rebounded some since then. And there was a lot of concern when the downturn occurred about growth in China, about the existence \u2013 significant amount of copper in off exchange bonded warehouses in China, and whether that might come to the marketplace in a context of relatively low global growth.","What we see though in terms of the business we're doing there now, and with what the market seems to be, is a situation of not where the copper market is being flooded by a large amount of new supplies. We're not seeing a situation of where fundamental demand has dropped off any clip. The market reaction is more dealing with issues that the margin place.","The fundamental demand in China remains healthy. It's supported by consumer and infrastructure investment. And the Chinese government has talked about incentives, relatively modest but important ones, in areas where copper is consumed. The lower price is reduced the availability of scrap, and that creates more demand for copper cathodes.","Market reports that some of the bonded warehouse stocks are now being purchased by China as strategic reserve. There's difference views of how much that, is but it's an indication and I think of volumes in bonded warehouses are not going to be dumped onto the market in any place. ","Demand in the U.S,, where we provide over 40% of the copper wire, is improving. Our downstream customers are doing well, consumer confidence is growing. Automobile and construction continues to be positive. We have a smelter in Europe, and we're seeing an uptick in Europe from its low base, but globally, copper cathode markets are tight. Exchange and consumer stocks are at historically low levels. Scrap availability is tight, and premiums for copper cathode are strengthening globally.","And if we look into the future, we continue to be encouraged by the basic fundamentals of a commodity which its use is inherently positive in terms of in developing countries, as well as uses in the economy in general, and where development of supplies and maintaining production of the existing mines is challenged.","Page 9, looks at our cost structure, and this when we look and generally view at one the gas operations, you'll see what strong margins we have there, but this margin story applies to our copper business as well. First quarter, our consolidated unit cost net of byproduct credits was just over $1.50 a pound that gives us a good margin at $3 copper and of course we are positive about copper prices moving forward. You can see how that breaks down by areas.","And outside of the situation in Indonesia, you can see our cost performance has been strong. Red's team in the Americas is doing a great job. Our African project is doing well. And you can see that in our distribution of our copper sales between North America, South America, and Indonesia and Africa gives us a good diversity in our copper business, and that's aided by our investments in the oil and gas business.","Our Brownfield development projects are proceeding well. Cerro Verde is the big product. It's $4.6 billion current estimate. We started construction a little over a year ago, and we're on target to complete it in 2013 to add $600 million pounds of copper per year. We've incurred just under $2 billion to date. This will be the world's largest single site concentrating milling facility, and can see groundwork being completed, physical destruction started, this is a site where construction can be undertaken on a relatively low risk basis because it's at an existing site where we were already operating.","Morenci is really exciting; this $1.16 billion project is being completed. Commissioning startup is expected to occur this quarter at 225 million pounds of copper $1.3 billion we've incur to-date. What is so really great about Morenci is this is a mine that people thought 10 years ago was dead, and now we've got this expansion project. We're making a lot of money there with what we already have. And we have a place where our exploration team is working hand-in-hand with our development group to give us the next stage which could be a very large scale expansion there and making Morenci one of the largest most profitable mines in the world.","So it's a real excitement for this to happen here at the flagship mine in North America for the industry, and our team is very enthusiastic about it. And when you look at our copper potential around the world with what is going on with Morenci, what we have Grasberg, what we're doing with Cerro Verde, and the opportunity at El Abra in Chile, to have potential for a massive concentrator development project there. And with Tenke, which is this massive mineralization area, we have the chance to have in our portfolio five of the very largest mines in the world. And that's what we're working towards.","I'll and talk about the outlook, but, Jim, turn it over to you and let\u2019s talk about our oil and gas business. And congratulations on such a great quarter for you and your team.","James C. Flores","Great, Richard. Thank you. Welcome everybody to the call. This morning I want to start with Page 12, and go through the Brent LSS crude oil pricing relationship and kind of how it affects our business or how well-positioned our business really is. And you see the curve there with the green and orange on our slide 12, you can see that it's very consistent through the 10 years. Except for right at the end, where you saw \u2013 we saw a little pressure on the LLS side and the merger from the Brent.","We believe that's a one-time type event with the opening of the southern leg at Keystone. We saw the tremendous crude oil inventories, the exiting cushing and going down to the Gulf Coast, namely Saint James refiners obviously took advantage of that and doubled down by having a significant amount of turnarounds, and therefore you had some downward pressure there on margins that affected a lot of margins of all upstream businesses.","I refer you to the black box down below, where you can see what FM O&Gs realizations per barrel before hedges are, and you can seen in June $97 a barrel, obviously we had a fabulous quarter in the third quarter of 2013 $106, $94, $100, these are basically reflecting that same curve volatility, as well as its basis differentials, but in the first quarter of 2014, to a have a $99 differential when you have that type of rollout in basis, just shows you the resilience and positioning of our assets, also the quality of the oil that we're producing. When we talk about HLS, LLS, and Brent, we produce a significant amount of HLS crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico heavy Louisiana sweet, which basically trades at a premium to LLS.","Therefore, when you see basis differential created here like on Page 12 between Brent and LLS, we are actually in excellent position to continue to sell our oil at the highest prices, and therefore reflects that $99 a barrel differential. One more thing operationally there, is we're continuing to produce more crude oil versus natural gas or liquids or condensate.","And with that crude oil margin so strong in the upper 80s, then we are able to obviously continue to expand that margin, instead of contracting it to offset these market conditions. The market has since rebounded, LLS and Brent is now trading closer to in parity, and we're taking advantage of that obviously with ongoing operations.","Page 13, with our oil and gas assets gives you a snapshot of our four major producing areas. California, the study producer, has continued to generate very strong returns for our invested capital, and supports underlying consistency of our $900 million of operating cash margin we had in the first quarter of about $59 a barrel margin, almost $60.","Eagle Ford, we've continued to add out performance there beyond our initial curves on our tight curves for reserves and production. But an excellent job of managing our completion inventory, and continued to outperform in the Eagle Ford, and do a very good job of extracting the resources there.","Our Haynesville is a significant gas resource. We continue to keep that incubated as we develop our inboard Tertiary\/Cretaceous gas play. We got from your balancing act between that reservoir and the large flows we'll have coming out of our South Louisiana asset base. But the Haynesville continues to be a significant gas reserve, and when gas prices move up 90% - our margin move up 90% due to a 25%, 30% increase in gas prices certainly feels a lot better to be in the Haynesville than in years passed.","Then on to the beast, the Gulf of Mexico deepwater we're continuing to outpace our production goals there. We have superior production management and reservoir management. We have offset any projected natural declines with those activities, and have actually drilled our first well in deepwater after our acquisition of the Gulf of Mexico assets back in the fall of 2013.","It feels like a decade ago, doesn't it, Richard? And so the first well, the A-60 well off our Holstein platform, we have now 60 feet of gorgeous 30% porosity boxcar pay that we're going to be bringing on here in the next month. And we'll be talking about that as we flow. But it's always good when you've got a long-term campaign to try to bring on 8 to 10 of these type projects a year, about 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil a day for the next six years in our development plan just on those assets each year. That it's always great to get off on a good start.","It's like a good drive in the first round of Augusta, it feels good getting off the number one tee box. So all is good on the operating side, and the strong cast margin that Richard was talking about as well intact and we're looking forward to good from the operating standpoint.","The cash margin is detailed here on Page 14. You've got California Eagle Ford, the gas assets, and Haynesville\/Madden\/Other, our GOM and the consolidated where you get you to the $58.71. You can see the strong emphasis on the Gulf of Mexico, and the Eagle Ford with our strong LLS pricing there is where our top performers there, and as well as I mentioned the large increase that we had on a margin basis in Haynesville due to gas prices, and then California has continued to be to be steady around $55 a barrel.","Moving on to Page 15, we were very successful in the 2014 central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. We outlaid $330 million of total high bids. We're waiting for those bids to be awarded, and it's to cover 20 blocks, and over 106,000 gross acres. Our net unrisk resource potential of 1.1 billion barrels associated with these new acreages, it's very important and added to our inventory. But it's the continued execution of the strategy we had. As we acquired these assets, we wanted to core up all the tie back opportunities to our facilities and give us our infrastructure leverage.","Remember in 2013, we were very active around the Holstein area in Green Canyon. Buying leases, like we bought $6 million in 2013, the majority of these leases in 2014 were around the Mississippi Canyon, the [indiscernible] area around our Marlin, Horn Mountain and Ram Powell facility.","This puts us in position to have those type of development activities I talked about by bringing that production forward through 2020 and helping drive our total production volumes in 2020, up to about 110 million barrels a year, versus where we are today at about 64 million. So, this business is intact, we have the real state. And like Richard talked about, it's execute, execute, execute, and we're very excited about having this opportunity.","Just to refresh everybody, on Page 16 are those three large facilities that were producing about 65,000 barrels a day total right now, which is consistent where we've been. And that's why I was talking about the production management of offsetting any projected declines, and get we have about 250,000 barrels a day or we have 75% of unutilized capacity going forward. So to be in a unique position to have the resources under our control, under our budget, and have the infrastructure in place where we can actually execute this plan in the Gulf of Mexico without the capital outlays for facilities and things of that nature is very unique. And we're finally positioned to do that, assuming all the leases get awarded to us here this summer.","Looking forward, on the near-term production growth side our Lucius Deepwater development is on time, on schedule. Our operator, Anadarko, is doing a fantastic job there. And there's always a few bumps and bruises, they make it look easy, and we really appreciate that but we're on schedule here and hopefully third quarter now as we're bringing in the world class reservoir on and deliverabilty will be impactful to our company going forward very soon.","So, on the oil and gas front and the deepwater everything's moving forward. We have a lot of drilling activity coming up in the next 18 months so spirits are very high. One of the other areas that's really help and focus our capital budget and causing us to think about a long-term exciting area is our inboard lower tertiary Cretaceous activity, and it all queues on to our Highlander discovery. It's going to be easy to talk about Highlander the rest the rest of this decade and so forth, and offsets and \u2013 remember, it all started with Blackbeard and Davey Jones.","Blackbeard proved that we could drill the wells, and there were sands below the salt wells. Davey Jones was one of the deepest wells in this area that not only drilled the Myascene and Oligocene, the lower tertiary, but it also drilled it our first Crestaceous well South of the Port Hudson Tuscaloosa trend that's on map 18, and north of the BP Tiber well which is about 250 miles offshore.","So that two wells stratographically set up the drilling toward Highlander as we move closer to the better sands to the north, and develop not only a huge structure, but also had the reservoir characteristics that we feel is very correlative to excellent production and with our deliverability capabilities in the Gulf Coast basin and that's our Highlander discovery.","So we\u2019re in the process of completing Davey Jones number two in the Crestaceous. It's in a different sand facies, carbonate facies that Highlander has. However, we want to continue learn from the Davey Jones well, and we should have that well tested here in the second quarter. We're probably a month away. Then we've got to move on to Highlander development. We have that well moving quickly toward completion in third quarter and we hope to have the Blackbeard West completion sometime in early fourth quarter.","The Blackbeard West completion is key because of the laminated sands are going to tell us a lot about our Lafitte discovery that we made two years ago. And that we're purchased the leases due to expirations. And also, we've drawn a lot of correlations to a recent well we've drilled with Shell at Ran Pau, our A-11 well in the L Sand which is a highly laminated sand that made over 220 million barrels at Ran Pau. So the Blackbeard West completion is very important to understanding what the aspects of that are.","And moving to the west after drilling a study well in Lineham creek, we moved the rig. We're getting ready to Farthest Gate West prospect up there in Cameron Parish and we are looking forward to the drilling results of that here in about nine months to 10 months. All-in-all, we are moving forward on development here and look forward to having a tremendous gas resource year to deliver to the marketplace starting in late 2015, 2016.","Richard, with that, that's the ops update, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks a lot, Jim. On page 19, we give our update that we do every quarter for the year 2014. Again this is based on returning to normal operations at Grasberg in May. While our sales have been restricted, we have produced concentrate in the inventory and that will allow us as we coordinate future shipments to customers and our customers have been working very cooperatively with us as we go through this situation with export ban would allow us to recover much of the shortfall that we had in the first quarter.","So on that basis; we are looking at 4.3 billion pounds of copper sales for 2014, 1.6 million ounces of gold, 97 million pounds of molybdenum. Dave Thornton is here, the price of moly had gone up 30% in the past month, which is positive for us and then positive outlook of 64.2 million equivalent barrels of 70% of oil. Unit cost on the basis of $1,300 gold and $10 molybdenum, we're above that right now with the $1.41 for copper, as Jim talked about, attractive unit cost for oil at $19 per BOE.","At $3 copper, last quarter we were using three and a quarter, we are not predicting, we are just showing you a model here that shows operating cash flows $7.7 billion in the basis of the plan, each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of 2014 is significant $275 million. No changes in our capital expenditure outlook of just over $7 billion.","Page 20 shows our sales profile as we go forward. You can see the significant increase and volumes that come about as we bring these development projects online. 2016 is a special year, in the sense that it's our last really full year production Grasberg open pit.","So we will access in that case to very high grades of copper and gold, low stripping, and that ends up with an extraordinary year particularly for gold as you can see it. An outlook for 3 million ounces, but also for copper, strong molybdenum sales, growing oil sales, as Jim talked about and with significant growth beyond 2016 oil and gas business.","Our quarterly outlook is presented on slide 21. You can see increasing volumes as we go through the quarter. Gold sales at Grasberg are affected by mine sequencing, and you can see our outlook for our oil and gas business as well our molybdenum business. The outlook for site costs in the mining is presented on Page 22 based on $1300 gold, $10 molybdenum outlook for consolidate unit cost at $0.41.","You can see the spread for our copper sales, we have more than 40% in North America, more than 30% in South America, roughly just over 20% in Indonesia and 10% in Africa. With our cobalt coming from Africa, our molybdenum principally from North America, and our gold from Indonesia.","Our model outlook for EBITDA and cash flows is presented on Page 23. What we're showing here is an average of our 2015 and 2016 operating plans. And then with set prices with variances for copper and it's the most significant driver of our earnings and cash flow and at $3 copper EBITDA of just over $13 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flows, $16 billion EBITDA at $3.50 and $12.5 billion of operating cash flows.","And then if copper were to average $5 during those two years, then the amounts to very significant levels $18.5 million and $14 billion. Sensitivities for your own use and developing your models are presented on Page 24. And our capital expenditures, which are unchanged from our previous outlook, are presented on Page 25. This year, there's just over $4 billion for mining, just over $3 billion of that is for the major projects, and $3 billion for oil and gas.","The commitment to balance sheet management, as we've been talking about since we announced the oil and gas acquisitions, we are focused on reducing the acquisition debt. That focus is unchanged. We are dealing with lower copper prices currently. None of us know what it's going to be as we look forward. We have some headwinds currently from the Indonesian export situation. We expect that to be resolved and recover from that very quickly. But despite that \u2013 those situations, we're still looking at targeting reducing our debt to something in the range of $12 billion by the end of 2016.","We anticipate continuing our current cash dividend on our common stock at $1.25 share. And we will reach this target by managing our large resource base, generating strong cash flows through execution. And being very disciplined in the way we run our business. We're continuing to work on divestiture and monetization opportunities. We're working with third-parties both in the oil and gas business and the mining business, and advancing potential transactions that would allow us to move towards our debt targets more quickly. If we run our plans without any divestitures, the story is a good one.","Even at $3 copper, we get down to the range of $14 billion, even at the reduced copper level by the end of 2016. But we want to get there quicker, and we're working hard to do it. We have opportunities to do it with our asset base. We can't announce specifics today, but we can report that the management team we feel good about what we're pursuing. And we're looking at other opportunities beyond straight asset sales in terms of joint venture arrangements potential, MLP opportunities focusing in on our California properties, which would be very attractive for the MLP market.","So all of those things are at work, and the story today is there's no wavering in our commitment to get to where we need to get to have a strong balance sheet. So that's our report for this quarter. Some challenges, but that's the nature of our business. We've been there before, and we've met them, and we'll meet these. And we look forward to answering your questions.","Question-and-Answer session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line David Gagliano with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks to be first up. Let me just ask you a couple quick questions on Grasberg please. First of all on the commentary regarding the contingency plans you mentioned more workforce reductions capital spending reductions what's a reasonable time period to expect for the start of these contingency plans. Is this something we should expect to start to occur in Q2, Q3 or next year?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, Dave, what would drive that is not anything that's from a timing standpoint forces us to do it. So long as we feel as we do now that we're moving towards resolution issue. Then we will not go through the negative impacts of having workforce reductions and capital difference that's where we've been so far. If there were to be something happening within the government that would lead us to conclude at any point in time that they're just going to leave the situation in place for a long period of time that\u2019s when we would act. ","So we believe this is going to be resolved in the relatively near future that there's progress being made that people are working towards a resolution and we would only act if we got word from the government \u201chey were not going to do anything were just going to leave is in place.\u201d So it's not a specific time but more a reading of the progress that\u2019s being made towards resolution.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then just somewhat related the rate of deferral months that went \u2013 I think it\u2019s now indicating 15 million pounds deferred volume each month that you're unable to export concentrates. I\u2019m just curious why do that deferral rate increase I think it was 40 million pounds a month?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yes, David this is Kathleen. We're just getting into some higher grade potential and so that just reflects that the gold is the same as what we had said before, but the copper is a little higher impact.","","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","What we did, Dave, when this first started is we moved out of the lower region pit and started focusing on mining at the higher areas where we had with material. All of these are things were going to have to do over time in our mine plan. So we mine higher grade material \u2013 I mean lower grade material, waste lower grade material but some and stockpiles and now just because of mine sequencing we end up getting into some higher grade material.","David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Perfect. I got it. Why don't I hop out? Thanks for taking the questions and good quarter by the way.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks a lot Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Richard C. Adkerson","Hey Tony. Operator lets go to\u2026","Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Hello.","Richard C. Adkerson","Tony, are you there?","Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen & Co.

It seems as though there was a bit of a breakthrough recently, at least in the regaining the ability to export, and this morning it looks like there's an article the Jakarta Post that indicates that the government has revised the controversial export duty and according to the Deputy Finance Minister, I guess, which is being quoted, but is the progressive export tax now no longer an issue Richard?","Richard C. Adkerson","Tony let me just make a comment, and this is not just unique to Indonesia, you see it here in newspapers. As you know because you follow us over a long period of time, we did caution you about reacting to daily press releases. Comments are made by a variety of people in government and there are inconsistencies. We will keep everybody informed when there are major developments and so forth. Now we think the current export duty is prohibitive. It goes up to 60%.","You just can't pay that and run your business. So when we talk about progress it is progress in the sense of dealing with this export duty and that would mean adjusting it downward. Our contract says that we pay no taxes or duties other than the ones listed in the contract, and so that\u2019s one of these issues of where people in the government are focusing on the new mining law, we are focusing on our contract and that part of the discussions that are going on.","So there is progress being made, the progress would necessarily entail a dealing with the currently prohibitively high export duties, but there are no announcements that we're prepared to make today about conclusions. And when there are, we would make them, it will require the Ministry of Finance to adopt new regulations. They have not done that yet. We have had an important step in being designated as an authorized exporter by the Ministry of trade but there is several procedure steps that we have to go through to get this behind us.","Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC","Okay. Could you maybe discuss in greater detail that the complexities you guys are facing as it relates to COW extension? And then, in light of the 2009 mining law, I know there's been some there were further changes in 2012, and the government seems like it is trying to convert the COW to that new business license structure. Should I be looking at these discussions, all of these whether it be the concentrate exports, export types of smelters, as being linked, or are they separate and distinct from the COW extension discussions?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. It\u2019s all link fundamental, but we are focusing immediately on trying to get to a point where we can export concentration returns to normal operations. That will not require dealing with all of the COW issues. We would like to see the COW issues doubt with we\u2019ve been working very actively with the government for 2.5 years doubt to do that. That\u2019s complicated in difficult to do in the current political environment.","So it\u2019s a two step process, first step is to reach a basis through regulatory changes and governmental approvals so that we can resume exports get back to working in a normal way and we'll continue to have discussions on the COW extension and that's where this issue comes up of our being committed to supporting and sending our COW the government warning to move COW holders to the new regime that\u2019s define by the 2009 mining law and that\u2019s basis for our the debate.","Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC","Okay. All right and then just to switch gears a little bit here, in terms of the asset sales and in the discussion you indicated that you're actively engaged in discussions. I was wondering, does the expansion enhance long-term viability of Morenci make it more likely you guys could part with other lesser core assets in North American mining?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well, that\u2019s an interesting question. We have opportunities to do that, but I think you were down in just go we can clearly unfortunate I could make it this year, but I think one of the things that comes out of there is the reality the mining industry is based. The U.S. is increasingly looking attractive for development. The energy situation here that's affecting industrial development across the board in the U.S. comes into play here in the U.S. for our mining projects.","So today U.S. is a very significant advantage over expansions in South America because of the cheaper energy here. We\u2019re also seeing increasingly the benefits of the U.S. workforce. We are nonunionized here. We have a very flexible workforce where it's easier to staff up for expansions and then adjust if you have to adjust than in South America where you have unions and government policies that make it difficult to flex your workforce.","Water is an issue in the United States, but Red and his group have done a great job in securing water opportunities for us here in Arizona. Water is a huge, huge problem in Chile, and that ties into energy because of having to use desile projects that requires a lot of energy to pump the water and run the projects.","So when we size things up we are increasingly encouraged about opportunities to expand U.S. and more than half of our resources now are in the U.S. So in any event, this Southwest copper district has rolled away the stone from the tomb. And you know and it\u2019s looking really good for us. And so what we wouldn't want to do is sell assets that have significant growth opportunities because we're so positive about the long-term future for copper work and we have that in the U.S.","Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC","That makes a lot of sense. I think that I appreciate the insights. And yes, I did miss you at CESCO there, Richard","","Richard C. Adkerson","","Yeah, I missed you too, Tony. All right. Thanks a lot. If you we'll let you get back in line.","Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC","Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Richard C. Adkerson","Good morning Sal.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Wanted to just ask you if your current labor force, you are still keeping them \u2013 my understanding is that they are doing maintenance work pre-stripping. Does it imply that the future cost could be better if once these things as all the preparation work is being done right now?","Richard C. Adkerson","Well the answer is yes. I mean our cost structure in large part is fixed. We do have some variable cost, but we have a lot of fixed cost so obviously we get volumes back up you don\u2019t see the unit cost come down, but we are getting ahead of the curve as you mentioned some stripping activities and maintenance activities and that will have some benefits that the margin as we go forward. Getting those volumes is forwards that's where we are making money, because have to touch our margins and we just need to get the shipments going to our customers outside Indonesia.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Got you. And, Richard, is there any difficulty or concern if you reach an agreement and the new government comes in they may have a different view again, is that also hampering the discussion or are you confident that whatever deal you make or whatever solution you make with the current government will actually be honored by the next government? And we have seen Indonesian government have what they have done with their COW, and change the rules during the game. And if there's a concern that it may happen again, even after the resolution with the current government.","Richard C. Adkerson","Listen we\u2019ve been there for over 40 years. You think about the huge concerns that we\u2019re there from the unknowns that happens when Suharto stepped down in 1998. And the government has evolved since then, and the government will continue to evolve in Indonesia as a lot of places in the world there's a lot of nationalistic political views that's popular with the local population. It really comes into play with natural resources and that's just something we have to do with so the answer is we're going to be dealing with this issue forever and we've had experience with it, there's a lot of reasons for whoever \u2013 the basic issue for Indonesia is this, Indonesia has grown so much and has developed over the 25 years that I've been going there.","They still have a growing young population with a lot of unemployment. And while there local economy has developed they need to create jobs, any political leader that comes in from whatever party is going to be faced with the necessity of creating jobs, are there going to be \u2013 are they going to fail. And they to create jobs Indonesia does not have an internal savings rate that's enough to fund the capital investment to create jobs.","So their going to need foreign investment and regardless of nationalistic views or feelings about self-sufficiency which you hear a lot today in Indonesia the reality is people there is around the world people face is creating jobs to the young people and in Indonesia and that's going to require foreign investment and that's going to require Indonesia to be part of the world economy and that's the reality. We stay out of politics. The people of Indonesia choose the kind of government they want to have and we don't try to influence that. We prepare ourselves to work with whatever government the people elect.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I did understand the smelter is going to create 500 jobs, and if you shut half the mine down, that's going to will cost 15,000 jobs to go away.","Richard C. Adkerson","We\u2019ve had those discussions, you can be sure that those discussions are made. Part of the problem that\u2019s complication, I'm sure as you know, Sal, is this was originally directed at other minerals. Where Indonesia is world's largest of nickel ores, I think they provide two thirds of the bauxite to China, significant tin exports and as those industries where they were just exporting ores, Indonesia was see value creation going to other countries that\u2019s not what it is for copper, but politically we are in a complicated situation in trying to say treat copper in a company like Freeport different than you are treating the small nickel exporters and that\u2019s a tough political situation for the government to be in, but yes we\u2019ve made that point and you are right.","Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, I\u2019ll get back in the front queue.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","If you can expand on the asset sale potential, I think in the past, company has talked about potential of $3 billion to $4 billion in asset sales and then specifically with regards to California, as you're thinking in the MLP opportunity that you would want to divest that to an existing MLP or potentially create your own?","James C. Flores","This is Jim. Regarding asset sales, we're looking and exploring all options. The LMP study and discussion we've been having internally is basically maximizing the value of our onshore oil assets. They're long lived, they're low decline, they're the prototype MLP asset in the investment banker and any of your firms will come tell you that aspect of it, but the key is, and foremost, what does it do for the FCX shareholder? And as Richard and Kathleen talked about our balance sheet discipline and with high oil prices, gives us an opportunity to transfer some of that value from the assets themselves to the FCX to shell to form a debt repayment.","That being said, we still want to maximize our oil business because of the high margins and the growth. And what we're seeing, this is going to be a long-winded answer to your MLP question, but what we're seeing in the Gulf of Mexico is all the growth potential we have, all the development activity, and the ability to grow that business much faster. So we're in the early stages of getting our hands around rotating out of our onshore oil business at the highest value possible.","And the MLP might be a vehicle to do that either internally, or sell, or a joint venture with it existing MLPs, or just sell outright those assets. And monetize those assets, and help accelerate the Gulf of Mexico. What we've found in our modeling is that we can grow faster in the Gulf, and hit the same targets by monetizing the onshore assets and rotating into the offshore business.","The MLP discussions or valuations are going to be one part of doing that successfully, because of the valuations for those assets. The current headwinds in the MLP market are severe, with the banks exiting the hedging market and the severe backwardation. You've got 20% to 25% backwardation in the crude oil curve over the next 36 months, yet you've got oil demand never stronger, it's up 1 million, 1.5 million barrels a day worldwide with 3% GDP growth.","So there's going to be continued headwinds to doing a traditional MLP of just hedging the oil volumes, levering it up, and selling it to another set of investors. At the same point in time, these properties are to be around for a long, long time. So what you could see is the next several years is us rotating that business, continue to use the excess sales proceeds to reduce the balance sheet, as well as rotate to higher growth assets in the Gulf of Mexico. And the $3 billion to $4 billion target that we've all talked about is going to be underpinned by that activity as well as anything on the mining side.","Richard C. Adkerson","Here's where it comes together. Here's, fundamentally, where we\u2019re approaching the oil and gas business in the mining business the same from this perspective. We\u2019re big believers in the future of the commodities we\u2019re big believers in the future of growth through our set of assets.","So we are looking to enhance that. That's where we can grow. And looking at our other assets which have value and are good assets that we might could monetize through sales joint venture MLP and reach this debt target. But we've not as I mentioned in the response to Tony, we don't want to sell assets that takeaway from our future growth opportunities.","In fact, we want to look for ways to enhance those assets. So we got \u2013 we got those opportunity across the board. And, Curt, we're just not at the point where we are discussing to specifically what we are doing, but our targets remain the same and we are optimistic about achieving them.","Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay and that's very helpful, and I appreciate it. And just a follow-up on Indonesia, it seems like one of the key points the government is trying to make is to get companies to adhere to obviously the new licensing agreements that you guys stated. And I think that for most companies operating under those IUPs, is there's a mandatory investment process.","Whereas, after five years, you have to start divesting your ownership stake, and I think by year 10 it's below I think 51%. And I was wondering is this going to affect your view towards capital allocation going forward at Grasberg? Obviously, there's a substantial CapEx swing as you go underground. And do you have confidence that you'll be able to effectively uphold the existing terms that you have regarding your ownership stake?","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay, you're right about the IUP. We have a contract of work, and under that contract we have no divestiture obligations. As we've talked before, what we\u2019re trying to do is to sit down with the government. Finally, that we can do response to certain of their aspirations and voluntarily change the contract without throwing it out the window and abandoning it as way of protecting our interest.","For example, with divestitures, we think if we as part of an agreement to extend the contract and resolve all these issues related to the review of the contract and the mining law, that for us to list an interest of PT-FI on the Indonesian exchange would be positive for all parties. Positive for the government, and positive for us. So that's the sort of thing that we\u2019re talking about doing.","But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges of our debate is this issue you raised with the government wanting to go more in the direction of the 2009 mining law, we wanting to extend the contract, and trying to reach agreement on that during an election year where all the politics are volatile.","So, that's why we're focusing first on getting back to work with our exports, and continuing the discussions on the contract beyond that. If we could resolve the whole issue, then we'd do it, we want to do it. But we\u2019ve got to face the realities of where we are in the context of Indonesia today.","Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","","Okay, thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson","But let's go back to your deal, we are confident we're going to be able to have a resolution of this. So we continue our underground development, so we can operate there through 2041 in a very profitable low cost way. This has changed our view about exploration outside of PT-FI. And looking at other places in Indonesia, unfortunately for the country, this new mining law is making it very difficult to doing new projects there in the mining business. And so, we have backed off of some of our exploration opportunities that we were pursuing because of the new mining law that doesn\u2019t\u2019 apply to PT-FI.","Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse","Indonesia, perhaps for Kathleen, I'm wondering how Indonesia may affect liquidity decisions in the next say six months. We saw a net cash draw down in the quarter, and which bringing the cash balance down. While between substantial lines of credit available, the dividend, CapEx, and as Indonesia and as all things come together, how is that strategy, if any, likely to change over the next six months as it pertains to liquidity?","Kathleen L. Quirk","","Well as we've been talking about our current plan is that we'll be able to resume normal exports in the second quarter and obviously what we have contingency plans as well that the deal with the situation is extended. We're not currently expecting that but we do have contingency plans. As you point out we would you have a very large undrawn revolver and do have cash on hand, but we'll manage the situation, we'll manage our outflows, we'll manage our CapEx all to maintain a very strong liquidity position.","Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you. And my second question is maybe a little bit more of housekeeping. There was $0.49 per pound that was excluded in the site production costs at PT-FI. And I'm just wondering, is that related to the increased rate of voice [ph] stripping? If we can have a little bit of discussion on what's actually in that $0.49.","Kathleen L. Quirk","Yes. Those were cost that were charged roughly the cost of sales rather than going through the normal process of going through inventory and then into cost of sales as a concentrated sold. What we did and this is consistent with accounting rules when you're not operating at normal levels, you need to keep your inventory balances at what they would otherwise would have been. So during the quarter, we incurred those costs that were outside because we didn't have volumes in inventory as those went to directly to cost of sales, but they were just the normal cost of operations it just was excess of what our normal inventory values would be have we been operating at normal capacity.","Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse","I see. Okay, thank you very much. That's clear. ","Richard C. Adkerson","It was explained as the cost of excess capacity to me I mean for example, if we could next port anything or couldn't ship anything we charge all the cost that were incurring directly as an expense of having excess capacity and this is the element of excess capacity that we have.","Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. That's very clear.","Richard C. Adkerson","Ralph, I\u2019m glad you called Kathleen, one of the benefits I have is she looks over my shoulders, I\u2019m making all these comments. I mentioned that the Indonesian elections were last week; they were actually April 9, just to be accurate.","Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","You are next question comes from the line of Tony Robson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Tony D. Robson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Ltd.","Thank you. good morning all and thank you Richard for taking my question. Following on from Tony's comments regarding the Jakarta Post article, and I understand your comment not to jump on the latest things you hear from Indonesia, but to reiterate it again, the comments from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry that had talked about a flat export duty of 10%. Would a flat 10% export duty for say the next three or four years while you're building a smelter, would that be acceptable to Freeport and to PT-FI or would that be because it cuts across your contact of work as you've well pointed out, would that be an unacceptable compromise to you guys? Thank you.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well I\u2019m going to repeat the caution about assigning too much weight to even specific comments that are attributed to individual government officials. So would again just suggest like I do, I read the papers every morning, every evening, but don\u2019t react specifically to what people are said or quoted as to having said. So I would just caution you about putting too much weight on that.","But you do touch on an important issue for us and other contract work holders, is that whatever the rate is if one is imposed it would be contrary to the contract provision to say that were only subject to taxes that are identified work. We have urged the government if they do impose a rate, to treat it as an income tax payment, and have it credible against income taxes as an offset to income taxes. And that way our taxes would be limited to what is in the contract.","We recognize that that might be difficult for the government to implement. So what we will be faced with is how to deal with this, I mean we have a strong incentive about going back to work, principally to avoid harm to our workers in the local community, we can manage this ourselves financially for the company. But we will have to work with governmental how we deal with this conflict and how it preserves our rights for the contract and we're just going to have way to see with the regulations are before we respond specifically to that. So Tony I'm sure you can appreciate we can\u2019t speculate on that right now until we see what comes out of the government.","Tony Robson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","I understand, and thank you for that, Richard.","Richard C. Adkerson","Okay. Thanks Tony.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Good morning everyone. First of all, congratulations on the strong results. We're starting to get used to oil and gas exceeding expectations, so hopefully that can be kept up. Just want to start first with a clarification. During your remarks, Richard, you mentioned that at $3 copper you expected the net debt to be down to $14 billion. Does that imply that you expect to get about $2 billion in the monetization of whatever the case may be joint ventures or asset sales?","Richard C. Adkerson","No. And that's based on a model of just running our business and achieving our production volumes and cost and based on $3 copper and $1300 gold and $10 molybdenum and oil prices being roughly at where they are today. So the point out was making is even though we've had the drop in copper prices, we still have a very strong business of generating cash flows at today\u2019s prices.","Now, if prices weaken or costs go up or we have production disruptions, one of the reasons we want to derisk the balance sheet by advancing these sales and get all this debt talk behind us. But if in fact we have other headwinds deal with which in our business, might have that. We always have the flexibility of reducing capital spending, particularly in the oil and gas business as we talked about before much more so in the mining business, you can deferred capital spending and cut back its more discretionary.","You don't lose resources by doing that as you know Oscar, because you\u2019ve been there very tough for us to back off of Cerro Verde now given where we are with our oil and gas capital spending. We have more flexibility if we were to have to adjust capital spending. So but my only point was we haven\u2019t run off any clip year from our basic operating situation and we still have a strong business, because of our margins at today\u2019s copper prices and commodity prices.","We still generate lot of cash is going to be back end loaded, because of our capital spending and the fact that we get the benefit of volumes after the capital projects are finished. But even with that backend loaded and copper prices coming off of $3.30 to over $3 now. We still have a very strong outlook.","James C. Flores","And, Oscar, I was reiterating the fact that the Gulf of Mexico as we get further into this we're getting more comfortable with it. We're getting some of the planning and volatility we're starting to see success and results and so forth, and it's really allowing us that more flexibility, as Richard said, to support the aspect of strengthening the balance sheet. And at the same point in time, growing \u2013 have a dynamically growing world business to support their long corporations growth long-term.","So, as we\u2019re growing to this process it\u2019s nothing like a little low copper prices to make you refine the business strategy and look at things in a different way. And I think it\u2019s going to positive results and everybody that's been involved in the situation and asked stepped up the execution on the operations front has responded. I am just continue to be pleased with our ability to work in tandem to the corporate goals, and at the same point in time ring out some operating excellence and flexibility in each and every business here. And we expect that continue.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you both. Not questioning the strength of the operation whatsoever. It's more like if you're building a new smelter refinery in Indonesia, then just want to gauge the flexibility on that net debt target. Because the expenditure of $3.5 billion or $4 billion over there, and I know you probably get a joint venture partner, it would be a different story. But anyway, second question\u2026","James C. Flores","Let me make clear on that, just to be specific Oscar. That doesn't include that kind of spending in Indonesia. We are talking with partners, and we also talk with government, about the need I have government incentives to deal with part of that cost. But that's not in the numbers that I talked about. With that something that would have to be dealt with. But there's several moving parts right now.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Oscar send label get free of way of the partner.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Well, we're talking to the wrong guy though. Sorry, and then in the spirit of educating the mining guy, your oil and gas sales projections for 2016, and at the end of the of the year you said 81 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2016. Now we're looking at 78 million. And I'm guessing this is just deferral, but could you just go over where the change was or what's causing that reduction?","Kathleen L. Quirk","Oscar this is Kathleen. As Rich will notice we move some production into 2014 we\u2019re previously saying $61 million BOEs and our $64 million and we have move some of the plan shut ins into 2015 and then moved some from 2015 into 2016. So, that's affected the volumes, but that's really what's driving and I think you'll see getting some volumes excelerated to do what we can to offset some of the shortfalls we've had in the mining business.","James C. Flores","","Right, and Osacar and the shutting she's talking about are the platform modifications so we can bring on incremental production from the tie backs. As we again thinking about the business everyday and making sure we are making the best decisions that made operational sense to group all those together at the end of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 and so there is so affected production, it wouldn\u2019t be individual well its just timing of us 45 days shut ins for each one of those make in facilities\/","Richard C. Adkerson","And this worth pointing out that these facilities were acquired from BP and Shell in the fall of 2012. So the team is learning more and getting experienced with it so changes in this range Oscar are just to be expected. I mean there's nothing that's significant about it as Kathleen said, its just we try to give you an outlook every quarter and outlooks are going to change.","Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","No, I appreciate that, Richard. Thank you all. And it is just again, educating the mining guy. Thanks very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","You are making a lot of progress Oscar; we don\u2019t keep working with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the lines of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with you question.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","At Grasberg, I see that the mill operating rate declined versus the last quarter, but what about the mining rate, did that remain pretty much unchanged, so you just basically did more stripping?","Richard C. Adkerson","It did it was in the range of changes it was down a little bit, our mine rated downward DOZ mine, which is at relatively full capacity is still 50,000 instead of 65 or 70, so we are making some adjustments to that and listen somebody mentioned earlier Mark Johnsons here, those guys have done a great job. We completed our labor contract last fall. We've had a harmonious situation working. We\u2019ve had a good safety performance in the first quarter which was big concern and focus of our company after the experiences over the last couple of years, but the team has worked very well together; we appreciate the support of our union and our workers so we've tweaked it Paretosh. It's down slightly but we are continuing to operate at essentially full mining rates.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And maybe a quick one for Jim, it could be a question similar to Oscar's question. For the second half of 2014, third quarter guidance is up, but fourth-quarter is unchanged. Anything major that's driving that?","James C. Flores","Yes, that was what Kathleen talked about. We had previously planned to shut our Marlin facility down for the entirety of the third quarter of 2014. We've now shift that to the third quarter of 2015. So that's between 30,000 and 40,000 barrels a day that will be on stream here in the fourth quarter, and add to those volumes and those numbers.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos' Very Independent Research. Please go ahead with your question.","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos' Very Independent Research","Thank you very much for all your efforts resolving the issues overseas, and the patient deliberations on the refinancing. I'm a small shareholder and appreciate your hard work. Some of Jim's comments about the oil and the gas properties went over my head. Could you explain the unrisked potential, is that before a feasibility study saying what's recoverable? And could you elaborate a little bit about the Highlander discovery and its relationship to Davey Jones and Blackbeard and the deep output potential please? ","James C. Flores","Sure, John. On page 15, you're talking about the green box in our slide saying Total Net Unrisked Resource Potential of 1.1 billion BOE, barrels of oil equivalent. That was respective to the blocks, the new tracks and new leases that we're the parent high bidder on, and are waiting to be awarded. We're trying to give everybody a feel of what we feel is the resource potential. When we start talking about putting it into a plan to be funded as a CapEx item and refining those plans, we will do it on a risk basis to make sure it's competitive with the rate of returns on a risk basis.","But when you're risking 1 billion barrels of oil, you get to a big number. When you start with 1 billion barrels of oil and when you start risking, you get to a big number especially when you're talking about $10 to $15 a barrel, costs may be as low as $5 in some of these cases, some nice big reservoirs when you already have the infrastructure in place. So I appreciate your question to give you a little more.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thank you. Let me say because I've talked with John so long about this. Maybe, John, what this is, this is a geologic analysis of what the opportunity is. So in the oil and gas business what the opportunity is. So in the oil and gas business what the next would be, would to do further geological analysis of the subsurface through seismic studies and so forth.","But ultimately, you have to drill wells to have discoveries or not and then you delineated and then you move towards a development plan. So this is sort of like in the mining industry of having, widely space and now you have to do exploratory drilling delineation drilling and then you move towards deciding specifically how you have a development plan. That makes sense John.","","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Yes, that's real good. Thank you, Jim, and, Richard. And could you explain a little bit the Highlander discovery and the analogies to the other deep wells? That was a little bit fuzzy to me?","James R. Moffett","","[Technical Difficulties]","","John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research","Thank you very much, I can listen for hours.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Thanks John.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Great, thank. Hey Rich, I've got a couple of clarification questions. One is just on the smelter costs. I think last quarter, you guys said maybe less than $3 billion, and then Oscar earlier mentioned $3.5 billion to $ billion. I was wondering if you could just elaborate what your more recent studies or look suggests about the CapEx on a 100% basis before any government subsidies?","Richard C. Adkerson","Yes. And part of it is and this is just to indicate what the study is the current smelter we have at Gresik is Mitsubishi technology smelter that continues casting. And new smelters that are being built in China older outokumpu type flash smelters is what we have and a version of that, an early version of that in copper and also right in our mine smelter here in United States. China which has been constructing smelters aggressively in recent years because of their internal demand for copper have advanced that technology and are building large-scale smelters using the outokumpu type flash smelting.","So one of the things we're studying is different aspects of that. We had an international engineering firm do a prefeasibility type studies which was focused on the Mitsubishi type situation. That's what we talked about earlier. I think at this point and we're working with Antam which is suggesting that with Indonesia we might have beneficial labor costs, et cetera. So, it's in the range of $2 billion to$2.5 billion is the number two think about. There is some working capital issues associated with that but all of this is still within a pretty wide range of potential estimating I wont call it areas, but just estimating ranges is because of the stage of studies today.","Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then secondly, just back to the earlier discussion about MLPs. And my understanding is that the valuations step up, a good portion of it has to do with tax savings, but you don't pay any taxes, at least at the operations level, both at the energy or on the copper side. So are there corporate tax savings that you would expect to realize from putting some assets into an MLP type structure that we should take into consideration?","Richard C. Adkerson","Let me just make a couple of comments about taxes, we pay substantial foreign taxes as you know, you know where we operate. So our cash tax obligations are substantial. Not so much in the United States, particularly with oil and gas acquisition, because of some net operating loss carry forwards have transferred over and the current deductibility of intangible drilling and development costs. So the benefit is not so much to the corporation, but to the investors. In other words, the initial attractiveness of MLPs was to individual investors where you weren\u2019t faced with having taxes at a corporate level, and then taxes on dividends.","It was a true partnership, so it eliminated the INU level taxes, and then the tax attributes like IDCs and so forth flow through to the unit holders, but what's happened since in the development of the MLP concept is today even a number of non-tax paying investors, institutional investors are attracted to MLPs because of the distribution aspects of it in the low interest rate environment. In other words they see distributions from MLPs providing current cash returns in relation to investment from other income yielding type vehicle.","So a lot of today's investors in MLPs that are not attracted to it from the tax attribute side, its still there for individual investors, but more just from the fact that MLPs are structured in ways to give attractive current income distributions. And so that resulted in attractive multiples in the public marketplace, those are admittedly higher for what's called midstream MLPs where you have contracts to give a surety of our cash flows and upstream MLPs typically trade in lower valuations, but we have assets particularly in California that are attractive for the MLP models and it gives us opportunity to look at it.","As Jim talked about, our real objective here which is maybe different from some other MLP developers is to create a monetization event, so we can meet our debt targets. We are focused \u2013 we are really focused on building value FCX shares, I mean that\u2019s what we really want to do. So the management team we are in the same views as our shareholders and we're trying to find ways as our shareholders and we are trying to find ways of increasing the value of FCX\u2019s shares.","We feel they are significantly undervalued today, almost every management team you talk to if going to say that, but we believe we can by executing our plans experiencing what we believe to be favorable future markets, dealing the problems like this Indonesian problem , and strengthening our balance sheet we think ultimately that will translate into our share price. And that's what we're all working towards.","Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, great thanks Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lipschitz with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Good morning. My quick question is, have you talked with other companies, other than the government, such as new moderns something like that about building a smelter? Are they involved in those talks as well?","Richard C. Adkerson","The answer is definitely yes. We\u2019ve talk with other companies in an appropriate way about their situations and you might want to speak for themselves, but their resource is significantly different than the Grasberg resource. Always has been in particularly in terms of mine life and so forth. But I mentioned we're working with Aneka Tambang, Antam the state owned mining company in Indonesia we\u2019ve also had discussion with others and so we\u2019re opened to working with partners and have active discussion going on with them.","David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","","Thanks I noticed there were some fairly significant upward revisions to third quarter sales guidance, for both copper, gold and oil and gas from your prior update. I think it Jim covered the oil and gas side, but on the mining side, what's driving that relative to the guidance you put out in January?","Kathleen L. Quirk","It's mainly the changes in the Grasberg volumes, and the timing of those.","Richard C. Adkerson","","It's the makeup. In other words, our production of copper concentrate is higher than our sales and so we\u2019ve increased our inventory of copper concentrates which with clearance to export will work it way into the marketplace over time. So that\u2019s why we talk about the shortfall is not being lost volumes, but deferred volumes.","Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then switching over, as you noted, the moly market has shown some signs of life here over the past couple months. As the world's largest producer of that metal, I was hoping you could provide some color as to what you're seeing fundamentally that's driving the price strengthening?","Richard C. Adkerson","I'm going to asked Dave Thornton to come down here and get by the phone. Dave is the guy that runs our moly business.","","David H. Thornton","","Yes, the fundamentals are basically is that the market has tightened up primarily in Europe as we've seen some improvement in the European economies, mainly Spain, Italy, big steel producing regions and countries. And then the supply has been tight, so mainly you're going \u2013 the traders in the market, the suppliers who are basically like us are meeting our contractual obligations.","So mine supply is tight demand picked up a little bit but not a lot, but because of the tightness in the market we're seeing that the traders are involved more. And we're seeing some uptick, price has increased roughly $3 in a month. And that still occurring, although we are seeing that the trade is backing off a little bit and taking some profits looks like recently. So the price has come back off around $12.50 last ever.","Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah.","Richard C. Adkerson","","Molybdenum is a relatively small global market.","David H. Thornton","Right.","","Richard C. Adkerson","And so changes can have a dramatic effect over short periods of time. Most molybdenum goes as a metal into steel alloys. A significant part of our production, because of our high grade of molybdenum that we produce at our standalone molybdenum mines in Colorado, Henderson and Climax, goes into higher values from a margin standpoint chemical marketplace where it's used as catalysts in refineries and for other chemical \u2013 high-end chemical users. But, with Europe being a substantial steel producer and with some upticks in the steel marketplace, that's created a tightness in a relatively small global marketplace.","Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","","Okay, that\u2019s great detail. Thanks a lot.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Charles Bradford \u2013 Bradford Research","","Hi, good morning. I've just gotten back from China, and they've continued to revise their back data. For right now it's 2013, the effect of which is to reduce the growth rates in March 2014. The same thing occurred of course all of last year. Do you have any evidence or have you seen anything whether the same is occurring in copper? Because frankly our copper concentrate data out of China has almost disappeared, and we're sort of at a loss as whether the same thing is occurring.","Richard C. Adkerson","Copper concentrate data?","Charles A. Bradford \u2013 Bradford Research, Inc.","","Yes.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well you are seeing a situation where with the development of the smelter business in China there is more important concentrates in relation that there has been historically but listen Chuck, we commercially sell product into China we sell copper, cobalt occasionally some of it and we worked directly with customers.","We\u2019re not traders and you know the numbers you talk about get obscured, because of this issue of how copper flows in and out of these bonded warehouses and so forth and I know it\u2019s a complicated situation we\u2019re not a great source of information for that sort of thing. All I can report on is how we are dealing with customers and normal course of business. And what was seeing is relatively strong demand both for copper and for cobalt. ","James R. Moffett","","Just we've been tracking in the past their own copper concentrate production tying it to imports, and then eventually into refined output, and the data just is a little bit more sparse than usual, but they seem to have been reporting much lower growth rates than otherwise would have been the case if they hadn't revised up last year.","Richard C. Adkerson","Yea, well there is a CRU report that came out this morning, I read in the predawn hours and you can look at it and see their commentary on that very subjects.","Charles A. Bradford \u2013 Bradford Research, Inc.","Well, thank you very much.","Richard C. Adkerson","Thanks.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","","Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. For Indonesia, and I think it's come up before with the smelter, there's been different cost estimates and whatever, but I just want to be clear. This smelter if it gets built, will be big enough to take the remaining concentrate out of Grasberg going forward so we're not going to get stuck with say 20% of the con still getting hit with a graduated tax. It would seem to me that would be an awfully big smelter.","Richard C. Adkerson","Well there are capacity limits for building a smelter. The biggest smelters in the world are flash furnace smelters that can produce 400,000 tons a year which say takes 1.6 million tons of concentrate. That plus we actually would not cover us in all years, but our production is variable. Particularly as we make this transition from open pit to total underground operations. So that is one of the complicated issues we're dealing with. I just want to point out something Brian; under the current regulations the export duty applies to all concentrate exports, not just what's net above smelter future to smelter requirements. So that\u2019s one of the issues that\u2019s still under discussions and subject to regulatory changes.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Okay.","Richard C. Adkerson","There are other developers I might mention, Indonesian companies had indicated plans to develop smaller scale smelters in Indonesia, there is not a lot of details on those plans, we have signed conditional sales agreements to sell occasionally certain amount of concentrates to those Indonesian smelter developers.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Great, thanks. My second question then just relates as mentioned, you do pay a lot of taxes to the Indonesians. Can you just refresh my memory how you pay them, when they get their cash? And secondly, the fact that now you're only at 40%, and therefore, you're not paying tax on exported concentrate. Does that affect the overall tax structure at all going forward?","Richard C. Adkerson","Our taxes are defined by the contract of work. We have a 35% tax rate, even though the tax rate generally in Indonesia today is 25% and then and that tax is based on incomes, there are some specific rules about how you calculate it, but its an accounting base taxable income determination, you apply that rates to it. Then in addition when dividends are paid from PT-FI to FCX there is an incremental 10% tax on those dividends. And so that\u2019s where you add that up, plus the royalties, plus the dividends on the government\u2019s 9.3% -- 9.36% equity interest is where you get the Indonesian government\u2019s participation in total income greater than 50%.","And so what is affecting the current income tax, but income taxes are paid basically on a one year lag basis, right in other words your current year\u2019s taxes is essentially based on your earnings from the prior year. So what's happening to the government today is because we are incurring 100% of the cost selling half or less of our concentrates, the taxable income is shrinking and so the government tax take of that which is payable next year is being reduced. Accounting purposes as you know well, because you follow this I think more closely than anyone else, we accrue for the tax expense based on our current income recognition, not when the taxes are paid.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","","Right. Okay, thanks. And just last question, and again like Oscar being a mining guy, just on Eagle Ford, it obviously had a very good first quarter. You provided different guidance a little bit for this year. But if I looked at it in simple terms, it looks like there's a pretty fast decline rate going forward to get to your averages for the year. Is that because you're harvesting that aggressively for cash, or is that something that was better-than-expected the first quarter, how should I think about that going forward?","James C. Flores","","I think a little bit of both. I mean obviously, we reduced our rig counts from nine rigs 2.5 years ago to two rigs. And what that means, obviously, is less the completions in the future. We\u2019ve been managing that completion inventory, at the same point in time, the wells have performed better overall in the field. So therefore, it's slowing that decline rate, because they're staying at higher production rates early on in their lives. So as we go forward, the production rates are probably a little conservative going forward. And we probably be adjusting those later this year, as we get a little more time on those curves and feel like we can feel good about projecting giving you tighter projections. But right now, the field continues to outperform on all fronts.","Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","James C. Flores","Thank you, Brian.

In addition to analysts and investors the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.","Before we begin our comments we'd like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.","On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice-Chairman and CEO of FCX; Jim Flores, Vice-Chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas; and we also have several others from our senior operating and financial team in the room today.","I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will start with the presentation material included in our website presentation. As usual after our prepared remarks we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $1.85 billion which was a $1.78 per share for the second quarter of 2015. ","The net loss attributable to common stock included net charges totaling $2 billion or $0.92 per share for the second quarter primarily for the reduction of carrying values of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these special items, FCX's adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $143 million or $0.14 per share.","Copper sales during the second quarter totaled \u00a3964 million, we sold gold of 352,000 ounces and our oil and gas sales totaled 13.1 million barrels of oil equivalent.","In the second quarter we realized an average copper price of 271 per pound that was below last year second quarter of 316 per pound. Gold prices of 11.74 per ounce compared with the prior year quarter of 12.96 per ounce.","And our average realized price for crude oil during the second quarter of 2015 was 67.61 per barrel which included 11.79 per barrel as realized cash gains on our derivative contract.","We generated operating cash flows of 1.1 billion during the quarter and our capital expenditures totaled 1.7 billion. We ended the quarter with 20.9 billion of consolidated debt and consolidated cash, which was just under $500 million.","We also ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of approximately $3 billion and under the severity Cerro Verde project loan of just over $500 million.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard who will provide additional details on our results on operations and outlook.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks Kathleen and good morning everyone. Thank you for participating in our call. I want to report on the operating and cost performance highlight of our second quarter and the first half of the year, of course in the context of a weak commodity price environment. But we have positive things to report.","Our Morenci project, which is an important project for us is operating at flow of rates. Our Cerro Verde project in Peru is progressing very well, it's now more than 87% complete inline to a start up later this year and we're very pleased with the progress there.","We have had improved operations at Grasberg, our mining rate, our recoveries, we\u2019re moving towards having access to higher grade ores in late 2015 and 2016, 2017 as we complete mining in the open pit. Our labor situation is stable during the second quarter.","So from a mining standpoint, we are positioned near term growth and production and also to get the benefits financially of declining costs and declining capital expenditures as we complete our expansion projects. We had a good operating quarter in oil and gas business and Jim will be talking about in a few minutes.","The Lucius production reached full capacity. We had positive drilling results with our Canyon projects for our hosting and horn mounting facilities. We now have seven top-ac wells available for completion that will provide incremental production volumes in future years.","We previously reported that on June 23, we filed a registration statement on form S1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for potential initial public offering of minority interest in oil and gas subsidiary. I\u2019ll just point out we are in registration so we have some limitations on what we can say today, but we can report on our results in and our plans for our operations as we go forward.","Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights and you can see that across the board our actual results were consistent with our guidance. We did, we are able to access some hard grade gold, Grasberg so our gold production was up roughly 15%.","Our cost performance was good with our net cash operating costs in our mining business be in $1.50 per pound and $19 per barrel in the oil and gas business. So again if you look at our financial highlights it reflects a strong quarter operationally.","Our company remains highly impacted by copper prices of course and highly leveraged to the copper prices and copper prices have dropped here late in the second quarter as we have gone into the third quarter. And copper is of course the commodity that\u2019s probably most effective by globally economic conditions in the current uncertainties there, the stronger dollar have contributed to the current price situation.","The slowdown in the China economy is the factor and the carry on effects of the drop in stock prices in China and the impact on financial investors is certainly being shown in the copper price.","Within China we do our business there, we see requirements for copper growing in absolute terms since China continuing to be a significant consumer of copper and with the countries commitment to infrastructure investment with the government's commitment to addressing the economic slowdown, we don't see China having a hard landing type situation in the summer predicting, but we have to be prepared to deal with the conditions as they evolve and we certainly will be do that as we have shown our ability to do in the past.","As we talk with our customers our downstream customers in the U.S. and of course we are very significant supplier of copper in the U.S. We see recovery continuing at moderate rates and our customers being well positioned and confident about the outlook for the second half of this year, a gradual recovery Europe.","So, as we have been for sometime we are facing near term price uncertainty in copper business and having to address our business in light of that uncertainty, you can develop reasonable scenarios now for prices either staying where they are dropping or increasing, but none of that deters us from our long range positive view of the long term fundamentals about the copper business.","On the supply side, that minor phase continue to be constrained, inventory levels while they arose in the first quarter of 2015 remain modest by historical levels and our company is strongly positioned with our large volumes of copper production and very large inventory of reserves and resources to take advantage of what we remain confident will be a long term positive future for the copper business.","Just to give view something that I have shown some of you before but just to illustrate that in broad terms on Slide 6, we show the largest copper mines in the world in terms of reserves on the left chart and in 2014 on the right chart. There is a limited number of mines here, the top 10 copper producing mines in 2014, produced less than 5 million tons per year.","Another factor when we think about supply situation in the copper business there are 16 mines on these two charts. Only four of them were discovered in the last 50 years. The discovery of world class copper mines is very rare. They lasts for decades and these mines provide growth opportunities as you go forward, but it is a commodity of where the expectations or the likelihood of discovery of a new mine of world class significance is something that is rare.","And then we look at the longer term copper market fundamentals, we used some WoodMackenzie data here. Other analysts use other data, some are more optimistic, some are less, but in WoodMackenzie analysis if you assume global growth at 2.4% a year for the next two years, which is not an aggressive view and that would include Chinese growth for the next 10 years, that would include Chinese growth at 3.7% where as China is growing at roughly 10% for the past 10 years you would see a requirement for copper $7.6 million ton.","Over the same period production from existing mines will decline its grades drop and as mines move underground and the expectations WoodMackenzie is that would create an incremental requirement of 2.8 million ton.","So when you look at growth at those levels declining production from existing mines, there is over the next 10 years at 10.4 million ton short falling copper that would need to be made up by expansions new projects or scrap and as I mentioned, the top 10 mines only produced 5 million tons last year.","So that\u2019s just an indication of a longer term needs of the world for copper and when we leave our companies well positioned benefit from that and we are focused on it.","Slide 8 shows our unit cost situations. You can see that we were consistent in achieving our objectives. Our consolidated net costs was a $1.50 pound showing some benefit of the incremental gold in Grasberg, which has had net unit cost of $0.81 a pound Tenke Fungurume in Africa is performing well approximately a $1 a pound cost and our North American operations are performing well.","You can see the production from our mines by region on the bottom part of this chart the growth in North America reflects the ramp up of marine sea and it is up 40% from last year with our expansion capacity South America reflects the sale of Candle area, which is in the last year's numbers and not in this year's numbers.","And our third where we felt short of it\u2019s production this year for operational reasons, but overall a good quarter. Slide 9, looks at our three major expansion projects that we targeted in 2010 following the financial crisis. ","We reviewed our portfolio and identified three major projects to pursue Tenke Fungurume in Phase II expansion was started in the second quarter of 2011 it was completed in 2013.","Meeting our target for capital expenditures and incremental copper. The marine sea project and the mill expansion mine expansion there was completed last year it is completed performed well now Cerro Verde is approaching completion.","In total these three projects will add roughly a billion pounds of copper production for us and involves a total of aggregate of expenditures of just over $7 billion very proud of our project management team and operations teams for effectively executing these projects.","At Cerro Verde, which is a world-class project make it a world-class mine the detailed engineering in major procurement is complete. On completion this will be the mine with the world\u2019s largest concentrating facilities 360,000 tons a day which is massive and impressive.","Construction is advancing own schedule that\u2019s more than 87% complete we\u2019re preparing to gain commissioning getting videos daily pieces of equipment beginning to operate our team there is very excited and highly motivated we\u2019ve been able to work closely with the community in doing this project.","And we\u2019ve had a minimal interruptions from our labor and virtually not from community standpoint adding 600 million pounds of copper per year. We will expect to complete this on our capital budget to-date we\u2019ve incurred about $4 billion and committed for more than that, but it\u2019s going very well.","Slide 11, shows our growing copper production profile for the remaining of remainder of 2015 and what we\u2019re looking for in 2016 we will be having increase in production as we go forward into the second half of 2015.","So here we\u2019ve been working for a number of years to benefit from these projects by giving us higher volumes and what we\u2019ll call us and that\u2019s what we\u2019re achieving and you can see as we go forward the impact of that using today\u2019s cost levels of declining unit cost for our company and also declining capital expenditures as we go forward.","The important area of attention for our company has been working with the government of Indonesia in terms of securing mutually acceptable agreement on long-term operating rights.","We have in place a contract of work our second contract that we signed in Indonesia, but it was a contract that signed in 1991 that had a 30 year primary term extending to 2021 and by it\u2019s terms giving us a rights to two 10 year extensions beyond that in a quarter with the terms of that contract.","That contract provides us the necessary, legal and physical assurance that gives us the confidence to be able to make the long-term capital investments and we\u2019re investing $15 billion to develop our underground resources to replace the open pit reserves is just depleted.","This extension requires approval by the government of Indonesia, but under the contract that cannot be unreasonably withheld. We\u2019ve had discussions now for a number of months with the government on how the deal with our contractual lights with new mining laws and regulations that has been adopted in the country of Indonesia and what we\u2019ve worked together with the government to do is to find a mutually satisfactory solution that provides our shareholders the confidence they need for us to continue to make an investments and also be responsive to the aspirations of the government of Indonesia and the new mining law regime.","The rights under our contracts currently continue until we agree to find a way forward, which may provide may involve some limits to it as part of our efforts to be responses to the government we\u2019re working on developing new smelting capacity in Indonesia and we\u2019ve made significant progress in terms of identifying sites and partnership arrangements and contract arrangements for that project that would be impair well with our resolution of our COW situation.","We have submitted our application for renewal for export license for the next six months and we were making progress with the government in securing that. We do have a long-term record that goes back 40 years now of working successfully in Indonesia and a positive way to partnership with a government and local community.","Our operations have been the primary economic driver for development in problem we want to continue to contribute to that and be part of that as well as providing significant overall benefits to the Indonesia economy direct benefits have been $18 billion over the past seven years and the split of those benefits have been 60% for the government, 40% for Freeport.","Our Chairman Jim Bob Moffett, has been in Indonesia directly involved in discussions with government officials he is there no. And Jim Bob I would like to turn the call over to you to make whatever comments you like to make.","Jim Bob Moffett ","I will make some comments in Q&A but as you said as we\u2019re making good progress and straight to good excellent guys and respect to duty timing certainly grew directionally continue as mentioned Joe, which we follow usually managing for.","The primary term for 2021 and 2022 extension, so I\u2019m here to make sure this rise since we are talking about 2041 been important time, because in that present time we\u2019ll be finishing maybe now operating and you wanted to open to it now bring those mines going on production. ","It becomes the largest underground mine in the world and as you have seen we continue engineering which has been in problems. So as you\u2019ve seen from the break actually things we measure the mines and then we made it actually I\u2019ll be thinking on rep and we hope it\u2019s included in next several areas.","Thank you Rick and I\u2019m further see in Q&A.","Richard Adkerson","All right thanks Jim Bob. Turning to Slide 13, operationally we've completed development of access to these underground ore bodies, which includes the deep MLZ zone, which is an extensions of our existing producing underground mine and the development of the Grasberg blockade, which lies underneath the pit and we expect the deep MLZ to start up late this year and so schedule that and Grasberg blockade to now begin production in 2018.","The key development activities have been involved with overflow systems and Grasberg blockade shaft development capital to-date is total $3.3 billion, $2.6 billion net to PT Freeport Indonesia after Rio Tinto\u2019s participation and our share of underground mine developments is expected to average $700 million a year over the next five years. ","And you can see in the chart below when the deep MLZ comes downstream and then the Grasberg Block Cave both these mines have very significant positive grades of copper and gold as does the Grasberg open pit and we expect after we move into the underground 1.5 year large volumes of copper and gold with copper being in the range of 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion and gold 1.4 million to 1.5 million ounces annually from 2019 to 2022, 2018 to 2022.","And now to conclude the opening part of our presentation I would like to focus on our really significant inventory resources on Slide 14. Our company has proved reserves that are based on mine plans of $2 copper of over \u00a3100 billion.","In addition to that, we have mineralized material that is based on 220 copper of an incremental \u00a3100 billion and beyond that we have identified additional resource potential at our existing mines. These are not greenfield projects but places where we already have infrastructure footprint operations of another \u00a3170 million. ","So, we have, as far as we can see in the future opportunities to invest in growth projects when the markets wants it, we\u2019re going to be very prudent about doing that what we can do it in low risk basis and use our track record of successfully doing projects in a consistent way.","When those opportunities warrant themselves and we are working diligently on looking at the next phase of growth projects as we look forward.","With that, Jim Flores is here to talk about oil and gas business.","Jim Flores","Thanks Richard and good morning everyone. I'm on Page 15 of second quarter 2015 oil and gas highlights. Couple of comments. We\u2019ve had a excellent quarter operationally both on the operating side but also on the financial side getting the S1 filed for our potential IPO later this year and that will guide lot of the restrictions on the comments I\u2019ll be able to make today.","But from the operation standpoint, we focused on low risk drilling and Tieback opportunities. As stated here on Page 15, we\u2019ve been 10 for 10 as very successful wells since 2014. This has help to tie in all of our seismic and all the resources that we capture over the last couple of years in the lease sales and also acquisitions. And now we are enjoying bearing the fruits of all that labor.","We\u2019ve placed three wells of production in 2014 and first half of '15 that really impacts production you see. Oil production increased in the second quarter over first quarter because of that activity.","We also cash operating margin has increased mainly due to prices and also lower production cost and we see our production cost of 20.26 a barrel down to 19.04. That trend is going to continue as we continue to add volumes to our fixed infrastructure and our fixed cost structure out there.","And when you look at the economics of our business, it\u2019s worth noting here, that is one of the key metrics when you look at our cash operating margin which is one the industry leading cash operating margin from the standpoint because our cost structure is low but also kind of continue to trend lower.","We\u2019re forecasting $19 to $12 on our alloys over the next four to five years as we continue to ramp up production here and our corporate costs are up $4. We\u2019re probably going to cut those in half. ","So, when you look at that our cash margin has got real opportunity to grow by controlling on the cost side and even in this low price environment from there with our DDNA rate now around $26 and going forward our F&D cost below $25 a barrel.","We\u2019re basically going to build and earn some money even if this $50 oil price. It is going to be much better than 60.65, we are tuning our business for the lower oil prices but as long as it takes before the adjust back to more normalized levels.","Back to the drilling, we continue to get success in a lot of tieback wells going forward to the next 12 months to 2017 and what the investors will get a vision of is as we have we call upon the success is exactly what the timing of that production is coming on. And the aspects of build models is for the value being created with the drill bit here is quite special.","But news is coming for rates been very successful project operated by Anadarko, we have the sister project Hollow Berg coming on mid-2016 it\u2019s on schedule and actually the facility is in place and secured.","We\u2019ve had a successful well with end of Vito basin, which is our Power Nap well and we\u2019ve already spotted an offset opportunity called deep slip that we have high hopes for as well.","Slide 16, the subsea development tie back strategy that\u2019s going to drive a lot of value for our company our investors is off to a great start across the board. And our 100% owned Holstein wall, Horn Mountain, facilities we\u2019ve actually drilled and completed well in each area or couple of wells in each area and tie back wells in to Marlin and also Horn Mountain.","And we also, but we have the big Holstein deep development that we every time back next year in 2016. Over the next two years as we put bring this well along it\u2019s going to require some downtime in each facility in our few weeks whatever to come up and so it will be actually be the following six to 12 months after that you\u2019ll see full production response without any platform interruptions to get all the success churns of the tanks.","And a big thing about our strategy in the deep water that makes us so unique is the timing of these tie backs the cycle time. We\u2019re making discoveries and having full production wells come on like in Dorado three months paid 17 OCG 12 to 18 months and King 9 to 12 months this will accelerate going forward as we get the initial subsea infrastructure place as we had wells and floor lies to the subsea connections, which is much easier to been trying to bring them all with back to platform.","So we\u2019re also running the teams who are all doing great and we\u2019ve overcome any kind of obstacles or challenges so forth and we look like we have some bulls guy he had is force doing something to a more repetitive basis and take some of the risk out of the situation.","In Page 18, Lucius we talked about was great discovery made 2009 it\u2019s up 80,000 barrels a day and about it\u2019s like to processing for to May maybe fill the gas, but about a 100 of that\u2019s ours that we have an interest in. ","And to six Sub Sea wells one depth of the 7200 feet is a real really pushing the more depth out there and it\u2019s just been a fantastic project on time and at cost. And our of our project it seems to be going just the same it\u2019s moved forward a lot of fund Lucius to help this Hollow Berg and so forth and we have a smaller as I said 2.5% but still significant for our 2016 volumes.","We open Page 19, and it kind of showed a near-term growth in 2015, 2016, 2017 from the capital budget we have now production growth is going to be important but muted and from 1.3, 1.51, 1.73, because of timing of spending to accelerate the production and wells we\u2019ve already drilled and that\u2019s one way we\u2019ll double to lay CapEx during this low price environment manage our business.","We\u2019ve been following S1 for the IPO if we raise capital in IPO to accelerate our business then when you look at the higher numbers of 143, 175, and 215, as potential \u2013 potential ForEx as we put on wells faster and we\u2019ve already drilled this year and next.","When you look at page 20, it\u2019s kind of it\u2019s subs of 70 of what prices do at various production rates you can plug in whatever you want you model that where this our cash flows live and so forth.","But this we\u2019re obviously planning on our side operation at the low end and on in the rest of the company is hoping for the high end. So you can look at that you could see they\u2019re growing the volumes does matter it would drop right to the bottom line and it\u2019s going to be a very significant part of our business is getting those lines up to 225.","Part of copying sustaining that or increasing that from that 225 well was at our Valley area we entered the space and post the detail discovery with an 18.67% interest and the detail and we certainly grow the power in that discovery with the 50% working interest we\u2019re very, very excited about that and that we\u2019re drilling the other side of the basin where deep slip as well as well and we should be down sometime this quarter and hope to be in gain results from that going forward.","On page 22, you can see kind of the pipeline we have built of we think are very strong set of projects that we own that are going to move the needle here to company so you can build and keep track of how we\u2019re doing and what projects going forward. Hope to keep the success rate up and drive the size going forward.","Richard turn it back to you on Page 23.","Richard Adkerson","Thanks Jim. Just to update our 2015 outlook our copper sales outlook is the same as last quarter at 4.2 billion pounds, gold at 1.3 million ounces for the year and molybdenum down couple of million pounds.","And with oil equivalents of 52.3 million barrels 67% crude oil. And our unit cost per copper is not changing a $1.53 a pound that will depend on any number of factors including byproduct pricing of which is built into here at 11.50 gold and $6 molybdenum for the rest of the year.","And oil at $19 that would model out with operating cash flows at 250 copper or for $3.6 billion each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year is a $190 million. Capital expenditures have been reduced by a couple of hundred million dollars as we got some capital in our mining business to $6.3 billion for the year.","Our sales profile looking beyond the current year you can see the growth in 2016 and 2017 both from our expansion projects, but also from the high grade that we will be having with our mine plan Grasberg you can see that in the gold sales going to 1.9 million ounces and 2.4 million ounces in 2016 and 2017.","On a quarterly basis on slide 25 as I mentioned earlier we\u2019ll be having higher volumes of copper in the second half of the year strong gold quarters as we take advantage of the grace available to it\u2019s Grasberg and you can see our outlook quarterly for our oil and gas business our molybdenum business.","Slide 26, gives the details of our net unit production cost, which consolidates $1.53 but you can see the strong numbers in Indonesia and Africa and really strong numbers in the Americas as well.","And you can see our sales volumes at the bottom. On the consolidated basis and looking at cash flows we have shown here averages for 2016 and 2017 and showing copper prices ranging from 250 to 350 and EBITDA numbers at 250 copper of $8.5 billion and $11 billion and $3 billion and then with operating cash flows, which would take into account cash taxes, cash interest excluding working capital changes so $6.5 billion for 215, $8.3 million for 350 for $3.","Sensitivity for that are shown or adjusting that as you see that on page 28, and then our capital expenditures are shown on page 29, you can see capital expenditures declining this year from last year and will decline further as we go forward with basically part of level of spending under this plan for our oil and gas business and robbing CapEx in our mining business is complete on making projects.","Our Board is committed to balance sheet management and we got a strong track record of doing that both in good times and times with weak commodity prices we\u2019re able to do this because of our large resource base.","The cash flows that it generates in our capital discipline. We have and we\u2019ll continue to take steps to reduce costs and CapEx look for opportunities to bring values forward through asset sales of course we have suspended our common stock dividend look forward to the time we can store that and company is committed to returning cash to shareholders.","But increasing volume declining CapEx will enhance our credit metrics even in low commodity price environments. We\u2019ve talked about looking for external funding in the oil and gas business due to this IPO that we\u2019ll be considering that has to go through an SEC review process, which we\u2019re making progress with now then give us the opportunity to look to go to markets here in the second half of the year and for other opportunities that might be there as well, we have $3 billion liquidity and as the extra revolving $0.5 billion facility our total debt at the end of the quarter was $20.9 billion with $500 million of cash as I said we looking forward to improving credit metrics.","In conclusion our three priorities are going to be focused in this kind of commodity price environment on protecting our balance sheet, we do that by managing operation in CapEx to maximize cash flows we\u2019re looking for oil and gas funding to take advantage of these near term growth opportunities as Jim talked about completing, we are totally focused on completing our Sierrita project and taking advantage of our expanded operations in Morenci and Tenke Fungurume and generating values in the long run from our large resource base so execution, execution, execution, execution is our focus during this challenging market conditions.","With that, we would like to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Gagliano","Thank you for taking my questions. My first question given the decline across the board in pricing, I'm wondering are you considering additional asset sales in this environment in addition to the energy IPO?","Richard Adkerson","Well we are looking at all alternatives. Assets sales is potentially one, other alternatives will be dialing back some of our operations to reflect the economics of the current environment. For example we are doing that in our molybdenum business were prices are week. We benefit in that marketplace because of our really strong position. 80% of the market right might or the chemical business to focus on that were realization are higher but we may limit molybdenum production in some of our bio product operations in response to prices.","In 2008 we curtailed production at high cost mines to reduce cost and we\u2019re looking at that. Presently all of our mines are positive cash flow generators but if markets deteriorate further we\u2019re prepared to take steps to be responsive to that.","So Dave we\u2019re looking across the board at opportunities, asset sales in the mining business are possibility the markets not great as you can see from recent transactions and with our long term positive view at marketplace that will be taken into account. But all things like that are on the table and under considerations.","David Gagliano","That's helpful. On Indonesia, it's a two-part question. First of all, on the export permit, can you talk us through in the event that it's not renewed, what does happen there given what's happened previously? And then the second part of the question any other dates that we need to be thinking about for Indonesia? I thought that was a labor contract coming due at some point in 2015, that\u2019s it.","Richard Adkerson","All right. Let me start with the labor contract. In Indonesia we have to negotiate new labor contracts every two years that's by law. And so we do have our existing contract expiring and the second half and third quarter and so we are engaged in negotiations with the union now and all reports of those negotiations are going well and we expect to get that contract renewed as we did with our last contract.","And actually as I mentioned labor relations at our operations are really good right now are positive. With the export permit we expect that to be renewed. We met the requirements of the government and the - and then we\u2019re going through the process of working with the government to get that done as we speak so we expect to get it renewed.","It is important to us at the present time without the export permit, of course to be an export and right now the PT smelting, smelter at graphic has faced an operation less user requiring some repairs and is currently shut down.","So it is important us to get this export permit. We believe we got a process going that allow us to do that. It\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interests, government communities, workers, of course our shareholders but that's not to be renewed, expected to be renewed.","David Gagliano","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Tony Rizzuto","Thanks very much. Hi everyone. I wanted to also focus on the cash burn just to follow up on Dave's question a little bit. I was very pleased to hear you Richard mentioned about throttling back possibly in the production side and asset sales as well. Do you have any further flexibility in terms of capital spending and also what about the possible equity issuances beyond oil and gas IPO? How would you view those other options or are the options?","Richard Adkerson","Well, as I said all auctions were on the table, none of us, want to sell equity at this stock price, I mean you know that\u2019s not something that any of us as shareholders and as you know we are all shareholders would want to do. Hopefully the board is going to protect the balance sheet so we are going to look at all options and see what we might need to do that.","As we look forward in running our business, we are going to be prepared to be add to be consistent with what the market brings to us. So if in fact prices do deteriorate, we have flexibility in our business because certain costs both in the mining and in the oil and gas business and we will have contingency plans that allow us to do that.","So we are optimistic about markets longer run prepared to deal with short runs uncertainty, prepared to bridge our business if we have to do it and operationally we have the capability to doing in it, and Tony I know I don\u2019t need to remind you just how effective we were in doing that in 2008 and 2009.","Tony Rizzuto","I think that would be well received if that was possibly joined in terms of efforts to throttle back on output because the market surplus at least what the consultants are saying right now might not be that much out of whack and if there were some movement sooner rather than later it might help the market from getting too far out of whack. I think that would be well received.","The other question I had was on Indonesia and there some reports have indicated recently that you guys have agreed to a transition from a COW to a special mining license and I guess first of these reports accurate? If you could help us understand what the main differences might be between the COW and the special mining license, what the new license arrangement wouldn't afford you similar levels of protection or might it be more subject to more frequent changes? Is there anything you can comment on at this point?","Richard Adkerson","There has been a wide range of options that been discussed with the government and different ideas have been raised for consideration at different times. There has not been a decision to convert from the contract to a mining license if that were to be done and I\u2019m not suggesting that its likely but that were to be done we would have, it would be done on the basis of having an accompanying contract that would give us the kind of assurances on fiscal terms and legal terms that we would require.","So that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on is how to we have a preservations of our rights to operate beyond the primary term by existing COW, it had a 20 year provision for continued operations and then to ensuring that the terms fiscally and legally that we have beyond the COW through an extension of the COW give us the degree of assurance.","And we've indicated a degree of flexibility in working with government so long that's achievable. Achieving that within the framework of the existing laws and regulations in the country is complicated and probably the most straight forward way would be to find a way of reaching a mutual agreement on continuing the COW, but we've expressed that we would be flexible in dealing with that so long as we could achieve our fundamental objectives of assurance about operating rights, fiscal terms, legal enforceability for the long run.","Tony Rizzuto","Is an additional sell down of the stake in PTFI, is that also part and parcel part of this, these discussions as well?","Richard Adkerson","Absolutely, I mean, a year ago we signed a memorandum of understanding that covered six points that we indicated would be prepared to go forward with in conjunction, achieving the continued rights to operate with the assurance of terms that I just mentioned.","And one of those is that we agreed that we would agree to sell an incremental interest in PTFI's equity to get up to a 30% Indonesian ownership. Right now the government owns 9.36%. We agreed to do that provided we had the extension of our contract and acceptable terms and that would be done at fair market value. But that was part of the memorandum of understanding that we've been had with the government now for roughly a year.","Tony Rizzuto","Right, understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Gambardella","Yes, good morning Richard. Just a follow up question on Tony's, on Grasberg and the contract. Is it your understanding that or the Company's understanding that you will not go forward without some type of whether it's the COW, hybrid between the COW and the licensing agreement. But that one provision that you need is some certainty of operations through 2041?","Richard Adkerson","Yes, that's right Mike. Because right now more than 75% of our reserves is going to be produced after 2021, and so these investments that we're making right now to develop the underground and we've agreed to develop smelting capacity, all of that is for the benefit of operations beyond 2021.","So, we need to have that rights, those rights under acceptable terms to justify the investments that we've already made in the continued investments. And the government understands that and that's what we're are working to deal with. And the complication has been, how do you do that in the context of the current laws and regulations in Indonesia and how that interrelates to our contractual rights? But that's a necessary element.","Michael Gambardella ","I mean, what's the government's response when you tell them that your contract that you signed back in 1991, supersedes any changes in Indonesian government law?","Richard Adkerson","There is an issue with the public perception of how the contract interact with the laws. The legal situation is clear cut, and so we have opted and I really believe this is the right answer, and our Board, Jim Bob fully supported is that we will be much better suited if we can find the way of dealing with this in a cooperative fashion that is responsive to the public opinion and aspirations of the government rather than just digging our heels and saying the contracts, contract.","Mike, we've been through this before in other countries and other places, and so that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to achieve our objectives in a way that's cooperative, that preserves the partnership, and that is sensitive to government officials, who are subject to elections and in a democratic process they have to be sensitive to public opinion.","Jim Bob Moffett","Mike, this is Jim Bob. Let me just comment on a couple of thing. As you've seen in the press in the last couple of days, the government has indicated that they're going to extend our contract and they're going to use [indiscernible] because as a matter of fact when the MOU expires at July 27, two days from now, the new COW is what becomes the controlling document.","[Indiscernible] as you've seen in some of the government announcements, it basically says that we have not changed anything. And the reason that we are offsetting our current is before we make any kind of concessions or the government makes any kind of concessions we're trying to end up with a win-win situation and that's where this thing is headed.","Michael Gambardella ","One last question on Grasberg. On Slide 29 of your presentation today, where you talked about the CapEx for the Company going through 2017. I'm assuming that does not include any assumptions for new smelter in Indonesia, is that correct?","Richard Adkerson","That's correct Mike. The new smelter would involve and aggregate investment of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, and we are working on a structure that would involve project financings for it, as we did with the smelter that we built in the mid 1990s and also the potential involvement of other partners in it, but that is not included in our CapEx numbers.","The bulk of that CapEx will be spent beyond 2016, 2017, because we'll do substantial work between now and then, but a lot of that work would be done on site preparation, their substantial amount of reclamation of land and preparation of the building sites because this would be located in Eastern Java in the Gresik area, near our existing smelter and the fertilizer operations in Fertilizer Company.","Michael Gambardella ","From the estimated $2 billion to $2.5 billion cost, and then using as you said bringing in partners, project financing, how low can you get that down for report. Can you get it down to $0.5 billion?","Richard Adkerson","Let me do some calculations in my head. I was going to just answer, as low as we can get it. I mean, we're going do it as low as we can get it. If we say - yeah, that could be in that range -- to be in that range.","Now also not included Mike, is also the proceeds that would come to us from these divestments that we talked about. I mean, we're talking about a substantial value for just over 20% interest in PTFI, and that would occur over time but those proceeds are also not included in our outlook numbers.","Michael Gambardella ","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.","Brian Yu","Thanks. Well, I also got a question on Indonesia. Richard, I think in the past you guys have laid out numbers about the financial benefits to Indonesia under the COW, and then under the new mining laws. And as you guys are going through the discussions, as we look at the possible financial impact, if you were switching to the new mining laws, is it still correct that financially there would not be material impact between royalties, tax rates, and other pieces to those?","Richard Adkerson","Yes. Well, when they talk about going to the new mining law they are insisting that we continue with our current 35% income tax rate which is higher than the general income tax rate in Indonesia of 25%.","Beginning last year we need to pay the higher royalties under the mining law to get the export ban out of the way, so the financial impact right now would be essentially the same that we've had under the COW. The issue for us is to fix these terms so that we would not be subject to imposing incremental taxes either by the duties, either by the central government or the provincial government.","So, we now haven't been arguing about increasing fiscal terms for the government, we all kind of agree on that. The issue for us is okay, we agree to this, this is what we live with going forward and not be subject to potential imposition of new taxes roll over these duties and fees by the succeeding governments over a long-term.","And when you look at our deal with Indonesia, where the government now gets 60% of the benefits, the financial benefits, that's stronger than kind of anywhere else in the world, by international standards this is a very positive deal for the government in Indonesia.","Brian Yu","Okay. And second question maybe, switching topics, page 19, where you've outlined the potential growth on the energy aspects. So what's the incremental capital that would be required to get to 215,000 barrels per day?","And then along those same lines I think, it was counted that you would do it only if the IPO is successful. Is there -- would you have to raise more the ones required to bridge the existing free cash flow short fall or is there some number that we can guide or you can guide us to, to figure out when you might go forward with more accelerated rate?","Jim Flores","Brian, this is Jim. I think the question is one and the same, right? It's what the capital it's going to take to get to 215,000 [indiscernible] it's somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion depending on what and how we time everything of additional proceeds to get there.","So if we don't hit 2015, and if we only raise $500 million, and we want to face in the spending and we want to hit 215,000in 2018, we can time that as well. So we got a lot of flexibility as to how much we raise and how much and how fast we spend it, but to support this plan is between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion.","Brian Yu","Yes I think. So, if I understand correctly is the fund, let's say that the IPO order go through whatever funds that'll be raised would be targeted towards growing production not necessarily kind of bridging the existing free cash flow short fall, that correct?","Jim Flores","Well, the aspects of that, it would allow us to spend that money earlier and get the production up and you would have a lot less free cash flow short fall with 215,000 to 225,000 barrels a day and therefore the free cash flow short fall be a lot smaller.","Brian Yu","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Oscar Cabrera","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. As you're saying, with oil and gas as we may, Jim you commented that you can get your operating cost in your oil and gas operations down for $12 BOE, what level of production would you need to get to those \u2013 that number?","Jim Flores","About 250,000 barrels a day. And the key about that Oscar, is where that production comes from. Well, it comes up from our existing 100% oil platforms that has the highest or the most dramatic impact lowering the LOE cost. Obviously we\u2019re just doing division there with higher volumes versus the same cost structure and that's where we've focused all our dollars.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay. And then got to ask a question on Grasberg. There is a comment on the -- on your press release that says that you may reduce further for investment activity. Any negotiations on the amendment of the contract of work?","Would you just put context from that, would these be if there's no resolution by the July 25th deadline how are you thinking about this?","Jim Flores","The comment is just a statement of fact that without resolution of the long-term situation we would be faced with discontinuing spending money for that long-term production needs.","And so that's what we've been trying to avoid, that's not in our interest, our workforce interest, the local community's interest or the government's interest. So that's just a consequence of what would happen if we have a failure in getting this resolved. We believe we'll get it resolved as Jim Bob said, the government is saying we're going to get it resolved, so that's -- we believe that's what will happen.","And so far we continue to progress our development activities based on our confidence that we'll get it resolved.","Oscar Cabrera","Thanks for leveraging. Just one more thing, if I may. In your development topic, $3.3 billion, that increased a little bit from the previous quarter and some of the projects -- the development projects around the world, CapEx has been coming down, is there any reason for the increase, anything to do with the metallurgy or the something that's happening in the underground that increased in the CapEx there?","Kathleen Quirk ","Oscar, are you referring to $3.3 billion that was incurred today, what number are you referring to?","Oscar Cabrera","This is the slide where you quote the amount of money that you're spending per year, so $700 million now, was $600 million last quarter.","Kathleen Quirk ","Yeah, There was some timing changes in some of the underground spend and it worked out from a rounding standpoint to get from $600 million to $700 million, but there was no material change in any of the plans.","And the progress on the underground development continues to go very well and that's achieving what we have set out to achieve in terms of the development. But there has been no significant changes from last quarter, just some timing things that came into the five years and some rounding changes.","Oscar Cabrera","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos","Thank you very much for the generous call and the length of the call and accepting my question. Concerning the Grasberg contract negotiations, is there any guidance concerning the proceeds from the government stepping up to 20% or FCX get any cash to make it down on the debt, or would that be financed by an earn out or a loan from FCX to the government?","And secondly, could you talk a little bit about the $1.2 mining CapEx budgeted for projects for 2017, does that equal $0.7 million for Grasberg underground, and then where would the other pieces of it be? And thirdly, could you tell us what are the bigger bites in $2.9 billion oil and gas CapEx, say in 2017?","Jim Flores","Okay, let\u2019s start with the questions in order that you raised. On divestiture, there is a process that is established in Indonesia, of where incremental interest would first be offered to the government as you suggested, it would not be all at onetime, but it would be done in steps.","And any transaction John, with the government would be a cash transaction, where we will not be providing financing. If the government opts not to buy the shares itself and that may well occur, we have talked with the government about the possibility of having an IPO of PTFI shares on the Indonesian stock exchange.","And that would be a standard IPO that would be syndicated and we would receive the cash proceeds from that. We've also talked about the possibility of having some interest not -- certainly not 20% interest, but some smaller piece of that perhaps going to the provincial government in some sort of trust form and we might drive some financing for that piece.","Otherwise, other Indonesian investors might have an interest in doing and those would be on of cash business to business type basis.","Kathleen Quirk","John it's Kathleen. The second part of your question regarding - ","Richard Adkerson","John is that covered?","John Tumazos","That's very helpful. Thanks you.","Kathleen Quirk","I was going to say on the CapEx, in addition to those underground development spend we also have couple $100 million for the smelter expansion at Miami and then we\u2019ve also got in our plans to commence the stripping for the Lone Star project which would extend the life of the Lone Star oxide which would extend the life of Stafford.","So we\u2019ve got some stripping costs reflected in 2017 as well and those are the three major components of that number.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Jim Flores","All right, John on the oil and gas side, this is Jim, you\u2019ve got to buy the 7 billion in Marlin and Horn Mountain, Holstein which is three key projects most of that\u2019s but half of Marlin in the second half split between Marlin Holstein. They spend about $300 million in California and about $650 million in the Vito basin and then a couple $100 million, $100 million which is another $90 million in our gas business.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Jim Flores","And then you got a corporate allocation of about $220 million on top of that get, up to the 2.9.","John Tumazos","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian MacArthur","Hi good morning. Sorry to go back to Grasberg again. I have the same question John did. If you did understand if you did a provincial thing it might like to [indiscernible] was done in the past so that\u2019s the only piece that you would actually potentially provide financing and then the rest would just be either sell down to whoever either the government or someone else were add that timing we get cash in and if that didn\u2019t work, that\u2019s when you go to the public markets and just take whatever the valuation was at the time.","Richard Adkerson","No, in this is still working progress Brian, but we and government officials for sometime have seen the benefit of the public market listing that would first of all Indonesia\u2019s stock exchange has developed into a active traded fair marketplace and we all see mutual benefits of having PTFI listed as an Indonesian company on that exchange provided we get a fair market value which you could in that marketplace.","So we think that would probably be something that we would pursue with the government following the government\u2019s decision own its owned desires for investing in the shares itself.","Brian MacArthur","Okay. So really the concept of just giving money to the provincial come out like probably very low on it, so you are really thinking about anyway you do it would be cash in the door, right away at the time.","Richard Adkerson","For the bulk of what we\u2019re talking about if our community relation situation and again to be response aspirations of the province, we can see some benefits of working on a structured deal with the province. From that standpoint for our portion of this interest and but that all has to remained to be worked out.","The province has indicated to us they might to provide third party financing for that. We and the central government want to ensure that if we do a deal with province its benefits the people, the province itself and not any third party investor so all of that has to be factored into the process.","Brian MacArthur","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Steve Bristo","Thanks. Did I hear Jim Bob right that you guys expect to reach an agreement on a contractor work and also those permits to the next couple of days?","Jim Bob Moffett","That's exactly right. Let me just read you can look it up. It talks about the investment that we're going to be making and extending the contract for another 20years. This is probably for the minister. The minister cited said earlier the government of Indonesia does not have any intention to terminate the contract after 2021.","The government we both have tried to get the agreement outlined here and if you go down to the next 2015, the Indonesian financed today which is Bloomberg announcement it says the administer once again for a point has a valid contract until 2021.","The President said prepare for an investment that could. The answer is the reason why I'm trying to measure my words in negotiations is really hard on a call like this to talk about negotiations. But the answer is public statements are using what the government has done and you can verify that they want us to continue and we obviously have every reason to continue under proper terms. ","The proper terms are going to be we need to get the terms continuously the contract whether you talk about a mining license or COW. We need to have that's why I'm staying here to make sure that we accomplish that.","Steve Bristo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Sussman","Yes, just going back to Slide 19 and whether or not you go through with the incremental, I think you said $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in CapEx to potentially accelerate drilling. Is this more about how much money you might raise an IPO or more about where oil prices are accommodation of both?","Jim Flores","Well, this would be - me and my team's third IPO. It's about to solicit funds and to attract investors they got to get return to that new capital coming in at door. So the aspect is going to have growth component but what we're basically able to do is accelerate putting this wells on and create more cash flow at the company warrant.","I think the investors will have a positive look on the oil prices longer term with respective of whatever oil prices are at the time in the IPO. I mean its \u2013 sense lower \u2013 because higher feature and so the aspect of that is if you look at higher volumes and better prices, I mean by 2017 cash flow neutral is a reality.","If you look at lower prices longer and higher volumes you\u2019re going to push out of 2018. So this really going to be how you look at the business and your view point going forward as far as what the investor appetite is. When it comes to size, we can sell up to 19.9% of the business and still achieve our objectives here at Freeport.","So if we sell 8% of the business, 10%, 12%, 15% based on price and that amount of capital will regulate how our business will be on going forward to make sure we get into a cash neutral situation.","Jeremy Sussman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just may be just fair potential update on timing of when you might look to do this?","Jim Flores","We're still hoping this fall. Like Richard said it's up to be SEC. They've been going back and forth on our document and we're making progress there. So everything looks like it's on track to be available. Obviously market conditions will be something that we'll be watching. We're looking at this fall, I guess this is an answer.","Jeremy Sussman","Great, thanks very much and good luck.","Operator","We will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks.","Richard Adkerson","Well, thanks everyone for joining us today and we look forward to making progress in all the issues we talked about today. If you have further questions please contact David and he will that you get your answers. Thanks for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
