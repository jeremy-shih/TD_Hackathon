For those who need to reference today\u2019s press release, you will find it at investors.nike.com.","Leading today\u2019s call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC including forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.\u2019s continuing operations including equipment; NIKE Golf, Converse, and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.","Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE\u2019s Web site, investors.nike.com.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Treasurer.","Kelley Hall","Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE\u2019s fiscal 2016 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today\u2019s call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release which was issued about an hour ago and at our Web site investors.nike.com.","Joining us on today\u2019s call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand, and finally you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion, who will give you an in depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We\u2019d like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we\u2019d appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that aren\u2019t covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thank you for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Kelley and hello everyone. Before we get into today\u2019s results, I want to acknowledge the tragic events that took place in Brussels. We are thankful that all local NIKE employees and those traveling to the area are accounted for and safe. I know I speak for everyone on this and to the call, when I say our hearts go out to the victims and the families of those impacted by today\u2019s attacks.","Getting back to the results, NIKE delivered another strong quarter in Q3 with balanced growth across our expansive powerful portfolio. By the numbers, here the highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8% to $8 billion. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 14%.Gross margin was 45.9% flat to prior year and earnings per share increased 22% to $0.55.","The foundation for NIKE\u2019s success and one of our greatest competitive advantages, is our complete offense. It\u2019s what gives us the power to use our size and scale to accelerate growth and the flexibility to stay nimble and fast.","Through our complete offense, we serve a wide range of athletes personally across 13 categories, six geographies, men\u2019s, women\u2019s and young athletes, up and down the price points, in wholesale, owned retail and online.","Our complete offense also creates a culture of shared innovation within NIKE where we turn insights from one sport into breakthroughs for all athletes, as we\u2019re dealing with footwear platforms like Flyknit, Lunarlon, and Air or apparel with Dri-FIT and Tech Pack.","And it allows us to create and curate a targeted mix of products, services, and environments into amazing retail experiences for consumers. We develop new concepts and collaborate with our wholesale partners to bring them to life in completely new ways around the world.","The complete offense is our proven game plan to drive long-term profitable growth, and it\u2019s never been as powerful as it is today. For example, we\u2019re seeing strong growth in China and Western Europe as well as in our global women\u2019s business and the Running category. We are creating deeper and more meaningful connections with our consumers through all of our dimensions from competition to training to sportswear.","At the same time, the complete offense also allows us to manage through volatility and take important actions to sustain the momentum in our business. It\u2019s how we ensure a healthy marketplace, so we can continue to deliver all of the amazing products we\u2019ve on the horizon to our consumers.","Our relentless flow of innovation is one of the reasons I remain so confident in NIKE\u2019s future. You know I\u2019d like to talk about the innovation pipeline and often all I can say is stay tuned. Well last week we gave the world a view into just some of what we\u2019ve in that pipeline for 2016 and beyond.","Let me take you through some of the concepts that will redefine how NIKE serves the athlete. In running, the Air VaporMax gives runner -- runners an amazing lightweight, high performance ride with the most complete and visually stunning NIKE Air Sole cushioning system ever.","The LunarEpic creates a new fit and sensation with a mid-height stretch Flyknit collar, laser-cut Lunarlon sidewalls and cushioning pods creating a whole new look and feel for performance running. Launched earlier this month, runners are giving us great feedback and consumer response has been very strong.","The Free RN Motion delivers our most natural ride yet with a new outsole design that expands in multiple directions when the foot strikes the ground. And in football, AntiClog Traction solves the major problem athletes have always faced, and that\u2019s mud sticking to their cleats. It removes weight and provides premium traction no matter the conditions.","The new Mercurial Superfly is the boot for the fastest players. For the new lightweight plate for better power transfer and texture mapping across the forefoot for enhanced ball control. And in basketball, the Air Zoom KD9 features a new Flyknit technology that combines lockdown fit with enhanced natural movement. And a full length Zoom Air is more responsive than ever for one of the games most explosive players, Kevin Durant.","And we brought Flyknit to one of basketball\u2019s greatest icons with the Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit, a design that\u2019s half the way to be original with added cushioning for incredible comfort.","We unveiled auto adaptive lacing with the NIKE HyperAdapt 1.0, the first step into the future of adaptive performance. It\u2019s a concept that embodies one of NIKE\u2019s most ambitious dreams and just a glimpse of what to come with products that sense and adapt with the body.","And finally we took off the incredible sports moments ahead of us this summer by unveiling bold National Olympic uniforms across track and field, basketball and football. Each features our new AeroSwift technology and breaks new ground in lightweight breathability, mobility and comfort.","All told, the two-day event was NIKE\u2019s most powerful display of innovation yet. The greatest sports moments are when we deliver our best for the athlete. We turn their insights into amazing breakthroughs and scale them across our diverse portfolio of categories. It\u2019s how we turn the energy of sport into momentum for our business for years to come.","We also thought -- know finding new ways to serve the athlete is key to our future growth. Today our consumers are more connected than ever before. They\u2019re demanding and their needs change everyday. Last week we introduced the solution with the new NIKE+ app, a personal service for athletes.","The NIKE+ app brings together on demand coaching, a personal store, and amazing experiences, all through one mobile access point. Through NIKE+ we offer training programs that adapt to your changing schedule and performance, syncing performance data directly from the NIKE+ app in a range of partner devices and we send reserve invitations guaranteeing our most coveted sneakers, and we\u2019ve gear up packs tailored just for you that get you started on a new goal or a new sport.","The new NIKE+ app makes it all easy and personal and puts all at your fingertips. It\u2019s the key to building deep and rich relationships with the athlete in this new era of personalized performance. And not only does digital create connections with the athlete, it also accelerates our business end-to-end.","For Q3 NIKE.com delivered another impressive quarter with growth at 56% fueled by growth in both traffic and conversion. NIKE.com allows us to expand our brand and deepen our relationships in new markets. We continue to add new countries every quarter to our NIKE.com platform and its driving growth around the world.","It\u2019s so energizing to see all we\u2019re delivering to make the athlete better. And last week was more than just moment in time. It\u2019s the blueprint for how NIKE will serve the athlete into the future. NIKE is built for growth for the long-term. We\u2019ve a winning strategy that puts the consumer in the center of everything we do, an unmatched global footprint that is fueling a growing moment of sports around the world and the imagination and creative power that can deliver real innovation at unprecedented scale.","NIKE has never been in a better position to deliver against our long-term goals. I\u2019m inspired by the work that we\u2019re doing, the management team and the people they lead are the best in the industry. And that\u2019s critical, because the changes we\u2019re seeing in the world are fast and massive, and so are the opportunities. And that\u2019s what makes me as confident as ever in NIKE\u2019s future. Thanks and here is Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another strong quarter of growth and profitability, as our innovative products and compelling consumer connections continue to drive growth.","On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue increased 15%, with double-digit growth across all geographies and nearly all key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue grew 29%, driven by 56% growth in online sales, 10% comp store growth and new store growth and finally Global Futures grew 17%. These strong results are driven as always by our relentless focus on the consumer.","Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting edge products, engaging experiences and powerful retail presentations. NIKE\u2019s ability to deliver on all three strengthens our position as the brand of choice and builds our business around the world. To view how all these three come to life, you\u2019ve to look no further than basketball where we were on a two category offense across NIKE basketball and the Jordan Brand.","Our long history of success in NIKE basketball comes from creating the most innovative and exciting products. Thanks to the insights and inspiration from our great athletes. We saw tremendous sell-through of the Kyrie 2, which features a first of its kind contoured midsole and outsole designed to enhance banking and cutting on the court. And the Kobe 11 was incredibly popular offering high performance and lightweight design in a progressive low top that distills Kobe\u2019s signature legacy to its very essence. Looking forward, I\u2019m very excited about what\u2019s to come in NIKE basketball.","As we gear up for Kobe\u2019s retirement, he will continue to inspire innovative products for years to come. We\u2019ve already started celebrating his career with a monochromatic, retro collection called the Black Mamba Pack. I\u2019m also incredibly excited about the signature basketball performance products that are coming including the new KD9 that we introduced last week.","The KD9 is just one example of the new signature basketball designs in our pipeline that we\u2019re bringing to the markets to continue to drive this important and vibrant category. And as always, we will amplify the category with innovative sport -- new sportswear styles, like the reimagined Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit.","All these products come to life in powerful retail experiences from our own DTC doors to key partner executions like Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops and these stores express a deep love of basketball serving those who share and fuel that passion for the game.","As the Jordan Brand expands as a standalone category, its global revenues remain incredibly strong, up double digits again this quarter. The Air Jordan XXX continues to fulfill its promise of offering the next frontier of flight and we\u2019re seeing strong sell-through in the market. The shoe offers the apex of Jordan\u2019s evolution both as a player and a design collaborator, as the shoe features performance insights and design inspirations from Michael.","And impressively the 72-10 colorway of the Air Jordan XI was the largest launch ever in the history of NIKE.com, breaking sales and traffic records. With this launch, we doubled NIKE.com\u2019s previous largest launch ever. This also -- this was also a quarter that proves yet again how powerful the energy is when NIKE basketball and the Jordan Brand team, team up.","The NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto was a full of the kind of -- was full of kind of superior execution that only NIKE and the Jordan Brand can do. That includes exclusive experiences for basketball fans, premium product launches, and a massive roster of the games best players, highlighted that we can\u2019t by the all inspiring dunk contest featuring Zach Levine and Aaron Gordon, two of NIKE\u2019s young and exciting players.","Overall, throughout that weekend, I was -- as I walk through Toronto, I was blown away by the visible excitement for the game as NIKE basketball and the Jordan Brand helped ignite the culture of basketball around the world. As we continue to experience the excitement of March Madness, and the NBA Playoffs and the Rio Olympics, that enthusiasm for the game will just continue to build.","Next, NIKE Women\u2019s which has seen its 9th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth as the business continues to outpace our Men's business. We\u2019ve seen consistent growth in our women\u2019s business, because we know this athlete is demanding more from brands, across products, across services, and across experiences. And we\u2019re there every step of the way throughout that journey, serving her completely through her run, train, and live lifestyle. But we also know that these are no longer separate categories for athletes.","More and more women are blending running, fitness, and sports style in their lives, and this shift is fundamental to how this business operates, so expanding our focus on product to include services and experiences. With and new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we\u2019ve elevated the quality and the technical innovation of our products. For example, our Power Speed Running Tight and our Zoned It Sculpt Training Tight provide compressive feel with every move to support her key muscle groups. And in footwear, our popular Metcon 2 is designed for high intensity training with just the right amount of stability and flexibility as she works out.","This quarter also saw the acceleration of our highly successful Better For It campaign, in which we invite each athlete to push herself out of her comfort zone by providing personal motivation and rich community to help her meet her goals. And we released the Margot versus Lily Web Series inviting women to challenge themselves and celebrate their victories. The response has been extraordinary with 80 million views to date.","We\u2019ve also seen a considerable increase in downloads of the NIKE+ Run Club and the NIKE+ Training Club with members becoming more active and buying more. Thanks in part to the links in each episode to the products worn by the characters. As Mark mentioned, these services are still just the tip of the iceberg, given the incredible promise of the new NIKE+ app and the expanded digital services.","Let me now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered strong growth in the quarter with revenues up 14%, driven by sportswear, Jordan, Running and Men's training. We are seeing positive consumer response to our execution with wholesale partner such as Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 25%, led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com.","As we discussed in last quarter, we\u2019ve been working to efficiently clear excess inventory in North America and we\u2019ve made good progress in Q3. The flow of products through our newly expanded North American distribution network is no normalizing. We prioritize liquidation through our factory stores and we\u2019re selectively utilizing third-party value channels. And as always, we\u2019re actively managing the flow of product into the inline marketplace to ensure a healthy pull market as we end fiscal year \u201916.","We remain focused on what is most important to our long-term strategy, serving the consumer. The NIKE Brand and its deep connection to consumers remained incredibly strong. And we\u2019re confident that the actions we\u2019re taking will ensure that we\u2019ve the capacity to deliver new, innovative products into the marketplace. Innovations like those Mark talked about.","We see tremendous long-term potential for North America, and we look forward to delivering even more innovative products and services to best serve our consumers in this important geography.","Next, Western Europe, our second largest geography which delivered 12% revenue growth in the quarter. It\u2019s clear the decisions we made to accelerate the category offense in Western Europe are paying off. As we continue to see momentum driven by sportswear, Jordan, as well as young athletes.","This growth was led by footwear, where we\u2019re seeing great sell-through in some of NIKE\u2019s iconic remastered styles, such as the Huarache Run Ultra and the Evergreen Classics like the Cortez. We are also seeing great momentum in apparel as we fuel sports style innovation to the newly launched Technic Collection, and throughout our broader Tech Fleece product line. We continue to see tremendous growth potential in Western Europe and look forward to the excitement created this summer with the 2016 European Championships.","Let\u2019s now take a look at the emerging markets, which delivered revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Strong growth was led by double-digit growth in SOCO, and growth in our key categories such as Sportswear, Running, Global Football and Women\u2019s training.","In Brazil, the work we\u2019ve done to reset the marketplace is paying dividends. We are seeing strong results in retail concepts that we developed with our strategic wholesale partners and our own DTC business continues to accelerate. Despite the macroeconomic trends in the territory, we\u2019re headed into the Rio Olympics with plenty of brand momentum. Inventory levels are healthy, our market share is increasing and we\u2019ve the pipeline of innovative products coming in this Olympics year.","Finally, Greater China, which continues to see strong marketplace momentum and very healthy growth despite macroeconomic uncertainty. China grew an incredible 27% this quarter, fueled in part by the continued strength of the NIKE Brand. The success we\u2019re seeing in China today stems from decisions we made to align our teams against the biggest opportunities, driving growth in key categories of sportswear, Running, Jordan, and Nike basketball. We are seeing incredibly strong growth in DTC with NIKE.com leading the way.","Demand during the Chinese New Year surpassed anything we\u2019ve ever seen before, and we operated with sharp precision to drive conversion to capitalize on that demand across all of our DTC dimensions. And successes by our key partners such as Bai Li and Pou Sheng continue to reflect the consumer demand with the reprofiled doors outpacing the rest of the fleet. Ultimately Greater China demonstrates our ability to execute our strategies and operationalize them at world-class levels.","Looking forward, I\u2019m confident in what the NIKE Brand is bringing to consumers, and the connections we\u2019re making with them. I like where we\u2019re and better yet. I like where we\u2019re headed. Thanks. Now here is Andy.","Andy Campion","Thanks, Mark and Trevor and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate first the power of NIKE\u2019s uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses. And second, the virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE\u2019s long-term financial model.","As Mark said, running a complete offense is one of NIKE\u2019s many competitive advantages. We continually push ourselves to sharpen our game and better serve consumers in every dimension of our business around the world. That said, not every dimension of our portfolio will have the same level of momentum in each and every period. But as we relentlessly strive to run a complete offense, we do sustain strong momentum in the vast majority of our businesses while also acting quickly to turn challenges into opportunities in other dimensions. That portfolio dynamic is how NIKE, Inc. consistently delivers strong top line growth year-after-year.","In the third quarter, we again delivered strong growth with revenue up 14% on a currency neutral basis. All geographies grew double-digits with Greater China continuing to set the pace. On that note, I was just in China three weeks ago, and I can sum up my visit in one word, amazing. Our brand and business in China have never been stronger. And we continue to build momentum. That\u2019s not by accident.","Our focus in China has been on fueling greater sport participation and love for sport, while also transforming the consumer experience along category lines both in store and online. We are now seeing increasingly deeper passion for sport in China and that is translating into strong demand for our products across multiple categories from NIKE basketball to Jordan, to Running, to Men's and Women\u2019s training.","To serve that fast growing demand, our team in China has already created some of the most compelling, new NIKE retail experiences in the world, both on and partnered. We see tremendous opportunity ahead in China and we will continue investing to sustain our strong momentum in this important geography.","That brings me to my second point. The virtuous cycle of growth and investment that fuels NIKE\u2019s financial model. Growth creates the capacity to invest. And as we prioritize our investments, innovation will always be at the top of NIKE\u2019s list. Last week\u2019s innovation summit we showcased what we mean when we say NIKE will bring a relentless flow of innovation to serve the athlete and consumer.","As Mark detailed, we revealed a series of innovations that we expect to fuel growth across our global portfolio over the long-term, ranging from adaptive and other new footwear technologies to new systems of performance in apparel to the new NIKE+ application, which will deliver the best of NIKE personalized at your fingertips.","While investing in innovation is our top priority. We also use our investment capacity to surgically edit and shift within our portfolio to ensure that we remain on the offense with consumers. For example, as we noted last quarter, our inventory levels in North America are somewhat elevated primarily due to protracted challenges we\u2019ve experienced in our supply chain, dating back to the West Coast port congestion and as we expanded distribution center capacity in Memphis.","So, we\u2019re taking action to ensure appropriate capacity in our full price in line channels for fresh new product including the innovation we shared last week. The investments associated with those actions include: one, investing in our supply chain to ramp up capacity and enhance the flow of product to consumers. And two, absorbing a negative mix impact on gross margin that comes with expeditiously clearing excess inventory.","In short, our consistently strong top line growth expands our capacity to invest for the long-term while also delivering appropriate financial performance in the short-term. That is the virtuous cycle that fuels NIKE\u2019s long-term financial model.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn to a more detailed review of our Q3 financial results. Q3 revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 14% on a currency neutral basis. And after taking into account significant currency headwinds, revenue grew 8% on a reported basis.","On a currency-neutral basis, the NIKE Brand grew 15%, while Converse revenue declined 5%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, reflecting continued strong demand for the NIKE Brand around the world, driven by a 10% increase in units with increases in average selling prices contributing seven percentage points of growth.","Futures in all geographies grew at a double-digit rate. On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, taking into account the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.","Q3 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.55, despite significant headwinds from FX. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, a lower tax rate, and a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding.","Gross margin was flat to prior year at 45.9% at higher average selling prices and continued growth in our higher margin DTC business was offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, higher warehousing costs, and the mixed impact associated with inventory management in North America.","Q3 gross margin was somewhat better than we expected 90 days ago, as a result of higher full priced gross margin and also slightly better than expected off price gross margin. As Our inventory management efforts in North America were more weighted to our NIKE factory stores as compared to lower margin third-party channels in the quarter.","Q3 demand creation increased 10% for the quarter in support of key brand initiatives, such as Super Bowl 50, and our women\u2019s Better For It and Margot versus Lily campaigns.","Operating overheads leveraged for the quarter at 7%, driven by strong operational and financial discipline, focusing our investments on our highest priorities, while preserving capacity to invest in the opportunities that lie ahead.","Our effective tax rate was 16.3% for Q3, lower than the prior year, primarily due to a higher mix of non U.S earnings which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. The accelerated recognition of foreign tax credits, adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year, and the retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the U.S R&D tax credit.","As of February 29, our inventories were up 8%, driven by a 4% increase in NIKE Brand wholesale units, growth in our DTC business and increases in average cost -- product costs per unit, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Now let\u2019s turn to a review of our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong revenue growth across nearly all categories and continued strong growth in our DTC businesses led by nike.com.","Futures also grew 10% in North America, reflecting strong consumer demand for the new innovative products that we\u2019re bringing to market. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 13% and EBIT increased 9% as revenue growth and operating overhead leverage were partially offset by higher demand creation spending and a decline in gross margin.","As the impact of our inventory management actions offset full price gross margin expansion. In Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in all territories, reflecting continued expansion of the category offense. Nearly our key categories grew led by strong growth in sportswear and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 2% and EBIT remain flat due to significant foreign currency headwinds.","In Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue grew 29% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth in nearly all territories. Most key categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running, and Global Football. Revenue growth in the quarter also benefited from a comparison to the prior year when import delays in turkey resulted in product, plan, for sale in Q3 actually being sold in Q4.","On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 12%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies, EBIT increased 33%, driven by double-digit revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage.","In Greater China, again we continue to deliver extraordinary growth, with Q3 revenue up 27% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across nearly all key categories led by Sportswear, Running, Jordan and NIKE basketball. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 23% and EBIT grew 43% due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","Moving on to the emerging markets, Q3 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered growth in the quarter, driven by SOCO, and Pacific. Every key category grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running, global football, and women\u2019s training. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% and EBIT decreased 14%, reflecting weaker foreign currencies.","Looking forward, the emerging markets, strong currency-neutral futures growth reflects strong demand in nearly all territories. And as Trevor noted while macroeconomics in Brazil are challenging, our reset of that marketplace is on track as we approach the Olympics in Rio.","At Converse, Q3 revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily driven by comparisons to a prior year shift in the timing of shipments out of Q4 and into Q3, fiscal year \u201915. To ensure converse is smooth transition to a new ERP system. On a reported basis, Converse revenue decreased 9% and EBIT decreased 22% versus prior year, driven primarily by the revenue shift, lower gross margin and weakness in the euro.","NIKE Inc\u2019s, powerful, global portfolio of businesses has delivered strong results year-to-date, and we expect momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. For the full year fiscal year \u201916, we continue to expect financial performance in line with the expectations that we shared with your 90 days ago. Specifically for both Q4 and the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue to grow at a mid single digit rate, roughly in line with our year-to-date rate of growth.","For gross margin, we continue to expect expansion of about 50 basis points for the full year with Q4 gross margin, flat to slightly expanding versus prior year. We also continue to expect fiscal year \u201916 full year SG&A to grow at a high single digit rate. With Q4 SG&A, growing at a high single to low double digit rate. Other income will continue to have a meaningful impact on our full year results due to the impact of hedges captured in this line item. For Q4, we expect other income of approximately $40 million. And finally, we now expect our full year fiscal year \u201916 effective tax rate will be approximately 19%.","Looking ahead to fiscal year \u201917, our planning is not yet finalized. However, we have strong momentum in our business around the world and we expect that strong momentum to continue. Accordingly, we anticipate currency neutral revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range in fiscal year \u201917, and we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single digit rate due to continued strength of the U.S. dollar. We currently expect EPS to grow at a low teen\u2019s rate reflecting continued strong operational performance partially offset by unfavorable FX related impacts.","Further, we expect that our EPS growth will be more heavily weighted towards the back half of fiscal year \u201917. As we invest in significant brand initiatives early in the fiscal year including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championships and also due to unfavorable FX comparisons being more pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic creating both headwinds and opportunities. Accordingly we\u2019ll provide an updated look at our fiscal year \u201917 guidance during our Q4 earnings call.","As we look ahead, we have broad based momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses and we\u2019ll continue to leverage that momentum to deliver appropriate financial performance in the short-term while also investing and taking action to sustain strong profitable growth over the long-term.","Having shared that context on our performance and our outlook, we\u2019ll now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon.","Kelley Hall","Hi, Kate.","Kate McShane","My question was on inventory. I know you addressed them a couple of times in the prepared comments. But can you just drill down a little bit more to, where we are in terms of inventory composition? Are you still working through things in North America and are there any other areas where there maybe higher levels of inventory and in what categories?","Mark Parker","Okay. Just to -- let me just give you just a little recap on the inventory as we discussed. Obviously we\u2019re working to efficiently clear all the excess inventory and we actually made good progress in Q3, specifically on the flow of products is actually working through our North American distribution network is now normalizing. We also prioritize liquidation through our factory stores and we selectively utilized third party value channels. And we continue to actively manage the flow of the product in the inline market place to ensure that we can have the healthy pull market by the end of fiscal year \u201916. At the same time the inventory is relatively fresh, its all very fresh product and so we feel good about where we are today in terms of making progress, and we don\u2019t see any increasing areas, its really isolated to North America and its not a global issues.","Kate McShane","Okay. Thank you. And if I can just follow-up with an unrelated question with regards to futures growth in North America specifically, are store closures or announced store closures having any impact on that growth in that futures window you announced today?","Mark Parker","No, they\u2019re not.","Kate McShane","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Parker","Feel good about the futures.","Operator","Your next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Kelley Hall","Hello.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Hello.","Operator","Lindsay Drucker Mann, your line is open.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Hi. Can you hear me?","Kelley Hall","Yes.","Mark Parker","Yes. We can hear you.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit more on Andy\u2019s reference to the need to invest in order to drive this virtual cycle of growth. As you think about your big areas of investment over the next year or so, is there any shift in where you had your emphasis in terms of investment? And perhaps you could update us a bit on how you\u2019re thinking about supply chain investments and the opportunity to get -- differentiate yourself better with those?","Andy Campion","Thanks, Lindsay. In terms of investment, we have shared with your our strategic priorities over time in some of the areas that we\u2019re most focused on, those will remain largely consistent. Some of the investment I referred to in the near-term obviously related to some brand initiatives, phenomenal moments in sports around March Madness, The NBA Playoffs, The Olympics, European Football Championships. But as we look further out as we look more consistently to next year and beyond, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in consumer engagement so that the digital capabilities as well as digital services, we\u2019re going to invest in the operating infrastructure that\u2019s required to support our growth. I referenced some of the investments that we made in our supply chain, in fact including in our supply chain in North America a lot of what transpired over the last year was us ramping up capacity and capability that\u2019s going to serve us incredibly well long-term maintaining a pull market and flowing product to consumers. Those are the primary areas in which you\u2019ll see investment. We\u2019ll also continue to invest in the consumer experience at retail.","Mark Parker","I\u2019m going to add the product area, product innovation. Innovational basically in product and in manufacturing continues to be a priority and a major opportunity for the company.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great, thanks. If I can just quickly follow-up, you discussed I think Trevor, you said in your prepared remarks, you referenced the replatformed stores in China versus the broader floor network. Could you just give us an update on how far along that initiative is?","Trevor Edwards","Yes. As it relates to China, obviously we continue to be very excited about the continued momentum that we\u2019re seeing in the Chinese business. The actual growth of 27% this quarter and then the futures obviously -- the futures growth is just what we thought was just amazing results. And the reason why we continue to feel confident about those results is the team there is really focused on driving the category offence and connecting with our consumers. The brand remains incredibly strong, and the work that we\u2019ve been doing with our partners to re-profile the doors is actually paying dividends. They still represent a relatively small part of the overall -- of their overall business. So we continue to believe that there was still a lot of run way for us to continue to accelerate that business.","Mark Parker","Yes, and Lindsay I\u2019ll just add, in terms of dimensions of the marketplace, we\u2019re seeing very strong comps in our owned doors. We\u2019re seeing incredible growth in nike.com, and comps in the doors that we\u2019ve re-profiled in the wholesale market place with our partners continue to be strong, and actually the -- what we\u2019re implementing in those doors to feel growth is cascading into the rest of the market. But there is still a tremendous opportunity in the broader market in China as well as in our nike.com and other DTC businesses.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Nice quarter.","Kelley Hall","Hi, Omar.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Omar Saad","You\u2019re welcome. My first question kind of the P&L guidance that Andy gave, I\u2019m trying to understand -- it looks like the gross margin trends you expect similar in the fourth quarter -- similar to what's been happening. But it looks like you\u2019re implying a pretty significant deceleration on the constant currency sales line and simultaneously an acceleration [indiscernible] acceleration on the SG&A line. I wanted to make sure, A; I\u2019m reading into that right. I\u2019m interpreting your comments correctly, and maybe little bit color around those two line items. And then I have one follow-up.","Mark Parker","Okay. Sure, let me hit -- you asked about revenue and SG&A. Our guidance for the full year remains consistent with 90 days ago Omar, both our revenue guidance as well as our SG&A guidance. One thing that has certainly transpired is we\u2019ve moved forward a quarter. And so while we gave you full year guidance 90 days ago, you now have actuals and we\u2019re given more specific items with respect to Q4. And as you know, we don\u2019t manage line item-by-line item quarter-by-quarter but more the long-term focus and our trajectory continues on the same track. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is you\u2019re just getting a little bit more detail quarter-by-quarter, that one; it\u2019s just the passage of time and two; the operating actions that we take in each quarter again are with more of a holistic focus than just adhering strictly to a line item-by-line item plan.","Omar Saad","Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, I wanted to ask a question about all the innovation unveiled next week. One thing we noticed was, some of the innovations are tied to downloading apps and there seems to be maybe even some limited sequenced releases around some of these new innovations which is maybe a strategy we\u2019ve seen more in the basketball area with some of the limited edition products. Are you changing the kind of distribution and release strategy around innovation and this will tie into apps and things like that? Maybe help us understand what's going on there.","Mark Parker","Well, first of all what you saw last week what we introduced last week in New York was, some of what is coming over the next year. So our -- with this in the Olympic years, we always have more innovation coming out of the pipeline than normally. I mean it\u2019s pretty much the cycle that we\u2019ve been on. It\u2019s a focus that we\u2019ve had in delivering innovation really since the past two or three decades. But I think what you saw last week was more at one time than we\u2019ve ever introduced. We\u2019ve actually edited that. There\u2019s more innovation than what we showed in New York, both in product and on the digital front. That said, we\u2019re incredibly proud of the spectrum, the scope of innovation that we had in footwear, in apparel, competitively in sportswear really much across the spectrum, the complete offense that I had talked about. And then in digital, obviously that continues to be incredibly important for us. I think you\u2019ll see a stream of innovation coming from NIKE in that area. It continues to a high priority for the Company and obviously important to the consumer and the athletes that we\u2019re hear to serve. So that will be the norm I think that to see that kind of steady stream of innovation. And this is what fuels our growth in the end is, the scope and the power of the innovation we have; not just in terms of any one product but the influence that those products have on all the categories and in some cases the brands within the portfolio. So we\u2019re in a great position to leverage that innovation across a wider portfolio.","Omar Saad","Thanks, it\u2019s helpful.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Robert Drbul","Hi. Good afternoon.","Kelley Hall","Hi, Bob.","Mark Parker","Hi, Bob.","Robert Drbul","I guess the questions that I have, I think, the first one is, when you look at the gross margin performance, can you give us an update on the Flextronics relationship, sort of where you are in those initiatives and if that is impacting the business now, and sort of when we can expect it to start to [technical difficulty]?","Andy Campion","Sure, I\u2019ll take that one, Bob. Actually I mentioned I was in Asia three weeks ago. That was one; to visit the marketplace, but also to spend time with our team there leading our manufacturing revolution initiative which as you know is, includes our partnership with Flextronics and it\u2019s even broader. In terms of the financial impact, we did see an impact in our gross margin a favorable impact from some of those initiatives. It\u2019s obviously starting to build. We\u2019re more optimistic about the impact of those initiatives long-term and I can tell you from being there first hand, it\u2019s certainly reinforced and probably built my optimism in that regard.","Mark Parker","Yes. As I said, this is a huge priority for the Company and a massive opportunity for us, not just in terms of being more productive and more efficient and improving our margin performance, but also in getting us closer to the market in advancing our sustainability goals, bringing customized solutions to consumers in the marketplace and that\u2019s where the Flex -- this is where the Flex partnership is particularly valuable to us. We do a lot of work with Flex and we\u2019re seeing the potential scaling that work between NIKE and Flex across our broader supply chain, both in our manufacturing partners around the world as well as even how we customize products here in the United States. So we\u2019re very, very excited about where that\u2019s going and the potential.","Robert Drbul","Great. And I guess just, on the business overall, on the revenue growth that we\u2019ve experienced and you\u2019ve seen so far, ASPs have been a big portion of that. Do you think near a ceiling with ASP growth or should we expect more units to drive the business. Can you just talk about how you see that playing out over the next several years?","Mark Parker","Yes, Bob, I\u2019ll start on that one. Average gross selling price continues to favorably impact margin, it did in the third quarter and I think when you look at our futures, you see that it\u2019s having a significant impact on our futures growth, seven points -- percentage points. We continue to see strong demand for the innovative and new products that we\u2019re bringing, of course in any given period we add it in shift as appropriate. But that continues to be in our view an element of gross margin expansion that we believe we can sustain.","Trevor Edwards","Yes. And I\u2019ll just add that, obviously our pricing strategy always centers on ensuring that we\u2019re giving the right price value to our consumers. And right now the -- and continue going forward, our brand is very strong. And importantly as Mark kind of just touched on, we have an incredible amount of innovation. So we believe that ability to combine the brand strength along with bringing great innovation to the market it allows us to continue to actually deliver a premium value to our consumers, and that\u2019s always the way that we look can drive our pricing strategy.","Robert Drbul","Great. If I could just sneak in one more quick one?","Kelley Hall","Bob, come on.","Robert Drbul","Okay, go ahead. Sorry, go ahead.","Kelley Hall","Go ahead.","Robert Drbul","So I guess, my question is -- is who had Syracuse and Gonzaga and who is going to win that game?","Kelley Hall","Now we know why you wanted to sneak one more.","Trevor Edwards","I think the NIKE team will win.","Robert Drbul","Thank you.","Operator","The next as is from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America.","Robby Ohmes","Hi, guys. Great quarter and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about sportswear. I think it was and I think you guys called it out in every market. Can you give us a little more color on what's working so well in sportswear? Is it more apparel than footwear? Is it weighted towards the women\u2019s strength that you\u2019ve been calling out? Is it different drivers in sportswear by region globally even though it\u2019s working well in every region? And also is there a -- is it a higher selling business right now than say Jordan or some of your other businesses? Just maybe some more color on why sportswear has been so great?","Mark Parker","I mean I\u2019ll tell you, in the beginning part of your question, I\u2019ll kind of give you a big yes, yes, yes on all those dimensions in the sense that, our sportswear as we always talk about -- our sportswear strategy is aligned with our Amplify strategy. So we always drive a performance business and then amplify our sportswear from that. Right now we have incredible great products that are coming through on sportswear, that really hits on the multiple dimensions of that business, whether that\u2019s footwear, look at the items line the, Air Force 1 Ultra Flyknit culture or the Huarache styles or the Roche styles all doing really well, the Air Max that we\u2019re launching right now. So those are the great items in footwear. On the apparel side, we just launched the new Tech Knit collection which is doing phenomenally well in the market place, and so, which is a continuation of the Tech Pack, so we\u2019re seeing that. And we\u2019re also into that really multiple price zone, so whether it\u2019s the most premium to the most premium value going all the way through. So it\u2019s hitting on every single dimension. But what is true also, that you\u2019re seeing sort of strong growth in the Jordan brand. So it isn\u2019t one versus the other. We believe that the complete offense allows us to really drive and continue to drive all those dimensions of those business both from performance to sportswear from the NIKE brand to the Jordan brand, and that really represents the complete offense.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, I want to add to that. When we say complete offense, we talk about that relative to NIKE in general. But you can dive into any category, in this case sportswear and there is a complete offense within sportswear. Today we\u2019re actually clicking on about every cylinder in sportswear up and down the price points, around the GOs [ph], current revenues of the futures demand, bringing technology into the category which is creating a great deal of interest from a consumer standpoint that the ability for NIKE to leverage technology in sportswear in compelling ways is what creates distinction for NIKE in this segment. And that is going to be the case moving forward. We\u2019re very bullish on where we are with sportswear now but really even more on the potential of what lies ahead.","Robby Ohmes","That sounds great. Thanks so much guys.","Trevor Edwards","Thanks, Robby.","Kelley Hall","We have time for one more question.","Operator","The last question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hi, guys. Good evening. Thanks and great quarter. Thanks for getting my question in here. I think where we\u2019re or I could use a little bit of help here just on the spread between the revenue guidance in the fourth quarter of the futures growth rate. I know Kelley and I talked about this intra-quarter. I think the past few quarters you\u2019re pointing to a very wide spread between futures and revenues due to a few shifts that I think should have at least started to normalize or normalize by now. If I look at what that means in your direct to consumer business contributing maybe four points of revenue growth every quarter and a guidance from its singles in the fourth quarter. Can you help me reconcile between the 17% futures growth ex-currency and the mid-single digit revenue growth, it\u2019s just a touch wider than we\u2019ve seen in the past. I want to make sure we understand it. Thanks.","Mark Parker","Sure, I\u2019ll touch on that one. As you know just two level set, we obviously reported futures to give you an indication of demand for the product we\u2019re bringing to market at full price in the inline channels, and we continue to see strong demand for what we\u2019re bringing to market going forward. We also gave you revenue guidance, so that you -- you get a sense for all of the items that sort of reconcile from gross futures to the total revenue for NIKE Inc. There is several dimensions of that. I won't hit all of them. We do report them, but just -- just to touch on a few of them. The difference between seasons and quarterly reporting windows, seasons in our industry are about a month off of our quarterly reporting windows. The waiting of futures by a month, both of those things, seasons and waiting by a month can be impacted by a number of different factors ranging from shipping timing to consumers to events, like the European Football Championships, The Olympics et cetera, so those are certainly impacts. And then, you touched on one of the two other dimensions. One is, the lag between the futures order date for our DTC business and the timing of sell through to DTC and the consumers. And that is the dynamic as we have a fast growing DTC business particularly led by nike.com. The other dimension is, that while futures represent the vast majority of our revenue, there are some pretty significant items that aren\u2019t reflected in futures and can be growing at various rates. That would be always available. NIKE factory store revenue, Converse for example. So there are a lot of factors. What we try to do for you guys is, give you a sense for demand again for the NIKE brand at full price that\u2019s futures, and then do that reconciliation for you and give you the revenue guidance.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then if I could just follow-up with one. On the fiscal \u201917 early thinking, thanks for the -- some of the help on that, Andy. I know the five-year plan from the October analyst day was 10% revenue growth. So when you look at the high end of the guide to the low end of the guide, high singles to low doubles. What kind of dynamics would take you to the high singles which might be touch below the 10% and what kind of dynamics are you thinking about early on that could take you above that 10% mark?","Mark Parker","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And I think, as I noted we\u2019re still finalizing our plan. And one of the reasons we\u2019re finalizing our plan is, there are number of dynamics, macroeconomic dynamics that can be headwinds to some extent, but there are also opportunities that are presenting themselves. And so, our guidance is in line with what we talked about at the Investor Day, high single digit to low double-digit, currency neutral revenue growth. And we -- and I think what you\u2019ll see from time to time, obviously mostly to the positives that we\u2019re looking at opportunities to connect even more deeply with consumers, and so we\u2019ll update you on our guidance as we move forward.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot, guys. Have a great evening.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Thanks everybody. I appreciate you joining us on the call this quarter, and we\u2019ll talk to you at year-end.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15853":["NIKE, Inc.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Many of you know Matt. I'd like to welcome him to his first call as he takes on the responsibility of Investor Relations. And then of course on behalf of the whole team, I\u2019d like to thank Nitesh for his partnership over the last several years.","Turning to the results, we feel very good about our performance in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, growing revenue 10% on a currency neutral basis. It was a quarter that proved the depth and balance of our complete offense, building on the strengths of our foundational business drivers and capitalizing on the untapped dimensions of our portfolio.","For the quarter, this is reflected in the broad-based growth in all geographies, led by our international business, which grew 16%; in double-digit growth in our women's business off the back of an incredible summer of celebrating female athletes; in both footwear and apparel with our strong lineup of innovation and style which continues to feed the growing consumer demand for comfortable athletic product; and in digital which grew a very strong 42% showing the power of more personal relationships with the consumer.","Mobile continues to lead the way and within mobile, app experiences are fueling the most growth. And while this trend has held true in our own channels for some time, we\u2019re beginning to leverage our digital experiences with our retail partners. As we set out to do, we\u2019re creating a differentiated marketplace for NIKE by scaling our learnings and best in class experiences with our partners.","The key to expanding our competitive edge continues to be our total commitment to the consumer through the consumer-direct offense. We\u2019re focused. We\u2019re investing in our brand in key markets and we're accelerating in the high growth dimensions of our business. And that\u2019s especially important in the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment that we see today.","In relation to tariffs, we've been clear that we strongly believe in the power of free and fair trade. Historically, we've effectively navigated through excessive duties and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll continue to do so under the current dynamic. In China, specifically, we continue to extend NIKE\u2019s lead. In our key cities of Beijing and Shanghai, we serve a generation of digital-first consumers and we support their love of sport by helping to grow participation through grassroots programs.","As I\u2019ve said before, NIKE is a brand of China for China and the results continue to prove it out. We\u2019ve driven double-digit growth in Greater China every quarter for more than five years. This quarter, we continued that momentum with an outstanding 27% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. In any environment, NIKE\u2019s foundation for success has always been great product. We continue to see that today with another huge quarter for NIKE innovation.","We're delivering more choice and fresh options on some of our hottest products and expansion of both new and existing platforms and a deeper commitment to serving a wider range of athletes. Sportswear continues to lead all categories in both footwear and apparel growing strong double-digits. One of NIKE\u2019s greatest strengths is how we mix style and innovation, and the Air Max React 270 is a perfect example. We\u2019ve created a runway hit by blending Air Max and React with multiple bold colorways. In fact, the 270 Air Max React led to the largest gains in footwear revenue for the quarter.","Another strong addition to our lineup this quarter is the Air Max 200, the layered upper with a new visible Air Sole unit continues to build on the energy we\u2019re driving in running silhouettes. We\u2019re also reimagining and clearly segmenting our top sportswear franchises like the Air Force 1 and Tech Fleece. By adapting the Air Force 1 into models like the N.354 and the Sage, we grew the Air Force 1 businesses with women's and kids faster than men\u2019s this quarter. It\u2019s an approach we\u2019re using with our Tech Fleece collection too adding new silhouettes and shapes throughout our lines.","Our strategy of designing apparel through themes and collections continues to connect with the consumer, as we drove double-digit growth in sportswear apparel for the 22nd consecutive quarter. Our kids business is one that doesn't get a lot of attention on our calls but it is in fact a critical part of our business. Overall, kids\u2019 footwear and apparel just experienced its biggest back-to-school season ever, driving double-digit growth for the quarter.","In kids, we\u2019re earning significant gains through core footwear and apparel for both boys and girls and in basketball and the Air Max 270 which drove triple-digit growth for kids\u2019 power franchises. How we present and distributed kids\u2019 product also provides new opportunities. We see more parents buying on our apps, so we continue to invest in more dynamic imagery on our digital platforms and we\u2019re testing new business models through membership to make it easier for parents to buy at the pace that their kids need new product.","In performance product, we saw very strong momentum in basketball internationally this quarter especially with the AlphaDunk. To be honest, we\u2019re excited about the long-term potential of this signature line. Not only did the Zoom Freak 1 become the largest initial signature launch in NIKE basketball history, its apparel line sold out quickly as well with the Freak T-shirt becoming the top selling apparel item on Nike.com.","This quarter, we were all inspired by the incredible athletes and performances at the Women's World Cup. It was also a tremendous stage for NIKE innovation. During the all-NIKE final, we also debuted our top football boot innovation, the Mercurial 2019. In addition, apparel revenue from the 2019 Women's World Cup was 4x bigger than it was for the 2015 event. Across the wider business, we stayed intensely focused on the apparel classifications that matter the most to the female athlete; bras and tights.","For the quarter, the light-support Indy Bra led the way and our NIKE One Tight is creating incredible demand, especially in NIKE direct and strategic retail partner doors. The NIKE One collection is a great example of our edit to amplify approach that will stretch to other categories putting more focus on our most profitable items across price points and distribution channels.","In running, we launched Joyride which was designed to encourage more everyday athletes to get moving. We're excited about the incredible comfort this system delivers with responsive beads that conform to the foot. The customer response to the running silhouette this quarter was very strong and we\u2019re just now beginning to scale the Joyride platform across multiple categories through women\u2019s, sportswear and kids.","As we began to communicate through Joyride, one of the biggest opportunity for NIKE is to continue to serve an even wider range of athletes. As leader in our industry, we will add to the growing movement of health and wellness around the world. We\u2019ve been broadening our definition of sport through our brand, but more and more we\u2019re doing it through product innovation.","From competition to fitness to light activity to play, our more inclusive view on design is opening up new lanes of opportunity for growth. For example, we\u2019re studying the fit of our products to serve more body types with our successful plus size line. Our teams are designing for modesty to match more people\u2019s preferences and our FLYEASE system has been updated for easier entry and exit to appeal to even more people.","We will be expanding into a new high performance basketball shoe and one of the most coveted sneakers of all time, the Air Jordan 1. Making more athletes comfortable and confident can be an incredible catalyst to bringing more people into sport and that\u2019s a theme we\u2019ll continue to champion as we lead into the Tokyo Olympics.","On last quarter\u2019s call we told you that the Jordan brand was accelerating and finished with over $3 billion in revenue for fiscal '19. Jordan followed up that record breaking year with the quarter of healthy double-digit growth in all geographies, including mid-teens growth in North America. We're growing at an accelerated pace in new areas like performance basketball, women's, international and apparel and the Air Jordan 1 franchise continues to create incredible demand all over the world.","This quarter, we were incredibly excited to announce that Zion joined the Jordan family. We\u2019re proud that Zion will wear the Air Jordan 34 to start this season and we\u2019re already developing new innovation with one of the NBA's most anticipated rookies. Looking over the next few seasons, our pipeline is set to fuel growth in our biggest businesses while also carving out new space for future opportunities.","New LeBron and Kyrie signature models will arrive as the NBA season gets started. Women's apparel will lead with new materials of performance types. Training will introduce a new franchise designed for a range of fitness activities, including high-intensity workouts, station-based training and spinning classes. Running will introduce more innovation that\u2019s proven to help make athletes faster as we headed into Tokyo. And our adaptive platform will continue to evolve with new features like voice activation from your phone. There\u2019s much more to come from NIKE innovation in fiscal year '20.","While products are usually the first to grab the attention of our consumers, we deepened those relationships through the power of digital. To do that, we\u2019re investing in three areas. We're building industry leading personal experiences. We're quickly ramping up our backend capabilities to capture more of that demand. And the final critical piece is to create scale through our own channels and with our partners.","Membership sits at the heart of that strategy giving consumers a more personal relationship with NIKE. Fundamentally, that gives them easier access to more tailored products and services. With product, there are multiple advantages to being a logged in member. In some cases, it means they have early access to our latest innovation like we did this quarter with the launch of Joyride and the Air Max 270 React. It can also be as simple as giving better access to the product they want in the moment, so you\u2019re capturing more full-price demand. Connected inventory is critical to that capability.","With services, we\u2019re bringing real value to our members\u2019 lives consistently. Our teams are assessing different ways to engage with more people completely and have them coming back for more. Over the last three years, we more than doubled the number of active users across all of our apps. With more active engagement we create more value for both our members and for NIKE.","In this quarter, for example, over 50% of our NIKE direct digital growth came from numbers. Becoming personal at scale is the ultimate objective. We start in our own channels and then amplify those experiences through partnerships. The sneakers app has truly redefined our connection with the sneaker community. It\u2019s now in 22 countries with more room to grow in EMEA and APLA and grew roughly 50% this quarter. We've also begun to test a new opportunity within sneakers on high heat apparel. The early read from our members on our pilots has been very positive.","As I\u2019ve said before, the NIKE app is the most comprehensive one-stop shop for NIKE. It\u2019s become the largest and fastest-growing platform in our portfolio, growing almost triple digits this quarter. The NIKE app is already in 21 countries and will go live in China in holiday. Just as exciting is the impact that the NIKE app is having on the physical shopping experience. It\u2019s scaling in North America and features can be now activated in every store owned NIKE location, most factory stores including most factory stores and in this quarter alone we added nearly 1 million new NIKE members from interactions in our North America doors.","NIKE Fit is our technology that scans the foot, eliminating a significant consumer friction point by providing an accurate read of a users shoe size. The in-store experience is currently available in all North America locations and is moving quickly into Europe and Japan. We\u2019ll also be launching an at-home in app experience later this fiscal year.","We\u2019re moving at an impressive pace in the channels that we control and while we continue to invest in stronger more distinctive partnerships. When coming together with another platform or retailer, our objective is to create a better experience in the path of the consumer. We want them to be able to move seamlessly from online to offline and easily find the product they want, when they want it across the marketplace.","Ultimately by recognizing, serving and rewarding members, it will engage with NIKE more often across multiple channels and touch points. Our teams continue to be very active in this space. NIKE App at Retail is already showing the ability to scale with partners.","This quarter, for the first time, NIKE App at Retail features and NIKE membership were activated with a wholesaler through a pilot with Foot Locker\u2019s Washington Heights store. We plan to integrate NIKE App at Retail in more Foot Locker doors in North America and bring new experiences to Zalando in Europe and top sports in China later this fiscal year.","Our inventory partnership program also continued to scale, including Zalando, JD and Pro-Direct in Europe. And we're leveraging the world's top social media platforms with Instagram where consumers can use direct messaging for commerce in our women's and training channels and with WeChat with a new feature that allows users to check product availability in nearby stores instantly.","A critical component to accelerating all of our opportunities is our ability to become smarter through our supply chain. And to do that we\u2019re bringing science to the art of retail like never before. With Zodiac, we've acquired proprietary technology and teams to better know our members, give them better experiences and expand their lifetime value to the NIKE brand.","Invertex brought us computer visioning capabilities for NIKE Fit which we talked about and in addition to more accurate fitting sizes we\u2019re already using the insights we gain to inform better design product. And just last month we acquired a new predictive analytics platform and team of data scientists through our acquisition of Celect. This game will greatly accelerate our ability to turn raw data into actionable demand insights, and this allows us to make more accurate inventory decisions closer to market.","We\u2019re partnering, investing in our own teams and we\u2019re gaining new capabilities all in the name of serving the consumer more completely. It was a great start to the year for NIKE. The global shift towards more active lifestyles continues to accelerate and demand for athletic product is high.","As a company, we have a sharper focus on these areas that will drive the greatest growth. We\u2019re bringing the joy of sport to even more people and we continue to build our more valuable relationships with the consumer through the power of digital. Our fundamentals are strong, but what excites me the most is the significant opportunity ahead for our industry and for NIKE.","Thanks. And now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thank you, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. First, I want to take a moment to personally thank Nitesh for his incredibly valuable partnership and leadership over Investor Relations as he now transitions into a new and expanded set of responsibilities. And I also want to welcome Matt to his first call as he expands his responsibilities to include leadership over Investor Relations.","In Q1, we came out of the block strong with our results meeting or exceeding the expectations we set 90 days ago on every dimension. Most notably, we delivered currency neutral revenue growth of 10%, 150 basis point of gross margin expansion, EPS growth of 28% and high expanding returns on invested capital. Those are extraordinary numbers, but what we're most excited about is the quality of our performance.","Our financial performance in Q1 reflects exceptional strategic execution by our teams around the world. We continue on our relentless drive to transform how NIKE serves consumers. There are three key themes that really stand out when we reflect on Q1. One, the strategic transformation of NIKE continues to be the fuel for accelerating broad-based growth across our global portfolio.","Two, this transformational growth is not happening by accident. Our targeted investments are extending our competitive advantage. And three, while the geopolitical and macro environment is increasingly volatile and in some respects unpredictable, consumer sentiment for the NIKE brand remains incredibly strong and consistent around the world.","Let\u2019s go a bit deeper on these three themes. First, strategic transformation is driving our broad-based global growth. When it comes to creating value for shareholders it all starts with growth. And as Mark has said, when it comes to grow, at NIKE it all starts with product. NIKE is bringing innovative new product to market at an unrivaled pace and scale.","New innovation platforms equated to over 100% of our incremental growth in Q1. That includes the successful launch of Joyride and strong sustained consumer demand for recently launched platforms from React to the range of compelling new Air Max platforms launched over the past two years such as VaporMax, 270, 720 and 200.","At the same time digital is transforming and amplifying everything we do at NIKE. In Q1, NIKE digital grew 42% on a currency neutral basis driven by enhanced digital services and the expansion of our ecosystem internationally. The NIKE app and sneakers app are now both live in over 20 countries with more expansion coming over the balance of fiscal year '20.","As for the second key theme, we are making deliberate investments both organically and through acquisitions to extend NIKE\u2019s competitive advantage. For example, we've enhanced our ability to test and scale new digital services faster by investing in the migration of over 95% of our consumer experiences to a more nimble cloud-based architectural.","Our acquisition of Celect in Q1 was another accelerator of our transformation. Celect\u2019s team and proprietary digital demand sensing tools will help us more effectively predict demand, plan supply, allocate product to the right stores and sharpen our pricing and markdown gains. Celect\u2019s capabilities are first of their kind in our industry. Most other industries sell the same products season after season.","Celect has developed unique models the leverage data science and machine learning in our industry where we bring new and innovative product to market every season. The acquisition of Celect accelerates our building of digital demand sensing capabilities by at least three years.","With NIKE's unrivaled scale and resources, we will continue to capitalize on opportunities such as these to invest and extend our leadership and competitive advantage. At the same time, we\u2019re also increasingly offsetting our incremental investment through the editing of resources within our legacy operating models.","The third key theme as we reflect on Q1 relates to the environment in which we\u2019re operating. Despite increasingly dynamic and somewhat unpredictable macro and geopolitical factors, consumer sentiment and affinity for the NIKE brand remained strong and consistent. NIKE\u2019s growth continues to outpace GDP growth and broader retail growth in our major markets around the world, and NIKE continues to be the number one favorite brand in our 12 key global cities.","Since launching our consumer direct offense two years ago, our currency neutral performance has exceeded our long-term financial model in terms of growth, profitability and return on invested capital and we see that momentum continuing over the balance of fiscal year '20. While the macro dynamics are even more volatile than they were 90 days ago, NIKE has a long track record of remaining agile and managing all of the levers we control.","We are also increasingly engaging with all of our constituents on the levers that are outside of our direct control. As a result, to-date our net real dollar reported results have remained strong and consistent. We continue to deliver strong financial performance despite FX having had a roughly $3 billion negative impact on our reported revenue and over $1.5 billion of negative impact on our EBIT over the past four years.","Despite the recently implemented tariffs and associated FX headwinds, we expect to continue delivering strong financial performance going forward. But before sharing our positive outlook for the balance of fiscal year '20, I\u2019ll first touch on our reported Q1 results in a bit more detail.","NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10% on a currency neutral basis and 7% on a reported basis. Our stronger than projected overall growth reflects healthy balanced growth across all four of our geographies, led by NIKE digital globally in Greater China. Gross margin expanded by 150 basis points in Q1 as average gross selling prices expanded and higher margin NIKE direct growth outpaced wholesale growth.","Q1 gross margin significantly exceeded our guidance, driven primarily by a shift in the timing of supply chain and other investments out of Q1 and into the balance of the year, significantly lower than planned markdown rates in our NIKE factory stores; in fact even lower than we\u2019d expect in a typical quarter and the favorable mix impact from stronger than planned growth in our high-margin international geographies and NIKE direct. We nonetheless expect gross margin expansion over the balance of the fiscal year, though of course not at the same level as we saw in Q1. I\u2019ll touch on this more specifically in our guidance.","SG&A grew 9% in Q1 as we continue to invest in our digital transformation and in part driven by brand marketing associated with the Women's World Cup and the Joyride innovation launch. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.4% which would have been largely in line with guidance but for favorable non-recurring items.","First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.86. And as of August 31st, inventories were up 12% reflecting strong forward-looking consumer demand globally and also in support of key consumer moments such as back-to-school which has extended into September this year and looking ahead to Singles\u2019 Day on 11.11 in Greater China.","Now let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 4%. Our growth in Q1 was right on plan, led by digital from a channel perspective and sportswear in Jordan categorically. We are reshaping the marketplace in North America with NIKE digital growing over 30% on a currency neutral basis and with high single-digit growth across our key strategic and differentiated partners.","In Q1, we also drove an intentional decline in undifferentiated multi-brand wholesale. We continue to reallocate our best product and our retail investment dollars to NIKE direct and differentiated partner experiences. That includes, for example, testing new services, leveraging the NIKE app in partner doors such as in Washington Heights with Foot Locker.","Now let\u2019s turn to EMEA where revenue grew 12% on a currency neutral basis in Q1. Growth was broad based across our categories and amplified by strong double-digit growth in NIKE digital. We see continued strong digital momentum in Europe with the Nike app having just launched in 13 new countries across this geography.","We extended our lead in Europe in Q1 with the NIKE brand rated the number one favorite brand in all of our key cities and our business growing at strong double-digit rates in London, Berlin and Milan. While NIKE direct is a key driver, our strategic partnerships with JD and Zalando are also contributing to our strong sustained growth in Europe.","Now let\u2019s turn to Greater China, which continues to set the pace for NIKE's growth globally. Q1 marks the 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China grew 27% on a currency neutral basis fueled by nearly all key categories led by sportswear and Jordan.","Coming off of the FIBA World Cup in China, we are also excited about the energy around the basketball category in this geography and globally as we enter the new NBA season. The impact of digital in China has been nothing short of extraordinary. NIKE digital grew over 70% in Q1, in part amplified by our strategic partnerships with Tmall and WeChat. And looking ahead we are pulling forward the launch of the NIKE app in Greater China into late Q2.","Based on trade and other dynamics we continue to be deeply engaged with all of our constituents in China and we\u2019re also closely monitoring consumer sentiment. At the same time, affinity for the NIKE brand continues to build and our sell-through at retail remains very strong. We believe we're extending the NIKE brand\u2019s leadership in China by remaining authentically focused on serving the Chinese consumer while fueling their passion for sport and a broader movement toward a more active lifestyle.","So now let's turn from China to another fast-growing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis driven by nearly 50% growth in NIKE digital. In Q1, we launched the NIKE App at Retail in our [indiscernible] store, a great example of bringing the consumer direct offense to life globally through the key city of Tokyo.","The culture of basketball was also driving force behind the momentum we saw in APLA with the Jordan brand growing strong double digits year-over-year. APLA is an extremely entrepreneurial and diverse geography. In APLA we continue testing new concepts with local partners such as our digital commerce relationship with Flipkart in India to leveraging the social media platform Kakao in Korea on the launch of Joyride and on ramping new members.","Finally, at Converse, revenue increased 8% on a currency neutral basis with the Converse brand delivering strong double-digit growth in China and across digital globally, while returning to growth in Europe. Growth is being fueled by an increasingly stronger and diversified product portfolio, including across the Chuck Taylor franchise, the Chuck 70 and the Chuck Taylor Lift. We're also excited about Converse\u2019s reentry into performance basketball, which got off to a great start with the successful launch of the All Star Pro BB.","Now turning to our outlook. We see continued momentum going forward. Accordingly, our projected currency neutral growth and profitability are improving. One might have expected the recently implemented tariffs and associated FX headwinds to result in lower real dollar expectations; however, our real dollar outlook remains consistent to slightly improved net of all of the dynamics in our business.","For the full year we continue to expect reported revenue growth within the high single-digit range, slightly exceeding fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth. This incorporates our improved currency neutral outlook being largely offset by the more intense FX headwinds of late associated with trade dynamics.","Recall that the impact of foreign exchange hedges is not accounted for within our revenue line item. We now expect to deliver full year gross margin expansion within the 50 to 75 basis point range. That assumes that the negative impact of recently implemented tariffs remains in effect for the balance of our fiscal year. And again remember that our Q1 gross margin expansion was amplified by timing shifts and other discrete items.","While our recent acquisition of Celect will have some impact on SG&A, we still expect SG&A to grow roughly in line with revenue for the year. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens. And for OIE, net of interest expense, we continue to expect $50 million to $100 million of income for the year.","Our focus first and foremost is on sustaining strong currency neutral operating momentum over the full year and longer term, but based on the volatile dynamics of late I'll provide a bit of context on Q2. We expect reported revenue growth in Q2 to be in line with our Q1 reported revenue growth. That assumes our strong currency neutral revenue growth will be dampened by roughly 3 points of FX headwinds. ","For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion to be roughly 25 basis points with slightly greater expansion than that in the second half of the year. The impact of tariffs will be most pronounced in Q2. In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the high single-digit range. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. And for OIE, we expect income in Q2 to be roughly $10 million to $30 million.","We are extremely pleased with our brand momentum and the strong currency neutral growth we delivered since implementing our new offense two years ago. That said, we are still in the early stages of NIKE strategic transformation. Our execution of the consumer direct offense will continue to fuel growth across our portfolio of key categories, key cities in key countries as well as accelerate our growth against the outside long-term opportunities that we see in women's, apparel, digital and international.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","Mark Parker","Hi, Bob.","Andy Campion","Hi, Bob.","Bob Drbul","I guess the question I have is \u2013 two questions really. On the first part of it is in North America, can you talk a little bit more about the apparel performance in terms of some success in women\u2019s but just generally the level of growth and sort of how we should approach that? And the second question is just around the inventory levels, any pockets of concerns there, any areas geographically that you\u2019re concerned about or anything we should think about from that perspective?","Mark Parker","Sure. I\u2019ll start on North America apparel. We continue \u2013 you asked about women\u2019s in particular, we continue to grow the women\u2019s apparel business in North America. It\u2019s in fact growing at a very strong rate. At the same time we see great opportunity ahead, even greater than we\u2019ve capitalized on to date. Overall, in terms of apparel growth, we\u2019re really pleased with the growth. The number in Q1 does compare unfavorably to some prior year comps. As you may recall last year in Q1, apparel in North America grew 8% and that was in part impacted by the jersey business relative to the NBA. As you may recall, LeBron changed teams last year and that had some impact. We also were seeing this year back-to-school extend a bit out of Q1 and into our Q2. So in short we see really strong demand for our apparel in North America. We\u2019ve had a little bit of pressure on supply but you\u2019re going to see the rates of growth in North America apparel accelerate over the balance of the year.","And then you asked about inventory. I guess I\u2019ll take that one too. Inventory as we spoke about was up 12% versus prior year. That was primarily driven by strong consumer demand. A majority of our inventories in new seasonal product, some of which is in transit to the marketplace and we\u2019ll sell in to the marketplace and sell through over the quarter and into Q3. There was also a little bit of an impact from foreign exchange in that inventory number. So if you look at it on a unit basis, our unit inventory growth is really well aligned with our forward-looking unit growth. And kind of combining those two themes, one, the fact that it\u2019s largely seasonal inventory and, two, that the overall unit numbers are aligned with what you\u2019re seeing and you would expect and hope to see is that our closeout mix is low and it is in fact very low. So our inventory is very healthy in our geographies. There are a couple of other dynamics that are probably worth calling out. One, again, is this extended back-to-school season. So you see some of that inventory now selling through as back-to-school extended into September, which is in our Q2. And then we also have been building inventory in anticipation of Singles\u2019 Day on 11.11 in China. So the punch line is we feel great about the inventory that we have on hand and it\u2019s reflective of the strong demand for the brand.","Bob Drbul","Great.","Mark Parker","Thank you. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jamie Merriman","Thanks very much for all the color on the call. The first question is with respect to North America and you talked about the decision to purposely ramp down some of those \u2013 not strategic partners in the market. Can you talk about how those plans play out for the balance of 2020 and how we should think about that? And then can you just give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about some of those strategic partners, specifically with e-commerce on whether you have an update on partnerships with Amazon, Jet, partners like that and what you\u2019ve seen so far? Thank you.","Mark Parker","Hi, Jamie. I\u2019ll take the first question relative to North America. As you may recall from our call 90 days ago, we highlighted that we were going to have some year-over-year comparison dynamics in North America. So I\u2019d start by saying we\u2019re right on plan in North America. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in that geography. We still see that geography as sustaining strong healthy mid-single digit growth. You\u2019ll see slightly higher growth rates in North America over the balance of the year than what we delivered in Q1 and of course remember not all percents are created equal. A point or two of growth in North America is a pretty significant impact.","And then again I think I touched on this a little bit with respect to Bob\u2019s question. The growth in Q1 was slightly impacted again by some year-over-year comparisons not just in the jersey business but also the timing of innovation launches in footwear and then again with that kind of extended back-to-school season spanning over Q1 and into our Q2, which begins in September. So again, we see tremendous momentum in North America.","You also asked about the distinction between NIKE direct differentiated consumer experiences and undifferentiated consumer experiences. That is really a tale of two cities. We are seeing strong in fact accelerating growth in NIKE digital. We\u2019re seeing high-single digit growth in differentiated retail with our strategic partners. And we\u2019re seeing an expected in fact somewhat intentional and deliberate decline in undifferentiated retail and the drivers of that are how we allocate product and where we put our retail investment dollars. So we would expect that trend to continue in the short term.","Of course, long term our goal is we have reshaped this marketplace to one in which we\u2019re connecting much more directly with NIKE consumers and members through NIKE direct in our strategic wholesale partners. So again, we\u2019re on plan in North America. The brand\u2019s extremely strong and really excited about the opportunities ahead including in those areas we consistently touched on; digital, women\u2019s, core footwear below $100 which is touched on in apparel.","Andy Campion","Let me touch on the second question you had on the digital partnerships. Obviously, digital growth is driving much of NIKE\u2019s overall growth and that\u2019s importantly obviously for direct but also the digital base business with our partners both wholesalers who are expanding their growth through the digital channel as well as digital platforms. We don\u2019t have anything new to update you on in terms of Amazon. So far the work with Amazon, the relationship has gone well. The business is performing well that is, so nothing new to report there.","We continue to sort of analyze that relationship and the other opportunities we have from a platform partnership standpoint. It\u2019s really critical that our platform partners are actually serving our members or serving our consumers at the highest level possible so that means sort of seamless interaction, frictionless experiences in terms of commerce, looking at an environment where they know that they\u2019re buying authentic NIKE products and ultimately just to better know and serve our consumers. So those are things that we expect from our digital platform partners.","We feel really good about our partners in Europe and in China and then also growing through the digital channels here in the United States with partners like Instagram through social media, just getting on Jet so there\u2019s lots of opportunity ahead there. So this will be an important part of our growth going forward. And I should mention \u2013 I failed to mention one of our biggest most successful partners here is in China and that\u2019s Tmall. So tremendous relationship there, continues to add energy to the brand as well as help to drive our business in China.","Mark Parker","Okay. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to touch base on the gross margin performance. Perhaps you could just walk through a little bit more detail on the spread versus your original estimates, how we should think about the supply chain impact in 1Q and how that will affect the balance of the quarters as well as what were the drivers behind the lower than expected markdowns and what is the impact in 2Q of tariffs, color on that would be helpful? Thank you.","Mark Parker","Sure. Thanks, Paul. I will first walk you through some of the impacts or drivers as you said in terms of the spread versus our guidance. So as compared to the expectations we said 90 days ago, 150 basis points significantly exceeded those. I\u2019d say, first, I would touch on higher growth and favorable mix in our international geographies; second, higher growth in our NIKE direct business and again both of those are I would say over-indexing growth versus the plan we had 90 days ago, so strong momentum in those dimensions of our business versus plan. And again, our international geographies are higher margin geographies than North America and our NIKE direct business is a higher margin business than the wholesale business.","You asked about lower than expected markdowns in our factory store business, I\u2019d say that was most pronounced in Europe. In Europe, we\u2019ve really just had extraordinary separation. You\u2019ve seen strong double-digit currency neutral growth in Europe for quite some time. We\u2019re taking share and our brand\u2019s just incredibly strong in all of our key cities in Europe. So frankly our markdowns were much lower than we had planned there and in some other areas of our business. Not only we planned for the quarter but then you\u2019d expect in a typical quarter. You also asked about the impact of tariffs. Tariffs will impact Q2 through Q4. Now again, we guided to slightly improved overall gross margin even taking into account those tariffs, but the impact is more pronounced in Q2.","As you know they were announced in August and implemented on September 1. That doesn\u2019t give us much time to manage any of the levers within our overall portfolio. As we look out to the balance of the year, there are a lot of levers within our portfolio. We\u2019ve managed them over time. We\u2019re a big proponent of free and fair trade and that\u2019s because tariffs have always been part of the financial equation in NIKE, so with a little bit of time we have a lot of levers we can work with from sourcing to other levers. So the impact of tariffs is most significant in Q2. And then as you likely inferred from our guidance, we expect slightly greater gross margin expansion in Q3 and Q4 as compared to Q2.","Paul Trussell","I really appreciate that color. My quick follow up is just regarding the product pipeline. You spoke about a lot of the exciting platforms that are delivering results for you already. Just curious if there\u2019s a way that you could maybe rank for us your excitement or how you think about the platforms and new areas of innovation that will drive these strong high-single digit revenue gains over the balance of the year as we think about Joyride and Air Max now moving to 200, what you\u2019re doing in women\u2019s, just any color on that would be helpful? Thank you.","Mark Parker","Yes, absolutely. The excitement meter is very high over this next year. We sort of look at the Summer Olympics as term papers due and so we\u2019re \u2013 this is the time when we bring our best work not only from a brand standpoint but certainly from a product standpoint. And in this case both performance-based innovation that actually leverages into sport style or sportswear, so we feel like the portfolio of innovation or the pipeline of innovation is more complete. I always talk about the complete offense and that\u2019s how we line up innovation is against our complete offense.","You mentioned women\u2019s. I would include core in that, more accessibly priced innovation coming particularly in the spring\/summer seasons. We\u2019ve got incredible again sportswear. We\u2019ve good performance up in here for a long time at NIKE and some of the most incredible breakthroughs in performance coming for the Tokyo Olympics building on some of the great platforms that we\u2019ve learned how to leverage more completely. That includes the cadence of the innovations, how we manage the lifecycle of innovations and how we again leverage that across multiple categories both in performance and sportswear. So incredibly high level of excitement. I would add we\u2019ve talked about adapt. It\u2019s still in the early stages.","NIKE Fit will include both the powered adaptive systems as well as non-powered hands free systems and that\u2019s incredibly exciting as we bring innovation to more \u2013 make innovation more accessible to more people. Women\u2019s of course will continue to be a high priority. We\u2019re shifting resources to amp up our innovation agenda there, feel really good both footwear and apparel. Kids I mentioned is an incredible category to leverage the innovation that we have more completely across the portfolio, so that\u2019s a major source for us for growth as well. So I think the opportunities ahead are as bright as I\u2019ve ever seen them, so very bullish.","Paul Trussell","Sounds like --","Mark Parker","Okay. Operator?","Operator","Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Omar Saad","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on another great quarter. I wanted to ask my first question, another follow up on North America. The 30% DTC growth obviously that\u2019s a huge number, a smaller piece of the business. We talked about that still kind of being offset by the intentional reduction and undifferentiated of the wholesale. If we think about when DTC \u2013 kind of the time horizon looking out when the DTC just to become a material mover for the overall North American market or you get to a point where you\u2019re happy with kind of the wholesale footprint. And then I have another follow up for Mark as well. Thanks.","Andy Campion","Yes, Omar, we at our Investor Day a couple of years ago talked about our business being 30% or greater digital, owned and partnered over the next five years. That\u2019s a global measure of success, but I would say North America is in that same range in terms of the [indiscernible]. So we see digital alone not necessarily all of NIKE direct, but digital alone being in that range. And as we\u2019ve discussed we see that continuing to build beyond that and potentially accelerating towards that date based on the incredible momentum that we\u2019ve had.","As I noted, that was an accelerated level of growth in NIKE digital in Q1. So much like we discussed at our Investor Day two years ago, our view is that over the next five years, sustainable profitable growth in North America would equate to a mid-single digit range of growth. But what we\u2019re really excited about is we think the next five years in North America is building the platform for the long term future. North America is the marketplace where the most reshaping and transformation is required and frankly is underway.","Omar Saad","Got it. And then stepping back, I don\u2019t think and watching the different components of the company perform year-after-year or quarter-after-quarter, I\u2019ve never seen such consistent positive performance across categories, regions, price points, channels, age groups, genders. Maybe help us understand \u2013 NIKE obviously performed exceptionally in the past, but maybe if you can help us understand or give us some insight into why that kind of broader platform seems to be performing so much more consistently than it has historically? Thanks.","Mark Parker","I think we\u2019re actually a lot smarter about how we \u2013 not only where we invest in terms of new product innovation but as I said we better leverage that innovation across multiple categories and then up and down the price point spectrum across genders. Again, I was fixated on complete offense and it\u2019s one of those areas where you go no matter how well we\u2019re doing across all those dimensions, we see more opportunity areas where we have \u2013 we are underpenetrated where we have what we call outsized opportunities. We\u2019ve talked about apparel. We\u2019ve talked about women\u2019s, digital, international as examples.","But even in our foundational business I think we\u2019ve got tremendous upside ahead in terms of core. Striking that right balance across the complete portfolio or the complete offense as we call it is never ending challenge for us or opportunity, let me put it that way. So the innovation that we\u2019re putting out there I think we\u2019re just getting better at how we\u2019re leveraging that across the entire offense. And I feel like this has always been a competitive advantage for NIKE as the source of brand energy but also tremendous growth for us and I\u2019ve never seen or been at NIKE during a period where there\u2019s such robust and strong innovation that\u2019s relevant to consumers across the portfolio.","That said, I\u2019d be the first one as people here at NIKE would tell you to say that we have a lot more opportunity. So the challenge or the opportunity is to focus on the things that matter the most. We have unlimited opportunities. The fixation or the focus on the things that are really going to drive the needle from a consumer standpoint that are really going to be relevant and ultimately drive growth is what creates success.","Andy Campion","And Omar I\u2019d just add maybe from a framework perspective or framing of how you might think about it, our key categories in our 12 key cities and our 10 key countries are really the where in terms of growth opportunity is for NIKE. The consumer direct offense is the how and it applies to all of those categories, all those cities and all those countries and that\u2019s about doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, being faster to market so that\u2019s 2x speed and then being more directly connected to consumers. And there isn\u2019t any dimension of our offense, the complete offense that Mark refers to, that isn\u2019t [indiscernible] can be positively impacted by those strategic principles.","And then of course the overarching or maybe you\u2019d say underlying fuel is this digital transformation of NIKE, it\u2019s impacting everything we do from how we create product to how we assess demand and plan supply all the way through to consumer services through the NIKE app that are now not just in our digital offerings but in our retail stores and increasingly in our partner doors. So it\u2019s really a strategy the consumer racked off in the sense of that, impacting every dimension of the portfolio.","Mark Parker","Yes, I want to put an exclamation point on that. The digital capabilities that we\u2019re creating and investing in are really going to make us a better innovation company understanding the consumer, serving the consumer, leveraging the innovation that we invest in, it\u2019s all making us better. I see so much more opportunity from advancing our digital capabilities going forward.","Okay. Operator, maybe we have time for one more call.","Operator","Our last question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Your line is open.","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple of questions from me on the gross margin. Andy, as we think about gross margin in the context of historical performance, you\u2019ve got pricing power afforded by innovations, structural shifts from outgrowth of direct, you\u2019re reshaping the North American marketplace and then some more nuance factors that can help margin like leveraging Celect and NIKE Fit and so forth. Is there a reason to think that NIKE gross margin shouldn\u2019t go past peaks in the near future? It seems like a lot of good things are coming together.","Andy Campion","The short answer is no. I think many of the drivers you mentioned and some others are long-term drivers of expansion in margin. NIKE direct is a significantly higher margin business than the wholesale business and as we just touched on as part of Omar\u2019s question, we see digital and direct being increasingly larger part of our business long term. The price value equation is also an opportunity to expand margin.","And as Mark just touched on, we\u2019ve never been more excited about the innovation pipeline we\u2019re bringing to market and that means bringing tangible value to the consumer. In your own question you touched on a huge opportunity. At our Investor Day we talked about the potentially significant impact from having a greater mix of full-price sell through and lower markdowns and closeout, and Celect is just spot on in terms of the capabilities that we had planned to build organically but are now able to start leveraging, thanks to this acquisition and drive that.","If I was to tell you the one thing that we\u2019re not as pleased about are the FX headwinds that have impacted us. As I touched on, on the call over the last four years we\u2019ve had about $3 billion headwind on revenue and $1.5 billion more headwind on profitability. Of course, if we could add this back we would. That would be a pretty significant expansion in our operating margin that\u2019s more reflective of what we\u2019re doing from an operating perspective. But again, the short answer is yes. We see some pretty systemic drivers of gross margin expansion over the short, medium and long term.","Jim Duffy","And then as it relates to FX and gross margin, to what extent are more favorable hedge rates a positive contributor to gross margin in the first quarter and fiscal '20?","Andy Campion","Yes, the way I would think about FX in fiscal year '20 is we came into the year expecting FX to be sort of neutral to slightly favorable. It\u2019s now a net negative from an EBIT perspective. Again that\u2019s in the context of our slightly improved guidance, so we are thrilled that our operational performance just continues to be so strong that it\u2019s offsetting that. Over the balance of the year one thing to keep in mind is it\u2019s somewhat difficult to predict \u2013 not to predict but to model the impact of FX.","You have very volatile actual spot rates. Certainly the Renminbi is at the top of the list in that regard of late. The timing of our hedges over the course of the year as well as the timing which is kind of backward looking timing aspect in terms of when we lock in product costs. So I think that the easiest way for me to say it is, FX will be about 3 points negative headwind on revenue as I spoke about in my guidance. It will be a slightly negative impact on margin over the course of the full fiscal year and it\u2019s now shifted to a slightly negative impact from an EBIT perspective.","Mark Parker","We\u2019re hopeful that those are more transient impacts. And that as we go forward and we get more certainty with respect to trade and some resolution that maybe we see things turn from a headwind into a tailwind.","Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thank you everybody. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Take care. Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release which was issued about an hour ago and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Charlie Denson, President of the Nike brand and finally you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks we will take your questions.","We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Kelley and hello everybody. I feel good about Q3, another very strong quarter for Nike. Our results show the power of our strategy to manage the pace and the quality of growth. Nike, Inc. third quarter revenues were 9% on a reported basis and up 10% on a currency neutral basis. That growth was well balanced across most of our brands, key categories and geographies. Gross margin grew 30 basis points versus prior year, better than projected. Diluted earnings per share outpaced revenue growth, up 20% to $0.73. Those are outstanding results that illustrate the value of having deep and genuine connections to athletes. We learn from them and they inspire us and the results show that consumers continue to see the value of products that deliver innovation in iconic style, which is really at the heart of what we do at Nike. This focusing delivering consumer-wide product and services has helped us continued to drive growth even in uncertain economic times.","We have a very powerful portfolio of businesses and resources, and we manage every piece of our business individually and as a collective. We know that our areas of the business will grow at the same pace or at the same time. What we are able to do is, leverage the strongest parts of the business to fund investments in long-term growth across the portfolio. We also focused on managing the levers of the profit equation balancing revenue growth, gross margin expansion and cost. Our goal is to deliver consistent profitable growth at the NIKE, Inc. level, even though there will be variability in the individual components. That is the nature of a globally diverse business.","My leadership team and I remain laser focused on managing the portfolio to capture the opportunities it creates. This was on full display in Q3. The Nike brand continues to expand the market and gain share in North America, incredible performance from our biggest sport businesses across almost the entire category offense.","In China, we are seeing progress against our strategy to reset the marketplace, but we still have more to do we can capture its long-term growth potential.","In Europe, we are still in the early stages of implementing the category offense. Not every country will grow at the same pace, but there is good momentum for Nike in Germany, the UK and in the developing markets of Central and Eastern Europe. I continue to see tremendous potential for growth in Europe over the long-term.","And Converse is connecting with young people on a local level around the world, delivering 12% growth in Q3. As you know, over the last two years, we converted to owned distribution in the UK and China and we are seeing strong results for Converse in both of those markets as we take more control of our brand, distribution and product assortment. If you know me at all, and most of you do, you know that my roots are in design, and I\u2019m an unabashed product geek. So, I want to share a small glimpse, just a sample of what we delivered in Q3, and what you can expect going forward.","Nike Flyknit is a technology that created a lot of excitement right out of the gate with athletes and consumers. We\u2019re already broadening its base across categories and we are blending it with other technologies to achieve new levels of performance like you see in the Nike Flyknit Lunarlon plus running shoe. At the same time, we are able to reduce our environmental footprint. Tremendous potential in Nike Flyknit for the near and the long-term impact across the company.","The Mercurial Vapor IX football boot is the latest iteration in a franchise we started 15 years ago. Today, like then, it\u2019s the lightest, fastest and most ambitious boot design we\u2019ve ever done.","And, we advanced three of the most successful shoe franchises in history. The AIR JORDAN XX8 delivered iconic style and new plate technology. We've added five new styles to the Air Force 1 family. And the Air Max 2013 shoe signaled a reemergence for Nike Air as the standard in impact protection.","We even used a 3D printer to create a state-of-the-art cleated out sole that was used in competition at the NFL Combine, where 7 of the top fastest times were run in cleat. Unbelievable. Footwear is really wide open at NIKE, and so is apparel. Our Nike Pro and Pro Combat base layer and protection products are the most innovative in the industry. Nike Sphere, Dri-FIT Knit, Hyperwarm and Hypercool are game changers in athletic apparel and we are ramping up those investments in apparel performance innovation and it\u2019s really paying off in the marketplace.","In short, we\u2019re flowing amazing products, services and experiences through the innovation pipeline and that\u2019s always been my top priority as CEO, and it\u2019s the source of Nike\u2019s consistent growth over the long-term. Looking ahead there are some amazing opportunities for NIKE, and I will highlight a few.","First, let's focus digital technology. As I said before, it's really an amplifier of what Nike does and it's help dimensional-ize the business in three important ways. Digitally enabled products and services, digital brand connections and e-commerce. We are executing on those opportunities right now.","In the longer term, digital at Nike is really a catalyst for innovation. It\u2019s the currency we use to invest and grow the business the same way NikeFuel points is the currency of movement we use to inspire athletes. More immediately, digital has helped us realize our vision for e-commerce. In Q3, our online business grew 33% outpacing the growth in our total VCC business and for total Nike, Inc. We delivered strong double digit results in our e-commerce every quarter for the past five years.","That said, I am not satisfied. Right now e-commerce is a relatively small portion of our total revenue. There is a pretty big gap between where e-commerce is today and where we can take it. So we are driving more innovation into the shopping experience, elevating the level of service and expanding customization online. At the same time, we are simplifying the user experience, making it easier to find and buy our products. I can assure you, given the size of the opportunity, everyone on the leadership team shares","my sense of urgency around e-commerce.","Second, let\u2019s look at Brazil, a place we have been doing business in for the past 20 years. I was there just last week in Rio and Sao Paulo and the excitement is obvious. Incredible pride and anticipation ahead of World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2016. I am really looking forward to working with those athletes, teams and federations. These events are special in the world, and they serve as inspiration points to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in innovation. They bring out the best of us at Nike. They always have and they always will.","And that brings me to the final thought, something not typically discussed on our earnings call, and that\u2019s the idea of serving human potential. I was in Chicago recently with First Lady Michelle Obama to help launch Let\u2019s Move Active Schools. Nike is pledging $50 million as part of our ongoing commitment to broadening access to sports and helping reverse the crisis of physical inactivity for kids. I mention it for a couple of reasons.","First, it\u2019s a very important personal commitment, and I want to do whatever I can to support it. To raise awareness and serve as a catalyst for others to get involved in this important issue.","Second, it speaks to the core of who we are as a company. Our mission statement focuses on innovation and inspiration, because that\u2019s how we help athletes realize their full potential. We also take an important cue from our co-founder, Bill Bowerman, who said, if you have a body, you are an athlete. It\u2019s a statement of inclusion and it\u2019s a rejection of limits, whether they are self-imposed or put on us by others. I believe that physical activity is an incredibly powerful way to help people overcome those limits and live a stronger, fuller life","So as we move through Q4, I am inspired by the work we are doing at Nike. The management team and the people they lead truly are the best in the industry and that\u2019s good, because the changes we are seeing in the world are fast and they are massive. So are the opportunities. That\u2019s why I am so glad to be at Nike, and so confident about our future.","Thanks everyone and here is Charlie.","Charles Denson","Thanks, Mark and good afternoon, everyone. Well, my focus today is on one of the biggest strengths of the Nike Brand, specifically the Category Offense and how it drives growth across products in our key markets. You saw that reflected in our financial results for the quarter.","On a constant currency basis, Nike Brand global revenue was up 10%. We saw growth across most key categories and geographies. Nike Brand DTC revenue increased 23%, driven by 12% comp store growth and a strong increase of online sales of 33%. Footwear grew at 9% rate and apparel grew at 8%. Global Futures were up 7%.","There is a common story inside these results and across every category in the Nike Brand. First, there are huge opportunities for NIKE to grow. And second, we get after that growth in three very specific ways. Innovative products, strong consumer connections and premium distribution. These are the three pillars to our growth strategy and we leverage them in every NIKE Brand category and market throughout our diverse portfolio of businesses.","I highlight this on every call, because it's critical to our success. One of the most exciting parts of our business right now is running. In Q3, running revenue grew double digits for the 13th quarter in a row and the futures were up double digits in nearly every geography. We're on a roll, but the question people ask is can we keep it up. We think the simple answer is, yes, and here is why I'm confident about that. Two main reasons, running participation continues to grow around the world and we continue to develop and introduce new and compelling products.","Let's start with NIKE Free and Lunar, unique technology platforms that resonate with runners around the world. Then, there's Nike Flyknit. We're just getting started here, less labor, virtually no waste. As we scale and expand our offerings, it adds a new dimension for running and potential to expand to additional categories.","Next, the Air Max 2013, it demonstrates the tremendous potential of the Air Max franchise and Nike Air cushioning and we are designing and engineering both, to take cushioning to a completely new level, which will energize Nike Air across all categories, and that's just footwear.","Running apparel is growing at a similar rate, driven by our Dri-FIT technology and premium apparel styles, which has been one of the fastest growing segments for the overall running category. We also continue to see very strong results in our women's running business as well.","The final piece that gives us confidence our running will continue to grow is our complementary position with our sportswear. For most average runners, it's more than just an activity. It's a lifestyle and we have the breadth and depth of innovation to serve their every need and to grow this business going forward. Bottom line, running is not a trend at NIKE, it's a commitment. And when we help runners train, compete and express, we win.","So, let's go to basketball. It's another strong business for us and growing bigger and more global every day. We see a ton of potential in basketball and where we see potential, that's where we invest. You know, over the last decade, we've been getting to know some special athletes. It started back in 2003, when we signed Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Carmelo Anthony. We thought it could be the early beginning of a resurgence in basketball. Then came something we didn't, or we hadn't seen since the game changing era of Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen in 90s. We added the talents of Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and Russell Westbrook to the NIKE team. It's a pretty special group.","Now, as we watch this group move into their prime, basketball is again one of the most compelling sports around the world. Their time has come and we're in a great position to take advantage of it. We saw in London with the men's and women's U.S. teams taking gold. We are witnessing greatness as LeBron and the Miami Heat, push the limits of records that have stood for decades. As we speak, yes as we speak, March Madness is shifting into high gear. All of it, setting viewership records worldwide, not just here in the U.S.","Our marquee styles from Kobe, LeBron, and Kevin Durant, sell through faster than ever. We feel great about our ability to expand our success with additional sportswear businesses in both, footwear and apparel. And in the Jordan brand, we are getting even more aggressive on the performance side of the business. In a game full of icons, there is no stronger one-two punch than Nike Basketball and the Jordan brand. Needless to say, we are very excited about the future of our basketball business.","So just like we leverage the diversity of our key categories, we also leverage, market opportunity in our geographic portfolio. Mark mentioned Western Europe, that landscape remains a bit uneven, but we saw a strong growth in the quarter with revenues up 8%. The northern territories are showing some real energy, but the south, specifically Italy and Iberia, will take longer to gain their footing as economic challenges remain. That said, we continue to see tremendous growth potential for Western Europe long-term and our efforts so far in transforming the marketplace to align with category offense are proving us out.","Our emerging markets continue to increase revenue and expand opportunity, delivering 8% currency neutral revenue growth for the quarter. Great potential for continued growth in this geography, as you can see by our Futures numbers, which were up 16%. Mark mentioned Brazil, which I am especially excited about as we gear up for the World Cup, which is now just 15 short months away.","Of course, our biggest geography is North America. In Q3, North America delivered another powerful quarter. Revenue is up 18%. Nike\u2019s performance in this market continues to outperform expectations. How big can this market get? I guess that\u2019s a good question, but it\u2019s not the one we ask. We focus on building healthy, sustainable and profitable businesses. We do that by investing where the greatest growth opportunities exist.","North America is a big business for us. We talk about it as one business, but in reality it\u2019s a portfolio of businesses. We look at every part of the business as a leverage opportunity to grow the Nike brand. I think the biggest strength of our North America business is our ability to run a complete offense. We drive very strong performance in our running, basketball and men\u2019s training categories. That\u2019s something we certainly feel good about.","I am equally confident in areas where we have even more room to run - Women\u2019s training, sportswear, digital products and services, apparel, and e-commerce. They all represent material growth opportunities for the brand. It\u2019s a pretty impressive portfolio. It gives us great flexibility and adaptability to serve consumer demand and address a very competitive marketplace.","We still see opportunities to continue to transform the marketplace along the lines of that Category Offense we talked about. The Nike brand is stronger and more relevant than ever before in North America and growing. Our distribution continues to get deeper, more targeted and more productive. I have tremendous confidence in these fundamentals. They continue to make North America a great opportunity for Nike, and they are a blueprint for growth around the world.","So next up, let me talk a little bit about China. On the last call we talked about our strategy for China, how we are continuing to adapt and elevate our apparel products, investing in brand connections with consumers, and improving productivity at retail. This strategy represents a comprehensive and balanced approach to resetting this important market.","Near-term, we are continuing to focus on aggressively clearing inventory from the marketplace. In Q3, we have introduced improved merchandising assortments in our DTC doors, delivering mid-teen comp store sales growth. Our wholesale partners continue to report they are seeing some positive comp store growth as well and its those partner doors where we have transformed the spaces to align with our Category Offense, we are seeing comp store results that significantly outpace the rest of the fleet.","While we continue to see progress, we still have work to do to clean up the market. At the same time, we are taking a harder look at our supply into the China market. This means re-phasing product flow and closely managing cancellations and at-once orders to more tightly control the volume of the product going into the market. As a result of these efforts, reported revenues for China will look different than our Q3 Futures might indicate.","As we work to manage inventory, we also continue to focus on improving productivity and sell-through, which are at the core of sustainable growth long term. Specifically, we will continue transforming doors to align with the Category Offense and increase focus on product assortments that are deeper in fewer categories. Most importantly, we continue to invest in our brand and our relationship with the Chinese consumer.","All of these efforts are going to take some time. So we are being aggressive where we can and patient where we must. Our purpose and our opportunity is to create a strong pull market. We do that by being the most exciting and relevant brand, the creator of the most important innovation and a source for the most exciting retail. China is an important part of Nike\u2019s long-term growth goals. That\u2019s why we are not taking any shortcuts in China. We will take the time to do it right.","So, in all, Q3 was a very strong quarter for the Nike brand, but as you know, we don't focus on one quarter or category or event. We will always stay focused on building the brand and the business for the long-term and taking advantage of our biggest opportunities for the short-term. Everybody at Nike knows the goals and the strategy and we are all working together to get better, stronger and more profitable in every dimension of the business. That's why we are confident about the future.","Thanks, and here is Don.","Donald Blair","Thanks, Charlie. I would like to start by outlining three characteristics of Nike that we believe underpin our valuations.","First, our track record of delivering consistent growth in revenue, earnings and cash returns to shareholders. Second, our long-term growth opportunities and our proven ability to realize them. And, third, the diversification, discipline and financial strength to effectively manage risk. Our third quarter results vividly illustrate each of these characteristics.","In Q3, we delivered strong growth. Revenue grew 9%, up 10% on a currency-neutral basis, while earnings per share for the quarter grew 20%. Our return on invested capital expanded to 23%. And for the quarter, we returned over $400 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","At the same time, we continue to strengthen our long-term growth prospects by deepening our connections with consumers, along each of the dimensions of our business, brands, categories, geographies, and product types, enabling us to grow even in highly penetrated segments. As both Mark and Charlie described, we delivered an unprecedented level of innovation to the market in Q3 and consumers are responding. Finally, Q3 demonstrated our capacity to manage risk.","As Mark indicated, our goal is delivering sustainable profitable growth. That requires continuous adjustment to changes in the global economy and the business environment. We do this by leveraging the strongest parts of our portfolio to fund investments in others. We do it by managing all of our financial levers to deliver near-term profitability and invest for the future, and we do it by maintaining financial discipline and a strong balance sheet to provide flexibility in a volatile environment.","With that introduction, I'll recap Q3 results for our continuing operations. Third quarter revenue for NIKE, Inc. and the Nike Brand grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, while our other businesses grew 9%. On a reported basis, futures grew 6%. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures advanced 7%, driven by 4% growth in units and a 3 point increase in average price.","Currency-neutral futures were higher for all geographies, except Western Europe, which fell 5% versus a strong prior year, driven by the Euro Champs and Olympics. Futures for Greater China were up 3%, reflecting the timing of fall orders and strong growth in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Futures for Mainland China were flat. As I'll discuss in a moment, we do not believe Greater China futures orders are indicative of the revenue growth we expect to realize for this geography in Q4.","Third quarter diluted EPS grew 20% to $0.73 driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as the lower tax rate and share count. Q3 gross margin increased 30 basis points versus last year as higher prices and easing raw material costs more than offset the impact of labor cost inflation, higher discounts, FX headwinds and shifts in our business mix to lower margin geographies.","Gross margin for the quarter was better than we anticipated as a shift in mix to higher margin products more than offset higher discounts and reserves in China. Demand creation grew 5% for the quarter, below the rate of revenue growth due largely to the timing of spending across quarters, particularly Q1 investments focused on the Euro Champs, Olympics, and NFL launch.","Operating overhead grew 11% for the quarter due to growth in our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business, as well as continued investments to support our innovation and growth initiatives. The effective tax rate for Q3 was 22.8%, compared to 27.7% in Q3 of last year. The decrease is largely due to a lower effective tax rate for foreign operations and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit which provided a one-time benefit of $0.02 per share.","For Q4 and the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of about 25.5%. Q3 inventories for NIKE, Inc. and the Nike Brand, each grew 4% versus last year, well below the rate of revenue and futures growth. Overall inventory levels are healthy as the proportion of closeouts is roughly in line with the prior year. Our main area of focus for inventory management continues to be China, as we take action to balance supply and demand at retail. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on the books at quarter-end.","Now, let's take a look at our performance by segment, starting with China. Q3 revenue for Greater China declined 10% on a constant currency basis and fell 9% on a reported basis. EBIT decreased 20%. We are continuing to take decisive actions to reestablish a pull market in China and our Q3 results reflect the impact of those actions, as both revenue and gross margin were below the prior year.","As Charlie indicated, we are seeing some early signs that our strategies are taking hold. While we are making progress, we are not done. We will continue to work with our retailers to right-size inventory, accelerate sell-through and improve retail productivity. Consistent with our accounting policies, we have made provisions for expected returns and discounts in our Q3 results and we will be tightening the amount of product we ship into the market over the next few quarters. As a result, we expect Q4 reported revenues for Greater China will be lower than the future's orders would indicate.","On our last conference call, we said we expected repositioning our business would take time and that revenues and EBIT for Greater China would be below prior year levels for a few quarters. That's still our expectation and the Nike, Inc. guidance I give you in a moment will include our most current thinking.","At Nike, we are focused on driving growth that's brand-accretive, sustainable, and profitable. We are absolutely confident we are taking the right actions to extend our brand leadership in China and return our business to growth.","At the other end of the scale is North America where Q3 revenue grew 18% on both a reported and currency neutral basis. Footwear revenue increased 15% and apparel revenue grew 22%. Strong growth in basketball, men's training, running, and sportswear fueled the increase. Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 19%, driven by 12% comp store sales growth. Q3 EBIT for North America grew 24% as revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage all contributed to increased profitability.","In Western Europe, Q3 revenue increased 8% on both a reported and currency neutral basis. Wholesale revenue grew in all territories except Italy and Iberia where currency neutral revenues declined 17% and 29%, respectively. DTC revenue grew 24%, driven by strong comp store growth in both inline and factory stores.","On a category basis, growth in Western Europe was led by running and basketball, which both grew double-digits for the fourth quarter in a row, and sportswear, which posted high single-digit growth. Q3 EBIT for Western Europe grew 19%, driven by revenue growth, higher gross margin, and SG&A leverage.","In Central and Eastern Europe, revenue increased 13% on a currency neutral basis, powered by particularly strong results in Russia and Turkey. Revenues were higher in nearly every key category, led by running, women's training, sportswear and football. On a reported basis revenue for CEE grew 16% and EBIT increased 18% driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion.","Results in Japan continue to be mixed. Q3 result revenue fell 6% on a currency neutral basis, largely as a result of steps we are taking to segment the market and significantly lower closeout sales but currency neutral futures grew 5%. Although reported revenue for Japan decreased 13%, reflecting the weaker Yen, EBIT was flat, driven by gross margin expansion. Our emerging markets geography delivered solid growth in Q3 as revenue grew 8% on a currency neutral basis.","Growth was broad-based as revenues were up in every category except sportswear and nearly every territory grew. Our Q3 results in Korea and Argentina were somewhat weaker than the rest of the geography due in part to macroeconomic conditions in those markets. Nevertheless, currency neutral futures grew 16%, indicating continued strength in this geography.","On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for emerging markets grew 6% while EBIT grew 3% as gross margin expansion was more than offset by increased investments in SG&A. The third quarter revenues for our other businesses increased 9% on both, the reported and currency neutral basis driven by growth at Converse and Nike Golf. EBIT for the group increased 23%, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margins for all three businesses.","Looking forward, our expectations for fiscal 2013 remain largely unchanged, but our guidance reflects updated expectations for China and the phasing of growth across Q3 and Q4. For revenue, we continue to expect full-year reported revenue to grow at a mid to high single-digit rate. For Q4, we expect reported revenue to grow at a mid-single digit rate as we anniversary strong revenues in last year's Q4, which benefited from the Euro Champs, Olympics and NFL launch.","For gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2013 will be roughly in line with the prior year. For Q4, we now expect expansion of approximately 50 basis points, reflecting updated projections for product mix as well as discounts and reserves in China. We continue to expect full-year SG&A to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate, reflecting mid-single digit growth in Q4, as we anniversary heavy demand creation investments in last year's fourth quarter.","While we haven't yet completed our planning for fiscal '14, we can provide some initial thoughts. Given the strength of our brands and the innovations we'll be bringing to consumers, we expect to see full-year revenue growth at or slightly above our high single-digit target range and EPS growth approaching our long-term mid-teens target. We'll provide more visibility to our FY '14 expectations when we report our year-end results in June.","As always, we are focused on managing our portfolio and our financial model to deliver profitable growth and shareholder returns in the near-term investing to realize our future potential and managing risk in a volatile environment. The strength of our brand and our businesses puts us on track to finish a strong fiscal 2013 and positions us well for continued profitable growth in fiscal 2014 and beyond.","We're now ready to take your questions.","Kelley Hall","Operator, can you please queue the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.","Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital","Hi. I guess the two questions that I have. The first one, can you elaborate a little bit more, just sort of how out of whack do you feel like the China market is with the supply\/demand and sort of how much more work you really have on the inventory side? A the second one is just quickly is on Western Europe like the footwear business was still very, very strong this quarter. Just elaborate a little bit more on the running, what's driving those businesses right now? Thank you.","Charlie Denson","Hi, Bob. This is Charlie. I'll take the China one first. I don't know if I categorize it as out of whack, but I think what we see in China is just that it's still a very robust marketplace. We still believe in it long-term and it's a matter of cleaning up some of the inventory that we have in there and then moderating the flow that's going in, so that we are pulling it out and pushing them at the right pace to get us back to that pull market.","I will just go back to the three things that we are really focused on and that's continuously building a great brand that we can obviously use as a launching pad for the future. It's going to be grounded in performance and we are going to have a premium position in the marketplace.","The second would be just the product, some of the product issues that we've talked about, primarily in apparel with some of the fed issues. We feel like we're starting to get some of that addressed and some of the new product is finding its way into the market and performing well. And then finally, just around the distribution piece and making sure that we've got a great consumer experience there that we have part of that consumer experience is obviously finding what you are looking for in the right size, in the right color. So a lot of that has to do with product flow and a little bit narrower presentation in each of the different retail spaces.","I think where we have started to transform some of those spaces, as we referred to earlier, some of the results are significantly better than what we are seeing across the rest of the fleet. So we are still very optimistic on the long-term. We feel like we have a good handle on where we are at and what we need to do and we are just going to get after it.","Kelley Hall","Second question was footwear in Western Europe?","Bob Drbul - Barclays Capital","Western Europe, yes.","Charlie Denson","Yes, and there again, it's a little bit of a tale of the north and the south. The challenges are in the south with Iberia and Italy, but we have a great performance story in running. We are even starting to see some interest in basketball in Western Europe. But it's really being driven by the running business. Then we had a very nice response to some of the new introductions of our sportswear footwear business as well. Those are the two things that are driving most of the Western European success right now.","Mark Parker","Yes, I am going to just jump in and add Germany is performing quite well for us, footwear and just overall. The business there, the strength of the brand, the flow of the product, the reaction from the consumers has really been real strong. So, the U.K. and Germany are really leading the charge in Western Europe.","Just a comment on footwear in general. We have always set a high bar, but we are doing a better job at leveraging our innovation across multiple categories. Charlie mentioned the new Max technology which has been incredible to sell through on that product and we are able to leverage that across multiple categories as we move forward. The Lunar, the Flyknit, the Free, some of the other platforms that we have been investing in, we are starting to see those really resonate across multiple categories.","Then the balance between both performance in sportswear and footwear is actually quite impressive, what we call Complete Offense. I think you see that Complete Offense really taking shape in footwear between performance and sportswear.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Two quick questions. The first is just could you give us a little more color on the futures orders? Maybe the balance of the futures in the window for the global number? Was it constant for the window ahead or weighted towards the front half? Then the revenue guidance for fiscal '14 implies pretty healthy futures orders continue. The comparisons are a little easier than what we just saw. Am I thinking about that the right way?","The second question is, Don, can you give us a little color on the gross margin thoughts around that fiscal '14 guidance you gave us? Thanks.","Charlie Denson","Okay, well. With respect to the futures we announced today, they are more back-loaded and you would expect that because we are overlapping the pretty heavy sales numbers, big sales numbers we had in last year's fourth quarter behind the European Championships and the Olympics and the NFL launch. So the futures are back-loaded in the window.","As far as FY '14 is concerned, Rob, as you know, we are going to give you most of the color commentary on that in June. So I don't want to get in too deep with that. But what I would say is, we feel very good about the overall momentum we have got. I mean, Charlie and Mark talked a lot about innovation and the way the consumers are responding. We have also seen pretty broad-based success with the Category Offense. So, that's really a reflection of where we see the momentum in the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane - Citi","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Don, you had mentioned overall inventories for the company were healthy, but I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail around inventory levels in Europe, and is that still weighing on gross margins at all.","Donald Blair","We have some pockets in Europe with some promotional, we call it promo product. It\u2019s a product that we would do for athletes. There is a little bit more specialized apparel products, we may have some pockets. But generally, we feel if you look at this on a global basis, we are in good shape. We are always going to have some areas of excess around the company, but one of the great things about the factory store network that we built over time is that we have got the ability to liquidate a lot of these products at a profit.","So we feel, overall we are in a pretty good shape. As I noted in my prepared remarks, the one place that we are really laser-focused right now is on China. And as Charlie said, we are confident that we are going to work our way through that.","Kate McShane - Citi","Okay. That's great. And my second question is on the women's category. I wondered if you could talk at all about how women's footwear and apparel performed during the quarter and what your expectations are for this category as retailers start to concentrate a little bit more on this initiative?","Charlie Denson","Hi, Kate. This is Charlie. I don't have the footwear numbers right in front of me, but I think I can very easily and confidently tell you that the running category is leading the way.","Our women's running business is incredibly strong and we feel very, very good about it and then I will echo that in some of our new apparel offerings. I think some of the new presentations that you've seen in women's training in some of the stores certainly has resonated with the consumer performing very well and we are starting to scale that on a much faster pace.","And so I think, I would say the U.S. market is leading the charge here and we feel very confident that as I said earlier, we had some real running room here and some potential opportunity. I think as well you can look to Western Europe and expect some good things coming out of there as well, so hopefully that answers your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial","Hi. Just going back to China for a second, the positive currency neutral futures versus your thought process about the revenue decline, just maybe talk a little bit about why the difference? Just specifically what's going on and are we going to continue to see futures increase, is this just a short-term situation this quarter? Just maybe explain a little more in depth in terms of what's going on the puts and takes there between revenues and futures?","Donald Blair","Sure. The equation is extremely complex. There's a lot of different variables, but let me see if I can just simplify it a little bit here. We take orders for futures well in advance of when they go into the marketplace. But what we are always doing is, as Charlie talked about, is managing to a pool market, so we are really always very focused on making sure that the product is moving through the supply chain smoothly and that we don't let too much product back up and when we do start to see that situation we are going to restrict the supply that goes into the marketplace.","So, the difference between what we expect to see going forward on revenues versus futures is that we are going to be putting less product in the marketplace than what was in the original futures order to make sure we manage the supply. If you're looking at what actually affected your Q3 results, we had those factors plus we were doing a little more discounting as well as making provision for bringing some product out of the market. So those, reserves that we would take for either discounts or returns to stock would actually affect the revenue number. The ultimate goal of all of this is to accelerate the productivity of the retail stores in the marketplace to accelerate the sell-through and make sure the Brand stays fresh.","Charlie Denson","And I would just add just one other point in the sense that the Mainland China futures number was flat. We've got a much more mature business in both Hong Kong and Taiwan and they are not unsubstantial. Those businesses are performing extremely well and so that's also affecting this number a little bit.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial","Okay. Thanks, Charlie, and my second question, I guess for Charlie, for you. I guess when you think about the basketball business, which has seen great momentum and everyone continues to talk about increasing over buy towards basketball, how you're managing allocation, the integrity of the Jordan Brand at scarcity, whether it's Air Force 1, whatever the case might be in that business to continue to drive it? Just maybe talk a little about that as more and more retailers talk about trying to get more and more basketball product into the marketplace?","Charlie Denson","Yes, it's one of the better problems I like to talk about, I guess, is the demand that we have and the building demand. The allocation process is something that we have used for a long time. We feel confident and comfortable on our ability to manage it. I think some of the challenges become logistically how much product gets to where and when.","That's been a challenge at times over the last couple of years. But as demand grows, we will continue to increase production against that demand. We certainly want to keep some of the very high-end products on a very short lease, so to speak, with regards to availability, but it's a tool that we use. We use it well. It's something we will continue to use but we will increase volumes as demand increases and continue to grow the business.","Mark Parker","I just want to jump in and remind you of the power of diversity that we have in basketball between the innovation that we talked about between the number of athletes we have to work with, as Charlie mentioned, the franchises we can work with in both Jordan, which are obvious the Air Force 1 and NIKE Basketball, the Dunk and others, Laser, other great franchises. Then of course, as Charlie mentioned the one-two punch between NIKE and Jordan brands. It's a great, great example of a full offense within a key category.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Guys, good afternoon and congrats on a great quarter. I apologize if you have already talked about this, but in the futures window, could you comment on units versus ASP or mix for us, please.","Donald Blair","Yes, in the prepared remarks the units are up four, the ASP is up three.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay, thanks. Can you help us think about over the next few quarters how we should think about China profitability or the margins there? Obviously that compressed quite a bit in this quarter. Maybe help us think a little bit more over the medium term about how you guys are thinking about that right now?","Donald Blair","Well, in the near-term, as you manage through an inventory situation, you are going to see some pressure on the margins. The benefit of moving towards a higher productivity model at retail is, that's a more profitable model for everybody. So, the management of that marketplace, as we said, we are really focused on putting that in a sustainable profitable growth position.","Charlie spoke to this, but the underpinnings of this are strong brand, driving a highly productive retail environment and we have done those things. We have a premium brand in China. We are bringing innovation to the market and we believe we can make the distribution system much more productive and that will let us keep our margins at a pretty robust level.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay, so even though we look at the margin compare gets a lot easier in the fourth quarter, maybe the message is, don't get carried away yet?","Donald Blair","Well, as we said, we think it's going to take us a few quarters to work our way through this. I like Charlie's phrasing on this. We are very aggressive. We are going to move as quick as we can, but we are going to be patient where we need to be to get it right.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay, and if I could just ask one more. The inventories had about a three point impact from FX, but the futures only about one point. Can we imply that product costs are negative at this point for you?","Donald Blair","Well, let me frame it a little differently, because there's a lot of changes in product mix but if you look at the actual product cost themselves, we are seeing labor cost inflation and we are seeing a bit of a tailwind now because raw material costs are easing. Those things are largely balancing out and we are also seeing ongoing increases in price. So that's why the margins are starting to head up.","If you look at all of our geography businesses and all of our non-Nike branded businesses, the only business where we had margins down was China. All the rest were up. So we are starting to see some positive movement there. There is currency. There is many other factors but that's bottom-line what's really driving it. We are starting now to see that the pricing and the material leasing is offsetting the labor cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon. So as we think about the expense side of the ledger into next year at the level of revenues that you guided to? Would there be any investment constrains to note to prevent potential leverage next year?","Donald Blair","I'm sorry, would there be any investment constraints to note that would prevent leverage?","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Basically if you hit your revenue guidance embedded within approaching the long-term model. Are there any investments to think about on the SG&A side to prevent leverage?","Donald Blair","Yes. I think at this point, we gave you the top and the bottom line, and obviously that would imply some leverage at the EPS level. At this stage, I'd rather not got too deep on that, but what I would say is broadly speaking we continue to work towards expanding our margins and we believe that we are going to be investing in the kinds of innovation and growth drivers that you have seen us deliver in the third quarter. And, in fact, for the last few years. So, I don't want to actually get too deep into the P&L model until we get to June.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Then, second, can you provide any performance versus expectations with the recent Flyknit expanded launch? And also, the trajectory of this platform over the next couple of years, any examples? How should we think about it? How big could this really be?","Donald Blair","I'd tell you, the demand from a consumer standpoint is huge. It's been steady since we introduced Flyknit this past year, basically catching up to demand. We are working hard to build that capacity. But as I mentioned, we are leveraging Flyknit, not only through running, but across the other categories.","It remains one of the more exciting pieces of innovation, I think, for NIKE, in terms of performance, in terms of the aesthetic, in terms of the sustainability story, but I think and over time as we scale this in terms of the profitability that this represents, it's really changing the game of one of the more expensive pieces of the manufacturing process.","And as we scale this, and I have obviously had glimpses of what's going on within the R&D pipeline and incredibly compelling product. We'll just leave it at that. Very, very exciting, and there is no question in my mind that this technology will allow us to do things we have never ever been able to do before and I think they will continue to resonate at a very high level with consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Thanks. Hello, everyone. So, I'm trying to understand the inventory management strategies in China. Orders are up. Is it simply that partners want the product, but you aren't shipping it to them to save them from themselves and develop an element of scarcity?","Donald Blair","No. I think Jim that's a little oversimplified. Basically, you take an order six months in advance, you estimate what the market demand is going to look like and where the sell-through is going to go and you monitor along the way. That's one of the reasons we measure the sell-through information with our retailers and we put the product in the marketplace based upon the level of demand that we have and the productivity of the retail stores. So, this is a constant process of moving all the levers that you have to make sure that you keep the supply and demand in balance, so this is something we do working with our retailers in making sure we have the right amount of product in the marketplace.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Got you. I was afraid it wasn't that simple. The back half of the futures window in China, Don, would be reflective of the fall winter period, where compares seemed to ease. Are the orders for the back half of the China futures windows indeed stronger as well than the front half?","Donald Blair","The only thing I can say about China going back to the prepared remarks, there was a timing effect in this particular report, because only the first month of futures is included in this window and it actually happened to be a pretty strong month higher than the overall season will be, so that's one of the reasons among others that we told you that those futures numbers are not necessarily what we would expect on revenues.","So, I don't want to get into trying to reconcile individual geography, futures. It just gets too much granularity and detail, but the bottom line is, our guidance says we don't think the revenue is going to be reflective of that level of futures growth. We think it's going to be lower.","Kelley Hall","Operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes Christian Buss with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Christian Buss - Credit Suisse","Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could ask a little bit about the European business. You have been restructuring that business. It looks like you are on the early stages of a margin recovery there. Can you talk to us about your expectations for improvement there? Where do you think you can get to? Can you get back to the historical margin profile of that business, and what would get you there, if so?","Charlie Denson","Yes, well, I am going to talk about the business. I will let Don talk about the margin piece, specifically. But the overall business, as we have referred to a couple of different times, we feel good about things going on in the north. Mark called out the performances in Germany, the U.K. market is coming out of the Olympics healthier than we have seen in a while, the Nordics and areas like that.","The severity of the economic situation in Iberia and Italy, which are substantial markets for us is significant. We are definitely feeling some of that. But overall, as you look at that marketplace and you look at the world of sport and the world of football, which we feel great about going into next year's World Cup, we feel from a brand position and a business position, we are in a really good shape.","Some of the recovery is going to be bumpy. I think we talked about that in some of the prepared remarks based on some of the economic conditions that we are facing. But the consumer proposition, and I guess that's the part I want to make probably the biggest emphasis on, the brand is in very good shape. We feel very good about the opportunity in both the near and mid-term and certainly the long-term. I am optimistically and yet still with some regard to the macros, bullish on Western Europe.","Donald Blair","","Yes, and I think from a profit margin standpoint, I do believe we can improve profit margins over time and that's indeed what we aspire to do around the world. One thing to bear in mind with Western Europe is if you go back two or three years, which is where I think you are referencing you have to recall the Euro at $1.45 and today we are seeing Euro to $1.25. So I think there is an impact on the margin from the value of the Euro but an evolution of where we see the margin is going. Yes, we think that as that geography grows we can continue to improve profitability.","Kelley Hall","Alright, well thank you everyone. That ends our call for Q3 and we look forward to chatting with you again in Q4.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

For those who need to reference today's press release, you'll find it at http:\/\/investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to a mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE Inc.'s continuing operations, including equipment, NIKE Golf, converse and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers. Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2013 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com. Also, I would like to emphasize to everyone that today's discussion of our NIKE, Inc. Q2 results will be focused on our continuing operations. As we reported in our Q2 press release, we closed the sale of the Umbro brand in Q2 and are in the process of completing the sale of Cole Haan. And as a result, both of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise specified, all of our comments today will address the results and outlook of our continuing operations.","With that, I would like to introduce our participants for today's call. NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker, will speak first; followed by Charlie Denson, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark G. Parker","Thanks, Kelley, and happy holidays, everybody. Our strong Q2 results and first half performance demonstrates that our strategies are working. For NIKE, everything starts with the consumer. Their insights enable us to innovate and this expands the power of our portfolio and sharpens our focus on the biggest growth opportunities. And that's how we deliver value to our shareholders.","Our Q2 numbers show the right kind of momentum as we head into the back half of the year. NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 7%. Excluding changes in currency, revenues were up 10%. And that growth was well balanced across all brands, key NIKE brand categories and nearly all geographies. Gross margin was down 30 basis points, better than projected and diluted earnings per share growth outpaced revenue growth, up 11% to $1.14.","The global economy is increasingly complex and volatile. The pace of change is accelerated. As leaders of a global company, we need to understand the risks and the opportunity brought by this change. Even more than that, we must remain focused squarely on our business. It's that balance that allows us to create and expand profitable long-term growth, even in challenging conditions.","As I look forward to the remainder of fiscal 2013 and beyond, I want to highlight 3 key drivers of shareholder value: first, our ability to connect and innovate with consumers; second, the power of our portfolio; and third, our ability to leverage both those strategic advantages to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.","For the first driver, shareholder value, let's start where we always do, and that's with the consumer and innovation. We're proud of the breakthrough innovations we've delivered across our portfolio, like Flyknit, FuelBand, Lunar, Free, the NFL products, Pro Combat, Considered Design and many more. And we have even more great opportunities coming up. Innovation at NIKE is about expanding into new spaces and leveraging new ideas and driving growth through new channels. Innovation is about the future.","Digital is a great example. The word itself has become a bit of an industry free-for-all. It's a technology, a platform, data, a product, a sensor, a service, a community, and all of that's true. But it's all short of their role at NIKE. NIKE digital has an amplifier. It highlights and expands the commitments we've had for decades, like listen to the athlete, connect with the consumer, enhance performance, expand the experience of sport and help others and ourselves reach our full potential. Of course, digital affects every part of modern life. But there are 3 very specific parts of our business where we focus our digital investment, and that is: digital-enabled products and services; brand communications; and e-commerce. And all 3 exist to amplify our relationship with the consumer. In products and services, what started out as Nike+ in 2006 has grown into a global community of 10 million and a new generation of devices and data that help people all over the world to become better athletes. In brand communications, our content goes viral and our campaigns are personal, segmented and surgical. We build a 2-way dialogue with our consumers that enables them to connect with NIKE and each other in ways never before possible. This ensures our connections with consumers remain deep, meaningful and relevant, which is really at the heart of what NIKE's been doing since we started. In e-commerce, we connect with consumers and make it easy for them to research, compare, customize and purchase NIKE innovations on their terms around the world. And that helped our revenue from digital commerce grow 39% in Q2. We are just beginning to tap into the potential of digital technology, but we believe the opportunity to drive growth long term is incredible. And we will be investing accordingly to capture that potential in products, in brand and e-commerce.","The second key driver of creating shareholder value is the power of the portfolio. We built a company that creates and leverages opportunity in the high-energy world of sports and youth culture. We design and commercialize more innovation than anyone in our industry. And we do that through a unique and unmatched mix of resources, organization and strategy. Converse, Jordan Brand and Hurley all broaden our consumer base and help grow our core businesses.","And as Charlie will tell you, the NIKE Brand category offense is the industry benchmark for delivering product relevance and consumer excitement. The power of our portfolio gives us options, and sometimes those options require tough decisions by choosing to divest of Cole Haan and Umbro. As we close the sale of the Umbro brand in Q2 and we work to close the sale of the Cole Haan brand in Q3, we'll shift those management and financial resources to the greatest opportunities to create sustainable, profitable growth.","With the divestiture of these businesses, we haven't changed our growth goals; we've highlighted them. We have even sharper focus on the tremendous potential in our core businesses, and we're more confident than ever in our ability to realize that potential. There are many great growth opportunities and stories across our portfolio, and Charlie will go into that in much more detail on the NIKE Brand, but I want to touch on 2 areas: North America and China.","In North America, we've created great momentum. This is somewhat counterintuitive to some, given this market's size and assumed maturity. But I see tremendous growth potential in North America, fueled by our continued success in transforming the marketplace along category lines. Even more exciting, North America's a glimpse into the future: the model for success we continue to adapt in key markets around the world. And one of those key markets, of course, is China. In over 30 years of doing business there, we've learned a lot about the consumer, what they value, how they live and what they want and expect from us. These insights have made NIKE the undisputed leader in this market, and they shape our strategy as we work aggressively to position the marketplace for continued growth. We know what needs to be done in China, and we know we can do it because we've done it before, and we're confident we will continue to grow and lead this market. The progress will not always be linear. Powerful change to unlock potential rarely is, but I truly believe NIKE's long-term opportunity in China is enormous.","And that brings me to the third driver of shareholder value and that's our ability to leverage innovation, consumer connections and the power of the portfolio to create sustainable, profitable growth. And we've done that over a long period of time and under a variety of macroeconomic conditions. Our performance has allowed us to deliver increasing cash returns to our shareholders. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, we completed a $5 billion share repurchase program and began and new 4-year, $8 billion share buyback plan, the largest in our company's history. We announced a 2-for-1 stock split and we increased our quarterly dividend by 17%, marking 11 consecutive years of dividend increases.","As I said, the global economy is complex, it's volatile and changing, and that presents both risks and opportunities. We're very confident we have the strength across our brands, our businesses and our balance sheet, as well as a deep, experienced team to manage the risks and seize the opportunities. In the end, NIKE, Inc. continues to grow and prosper [ph] because of who we are: competitive, innovative and relentless. And I'll take that every time.","So thanks, everybody, and then now here is Charlie to take you through the NIKE Brand.","Charles D. Denson","Thank you, Mark. I'm very bullish on what we continue to see out of the NIKE Brand, and Q2 was no different. Innovative must-have products, strong connections with consumers and another quarter of transforming distribution with our retailers and our own DTC business. We are able to consistently grow because we identify and resource our biggest opportunities. Mark mentioned this in his comments. It's about power of the portfolio. It's the same flexibly and opportunity that defines NIKE, Inc. It also empowers the NIKE Brand.","Q2 was a great example. A strong quarter overall was the major successes in key businesses around the world. On a constant currency basis, the NIKE Brand global revenue was up 11%. We saw growth across all key categories and all geographies, except China. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 27%, driven by a 16% comp store growth and a strong increase in online sales. Footwear and Apparel grew at 10% apiece and global futures expanded 7%.","So let's talk about how that's playing out in some key parts of the NIKE Brand. Specifically, let's look at North America, China and the Emerging Markets, along with a couple of the key categories. North America. We've seen a strong -- we've seen a run of strong double-digit growth quarters in this market, and the momentum continued in Q2 with revenues growing at 17%. Nearly every category was up, led by double-digit growth in Running, Basketball and Men's Training. Footwear revenue increased 13% and apparel grew 19%. North America is a case study in leveraging our strengths in both product, brand, as well as distribution. In product, look at the NFL. It was the most anticipated launches in football and in this market in years. That alone says a lot about our role as an innovator. We delivered a new level of performance and style for every player in the NFL. The success is beyond our expectations, which were pretty high to begin with. We also see a ton of potential for our Amplify Sport Strategy to expand the NFL business into every dimension of the athlete's life, that's how they compete, how they train and how they express themselves. The NFL license is a huge platform for innovation and product, brand and distribution, and not just in football, but across the whole of the Men's Training category. There's a lot more to come on that front.","In brand, we talk a lot about the global stage of sports. We talk about the Olympics, the World Cup, Super Bowl, BCS, March Madness, NBA Finals. They're all big moments for our products and our brand. But as Mark highlighted, digital adds tremendous power in amplifying everything we do. Nike+ is a great example. It's a product, it's a platform for services, it's an ongoing dialogue with our consumers and it's a rapidly growing community that crosses categories, gender, age and geography. Digital at NIKE is like innovation at NIKE. It enables growth and opportunity for the brand.","And so let's talk about distribution. We continue to create differentiated category destinations. Football fans are in Yardline stores at Champs. Runners are in Track Club stores at Finish Line Basketball players are in House of Hoops stores at Foot Locker. Athletes of all types are in Dick's Field House, and we continue to see positive results as our wholesale partners report that the comp store growth for these spaces are exceeding their fleet averages. Consumers are also in our DTC brand and category stores, factory stores and shopping online at nike.com. All of these executions work together to help transform the marketplace and to yield continued strong growth in North America. I believe there will always be opportunity in North America. However, we don't take it for granted. It requires a relentless focus on the consumer and on delivering the products and experiences they demand from us. North America is a major focus for us, and we have every intention of maintaining our leadership position.","Now let's talk about China. As I outlined last quarter, there's a lot going on in this market: an evolving economy, an increasingly sophisticated consumer and a marketplace still challenged with some high inventory levels at retail. We've seen a similar change in other markets, just never at this pace. I also told you we're taking decisive action to position this market for sustainable, profitable growth. Our results in Q2 reflect these actions. Our strategy focuses on 3 things: continuing to build brand connections with our consumers, differentiating consumer experiences at retail to improve productivity and profitability and adapting and elevating our apparel products to align with the needs of the Chinese consumer.","So let's start there. With our connection to Chinese consumers, NIKE is the premium performance brand in China and we'll keep that distinction. We won't sacrifice our brand or the trust of the consumer to chase opportunities not grounded in performance and sport. Anchoring our brand in authentic performance gives us the credibility and relevance to differentiate our products and brand from a sea of competitors. And as we've demonstrated in China and elsewhere around the world, that authenticity allows us to amplify sport and drive sustainable, profitable growth in our Training and Sportswear businesses as well. We believe this is a highly -- we believe this is highly relevant to the needs and aspirations of the Chinese consumer, and we're committed to staying connected with them.","With regard to distribution, we're entering a new phase in China, placing greater focus on improving the productivity and profitability of our retail base. That includes both partner and our own DTC doors. We still expect to increase our square footage over time, but the retail footprint will evolve to bigger, better and more productive retail spaces. We've mapped the key shopping districts and we're beginning to transform the distribution landscape, starting with the locations that matter most, generally the biggest urban centers and their most important shopping districts. We're also increasing our focus on how to better leverage our supply chain and our centralized distribution center.","Even though we're still in the earliest stages of this transformation, we're seeing some encouraging signs. In Q2, our DTC doors continue to perform well, delivering a 10% comp-store growth. And our wholesale partners have reported to us that they are seeing positive comp-store growth, and inventory levels in the market are beginning to come down. On a more surgical level, the specific wholesale partner doors we've transformed to align with the category offense, are producing very solid early results and are delivering comp-store growth at about twice the level of the overall fleet. This is very similar to the results we're seeing with the same focus in the U.S. market. And finally, in the product space, we're seeing improved sell through in our apparel styles, with the new fit and silhouette that we've launched for the holiday 2012 season, designed specifically for the Chinese consumer.","Although there is still a lot of work to be done, we've made some solid progress in making China a healthier market in the short term, and a stronger market in the long term. As Mark said, we know what needs to be done in China because we've successfully done it before, and we're committed to continuing to invest in the 3 key areas that we will set -- that will set the stage for growth: product, brand and distribution. We're doing all the right things to position the China marketplace to be a full market that delivers long-term, sustainable growth for the NIKE Brand.","Okay, a brief word on the Emerging Markets. They continue to perform at an impressive rate, reinforcing our premiere position in this broad portfolio of markets. Revenue across the geography is up 18%. That's the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. It's happening across our biggest performance categories, especially Running and Football, where we still have enormous room to grow, and it's not a single market that's driving those big numbers. It's happening in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, as well as other developing markets around the globe. In fact, in Q2, was the first $1 billion revenue quarter for the Emerging Markets. Now that's a big number anywhere in the world. Clearly, the brand is resonating with this consumer, and all signs indicate the Emerging Markets will continue to generate significant growth for the NIKE Brand.","Okay, let's shift over to another powerful dimension of the portfolio, the category offense. Once again, another impressive quarter for the Running team, delivering double-digit revenue growth yet again. And I continue to see a lot of opportunities for this category, participation rates are growing around the world, our performance innovation is stronger than ever and apparel continues to bring new energy to the consumer. Three of our most compelling product innovations today got their start in Running: Free, Lunar and Flyknit. Nike Free today is over $1 billion wholesale franchise and growing. With about 50% of that business coming from categories beyond Running. And Flyknit has the potential to revolutionize footwear on every level: performance, lightweight, fit, comfort, durability, sustainability and profitability, everything. And it's one of the most visually compelling innovations we created in a long time. It's a tremendous opportunity to bring that life across the entire footwear portfolio.","In distribution, we have 17 Nike Running category stores around the world, all driving strong comp-store performance. It's a great example of our amplified strategy being executed at its highest level. That unique combination of performance, training and lifestyle merchandised across footwear, apparel and equipment serve all of the athletes' needs. It\u2019s a significant competitive advantage for the NIKE Brand.","Running is also a growth accelerator for the Women's business. We made the strategic decision to leverage the power of 3 categories in a way that is meaningful to the female consumer: Running, Training and Sportswear. It's a cross-category version of our Amplified Sport Strategy, where women compete, train and express themselves across a broad spectrum of products. And it's driving strong growth in our women's business. If you look at the combined strength of Women's Running, Training and Sportswear year-to-date, it is outgrowing our Men's business. Better still, our Women's business will be bringing a lot of new energy into the retail space this spring and on into the summer. Again, it\u2019s that power of the portfolio at work. Footwear, apparel, category, brand and distribution. It's a competitive advantage that no one in the industry can match.","Before I hand it off to Don, I want to mention Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand. Q2 means it's time to talk Basketball. Major releases from marquee athletes Kobe LeBron and more highlight why we continue to be the most innovative basketball brand in the world. That basketball is not just a U.S.A. story, where we saw double-digit growth in North America. But in Q2, we also saw strong double-digit growth in central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe, where we've seen a lot of energy following the Olympics. Basketball generates a lot of heat for the brand this time of year, and it's becoming more and more impactfully, globally. So we've had a strong first half of the year, and we're focused on continuing our momentum going forward, but we expect there will be -- there will continue to be some uncertain times ahead in this volatile global economy. But we have a better game plan. We're well positioned to manage of external factors, and we're laser focused on transferring top line revenue to the bottom line profit.","With that, I want to wish everyone a happy set of holidays and here's Don.","Donald W. Blair","Thanks, Charlie. Our results so far this year demonstrate the strength of our business and the effectiveness of our strategies. In every day the business press is filled with a litany of risks, from political instability and economic volatility, to rapid changes in market dynamics. Both the opportunities and the risks we face are truly unprecedented. As Mark said earlier, we need to be mindful of the risks that continue to drive forward against sharply-focused strategies to create shareholder value.","I'd like to start by outlining 3 ways we strike that balance. First, continuing to deliver a strong profitability and increasing cash returns to shareholders. Second, making focused investments in strategies that will deliver future growth. And third, staying strong and nimble to manage risk. So far this year, our global portfolio of businesses has delivered strong growth, despite softness in key markets like China, Iberia and Italy. And we've continued to increase cash returns to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and higher dividends. At the same time, we're investing heavily in strategies that we're confident will deliver continued growth. We're expanding our Direct to Consumer businesses, generating significant incremental revenue and profits. We're investing to transform the wholesale marketplace, with category shop and shop concepts in developed markets and partnered doors in developing ones.","We're leading our industry into the digital world, creating compelling products and experiences that help athletes at all levels perform better, and we're delivering product innovation to consumers at an unprecedented pace and scale. We are confident these investments will deliver profitable growth, and we'll continue to make them. At the same time, we're mindful of the risks we face, along with every other global company. To better manage those risks, we've built a broad portfolio of businesses, maintained a strong balance sheet and focused our resources on the highest potential opportunities for growth. Divesting to invest. We've prepared for risk, but no one can fully anticipate everything that will happen. And that's why we rely on our experienced leaders around the world to adjust to market conditions and deliver our goals.","With that introduction, I'll recap Q2 results for our continuing operations. Second quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 7%. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 10% as the NIKE Brand grew 11%, and our Other Businesses grew 6%. Also, on a currency neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders increased 7%, driven by a 4-point increase in units and a 3-point increase in average price per unit. Futures were higher for all geographies except China, which declined 7%, reflecting our actions to tightly manage the inventory going into the marketplace. On a reported basis, futures grew 6%, reflecting weaker international currencies.","Second quarter diluted EPS grew 11% to $1.14, driven by strong revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly lower gross margin and a higher tax rate. For the quarter, gross margin was 30 basis points below the prior year, but better than the guidance we gave last quarter. Although there continues to be a great deal of volatility in the components of gross margin, we're seeing some encouraging trends. The pricing actions we have taken over the last 5 seasons, combined with easing raw material costs, are now more than offsetting the impact of ongoing labor cost inflation. However, in Q2, currency changes reduced our consolidated gross margin by about 70 basis points. We've also seen significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business. While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivers incremental revenue and profits, it does put pressure on our reported gross margin. With all that said, we remain confident in our ability to drive higher gross margin over time, and continue to expect gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter of fiscal '13, with the full year essentially flat.","As expected, demand creation was flat for the second quarter, following significant first quarter investments in the Olympics and Euro Champs, as well as product launches for the NFL and Digital Sport. Operating overhead grew 10% for the quarter, due largely to growth in our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business, as well as continued investments to support growth initiatives such as digital.","The effective tax rate for Q2 was 26.8% compared to 24.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The increase was largely the result of an increase in our effective tax rate for foreign operations.","Q2 inventories for NIKE, Inc. were up 9%, while NIKE Brand inventory grew 8% versus last year. Over 80% of the NIKE Brand inventory growth in Q2 was driven by North America, which continues to show tremendous increases in revenues and futures. As a percentage of our worldwide inventories, closeouts are roughly in line with the prior year. Our main focus of inventory management continues to be China where we're working to manage down inventory at retail. More on China in a few minutes.","Our balance sheet continues to be strong, as we held $3.5 billion of cash at quarter end, with less than $400 million of debt.","Our trailing 4 quarter return on invested capital was 20.4%, down 220 basis points from the prior year, largely reflecting the timing of earnings growth across quarters and the book loss on the divestiture of Umbro.","Now let's take look at our performance across 4 key segments starting with North America, which delivered another remarkable performance in Q2. Q2 revenues for our largest geography increased 17% on both a reported and currency neutral basis, bringing year-to-date revenue growth to 20%. That equates to over $850 million of incremental revenue. Footwear revenue increased 13%, and apparel revenue grew 19%, including strong sales of NFL product. Direct-to-Consumer revenues grew 23%, driven by 18% comp-store sales growth.","Q2 EBIT for North America grew 31%, as revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage all contributed to increase profitability. In Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 4% on a currency neutral basis, despite persistent economic challenges in southern Europe. We continue to be encouraged by our progress in Western Europe, with the actions we've taken to transform the marketplace are showing early signs of success. Revenue growth for the quarter came from higher revenues for DTC stores and online, as well as increased wholesale sales in every territory except Italy and Iberia, where revenues declined 9% and 23% respectively.","Every key category reported higher revenues for the quarter expect Women's Training and Action Sports, which reported single-digit declines. Running and Basketball were the standouts, with each posting growth well over 20%. As a result of the weaker euro, reported Q2 revenues for Western Europe declined 2%, but EBIT grew 23%, reflecting higher gross margin and lower SG&A.","We're also seeing some positive signs in China. As Charlie discussed earlier, we're taking decisive actions to position our China business for sustainable, profitable growth. As expected, our Q2 financial results reflected the impact of these actions. We increased reserves for product returns and retailer discounts to clear excess inventory at retail. We also proactively canceled orders and reduced futures to tightly manage the amount of new product flowing into the market. Including these items, currency neutral revenues declined 12% and futures orders fell 7%.","On a reported basis, Q2 revenue for China declined 11%, and EBIT decreased 16%, as lower revenues and increased operating overhead were partially offset by expanding gross margin as the impact of our actions to clean up the market were more than offset by the benefits of higher prices and easing raw material costs. As Charlie indicated, we're seeing some very early signs that our strategies to transform the China marketplace are taking hold. Comp-store sales are growing in both NIKE DTC and wholesale partner stores. Inventory levels are beginning to decline and apparel sell-through is improving. That said, we still expect lower revenue and EBIT from this geography over the next few quarters as we work to position our business to realize the tremendous growth potential that Mark spoke to earlier.","In our Emerging Markets geography, we continued to see tremendous growth in Q2 as revenues grew 18% on a currency neutral basis. Revenue growth was broad-based as every territory grew, and 5 of 7 key categories reported double-digit increases. As Charlie mentioned, the geography posted its first $1 billion dollar revenue quarter in Q2. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue grew 11% and EBIT grew 23%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion.","Second quarter revenues for our Other Businesses increased 6% on both a reported and currency neutral basis, driven by mid-single-digit growth at Converse and Hurley, and low double-digit growth at NIKE Golf. EBIT for these businesses increased 13%, driven by improved profitability at Hurley and NIKE Golf.","Let me now turn to the balance of year outlook for our continuing operations. Our full year expectations remain essentially unchanged, although the phasing of profits across the quarters has evolved. On a constant currency basis, we expect Q3 revenue to grow at a low double-digit rate. For Q4, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth, as we anniversary strong revenues in last year's fourth quarter, fueled by the Euro Champs, Olympics and NFL launch. For both Q3 and Q4, we expect reported revenue growth to be about a point lower.","For the full year, we continue to expect high single to low double-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis, with reported revenue expected to grow mid- to high single digits, reflecting weaker foreign currencies, particularly the euro. For gross margin, we expect a slight year-on-year decline in Q3, generally in line with the year-on-year decline in Q2, as we continue to take actions to clear inventory in China and face currency headwinds. For Q4, we expect gross margin expansion of approximately 80 basis points. As a result, we continue to expect full year gross margin will be essentially flat despite the stronger-than-expected performance in Q2.","We expect Q3 SG&A to grow slightly faster than the rate of revenue growth, at a low double-digit rate as we shift some planned spending from Q2 to Q3, and continue to invest in our brands and growth initiatives. Q4 SG&A should grow at a low single-digit rate, as we anniversary demand creation investments in the Euro Champs and Olympics in Q4 of FY '12. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a high single- to low double-digit rate.","As you know, other income is very difficult to forecast, since it's comprised of non-operating items, many of which are nonrecurring or driven by macro factors such as currency exchange rates. Based on current information, we do not expect other income for Q3 or Q4 to be significant. And finally, we continue to expect the FY '13 effective tax rate will be about 26.5%.","As we look to the balance of FY '13 and beyond, we'd like to leave you with 3 key takeaways. One, we're continuing to deliver strong profitability and increasing cash returns to our shareholders. Two, we're making focused investments and strategies that are working, and will deliver future growth in revenue, profits and cash flow. And three, we'll stay strong and nimble to manage risk.","We're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question is on the gross margins during the quarter. Can you tell us what the difference was between what you had been expecting for Q2 and where you ended up during the quarter?","Donald W. Blair","Well first of all, I have to start by saying that on a business where we're operating in almost 200 countries and across all the different styles and product types, 50 basis points is kind of in the margin of error. But bottom line was, we had pretty strong performance from the price increases we've taken over the last few seasons, and as I indicated, the combination of that and easing raw material costs is now offsetting some ongoing inflation in labor. We were only slightly down year-on-year, and a lot of that has to do with mix changes and currency. So bottom line is, we feel great about the trendline we're on in gross margin, I think its playing out as we expected it to. Our ability to forecast this thing with all the moving parts we have, I think this is pretty good shooting. And as you know, we don't manage one line out of the P&L. We manage the whole thing. So we're pretty pleased at how the second quarter came out.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's great, and then my second question has to do with China. I really appreciate all the detail Charlie walked us through with regards to all the strategies you're employing in China currently. And I was just wondering, it sounds like you're in the very early stages of doing a lot of the category offense. When can we start to see that be a little bit more prolific in the region, and when do you think that will start to contribute more effectively to any kind of inflection in the growth rate in China?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, I think, Kate, it's early in the game as we stated in the remarks. We feel really good about what we're doing and how we're doing it. We're seeing great results in the specific locations that we've started to move forward to. So I think as we scale it, where you start to see the impact, it's hard for me to pick a quarter or a date, I would expect to see an increasing level of performance on a broader basis as we move down, quarter-to-quarter. So the goal obviously here is to be decisive and move quickly as we can. We've talked about that, the last 2 calls. I think some of the actions that we took over the last 90 days lead me to believe that we're moving both at an increased pace and in the right direction. The sooner we can get towards this market differentiation, consumer differentiation in the marketplace, the better off we're going to be, and we're taking early, small steps, but you can expect that to accelerate as we move forward.","Mark G. Parker","And Kate, one other thing, too, that I want to highlight about Charlie's remarks, one of the reasons why we talked about some of the underlying productivity metrics in the marketplace is that as we really differentiate the marketplace and build that platform for long-term growth, you won't necessarily see it in the headline numbers over the next few quarters. As Charlie said, we expect that to get better, but one of the things we're really focused on, is those underlying productivity metrics that are telling us that we're getting it right in the marketplace with the consumer, and that's why we're giving you that level of visibility.","Charles D. Denson","Yes, I'll add 2 points, Kate, because China's obviously a big topic of conversation. One is, the emphasis on working with the space that we have and making that space better, more productive and more profitable, and we think, probably a little bit bigger on a per location basis to storytell the way we do, so we're very good -- we're excited about that. And the other one is, focusing on the high end, the premium positioning of the brand. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And Don, just a minute, I want to ask you on the gross margins, but also want to congratulate you there. I know it's been a long road with some of the volatility over the last few years, so it looks like it's starting to pay out, so congrats there. As we look back in time a little bit, you see gross margins peak out in about 2010. Obviously that was at the end of several years of currency going the right way. But if you look at that as where you peaked on past, how confident are you that you can get back there, if you are? And how long do you think it takes on a longer-term basis, as we look at our models?","Donald W. Blair","Well, I think, trying to do this from a modeling standpoint is not exactly how we think about this. I mean, what we do is, we're focused on the key drivers that differentiate our product and our brand in the marketplace. A great example of that is the innovation that we bring into the marketplace. That is one of the things that lets you move your margins up because you've got premium differentiated product that the consumer's looking for and not everybody else has it. So our approach to growing margins has been focused on those basic fundamental levers of moving margins higher. We're confident we can continue to do that over the long period of time. Trying to pick a date or a destination point, given all the volatility there is in the world, is not something that we try to do.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, and I guess that's a good point. The -- you now have the futures, at least in the U.S. lapping a pretty big price increase last February, yet the futures orders here accelerated in the quarter. Can you just tell us about what the units versus pricing breakdown in the U.S. futures number looks like?","Donald W. Blair","Well, not doing it geography by geography, but the unit -- actually, Kelley, do you have that number?","Kelley Hall","Yes.","Donald W. Blair","I just don't have it off the top of my head.","Kelley Hall","Futures?","Donald W. Blair","The units versus price. All, right, we'll come back to you on that, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, and I think you had a shift on the China Apparel business last year. Could you tell us what the revenues in futures would have been in China, without that nonrecurring headwind from the Apparel comparison last year?","Donald W. Blair","I don't think that's a material driver of the trendline in China for this quarter, Michael.","Kelley Hall","So Michael, for the futures orders, the 7% on a currency neutral basis was a 4-point increase in units, and a 3-point increase in average price per unit.","Operator","And your next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see -- I thought you had some interesting comments around the Basketball business, seeing a bit of a renaissance there. I know it's not as big of a category as Running is, but wanted to see if you could elaborate on that. I especially was interested in the fact that you're seeing something going on in Europe there as well. Is it core Basketball junkies? Are you seeing, maybe a little bit of a broader, kind of acceptance of the basketball shoe? And did it come at the expense of Running, or how should we think about that as that gains steam?","Charles D. Denson","Hi, Omar, this is Charlie. Hey, I'm going to take that, actually from a couple of different angles and give you some examples. First of all, the performance side of the business is very strong, and we're seeing some really great sell-throughs at retail on some of the new marquee product. And so that always makes us feel good. We always feel like we're headed in the right direction with that premium product. I think the other things that are starting to -- that you're starting to see is, a, a little bit more interest in basketball in Europe, we're excited about that, and that is coming at both the performance level, as well as an influence in sportswear. You're starting to see -- the basketball silhouettes outside the United States is becoming a little stronger. We're seeing styles like the Blazer in Western Europe becoming a very, very big franchise business for us, from a silhouette standpoint, and it's even creeping into the Women's business, whereas the Dunk Too High [ph] is a new shoe on the Women's side that is becoming, quite frankly, becoming a bit of a phenomena around the world. And s, we're very excited to see the influence of basketball becoming more influential around the world, both on the performance side as well as the sportswear side. So it's -- with our position in basketball, it bodes well for us over the near and mid-term.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I wanted to ask you, you made some interesting comments upfront about digital and the importance of that as one of the key pillars of Nike's opportunity to create shareholder value. As you think about e-commerce, how do you balance the Internet, and how the brand operates on the Internet, between kind of creating consumer connections and developing that relationship almost as a marketing vehicle, versus the commercial side of the business, where you drive it, as you utilize it and lever it is a profit driver. And I'd probably venture a guess that you guys are probably underpenetrated in terms of Internet as a sales mix, relative to some other discretionary brands out there. But I just want to see how you're thinking about that.","Mark G. Parker","Yes, this is Mark, speaking. It's all interrelated to your comment. Both the commerce side, the communications piece, the social networking that, we have a 2-way dialogue with the consumer. We enabled consumers to talk to each other. We are strengthening the relationship we have with the consumer. Certainty, just through our communications, but also through the commerce side of things. And then, of course, the product and the services piece, which is in its infancy stages right now. But we expect big things out of that piece of our business. But the point is, this is all interrelated. And this is exactly how we're managing this part of our business. We have groups that are highly focused on each of these segments, but we also work this as a unified portfolio. And we see this is really the way that we're going to increase the power of the connection with the consumer, and then, to your point on the e-commerce piece is, we're going to drive a huge commercial opportunity in, yes, I think an underpenetrated channel for NIKE. But it's a real holistic view of the digital world and how it applies to NIKE and the massive potential that represents. These aren't separate silos. These are interrelated, and again, that's exactly how we're managing it.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Don, can I ask you to speak to the balance of the futures across of the futures window? And then, the 3 points of price in the futures, has that benefit run its course, or would you expect there to be a longer tail on that going forward as you emphasize the premium end of the brand?","Donald W. Blair","Well the futures are more frontloaded, and as I talked about in the guidance section, we are overlapping last year's fourth quarter with quite a bit of Euro Champs and Olympics business in there. So we've got stronger growth in the front part of the window. With respect to pricing, one of the things we also spoke to is that we do believe that we think there's price opportunity out there on a season-by-season basis. We do not expect to be doing this across the board. Across the majority of the line, we think it's really more of a customer value equation assessment, where style by style, we're looking at the pricing. And particularly behind innovation, we think there's opportunity to move price up. But I don't think you're going to see the kinds of broad pricing actions going forward that you saw from us 1.5 years ago.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you, okay. And then, Charlie, can you elaborate some on the changes to the apparel direction in China, particularly the new silhouette for the consumer, and some of the performance direction of that product line that's resonating?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, I think, well -- one of the things, and we've talked about this in previous calls, the majority of our inventory issue in China is built -- basically built around a lot of the apparel product. And one of the things that we felt pretty strongly about was some of the fit opportunities we had in the marketplace. For holiday, and I alluded to that in the commentary, we started to move some of that new fit product into the market. It does not, by any means, represent even anywhere close to 100% that's in the market today, but it is very quickly becoming a higher percentage of the line as we move into spring, and then on into summer. The response that we're seeing there, both from a, obviously a sell-through standpoint, and the way we've been a little bit more focused around the Chinese consumer silhouette-wise, that new product is moving through the marketplace at a very nice pace. And we're very, very comfortable with it, and quite frankly, happy with it. We've got to get more and more of that part of the apparel line into the marketplace, which the plan is to do as we move forward into spring and summer.","Operator","And your next question comes from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess just a quick point of clarification, I want to make sure I heard correctly on the guidance, up low double digits revenue growth in 3Q. Is that constant currency or reported?","Donald W. Blair","That's constant. And we gave guidance for the fourth quarter of mid-single digit, and for both of them, the difference between constant and reported, we think will be about down 1 percentage point versus the constant currency numbers, consistent with our futures.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then turning to -- in the product pipeline, obviously you've had a ton of great innovation, expect that to continue, you mentioned digital. Maybe specifically, as it relates to Flyknit, certainly a really big opportunity, but maybe help us think about the cadence, how that business ramps from a top line perspective in terms of incremental distribution? And how we should think that from a volume basis, maybe over the next 12 months? And then certainly from a profitability perspective, what type of scale do you need in terms of really getting a nice margin that's given -- that it doesn't have labor, or very little labor associated with it?","Mark G. Parker","Yes, this is Mark. I'm going to jump in on that. The Flyknit as you said, we're quite bullish on that opportunity. I think it's going to take a little while, meaning 12-plus months or so to really get this to a meaningful scale in terms of some of those numbers that are going to have a more dramatic impact on the units and the overall margin numbers. We are very bullish on -- of scaling the manufacturing capability, the capacity. There is obviously, from our vantage point, a huge consumer appetite for this product, so we're balancing the aggressiveness to close that gap and meet that demand, and make sure that we're not getting out ahead of ourselves. So we don't -- we're not creating excess demand that we can't meet in the marketplace. So I think it's going to take -- it's going to ramp up consistently and aggressively over the next 12 months and beyond. And I think you'll continue to see this become frankly, a bigger and bigger percentage of our total footwear focus. And it'll expand, I think dramatically from a category basis as well. Many of our innovations really start in Running. And then they move and are leveraged into other categories. And Flyknit is certainly no exception. Some of the most dramatic and innovative and exciting product that I've seen behind the door there, that I can't really get into with you all right now, is in this Flyknit area and across some of the other categories. So it's a huge part of our future, and I think from a units and a margin standpoint, you'll see that continue to get bigger and bigger.","Donald W. Blair","Just to answer the second part of your question, on the financials, just want to make sure, I make 2 points, one is, this is an upper technology. We are really bullish on what the potential is here. At this point, it is half the shoe, if you will. And so we're working on putting all of the pieces together. So I want to put that in that context. The second thing is that, the trendline we've seen consistently as we launch new technologies is that, we launch them, and then we work our way down the cost curve. So our products tend to get more profitable the longer we work with that particular technology, and we believe Flyknit will certainly be consistent with that.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then if I could, just quickly in terms of your wholesale partners, you obviously had great gains domestically in terms of the shop in shops, be it Dick's Field House, Nike -- The Track Club at Finish Line and House of Hoops. Sort of where do you stand in terms of that, what maybe what inning, in terms of penetration, kind of the incremental opportunity be it in those doors or sort of other areas that continue to sort of drive productivity with those wholesale partners?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, this is Charlie. Well, I'm going to -- I guess, if I understand your question, one of the things that obviously we can do is more of them here in the U.S. Now we used those examples because most of the group is most familiar with those examples here in the US. We actually have a lot of that type of activity going on in other markets around the world. We have some great soccer or football spaces in Europe that are performing extremely well, and we're very excited about scaling those, along with the examples that we've given you in the U.S. The other thing that it provides us is great learnings that we take to a market like China or Korea in a mono brand space, where we can really take the category offense and use the amplified execution in performance, Training and sportswear, to really bring productivity and profitability to the mono brand spaces that we have in marketplaces like that. And so, some of the references that we've made in China some of the things we're starting to do in places like Shanghai, is starting to bring some of that category focus into these spaces that -- and we're seeing a lift, both from a consumer response standpoint, and obviously from a productivity and profitability standpoint.","Operator","And your last question comes from Sam Poser with Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just wonder, could you -- I just -- a little more on Flyknit. You did over [indiscernible] a while, you say it's $1 billion wholesale platform, Lunar you've said in the past, is well over a $2 billion retail platform. It took you 4 years to get Lunar there. Is Free as -- excuse me, is Flyknit as big an opportunity? And how does it cross categories? Does it has to -- does the idea have stability enough to make a Flyknit basketball shoe, I mean, down the road, or is it more Running-oriented? You talked a little bit about that.","Mark G. Parker","I'll talk -- this is Mark, again. I'll talk a little bit about that, but not too much, for hopefully obvious reasons. Let me say I am incredibly bullish, I mean, I'm a product -- self-admitted product geek here, and very important, not only to me, but this company, it's the basis of our success. So we're very discriminating on new technologies like Flyknit. And feel this is one of those technologies that has incredibly massive potential, let me put it that way. Not only within Running, as I said before, but across multiple categories. What form that takes, you'll see. I mean, that's all I can say. It'll-- you can't judge the applicability of Flyknit based on the products that you've seen to date. This technology has tremendous potential, tremendous possibilities, and as I said, some of the most exciting product we have in the pipeline is involving the use of Flyknit technology. And as Charlie mentioned in his note, the impact on performance, on the aesthetic, on sustainability, all these factors are tremendous. And again, well beyond Running.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And it sounds to me as if you're working on a sort of an official Flyknit coordinating outsole technology. I mean that's just sort of, what you sort of implied. Am I down the right road there as well?","Mark G. Parker","No comment.","Charles D. Denson","You've gotten -- you've probably got Mark right up to as far -- close to the edge as you're going to get him. But if he's a self-professed product geek, I guess, I'm known as one of the more commercial-minded guys around here. But I think that I would only echo all of the commentary in the sense that, I think we've both been around here a long time. We've seen a lot of innovation come and go through this place, and I think Flyknit represents one of those bigger opportunities that we all get so excited about. So, and one thing that I think we've overemphasized too, is that we feel that strongly about it, we're going to manage it, and we're going to ramp it at appropriate level, both the way it ramps commercially and the way that you'd see it transform the way that footwear is used by the athlete. So it's exciting times.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, on the SG&A, with the man [ph] creation, when we're looking at next quarter in absolute dollars, how should we think about that in absolute dollars?","Donald W. Blair","Well, I think the best thing to do, Sam, is just go back to the guidance we gave around SG&A growth. I think that's the best way to model it.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, so some of that's going to push over from Q2 into Q3?","Donald W. Blair","But the guidance that we gave you includes that factor. So just the guidance we gave is all in.","Kelley Hall","All right, thank you, everyone. Have a happy holidays, and we'll talk to you after the New Year.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15858":["NIKE, Inc.

In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon, everyone.","We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we\u2019re so excited about potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we\u2019ve made to our business and our deeper focus on the three core areas, innovation, direct and speed are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for NIKE. Here are the key areas where we\u2019re driving momentum in our business.","First, we\u2019re winning with new innovation. We\u2019re leading with platforms, not just products. For example React and Air Max are scaling through multiple styles and across categories. They\u2019re driving extraordinary growth and brand heat with consumers. Second, our Digital Offense is transforming NIKE from how we connect with consumers to how we deliver products. This is a major shift from operating models of the past to a new digitally powered model of the future. And third, with a more focused strategy, we\u2019re running a more complete portfolio with better balanced growth across geographies and categories.","For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 13% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include our international business growing 23% with Greater China up 35%. We returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. Sportswear, a $10 billion business for NIKE had another quarter of double-digit growth. We saw a solid momentum in key performance categories and digital, NIKE Digital was up 41% for the quarter. The key to accelerating our strength is to continue to sharpen the execution of our Triple Double. And looking at our progress this quarter, I\u2019ll start with 2X Innovation.","The lineup of fresh, unexpected products that we shared with you last fall at our Investor Day, has entered the marketplace. And as I noted, the consumer has responded. NIKE React for example is living up to big expectations. We extended the launch momentum from last quarter and scaled significantly with excellent sell-through globally. The Epic React is already the number two performance running shoe in the marketplace, above $125, only trailing the Air VaporMax. And Zoom Air continues to be the training platform of choice for serious runners led by our best selling Pegasus line. Our latest, the Peg 35 has the highest bookings in the first season for any Pegasus in our history.","Overall, running grew 7% for fiscal year \u201818. And with the loaded pipeline in fiscal \u201819, led by the Peg Turbo with ZoomX cushioning, we see a great runway ahead for our largest performance category.","In Sportswear, the consumer demand for all-day comfort is making Air Max one of the fastest growing platforms in our industry. Our icons, the Air Max Plus, 95, 97 and 98 are all performing incredibly well.","Air VaporMax, built on that demand, and this quarter we took it a step further with NIKE's first innovation built specifically for lifestyle, Air Max 270. Since launching in March, 270 is the most successful Air Max launch in our history. And it\u2019s one of the driving forces behind Sportswear, a category that delivered more than $2.6 billion in revenue in Q4, its best quarter ever. [Technical Difficulty]. Can you hear me clearly there? Okay. All right. Sorry about that. Let's take this back up again.","So I said, you should look for more Air Max platforms in the seasons ahead, pushing the boundaries on lifestyle innovation. Air is one of NIKE's greatest competitive differentiators and it continues to fuel extraordinary growth.","Sportswear has begun to integrate NIKE React into new styles with more to come throughout fiscal year \u201819, including new icons from Jordan.","The success of our new cushioning platforms is driving momentum in our women's business as well. In fact, following our launches the past three months, the 270, VaporMax and Epic React are already the top three selling women's athletic footwear models, above $125. Overall, women's lifestyle product continues to set the pace for the category. For the quarter, women saw the Air Force 1 continuing its strong momentum, The Blazer ramping up quickly in China and APLA, and key Air Max icons growing triple digits.","One of our biggest opportunities for fiscal \u201819 is to scale our women's sneaker business across both NIKE and Jordan. In women's apparel, lifestyle is also leading the way, highlighted by strong growth in tops and fleece. And looking ahead, we're building on our leadership in bras and bringing more innovation through Flyknit apparel in the second half of the year.","And as a part of our more holistic point of view on women\u2019s across Running, Training and Sportswear, we'll roll out a new approach with seasonal head-to-toe capsules and collections, like we did with the Meshed Up collection this quarter. There is great energy across our women's products and marketplace teams right now.","One of our most important performance categories, NIKE Basketball has produced strong momentum this year off the back of the NBA partnership and high demand for key signature styles.","We\u2019ve had an amazing year one with the NBA. We had a lot of firsts this year, but I\u2019d say our three biggest wins were our editions approach to jerseys, driving significantly higher NBA jersey sales than the league has ever had; the Showtime Hoodie, which is a new premium apparel business for fiscal \u201818, with sell-through approaching 100% across most teams and channels; and the steady flow of LeBron Player Edition footwear that we launched through LeBron Watch on the SNKRS app, this is a new feature that turns the on-court footwear into real-time buying opportunities.","Jordan Brand proved, too, that the NBA is the ultimate sneaker runway. In many ways, Jordan defines the spectrum of performance and style as part of the pre-game walk-in on the court with the game\u2019s best players and courtside with fans. But we know consumers are demanding more from Jordan, and we know that people want wider access and new dimensions, and we\u2019re delivering. This quarter, we nearly tripled the size of Jordan\u2019s women\u2019s sneaker business, ","Jordan apparel was up double digits in all geos, and the Jordan Brand in China was up nearly 50%. These are the areas where we see exponential growth and we\u2019ll continue to focus. We have a lot of opportunities to expand the Jordan portfolio of products to create a greater range of choice and to match the energy of the Jordan Brand.","For both, NIKE and Jordan, our partnerships with the world\u2019s best leagues, teams and athletes are what fuel our growth. Nobody is better positioned to harness the expanding power of sport.","Just look back at the moments and performances from our athletes over the last few weeks. Kevin Durant won back-to-back NBA titles and Finals MVP awards. Eliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon in our new 3D printed uppers with Flyprint and ZoomX, Brooks Koepka winning the U.S. Open for the second year in a row, and at the French Open, Simona Halep won her first title, and Rafael Nadal won his unrivalled 11th at Roland Garros.","And of course, we\u2019re two weeks into one of the world\u2019s greatest sports moment, the World Cup where the energy for the NIKE brand has been tremendous. With over 60% of the players in the opening round wearing NIKE boots. In fact, [technical difficulty] scored by players in NIKE boots than all other brands combined with Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way.","We also debuted the latest generation of NIKE Flyknit, the Mercurial Superfly, 360 and Vapor 360.","In apparel, we\u2019ve seen strong sell-through of our performance kits, and we\u2019ve designed full collections across performance, training and sportswear for key national teams including England, France, Portugal, Brazil and Nigeria. This quarter, we also made an important commitment to our future in football. We entered into a 10-year partnership with the China Super League, one of the fastest-growing football nations in the world.","The stories of our athletes and the innovation they inspire have always been central to our brand. And today, those products and stories are being amplified even further by the power of digital. We\u2019ve talked about how critical mobile and social experiences are to our consumer and how that\u2019s driving change. But, really, the full digital transformation of NIKE that\u2019s taking place right now is even bigger than that. It's fundamentally shifting our entire company.","Digital is allowing us to realize our vision for smart retail to remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. It\u2019s sharpening our ability to sense the market through data and analytics. It's unlocking new manufacturing tools that are more precise and drive a new esthetic. And it's opening up opportunities for new partnerships and how we develop talent in the organization.","Let's start with how digital is fueling 2X Direct in our mission to lead the industry to more differentiated marketplace through NIKE consumer experiences. In our own ecosystem, NIKE Plus membership is the key to an elevated consumer experience. Once someone becomes a member and customizes their profile, we know what sports they like, how active they are, and the style of products they prefer. And that insight allows or unlocks for exclusive product, style advice from experts and rewards for their activity. It personalizes the entire experience and allows us to remove friction points for members as they move seamlessly from mobile to the in-store environment.","We've relaunched NIKE Plus membership in November. And for the year, we've exceeded all of our membership targets with strong growth in new, active and buying members and improvement in engagement and in conversion. And we continue to explore the physical and digital intersection through our new NIKE app at retail, which is beginning to scale some multiple stores. Through Smart Retail, we can aggregate consumer buying patterns to better inform localized preferences and turn those into new growth opportunities. For example, next month, we're opening a new retail concept in LA, called NIKE Live. It's a small format, data-driven store with its assortment influenced by what consumers are buying from surrounding zip codes. We see great potential on this approach, and you'll see a lot more of it across our key cities.","Digital innovation also allows us to push the edges of new immersive experiences whether that's in our own channels, or through partnered retail or social media platforms. The SNKRS App has delivered some incredibly compelling experiences this quarter. For example that venues during Kendrick Lamar\u2019s recent tour, we triggered SNKRS stash drops to make his Cortez Kenny III shoe available exclusively to his fans who are at the show. The SNKRS App is creating incredible demand and capturing more value from that energy as one of NIKE's largest upside opportunities for fiscal \u201819 and beyond.","Our investments in the digital experience are also creating a platform for new brand-friendly e-commerce partnerships. Our work with Tmall continues to set the bar for how we co-create shopping experiences through mobile and social. This quarter, we leveraged key shopping moments for Air Max on Tmall's Super Brand Day and Young Athletes during its parent\u2019s channel launch.","We continue to expand our presence in digital marketplaces through partnerships like Zalando in EMA and ZOZO-town in Japan which became fully operational in March.","And we see huge potential emerging storytelling and shopping through our social platforms. This quarter, NIKE became one of the first companies to drive new consumer experiences in Facebook Messenger app, leveraging the AR camera to reveal the Kyrie 4 Red Carpet. To look for more exciting new shopping experiences with Facebook and other social media platforms in the coming months.","And as we noted at Investor Day, we\u2019re also piloting and scaling NIKE Consumer Experiences with key wholesale partners. For example, the NIKE Certified Athletes program turned selected Foot Locker associates into NIKE experts. And after showing strong early results, Foot Locker will scale the program across North America in Q1. And with JD group in EMEA, we launched both a physical and digital concept to celebrate Air Max storytelling, called Undisputed Air, driving triple-digit growth of NIKE Air products in JD versus last year. Digital acceleration is also critical to creating an overall faster company, from consumer insight to responsive manufacturing to delivering products to the consumer when they want it. In other words, it is integral to our 2X Speed initiative.","In fiscal 18, we\u2019ve invested significantly in the capabilities that heighten our ability to sense the market and drive efficiency through our supply chain. We scaled seven key distribution centers around the world this year. One of the facilities in North America is our new Rebound facility, the first to be focused solely on accepting returned products and getting it back into the market place significantly faster, to maximize full price, in-season selling. We\u2019ve also integrated the Zodiac team from our recent acquisition who are giving us new predictive tools and advanced analytics to drive targeted growth. And we continued to develop our sensing capabilities within our key cities and sharpened the Express Lane, our fastest growing product engine that serves as a key focal point of our Speed initiatives. This quarter, the Express Lane created a substantial impact by extending our in-line stories with new materials and colors, as the teams did with the Air Max 270 this quarter. And amplifying the brand concepts we know are connecting best with consumers, like the Tuned-Air Mercurial to celebrate World Cup, and capturing emerging trends, like we did in EMEA with a 90s-apparel collection where we identified the trend and quickly delivered product to market.","Express Lane, as a whole, is leading to significantly stronger full-price sell-through rates. Through digital, we\u2019re also inventing new manufacturing tools that allow us to push the boundaries of product creation -- like computational design with React or new Flyknit apparel. And Automation throughout our supply chain continues to drive speed and efficiency. 2X Speed is a multi-year journey and while we\u2019ve made progress, we also know there\u2019s even greater opportunity ahead in this space. We\u2019ve closed out the fiscal year with a strong performance across our business. Being closer to the consumer and our new offense has us focused on the biggest growth opportunities, making the right investments with the greatest returns. We fueled increased demand for NIKE in fiscal \u201818. In fiscal \u201819, we\u2019ll continue that acceleration with an even faster pace of innovation and by serving consumers more completely across our entire portfolio.","We have momentum, and we are continuing to transform across multiple dimensions and throughout our entire organization. And I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll use this quarter as a catalyst for growth into Fiscal \u201819 and beyond.","Thanks. And now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thank you, Mark and hello to everyone on the call. Fiscal year \u201818 was a strategically significant year for NIKE. As we began the fiscal year last June, we communicated our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, which we believed would ignite NIKE\u2019s next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth and transform the company in the process. Then, at our Investor Day. This past October, we showcased how our new strategy was already beginning to come to life. We displayed the pipeline of innovative products that we plan to bring to market in the second half of fiscal year \u201818 on our path to 2X Innovation. We immersed our stakeholders in the relaunch of our NIKE and SNKRS app experiences and the new membership services that would ignite 2X Direct. And we shared several of the manufacturing and supply chain initiatives that will help 2X our Speed and ultimately cut our time to market in half.","Of course we also established a new long-term financial model. But, perhaps even more notable than the financial goals we established were some of the key operational measures of success that we shared. Those measures of success better define how we will transform NIKE into a digitally-led enterprise that connects more directly with our consumers globally through our key cities and countries.","And as we now close Q4, we are thrilled to see our strategic execution, translating into strong financial performance, as both revenue growth and profitability exceeded even our own expectations. At the same time, what\u2019s even more exciting is that we also delivered across all of our key operational measures of success.","And, it\u2019s worth highlighting a few examples, as these are proof points that NIKE\u2019s strategic transformation is underway at an accelerated pace. So first, we said that new innovation platforms will drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next five years. In fiscal year \u201818, revenue from new innovative platforms actually drove over 80% of our incremental growth, fueled by innovative new platforms such as the Air VaporMax, React, the Air Max 270 and ZoomX.","We also said that we would 2X Direct with Digital Commerce growth, both owned and partnered, comprising over 50% of NIKE\u2019s total company growth over the next five years. In fiscal year \u201818, NIKE Direct, in fact, drove over 90% of our growth and 100% of our growth was driven by the combination of NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE consumer experiences. NIKE Digital in particular grew 34% in Q4 on a constant currency basis and was the single fastest growing channel globally. Yet, from many of the hottest styles launched on NIKE Digital platforms within the quarter, our supply was only a fraction of the actual demand we experienced. This underscores a significant opportunity to better sense and serve digital demand in fiscal year \u201819.","We also said in October that we expect our international geographies to drive over 75% of our growth and that North America would return to mid single digit growth over the next five years. For the full-year, our international geographies accounted for over 100% of our growth, with Greater China growing nearly 2X the rate of any other geography on a currency-neutral basis.","And, in Q4, North America returned to growth, sharply reversing its prior trend. As Mark said, as we enter fiscal year \u201819, we are now running a more complete offense across our global portfolio. But, before I go deeper into our outlook for fiscal year \u201819, let\u2019s first reflect on the drivers of our strong Q4 results.","NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 13%, up 8% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit international growth and a return to growth in North America. NIKE Direct led our growth globally, including 5% comp store growth and 34% digital growth. For the full-year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $36.4 billion, up 4% on a currency-neutral basis.","Gross margin expanded over 60 basis points in Q4, exceeding our own expectations due to accelerating full-price sales and NIKE Digital growth. For the full-year, gross margin contracted just under 80 basis points, as strong underlying product profitability was more than offset by a 90 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange.","Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25%, primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham, and the NBA; brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup; and global campaigns supporting the launch of new product innovations. For the full-year, demand creation increased 7%.","Operating overhead increased 14% for the quarter and 10% for the full-year as we are investing in capabilities that will fuel growth long-term, particularly with respect to digital and innovation.","Our effective tax rate was 6.4% for the quarter and 55.3% for the full-year. The full-year rate was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily due to the one-time transition tax associated with U.S. Tax Reform.","Fourth quarter Diluted EPS increased 15% to $0.69. Full-year diluted EPS declined 53% to $1.17, taking into account the significant one-time impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. As of May 31st, inventories were up 4%, growing slower than the rate of revenue growth, which is an indication that our supply and demand management efforts over the course of fiscal year \u201818 have returned NIKE to a strong pull market globally.","Finally, today, we are announcing a new four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program. We anticipate that our current $12 billion share repurchase program will be completed within fiscal year \u201819. This new, expanded authorization, coupled with our dividend program, are evidence of NIKE\u2019s strong cash flow generation and steadily increasing cash returns to shareholders.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for a few of our reported operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 3% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by new innovation platforms, very strong Digital growth, continued momentum in Sportswear and broad growth across Apparel. We\u2019ve returned North America to revenue growth and expanding margins, and this healthy momentum is carrying forward into this new fiscal year.","As we expected, Digital continues to reshape the consumer experience and to some extent disrupt the more undifferentiated, multibrand, wholesale dimensions of the marketplace. However, NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, both owned and partnered, and particularly those that leverage a digital connection to the consumer, drove over two-thirds of our growth in North America.","Digital connections have been critical to launching new and innovative products, creating brand heat, and better serving consumer demand. For example, as part of the Epic React launch, through social media, we invited our consumers to Choose Go. The Choose Go campaign inspired more than 1 million NIKE+ members to participate in a run on the NIKE Running Club app that day and generated over 500 million social media impressions. We also launched an exclusive colorway of the Epic React with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods through a takeover of their Digital Commerce platform and social media channels. And, as Mark detailed, we\u2019re in the process of launching the NIKE app at retail in key markets bringing NIKE+ membership into the store and accelerating the convergence of digital and physical retail.","As for the Jordan Brand in North America, we are already back to a pull market, and we expect a return to global growth in fiscal year \u201819. Consumers love the Jordan Brand and their passion for the brand is unwavering. At the same time, we saw an opportunity to recalibrate the supply of select styles across just distribution channels. While that included tightening the supply in some cases, it also included expanding the supply of the hottest, most iconic Jordan styles on the NIKE SNKRS app, which has fast become the leading destination for high heat footwear launches globally. We also leveraged both Jordan and NIKE launches on the SNKRS app to create compelling new consumer experiences that merge digital and physical with our strategic retail partners, for example, through initiatives such as Shock Drop, SNKRS Pass, and SNKRS Stash.","Looking forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue diversifying the Jordan Brand for Women, in performance, and through Apparel. For the full-year North America\u2019s revenue declined 2% and EBIT was 7% lower. However, our Q4 results in North America reflect a reversal of trend and sustainable momentum going into fiscal year \u201819.","Moving to EMEA, where revenues grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in Q4, driven by strong growth in Global Football, Sportswear, and Running. Our apparel business is also particularly strong across Europe, with Global Football apparel approaching triple digit growth in Q4 fueled by high-energy national team collections associated with the World Cup. In footwear, Air Max continues to be the dominant platform in the region, with the Air Max 270 becoming the number one style across key European markets and Air Max month in March propelling Sportswear to record full-year revenues.","The NIKE Brand is also number one in all of our key cities across Europe, fueled by campaigns such as Nothing Beats a Londoner that amplified the authentic voice of over 200 London consumers along with influencers such as Skepta and several of the world\u2019s greatest athletes including Mo Farah, Harry Kane and others. This was a great example of a hyperlocal city campaign that resonated with our consumers globally.","While NIKE Direct continues to lead all dimensions of growth in EMEA, JD, for example, has also been a very strategic partner for NIKE. JD continues to leverage digital connections with consumers and differentiated store concepts, including size, to both create and serve demand. And we look forward to the best practices that they will bring to the North America marketplace","For the full-year, currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear and across Apparel. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201818 revenues grew 16% and EBIT increased 5% as strong revenue growth was offset primarily by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin.","So, next, let\u2019s turn to Greater China. In Q4, Greater China\u2019s growth accelerated to 25% on a currency-neutral basis, including strong double-digit growth across all categories, the Jordan Brand and across our Women\u2019s business. NIKE Digital growth continues to outpace all other marketplace dimensions, and we continue to partner with and learn from China\u2019s leading digital platforms. Through our partnership with Tmall, our first ever Air Max Super Brand Day in March became our largest day on the platform second only to Singles Day for the year. And with Tencent, we launched our Choose Go campaign through digital media, inspiring 2 million runners to participate in a seven-week running journey and creating strong demand for the Epic React.","For the full-year, revenues in Greater China increased 18% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by Running, Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, and NIKE Basketball. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201818 revenues were up 21% and EBIT increased 20%. There are several drivers of the extraordinary long-term growth potential we see in Greater China, from favorable macroeconomics, to the rise of sport and fitness, to the scale and impact of Digital, to the strength of the NIKE Brand. Accordingly, we will continue to invest to extend our leadership in this strategically important and fast-growing market.","In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across all key countries within this diverse geography and is being fueled by our focus on creating brand energy in key cities and through digital. In fact, while NIKE Digital growth was strong in every geography, APLA\u2019s digital growth led the pack. In addition to strong NIKE Direct Digital growth, growth through new, entrepreneurial digital partners also accelerated. Looking forward, we will continue to drive digital momentum by scaling the NIKE and SNKRS apps across key countries within APLA, while also continuing to explore and scale these digital partnerships.","For the full fiscal year, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced growth across all categories, including the Jordan Brand and our Women\u2019s business. On a reported basis, full-year revenues for the fiscal year increased 9%, while EBIT was up 21%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","And finally, at Converse, revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal year \u201818 and declined 14% in the fourth quarter. Contraction was primarily driven by the decision to right-size wholesale distribution in North America and EMEA. At the same time, Converse Direct grew double-digits in Q4, including strong double-digit growth in Digital for the full-year with acceleration in Q4. On a reported basis, full-year revenues were down 8% and EBIT declined 35%. As we move into fiscal year \u201819, we are reigniting energy in the Converse Brand, and diversifying Converse\u2019s product portfolio, both through Converse\u2019s authentic positioning in sport and through new sportswear styles and collaborations. In fiscal year \u201819, Converse will also launch a more direct, branded and immersive digital experience to drive closer connections between the Converse Brand and its passionate consumers.","Fiscal year \u201819 will be the first full-year of execution against NIKE\u2019s Consumer Direct Offense and the long-term financial goals that we detailed at our Investor Day. As we are now deeper into execution of our new offense, it is becoming increasingly clear that Digital is transforming how we operate, and will favorably reshape our economic model over the long term. Digital is inflecting our revenue growth and has a favorable mix impact on our gross margin as we capture more of the value that we are creating for consumers. And, as for SG&A, we will continue to accelerate investment in scalable digital experiences and capabilities, building both organically and through acquisitions. At the same time, we are already seeing how upfront investments in experiences, like the NIKE and SNKRS apps, and in capabilities, such as data and analytics, can be efficiently leveraged globally to better serve our consumers across our key markets. Finally, digital also creates the potential for win-win economic models with our wholesale partners over time as they transform their retail experiences to serve the next generation of digitally native consumers.","Taking all of these dynamics into account, we are updating our guidance for fiscal year \u201819. As of our last earnings call, we expected mid-to-high-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal year \u201819. As we now close Q4, our expectations for revenue growth in fiscal year \u201819 have moved up slightly, entering the high-single-digit range. This improved outlook takes into account building consumer demand for NIKE. However, we are also mindful of renewed FX volatility and the strengthening dollar of late.","As for gross margin, we now expect expansion of roughly 50 basis points or slightly greater, fueled by strong full-price sales, expanding average selling prices, and growth in our NIKE Direct businesses, partially offset by higher input costs. As for SG&A, we will continue to prioritize investment in new digital consumer experiences and capabilities, in product innovation and in brand marketing. As such, in fiscal year \u201819, we expect SG&A to grow roughly in the same range as revenue growth. We are not targeting SG&A leverage in fiscal year \u201819. We are capturing productivity gains within SG&A, but we will use that incremental capacity to invest strategically for the long-term. As for other expense, net of interest expense, we expect roughly $125 million to $150 million of expense for the full year.","We see our effective tax rate being in the mid-teens range or potentially slightly higher for the full-year. It\u2019s important to note that our tax rate will continue to be volatile based upon the full implementation and further guidance with respect to U.S. Tax Reform. Variation in our mix of earnings geographically, will also have an impact as will be impact of stock-based compensation, and other discrete items.","Our focus will remain on driving strategic transformation and delivering strong growth over the long-term, more so than on the results in any individual quarter. That said, for some additional context as we enter the fiscal year, we expect the same level of revenue growth in Q1 as we do for the full-year. We also expect less gross margin expansion in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. And, finally, as for SG&A, our investments will be more front-loaded towards the first half of the fiscal year driven by key consumer and sports moments such as the World Cup.","The Consumer Direct Offense is transforming how we operate at NIKE and how we will create value for shareholders going forward. More specifically, Digital is proving to be as transformative as we expected, and potentially even more so. We still have much work to do ahead of us to realize the full potential of our new offense; that said, it is clear as we accelerate into fiscal year \u201819 that we have now ignited NIKE\u2019s next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I guess, the question that I have is on the North American market, you talk a lot about the sustainability of the growth in the U.S. Can you just -- as you look for the -- throughout the next fiscal year, in terms of -- is expectation for like the low single-digit increase, is it expected to accelerate based on what you're seeing? I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more around the outlook in the North American market.","Andy Campion","Sure. We do see sustainable momentum in North America. As you know, our investor day guidance for North America was that we believe it was a mid single digit growth market over the next five years. And so, we don\u2019t typically provide geographical specific guidance, certainly by quarter or for the full-year. But I would say that we have momentum going into the year, and that's really primarily fueled by new innovation platform that we are scaling, NIKE Direct, certainly NIKE Digital which accelerated to well over 30% growth, driven by strong results on SNKRS and through the membership. And then, I\u2019d note that importantly, we have returned North America to healthy pull market. Inventory is clean, up only 2%; full price sales are accelerating; off price sales are declining; and gross margins are expanding. So, we do see strong momentum, sustainable momentum going in to fiscal year \u201819, but we aren't providing specific guidance by a line item by geography.","Mark Parker","And much of what you saw in terms of Q4 in terms of the momentum that has been building, we'll see that continue throughout the fiscal year. And I'll put an exclamation point on the products as being a driving force beyond just executing some of the basics better across the board.","Bob Drbul","Okay, great. And I just have a follow-up question I think for Mark. The LeBron Watch, can you just give us some insight into where you expect LeBron to land in free agency this year?","Mark Parker","I'm not going there. I think, wherever he goes, he's going to help his team more than anybody else, I think in the league. So he's -- yes, everybody wants to know that question but I can't give you any more insight.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Citi. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. My question's centered around Jordan. You made a couple of comments in the prepared comments about the brand. But, I was curious, could you remind us now like you're back into the pull model, how big that business is in terms of dollars? And could you also maybe walk us through size of a retro versus the marquee business, and if there's been any significant change in the pricing structure within Jordan?","Andy Campion","Yes. Kate, if you refer to our earnings release, this is the time of the year where we actually report our revenue by category. And what you would see in the release is Jordan brand for the 12 months ended this fiscal year was about $2.85 billion.","Mark Parker","Sorry, Kate. Can you repeat the second part of that question related to pricing?","Kate McShane","Just if there was any change in the structure of the pricing, now that you're back to the pull model for the brand?","Mark Parker","From a pricing perspective, I'd say that the leading indicator in terms of the strength of the Jordan brand is that we're seeing strong full price [ph] sales. In fact, it might be an understatement to say that our inventories are clean in North America. And that was not a result of adjusting prices. That was entirely about right sizing supply and within distribution channels. And what we've seen is that certainly with respect to the hottest styles and the most iconic styles, we've had extraordinary demand, again the demand that outpaced the supply that we had planned, particularly with respect to our digital experiences like the SNKRS approximately. So, we continue to feel that there's great price value there and certainly as we bring innovation and storytelling to those icons and across the rest of the Jordan line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jamie Merriman","Thank you very much. I had two questions related to digital. Andy, you talked about the investments that you're making in digital and the visibility that you have in terms of the results that is delivering. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about the ultimate opportunities from a profitability prospective, as that business does scale? And then, the second part would be, you mentioned Tmall I think really setting the bar in terms of your digital partners. You didn\u2019t talk about Amazon. And so I\u2019m just wondering if there are learnings from the Tmall relationship that you could work with Amazon to apply or if there is an opportunity there? Thank you.","Andy Campion","Sure. I will off start with your question around the impacts of Digital. It\u2019s a great question and a timely question. As both, Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in Digital that quite frankly exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn\u2019t by accident, we have certainly been investing both organically in digital experiences such as some of the experiences we have shared with respect to our membership initiatives as well as in capabilities. You\u2019ve heard us refer to our acquisitions of Virgin Mega, Invertex and Zodiac over time. And so that acceleration is definitely a result of the investments.","In terms of our evolving view of the impact of Digital on our economic model or how we create value for shareholders, we do see Digital being a platform that helps us better optimize supply and demand. We obviously get a very direct read and signals from consumers in terms of which products they are most interested in, and that ultimately helps us amplify revenue growth through full price sales. When we're leveraging digital in a more direct way, we obviously capture more of that revenue at the retail price. When we are leveraging digital with our partners, we do see a benefit from a full price sales and win-win relationship with our partners. Digital Commerce also has margins that are favorable from a mix perspective relative to our traditional wholesale brick-and-mortar business.","From an SG&A perspective, I would suggest there are two ways to look at it. One is short, medium and long term, and then the other one is specifically more in the shorter term. I think short, medium and long term, what we\u2019re finding is that the capabilities or experiences we\u2019re building in digital are very scalable and they are scalable in efficient way. You think about creating experiences around the SNKRS or NIKE apps, and to the extent we have success in the markets where we launched that we\u2019re then able to take that investment we\u2019ve already made and leverage it in markets around the world. And we\u2019re certainly seeing that for example with the SNKRS app, which is number one in Japan. In terms of free applications, we\u2019ve seen millions of downloads of that app since launch in China, leveraging a lot of that upfront initial investment. So, we think it's a source of leverage. At the same time, because we\u2019re focused on long-term and we do think digital has the ability to really inflect our value creation. We\u2019re accelerating investments that we\u2019re making in digital now to accelerate as down that path.","Mark Parker","And quickly on Amazon, I would just say that our partnership is progressing well. We remain focused on elevating the consumer experience on the platform, we\u2019re learning a lot, applying, and you mentioned Tmall, we did call that, partnership out in our prepared remarks, Tmall has been an exceptional partner for us. I think, the main focus is on elevating the brand profile and experience on the platform, and that will continue to be the focus as we explore next steps with the Amazon. And I'll call out our other digital platform partners to Zalando and Asos, and some of the others I mentioned earlier, this is a critical part of our digital opportunity going forward beyond what we're doing direct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel. Your line is open.","Jim Duffy","One of the things that jumped out of me from the call is that notable success you're having in capitalizing on sneaker culture for women. How far are you down the runway on this and can you highlight some things to look for in fiscal \u201819 and beyond?","Mark Parker","Well, I would say that we're in the early stages here. To be frank, the demand that we've created from our SNKRS app has greatly exceeded our expectations and done so quickly both for men and for women. This is -- I mentioned this before but one of the biggest upside opportunities, I think we have over the course of fiscal \u201819 and beyond. The response has been phenomenal, and it's truly an area that we\u2019re excited about catching up, meeting end-to-end, being in a position to serve that incredible increase in demand that we've got from sneakers and the whole sneaker culture which is now a global and connected community that is creating again incredible buzz around the world and incredible demand. In some way, it's just a great problem to have but we've got a lot of upside opportunity here.","Jim Duffy","And then, Mark, levering data, clearly a focus, where are you do you think in the process of providing data to some of the upstream operating units like design and demand planning and putting them in a position to use that data to inform business decisions?","Mark Parker","Yes. That\u2019s a great question I'd say we're on the early stages. I mean, this is a constantly moving opportunity for us, design and product creation and the express line, the supply chain they are all connecting digitally; it's predictive demand planning -- sensing and demand planning is absolutely a critical part of advancing this capability moving forward. I feel like we're making a tremendous product - or progress in that respect. I think this next fiscal year will be an acceleration, the use of data to inform product design and capabilities going forward. And then, it's actually impacting how we do our -- manage our supply chain in our manufacturing flexibility in response time. So, I think you'll see a lot of scaling of the data and analytics capabilities for NIKE here in the months and quarters ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Simeon Siegel","Just looking further out over that multiyear mid single digit North America number, is there any color you could share on how you view footwear and apparel in any distinction there in terms of how you see the competitive dynamic? Thank you.","Mark Parker","Yes. Actually, we see strength across both product types, footwear and apparel, both are competitive, market sizes for NIKE in North America but around the world.","The health of the business both on the footwear and the apparel side is actually quite strong, and demand that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re equally focused on innovation, both in performance and lifestyle, and footwear and apparel. But, we see the results that we\u2019ve rated I think in Q4 and the momentum it\u2019s building. We\u2019ll see that continue throughout the fiscal year, very bullish on both footwear and apparel, both performance and certainly Sportswear.","Andy Campion","I\u2019ll just note that in the quarter, in North America, the return to growth was fuelled by growth in both footwear and apparel with a slightly faster rate of growth in apparel and part of that rate of growth was impacted by our new partnership with the NBA and Mark referenced some of the new styles that we brought the assortment with the NBA and then more broadly across our line in basketball.","Mark Parker","And I\u2019ll mention too, it\u2019s across both men's and women\u2019s. Women\u2019s is a major growth area for NIKE, in both footwear, we mentioned SNKRS, and the sportswear success that we\u2019re seeing, but likewise in apparel, again particularly in the sportswear area.","Simeon Siegel","And so, to the point -- and to the point about the digital strength, do you see any distinction between apparel and footwear online as that business grows or is it broad-based?","Mark Parker","It\u2019s actually fairly broad based. We see it both in physical and digital, direct, and wholesale. But certainly on the footwear side, we\u2019re seeing incredible spikes in demand as I mentioned with our Direct business, particularly around the SNKRS mobile approximately, and again, expect that to continue. On the apparel side, I think it\u2019s more balanced.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Svezia from Wedbush. Your line is open.","Chris Svezia","I guess, just first, western Europe, just curious beyond the World Cup, what\u2019s your ability to maintain some of the momentum you\u2019re seeing, whether it\u2019s in footwear or apparel, maybe any color by region, digital or DTC, just sort of what you\u2019re seeing in that market, that might give you some confidence that that momentum can continue, once you get through the World Cup event?","Mark Parker","Yes. I think the underlying health of the business for NIKE in Europe is actually quite strong, beyond what we\u2019re seeing in World Cup, and again, I think that\u2019s both in footwear and apparel. Similarly to the North America, we have a clean marketplace seeing growing full-price sales, we\u2019re outpacing the marketplace, overall. It\u2019s the same dynamics. New product innovation is resonating, especially in the some of the key styles we mentioned like the Air Max franchise, the Air Max 270, the VaporMax. We\u2019re editing our product mix, we\u2019re creating more choice, but focusing on key products, and that\u2019s really helping to drive our strength in the marketplace. I think the focus too on the key cities, with hyperlocal products, and a lot of it\u2019s fuelled by Express line, it\u2019s really clicking into gear in Europe. So, we\u2019re over-indexing Europe. And again, beyond the World Cup, we expect that to continue.","Chris Svezia","And Andy for you, you outperformed Q4 on the gross margin. You guided to roughly 50 basis points for fiscal year \u201819, but it seems like some of the drivers are accelerating around products, favorable channel mix, and I believe also FX starts to become an incremental tailwind here. Can you just maybe just walk through with other pieces we might be missing that go into that gross margin to get through our product cost? But any color around that will be helpful.","Andy Campion","Sure. As I said, we see strong gross margin expansion in fiscal year \u201819, you know that our long-term financial model is to deliver as much as 50 basis points as expansion. And we have updated that outlook to be 50 basis points or slightly greater that\u2019s led by stronger full price selling as well as over-indexing growth in our higher margin NIKE Direct businesses. While FX headwinds are now behind us, we are not forecasting significant FX tailwinds based on current rates. And based on FX volatility being renewed of late, we are being measured in that regard even as we look at to the second half of the year. We are forecasting, as you noted a bit of pressure on gross margin from select input cost headwinds within labor, oil, freight materials. And I should note that our margins -- within our margins different than many of our peers, we capture a significant portion of our supply chain costs, where some of our peers capture those costs in SG&A. And so, as we're investing to 2X Speed, we do have some investments in revolutionizing manufacturing and other initiatives that are in that line item of our P&L.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Matt McClintock Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt McClintock","Andy, I wanted to follow up on something that you said in your remarks. You said supply was only a fraction of the demand, and that sounds like a pretty good problem to have. But, I was wondering, in the content of 2X Speed as you were just saying, how do we think about optimizing the total value or the total projected value of a new shoe or new sneaker in a world where you have 2X Speed and consumer demand is changing at accelerating rate?","Andy Campion","Yes. As you put it -- I think, you said it was a nice problem to have. We see it as a great opportunity to really serve the consumers who have extraordinary demand for that product better. So, frankly, along the lines of -- the notion of 2X Speed, we are attacking that opportunity with a lot of urgency, not just because it is a revenue upside potential driver which it certainly is. As I said, the supply that we had, again, some of the demand we saw on some of the hottest styles was as I said a fraction of that demand. We also see it as a great opportunity to both serve in terms of product they want but also connect in a deeper way with passionate consumers, many call them sneaker heads who have chosen to connect with us as members on the NIKE app and SNKRS.","In terms of 2X Speed, I think maybe even elevating, as Mark said, the digital transformation at NIKE is really an end to end notion. And when we think about demand sensing, the greatest opportunity we have is to sense the demand and even in a more nuance way, the signals and the preferences from the consumers that we are connecting with directly on SNKRS. We use things like notify me initiative, draws, preorders and we are coming up increasingly with even more creative ways to get a sense for how robust the demand is, either for specific products or for types of products that we may be planning to bring to market.","Nitesh Sharan","Great. Thank you, Matt. Again, thank you everyone for joining us today. I'd like to again just apologize for the technical difficulties we had earlier. We were receiving some noisy feedback. It was a great quarter though. So, if you have some business related feedback or questions related to that feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

President and CEO Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike brands, and finally, you will hear from our chief financial officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results.","Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Our Q1 results demonstrate that Nike is, without a doubt, a growth company. Nike Inc. revenues grew 15% to $8 billion. Gross margin expanded 170 basis points, and diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.09.","On previous calls, I\u2019ve highlighted three of Nike\u2019s distinct competitive advantages: our relationship with athletes and consumers, our ability to innovate, and the power of our portfolio. Those advantages are the foundation for the Q1 results we just reported, and the competitive separation we\u2019re driving in the marketplace.","First, our relationships with athletes and consumers are unparalleled. By relentlessly focusing on what they want and need, we propel our business forward. We use the insights we gain to deliver the products and services and experience athletes and consumers want. The lens we use to focus these relationships is our category offense, and the power of that approach is most clearly seen during global sports moments like the World Cup.","These events provide us with the opportunity to showcase our most innovative products, as the world\u2019s greatest athletes inspire us with their performance and their passion. They also create tremendous energy throughout the year, as we leverage these innovations and athlete stories to deliver compelling products and experiences to consumers through their favorite sports.","As I think about the evolving consumer landscape, there are a number of trends that play to Nike\u2019s strengths. The middle class is growing around the world, interest in sport continues to grow, and consumers are investing more and more in their own health and fitness. Apparel and footwear styles are becoming increasingly athletic. Because we know the consumer better than anyone else, we\u2019re able to leverage these developments to accelerate our growth. As a result, we turn trends into real business momentum.","Second, let\u2019s talk about innovation. At the heart of our ability to achieve long term growth is our unrivaled ability to innovate. Nike delivers impressive innovations because we\u2019ve developed ever-sharper insights from athletes and consumers, and we harness the power of new technologies, designs, and materials.","Our capabilities today are greater than they\u2019ve ever been. Our challenge is to edit and focus those capabilities on the most significant opportunities. And when we do this effectively, we accelerate the pace of innovation, we create competitive separation, and we deliver results, like we did in Q1.","In just the past 90 days, we\u2019ve demonstrated the versatility and potential of our advanced Flyknit technologies, with products in running, global football, basketball, and most recently, football in the U.S. The consumer benefits are incredible, and looking ahead, I know the potential for this is significantly increasing the scope and scale of this technology is very, very real.","We set new levels of performance in apparel with products such as the Nike Dri-FIT rain jacket, the Nike Pro collection, and the further extension of our Dri-Fit Knit and collections like Nike Tech Fleece continue to drive growth and distinction by leveraging technical performance features in the premium sportswear apparel.","We launched the Air Jordan 29, our lightest Jordan ever, bringing a new level of basketball performance to the Jordan brand. And just last week, we expanded the potential of our Zoom Air technology with the launch of the LeBron 12. We have some very ambitious plans for this signature Air technology. I can\u2019t tell you much more now, but I will say that the LeBron 12 is just the beginning of the revolution.","It\u2019s important to understand that Nike\u2019s innovation agenda goes beyond products. It touches everything that we do. One example is how we\u2019re leveraging the power of digital. The digital world moves fast, and Nike is at the forefront. We\u2019re employing new ways to engage consumers online as we create communities, services, and ecommerce experiences that fuel our growth strategies around the world.","These strategies are strengthening our relationships with consumers and driving our business, as ecommerce revenues were up over 70% in the first quarter. Going forward, we will innovate at an increasingly rapid pace. We are a growth company, because we are an innovation company. That is why we are committed to sustained investment in this area. We know it fuels top and bottom line expansion and drives value for our shareholders.","And when I look at our innovation pipeline, I see innovations that will, no doubt, surprise and delight, innovations that are better for athletes, consumers, and the planet. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s coming.","The final competitive advantage I want to highlight is the power of Nike\u2019s portfolio. It\u2019s a complete offense that encompasses brands, geographies, categories, product types, and channels. When all these components are working together, the portfolio generates amazing growth, and when we double and triple click into the various dimensions of our business, we see even more potential.","The diversity within our portfolio is a tremendous competitive advantage. It allows us to thrive in a rapidly changing environment, create separation, and ultimately expand the market. Trevor will discuss the Nike brand\u2019s outstanding Q1 results in more detail, but let me give you three highlights from my point of view.","One, the Nike brand is strongly resonating with consumers around the world. We\u2019re delivering robust growth and profitability in some of our largest geographies, maintaining momentum in North America, accelerating growth in Western Europe, and turning the corner with strong results in China.","Two, our category offense is accelerating growth. Our largest performance businesses, running, basketball, and global football continue to expand. Sportswear grew at a strong double digit rate, and our women\u2019s and young athletes businesses grew rapidly, in fact faster than our men\u2019s business.","And three, we\u2019re driving growth across an integrated marketplace. DTC revenues grew over 30% in the quarter, and our wholesale business grew double digits, reflecting strong growth in stores and online.","I\u2019ve said that becoming a better retailer would make us a better wholesale partner, and our Q1 results are only the beginning. We have been extremely thoughtful about the investments we\u2019ve made against our biggest growth opportunities across the portfolio. From accelerated product innovation, to enhanced consumer experiences, to sharply focused retail executions, it\u2019s the integration of complementary strategies and investments that leads to an acceleration of growth.","And we will continue to make strategic investments to drive growth for years to come. I\u2019m tremendously proud of our Q1 results, the momentum and our management team\u2019s ability to seize opportunities and manage risks. At the same time, I\u2019ve never been more excited about the potential to raise the bar even higher in the future.","Thank you, and now here\u2019s Trevor.","Trevor Edwards ","Thanks, Mark. I\u2019m also very proud of the results of the results we reported for Q1. On a constant currency basis, Nike brand revenue grew 15%, with growth across all six geographies and nearly every key category. Nike brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by comp store growth of 15%, new store expansion, and accelerated growth in online sales up 70% and global futures, a robust 14%","The great results we\u2019re reporting today clearly demonstrate the success of our vital growth strategy, the category offense. The power of the category offense is unleashed when Nike works with our wholesale partners to develop an integrated marketplace. This happens when we have the right product at the right time, presented in a way that clearly differentiates the Nike brand to consumers.","A key component of this offense is our own DTC business, which is an important complement to the wholesale business around the globe. As I said, we delivered impressive growth in the quarter, with expansion in all three DTC concepts, in line, factory stores, and Nike.com.","Our investments in DTC as a strategic driver are clearly paying off, and we continue to see even greater potential ahead. And we\u2019re investing to create compelling presentations with our wholesale partners around the world, as we expand the potential of the Nike brand in a holistic and integrated marketplace.","At Nike, we earn our place with consumers every day. The World Cup is a great example of how we harness the power of sport to deepen the relationship between consumers and the Nike brand.","We introduced more revolutionary product innovations in this World Cup than in any prior, and we\u2019re proud of the fact that more players wore Nike boots on the pitch than all other brands combined. Nearly a third of those players wore Flyknit boots. That\u2019s amazing.","We delivered products to consumers in compelling retail experiences all over the world, from our first football-only store in Copa Cabana, Brazil, to the Nike Towns in London and New York, to football-focuses executions with our wholesale partners around the world.","With great football product, compelling retail presentation, and strong consumer engagement, we drove great results. All told, global football revenue grew at a strong double digit rate in Q1, and as of the end of the quarter, we had the leading footwear market share in the nine largest football markets around the world.","Next, I\u2019d like to highlight running. Our relentless drive to serve our athletes gives us an unmatched ability to meet their needs as they compete, train, and express themselves. Our Q1 results demonstrate this with double digit revenue growth, driven by premium footwear and apparel.","In footwear, the Pegasus 31, the LunarGlide 6, and the Free Flyknit have all sold exceptionally well. In apparel, our Dri-FIT knit, with its seamless construction and comfortable fit, has continued to resonate with consumers. And in sportswear, we continue to showcase our deep heritage with products like the Air Max Lunar1, the Nike Tech Windrunner jacket, which delivered strong results.","Like the athletes we serve, we look for ways to continually improve. We see tremendous growth opportunities for running around the globe, and we look forward to another season of great events, starting this fall, with the Nike women\u2019s half marathon in San Francisco, followed by marathons from Chicago, to Amsterdam, to Shanghai.","Now, I\u2019d like to talk about our women\u2019s business, which continued to grow faster than men\u2019s. Q1 revenue for women\u2019s grew at a strong double digit pace as we focused on realizing the significant potential in this large and growing business.","It all starts by engaging and inspiring consumers, and here are some key examples. The Nike Plus Training Club has been downloaded nearly 17 million times, and has become a personal trainer for women around the world. And we\u2019re also inspiring women with live experiences every day. 70,000 members participate in Nike run clubs across the globe, and more are joining daily.","We also lead the women\u2019s market by continuing to deliver innovative products such as the performance footwear for the gym, like the Nike Free Trainer 4.0, premium apparel such as the Nike Sculpt Tights and the Nike Pro bra collection, which saw exceptional sell through, and iconic franchisees that remain incredibly popular, like our Air Max footwear and sportswear Tech Pack apparel.","Lastly, we served these consumers in increasingly dynamic retail environments. We\u2019re experiencing tremendous growth online, led by Nike.com, and in store, driven by sharper assortments and the continued expansion of the Nike Training Club concept to in line stores. And our printed and digital style guides are a key accelerator leading to increased conversion. All told, it is this complete offense that is driving impressive results for our women\u2019s business.","Let me turn to a number of our key geographies. First, Western Europe, where our incredible business momentum continued into the first quarter, with revenues up 25%. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with every key category and territory reporting double-digit growth.","There is tremendous energy around the brand in Europe, with innovative products that are resonating with consumers. We saw strong results from both performance footwear and apparel, as well as in sportswear.","A critical component to unlocking this growth is the work we have done in the marketplace. By creating category specific retail destinations with partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, and Intersport, we have differentiated the Nike brand with consumers.","We also leverage our own DTC business, including Nike.com, as a key component of a segmented marketplace. We continue to evolve our DTC strategy and the market share gains in nearly every territory send a strong signal that our efforts are working.","Next, the emerging markets, where revenues increased 10% in the quarter, with most territories growing in Q1. In Brazil, the World Cup was a tremendous success for the Nike brand. Our ability to connect with consumers was unmatched, and our enthusiasm for the long term potential of this critical market remains unchanged.","That said, the recent weakening of the Brazilian economy requires us to carefully manage the marketplace, to keep it healthy and productive for Nike and our retail partners. While we are not immune to macro conditions, we are focused on maintaining strong brand momentum and deepening consumer connections as we work to elevate the marketplace for continued growth.","In Mexico, as discussed in previous quarters, distribution challenges led to an inconsistent flow of product into the marketplace. While the Nike brand continues to resonate with consumers, inventory levels at retail are higher than we would like given the slower sell through in certain channels.","In response, we are carefully managing the flow of product into the marketplace. At the same time, we are working with our wholesale partners to clear excess inventory already in the market. This is to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico for the long term.","By staying closely attuned to consumer and marketplace dynamics, we seize opportunities and address challenges as they arise. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for long term profitable growth in the emerging markets.","In greater China, we continue to see strength in the Nike brand and positive near term results from our actions to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace. Revenues grew 20% in the quarter, led by 30% comp store growth in our own DTC doors.","At the same time, partner doors that have been reset continue to outpace the reporting of the fleet, delivering greater productivity and profitability. As we continue to deliver innovative products and compelling experiences to consumers, and reset additional retail locations, we are confident we can deliver double digit long term growth in this key market.","And finally, North America continues to be a growth driver for the company, with Q1 revenues up 12%. North America is a clear example of the incredible results we can drive with the category offense across an integrated marketplace. We saw growth in nearly every dimension of our business: wholesale and DTC, in line, factory, and online, in nearly all key categories and across our men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and young athletes businesses.","The category offense is unlocking new areas of growth in North America by serving the unique consumer segments. The more we focus and separate ourselves, the more potential we discover in our largest geography.","Ultimately, the strategies we have deployed around the world are working, and the investments we have made are yielding tremendous results. I am proud of the accomplishments, and excited about the opportunities as the momentum of our business continues to accelerate.","To put it simply, Q1 was a great quarter, and we\u2019re just getting started. Thanks. Now, here\u2019s Don.","Don Blair","Thanks, Trevor. The outstanding results we delivered in Q1 continue to demonstrate the strength of the Nike portfolio, exceeding the expectations we set only 90 days ago. As Mark discussed, these results are the product of aligned strategies and disciplined investments, creating a virtuous cycle, focused investments that deliver strong returns, fueling near term growth and additional investments.","As our Q1 results demonstrate, our strategies are delivering great returns and will continue to make targeted investments to drive long term profitable growth. The growth in Q1 was powered by our largest businesses. When our largest businesses have momentum, we\u2019re able to deliver the level of growth and profit leverage we are reporting today.","We saw double digit revenue expansion in each of our largest geographies, notably, North America, Western Europe, and China, driven by deeper and more tailored execution of our category offense in each market.","Growth in these geographies accelerated in the quarter, and profitability grew faster than revenue. Our Q1 growth was broad-based across categories, with particular strength in our largest performance categories such as basketball, running, and global football, as well as in sportswear.","While every product reported higher revenues for the quarter, we posted 18% growth in footwear, our largest and most profitable business. And while we delivered double-digit growth in wholesale revenues, DTC grew even faster.","With that introduction, I\u2019ll now recap our Q1 results. Nike Inc. first quarter revenue grew 15% on both a reported and currency neutral basis. Nike brand revenue increased 15%, and Converse revenue increased 16%.","Nike brand futures orders grew 14% on a currency neutral basis, driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by double-digit growth in North America and both European geographies, including strong growth in sportswear, basketball, running, and women\u2019s training.","On a reported basis, futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly in Japan, Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. First quarter diluted EPS increased 27% to $1.09, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased SG&A investments.","EPS also benefited from a lower tax rate and reduced share count, which together accounted for about 9 points of EPS growth. Gross margin increased 170 basis points in the quarter, driven by higher average selling prices, a mix shift to higher margin products, the continued strength of our DTC business, and a modest FX tailwind.","Gross margin also benefited from a mix shift to higher margin geographies. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from product input cost inflation. Gross margin for the quarter was better than expected, primarily due to a more significant mix shift to higher margin products and geographies, as well as stronger revenue growth in our DTC business.","Driven primarily by World Cup marketing, Q1 demand creation increased 23%, lower growth than we projected 90 days ago. As Trevor noted earlier, our World Cup marketing in Q1 was highly effective, driving energy around the world and across categories.","As a result, we decided to shift some demand creation investment to the balance of the year to support upcoming brand and product initiatives. Operating overhead grew 19% in Q1, reflecting investments in DTC, digital innovation, and infrastructure.","Other expense net was $3 million for the quarter, down significantly from Q1 of FY14, when exchange rate movements in developing markets led to significant currency conversion losses. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.7%, better than expected due to the resolution of tax audits in several jurisdictions and an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate.","Our return on invested capital continues to be strong, as ROIC reached 26.2%, 70 basis points above last year. Inventories at August 31 were up 14% year on year and remained healthy overall, with the majority of the growth driven by North America and Europe, as well as the expansion of our DTC business around the world.","Our primary areas of focus for inventory management are Brazil and Mexico, where we continue to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our performance by segment. In North America, Q1 revenue increased 12% on both a reported and currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in basketball, women\u2019s training, and global football. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 15%, while apparel grew 10%.","Direct-to-consumer revenues increased 22% in Q1, driven by 11% comp store sales growth and significantly higher Nike. com revenues. On a reported basis, Q1 EBIT for North America grew 19%, due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion.","For Q1, Western Europe revenue grew 25% on a currency neutral basis, with double-digit growth across all territories and categories. As both Mark and Trevor discussed, we\u2019re very pleased with the results of our work to develop an integrated marketplace with engaging, differentiated retail presentations. Both DTC and wholesale revenues advanced strongly for the quarter.","On a reported basis for Q1, Western Europe revenue increased 32%, while EBIT jumped 52%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, as well as the translation benefit of a stronger euro.","In central and eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues rose 9%, with growth across all key categories except action sports, and all territories except Russia and Israel. We continue to closely monitor the situation in these markets, and remain focused on the things we control, building strong consumer connections, leading with innovative products, and managing a healthy marketplace.","Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our results in CEE, and remain confident in this geography\u2019s growth prospects. On a reported basis, revenue for CEE grew 7%, but EBIT declined 16%, reflecting FX headwinds, particularly in Russia, lower gross margins, and SG&A investments to support the World Cup.","In greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 20% for the quarter, with double-digit growth in our three largest categories: sportswear, basketball, and running. As Trevor discussed, we\u2019re seeing the results of our strategies to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace.","On a reported basis for Q1, China revenue rose 18% while EBIT grew 28% as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset the impact of SG&A investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus.","On our last earnings call, we projected revenues in China to grow at a somewhat faster rate in Q1 than for the full year, due to changes in seasonal product flow and significant variations in prior year comparisons. Q1 growth was even stronger than we expected, due to higher DTC revenue growth and at once sales. We expect these trends to continue, driving FY15 revenue growth for China to a low to mid-teens rate, with the growth heavily weighted to the first half.","In the emerging markets, currency neutral revenues increased 10%, reflecting revenue growth in every territory except Mexico and our Latin American distributors. From a category perspective, the growth was led by double-digit growth in sportswear, running, global football, basketball, and women\u2019s training.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for the emerging markets grew 4%, but EBIT declined 26% as a result of marketing investments in the World Cup and FX headwinds in a number of markets. We remain confident in the significant growth potential of this geography, and as Trevor discussed, we\u2019re focused on doing the right things now to evolve these developing marketplaces and further strengthen our brand to generate sustainable, profitable growth for years to come.","First quarter revenue for Converse increased 16% on a reported and currency neutral basis, driven by market conversions in Europe and Asia, as well as continued growth in direct distribution markets such as the U.S. and the U.K. EBIT increased 10% for the quarter, as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in DTC and infrastructure to support the brand\u2019s long term growth and profitability.","We entered FY15 with tremendous brand and business momentum that drove outstanding Q1 financial results. Our updated FY15 guidance reflects continued momentum over the remainder of the year, fueling sales growth in revenue and EPS as well as enabling continued investments for sustainable, profitable growth.","For revenue, we now expect constant dollar growth for Q2 and full year in the low double digits. This accelerated growth reflects robust consumer demand in our largest markets and categories, with particular strength in our DTC business. Our current outlook for reported revenue growth is 1 to 2 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar.","We now expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by 125 to 150 basis points. This is above our prior expectations, as our strategies to increase average selling prices continue and growth in our higher margin businesses, including DTC, continue to accelerate.","These benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor and our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets geography. In addition, given current exchange rates, we expect FX will have a neutral impact on gross margin for the balance of the year, versus the benefit we recorded in Q1. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 125 basis points.","As both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in them. We expect demand creation to grow at a low double-digit rate for Q2, and at a high single-digit rate for the full year.","Operating overhead is expected to grow at a high teens rate for Q2, and at a mid to high teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation and key operating capabilities.","For full year full year 2015, we now expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24.5%. Overall, assuming no material changes in FX rates, we expect earnings per share to grow at a high teens rate for Q2, and about 20% for the full year, reflecting strong top line momentum and continued gross margin expansion, partially offset by strategic investments in our biggest growth drivers.","Q1 was a great start to the fiscal year, and we remain confident in our ability to drive strong growth and deliver shareholder value. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane - Citi ","My first question is on China. Don, you had mentioned that you expect the growth to be stronger in the first half than the second half. What happens in the second half that gives you a little less confidence that you can achieve that same level of growth that you expect for the first half?","Don Blair ","Yeah, it\u2019s really not related to this year\u2019s momentum. It\u2019s really the comparisons to the prior year. We do believe that we\u2019ve really seen fantastic improvement in that marketplace, and so this is not a belief that there\u2019s any lack of momentum in the back half. It\u2019s really the comparisons to the prior year.","Kate McShane - Citi ","And then my second question has to do with the category offense in Europe. It sounds like women\u2019s is really starting to work very well. And I wondered if, in regards to just the overall category offense in Europe, will we see another wave or another level of category offense for women in Europe now? Or is it all happening concurrently?","Trevor Edwards ","Just to hit on the category offense, of course, we\u2019re obviously very pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing in Western Europe. And it really comes back to the decisions we made a couple of years ago, when we decided to really reset the offense and really get focused on the category offense in Western Europe, with a more centralized model which allowed us to get closer to our account and work with them to really help expand the marketplace.","So we\u2019re seeing tremendous benefit, actually, come from that. So strong resonance with consumers. Around the women\u2019s business, specifically, yes, we have now, as we said, focused it on our both running, women\u2019s training, as well as our sportswear business. That offense is actually running in Europe. And again, we\u2019re also seeing a really increased drive around sneaker culture, building around women in Western Europe.","So we feel very positive about the growth that we\u2019re seeing. And more importantly, we feel very positive about the long term potential of the opportunity in Western Europe and actually around the world.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad of ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group ","The ecommerce number this quarter was kind of through the roof, the acceleration from last quarter and from last year, off of really kind of a very high growth already. Did something change? Did you open up new markets in terms of the digital ecommerce front? Is there a new logistical capability there? What\u2019s the underlying driver of that pretty significant acceleration? And then is that sustainable? Do you have the logistics and the inventory in place to kind of maintain that type of growth rate there?","Mark Parker ","We\u2019re very bullish on our ecommerce opportunity. We\u2019ve invested quite heavily in improving our operational capabilities or supply chain. We\u2019re seeing, again, the category offense really resonate through dotcom. Obviously, it is the preferred channel, where a lot of consumers are shifting and moving.","Women\u2019s business is up significantly in that mix. Our customization, or Nike ID, up significantly. Running, sportswear, really across the main key categories, we\u2019re seeing tremendous resonance in that channel.","This will continue to be a major growth opportunity for Nike, and definitely a source of further investment. We think that the return on this investment will be as strong, frankly, as anywhere we have in the company. Very bullish. Top, top priority for the company, and continued opportunity for growth and profitability.","Trevor Edwards ","One of the things I\u2019d just add to that would be on, using the category offense, we\u2019re able to basically segment and understand how to grow the running business, the women\u2019s business, each of the different dimensions of the business, so that our teams are squarely focused on doing that. So we think that\u2019s also really helping to accelerate the growth that we\u2019re seeing in the ecommerce business.","Omar Saad - ISI Group ","Thanks, and then, switch gears on my second question. Around the endorsement strategy, the sports marketing assets, you had some things happen over the last 90 days or so. You were able to keep Kevin Durant. It sounds like the Manchester United contract moved somewhere else. How do you think about it philosophically, strategically, or how should we think about where you want to make those investments, and which cases you might not want to make those investments? Or is there no rule of thumb, it\u2019s really just individual case by case, where you see the opportunities?","Trevor Edwards ","First, I\u2019ll just start by saying that obviously we believe very much in the power of sport and athletes to inspire people. So we\u2019re obviously very focused behind that. And obviously, some of the things that have been happening, it\u2019s been quite a mix in the marketplace. Obviously, some issues are seriously concerning to us. On the other side, you have some great opportunities with some great athletes like Kevin Durant and our ability to re-sign those athletes.","So from our perspective, we really line up how we connect and sign the right athletes, really based on where we see the biggest growth opportunities. We line those two things up and we make sure that we find the athletes and the teams that can inspire consumers and at the same time make sure that we can use that to then drive our business. And we remain singularly focused on that.","Mark Parker","You know, the athletes aren\u2019t just a source of or a platform to promote the brand and to get brand exposure. They\u2019re the source of insights that we get. The relationships we have with the athletes are really what drives the innovation that ultimately drives our business and our growth potential. So that\u2019s been there since day one. That will continue to be the case moving forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ohmes from Bank of America.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America ","Two questions. The first, so the North American footwear growth, up strong, still up, I think 15%. Any channels of distribution in North America that are outperforming that you could call out? And then the second question is, the sportswear double-digit growth, I think you mentioned it for North America, China, and Europe. Can you remind us how long sportswear has been growing at that rate and when the change was, and what\u2019s driving that acceleration in that part of your business?","Trevor Edwards ","Around North America first, I would say that obviously we\u2019re seeing great momentum in North America. And we think it continues to demonstrate the power of the category offense. You know, the ability for us to really connect with the consumer to make sure that we can drive the right products into the market, the most innovative products. And we\u2019re seeing incredible sell through amongst all of our products. So really, we\u2019re seeing it across all the different channels. It\u2019s pretty balanced in terms of the strength, so really on every dimension, as we mentioned, we\u2019re just seeing great growth.","One of the things, we\u2019re very proud of the relationships that we have with our wholesale partners, our retail partners, because they really are working with us to better dimensionalize the market so we can continue to grow it. So we\u2019re seeing just great growth from that.","Then specifically around sportswear, if you recall over the couple years, we\u2019ve certainly seen sportswear business grow double digit. Certainly on the premium part of the business. Where we saw the lagging part was certainly around the more entry priced opportunity. We\u2019re seeing that business really strengthen too. So that\u2019s really helping to buoy the results that you\u2019re seeing around sportswear.","So again, it\u2019s when all the pieces start to work together, both footwear, apparel, as well as both the premium and also the entry business. And we\u2019re seeing that really play in all the markets that you mentioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","The first question that I have is, the DTC up 30, ecommerce up 70, do you believe that you\u2019re seeing any signs of potential cannibalization with your wholesale\/retail partners anywhere?","Trevor Edwards ","No, I wouldn\u2019t say that. Like I mentioned before, the thing that we\u2019ve been able to put in place is this idea of an integrated marketplace. And DTC plays a role that\u2019s been a complementary part of the marketplace. So we\u2019re able to actually bring more dimension to the market by serving unique segments. And that allows the market to be more segmented and more differentiated. And we believe that\u2019s [unintelligible] incredible amounts of growth.","The other piece that we\u2019ve talked about is the idea of us being a better retailer ourselves, so we can be a better wholesale partner. And that is actually working, so we\u2019re able to transfer a lot of the learnings that we have done in our own stores, working with our retail partners around the world to accelerate their businesses too.","Bob Drbul - Nomura ","And my second question is, around the NFL business, can you just comment on sort of the sales trends of the jerseys and the sportswear? And specifically, I can\u2019t seem to find a Richard Sherman jersey for my son, and I was just wondering if you could maybe talk to the process of selection on which athletes you\u2019re choosing for the jerseys these days.","Trevor Edwards ","[laughs] I will try and find out exactly where your son is and make sure that you can get one.","Kelley Hall","Bob, I\u2019ll help you with that. We\u2019ll let Trevor answer the business question.","Trevor Edwards ","The NFL business continues to perform really well, and so we have a great relationship, a great partnership with the NFL, and we continue to see the jersey business grow. It didn\u2019t grow as fast as it did the prior year, and that\u2019s obviously because we had brought newer uniforms in, but we certainly see good growth in our NFL business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus ","The first, increases in ASPs in the futures has been really impressive. What are the ongoing opportunities in ASP, and what\u2019s your feeling on the sustainability of that trend?","And then secondly, what are some of the opportunities in the supply chain for efficiencies to offset some of the inflationary inputs that you\u2019re seeing?","Trevor Edwards ","Certainly on the pricing side, what I would say is that, you know, we have been really focused on ensuring that we give the consumer the best value, and we really start there. And we\u2019re making sure that, given the strength of our brand and the power of the innovation that we bring into the products, that we have the ability to really command a premium price. And we\u2019re able to do that not only in individual markets, because we work specifically in each market, to make sure that we\u2019re paying attention to the market dynamics so that we can obviously give the consumer the most value.","Mark Parker ","And I think, Jim, on your second question, about the supply chain, we\u2019re working really across the whole supply chain and harvesting opportunities all the way from manufacturing modernization and implementation of things like Lean manufacturing or improved human resource practices in the factories, doing some factory automation, as I said, all the way to more revolutionary technologies like Flyknit.","We\u2019re also continuing to work on streamlining the whole supply chain and making sure that we\u2019re matching up the supply and demand as tightly as possible, which reduces closeouts and maximizes margins. So there\u2019s a tremendous number of opportunities. We feel that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to take advantage of some of those things as we work to offset input cost inflation.","Don Blair ","Let me add that the manufacturing revolution focus is a big one for us. It\u2019s not only a place where we can see some margin opportunity by scaling some of these innovations that are really, in a sense, game-changing. And we\u2019re talking beyond Flyknit. We\u2019re on the verge of moving some other what we call man rev, or manufacturing revolution innovations to a much larger scale. So there\u2019s a great opportunity there. And those processes actually allow us to create products that are more innovative at the same time, to actually improve performance while we actually get some margin opportunity at the same time.","Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus ","Some of the increase we\u2019re seeing in ASP, is that a function of the supply chain, just better managing the flow of inventory and having less discounting?","Don Blair ","We have seen some benefit to that in most parts of the world, certainly. But I think as Trevor said earlier, the improvements in ASP are really two things. It\u2019s really the value equation and how we approach the consumer from a pricing standpoint. It\u2019s also the tremendous strength at the top end of the market, the premium end of the market, driven by innovation.","So if you look at the mix of our product, it\u2019s really been extraordinarily strong at the premium end. And it\u2019s really, as Trevor said, the value of putting the brand, the product, and then compelling retail distribution in place, which lets you shift the market to premium and maximize price.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","You\u2019ve told us the story about Western Europe a bit and made the analogy to the category offense strategy that you put in in the U.S., and I think you\u2019ve injected a lot of those disciplines so far over there. But can we maybe talk a little bit about some of the similarities you\u2019re been able to capture, and maybe some of the differences as you are now, I would say, in the middle innings of rolling that out in Europe?","And maybe as we think longer term about Western Europe, it\u2019s growing very well, but you\u2019ve seen higher margins there in the past. That obviously looks like an opportunity. Is there an opportunity there to push above prior peaks with the category offense, like you did in the U.S.? Or do you think that for now that market still needs some investment to get to what you think the potential is?","Trevor Edwards ","Around Western Europe, and speaking about the similarities, the first thing I\u2019d say, for example, what we did see earlier, we saw certainly a very rapid growth of our running business in North America. And we saw that we were able to really grow the running market in a substantial way.","We saw that Western Europe was trailing in that respect. We\u2019re now seeing that actually take place in Western Europe. So as an example, we\u2019re seeing a lot of the ideas and a lot of the things that were done in North America really play the same way in Western Europe.","Having said that, we do execute sometimes slightly differently in some of those marketplaces. So recognizing where the consumer is different or they might approach it from a different perspective, we do make sure that we have tailored product offerings that will meet that specific consumer\u2019s need in that marketplace.","The other part is just a matter of, we\u2019re still in early days. And so when you think about, we\u2019ve got running rolled out, we\u2019ve obviously got an incredible focus on footwear, we\u2019re amplifying our business in terms of how we think about our category business.","And then when you drill it down and you go into our markets within Western Europe, you can only see more growth opportunities. So we\u2019re seeing great growth come out of Germany. We\u2019re seeing great growth come out of the U.K.","So it\u2019s really a matter of, we think about that as a portfolio in and of itself. And that\u2019s what we believe helps us to continue to see even further growth. But we see tremendous potential in this marketplace, and we\u2019re only just scratching the surface.","Mark Parker ","We have a lot of confidence around our ability to leverage and scale best practices around the world, but then also, at the other end, to tailor our product and marketing as needed, even down to the city level. So it\u2019s that combination, I think, that is really a part of Nike\u2019s strength and our potential.","Michael Binetti - UBS ","If I could ask you one follow up. You guys have really obviously been focused on pricing, and we see the numbers go by with your new disclosure, how much that\u2019s adding to the gross margins quarter to quarter. Could you talk about the pricing strategy a little bit there? And what I find to be counterintuitive is how you guys are getting such a nice benefit from pricing while a lot of other categories in the U.S. in particular are seeing pricing pressure. How do you think about policing that to make sure you\u2019re protecting from overheating down the road, as you think about your higher level pricing strategy?","Trevor Edwards ","A couple of things there. I think one of the things that we, I think, did a number of years ago is we really embedded pricing into the way that we do the business every single day. So we\u2019re working on pricing at a style by style level and a market by market level, and making sure that ultimately we deliver the value to the consumer.","At the same time, we do believe the power of our brand, and our ability to bring more innovation to the market, is really helping to drive a premium position. And we\u2019ve seen it really in every market around the world where the consumer is definitely trending towards premium products. Well made with great innovation is certainly resonating with the consumers.","But again, we do stay very mindful of the market situations in every market to make sure that we remain competitive and attack it at all different price points.","Mark Parker ","And I\u2019d add one other thing too. In our organization, the people who are really on the front lines from a pricing and a consumer value standpoint are the merchants. So this is a set of decisions that the people who are at the marketplace are really driving that strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets","Mark, if I could follow up on the commentary on the manufacturing revolution. Completely agree with it being potentially game changing. And I think this was kind of the first time we had heard the potential that that could be sooner rather than kind of a long term opportunity. Could you just speak to, again, specifically beyond Flyknit, is it 3D printing, is it other disruptive technologies that are in play? Again, the timing of when you might be able to scale that and what that level of penetration might look like?","Mark Parker ","Yeah, I\u2019m not going to go into great detail here and now, but I will say that these breakthroughs really come in the shorter term, the midterm, and the long term. You know, we\u2019ve got a steady flow of innovations beyond Flyknit to speed up our manufacturing, to make the whole process of manufacturing more efficient, more sustainable, and offset some of those higher input costs. Specifically, 3D printing, that has a tremendous opportunity for us. That\u2019s a bit on the longer road side of things. But we intend to be on the forefront of that potential. And there\u2019s other things that I don\u2019t want to get into at this point, that will start to make a more meaningful impact over the next one to three years.","Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets ","And then maybe if I could switch gears, as we think about heading into the Brazil Olympics, clearly a little bit of a macro downtick there as well as just some of the distribution issues across the Latin America region. How do we think about managing the emerging market business into that. Do you double down from an investment in sort of demand creation standpoint? Do you manage back on that? Again, it\u2019s much bigger in terms of showcasing the Nike brand on a global level, but anything kind of region specific we should think about into that event?","Trevor Edwards ","I\u2019d say first that the brand is very strong in Brazil. It\u2019s very strong in Latin America. And in fact, the World Cup obviously was a great example of, it was a tremendous success for us. I think what you\u2019re seeing around Latin America right now is certainly some macroeconomic headwinds that we\u2019re working through. And what we\u2019re essentially trying to do is make sure that we\u2019re taking prudent steps to proactively manage the flow of product into the marketplace. To make sure that the market can actually remain healthy for both us as well as for our retail partners. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. So it\u2019s more about making sure that we balance it.","For the long term, we are tremendously enthusiastic about the opportunity that lies in the Brazilian market and in Latin America. Very high sports markets. Consumers have a very good passion for the brand and certainly passion for sport. So we really are very bullish about that market long term.","Kelley Hall","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","The next question comes from David Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank","I wanted to ask about the North American running business. I think you gave some color on some of the footwear and apparel SKUs, products that did well. But I was wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into the consumer and kind of what are they looking for in product, and if that\u2019s changing at all as we go into the holidays. And then also, I\u2019m not sure if you gave a performance number for how North American run did, but if you could, that would be great.","Trevor Edwards ","Around running, obviously running is our heritage, and it\u2019s obviously our largest performance category. And we continue to see great growth in our running business. In fact, the running business grew double digits this year on top of double digits last year. So it certainly is still driving.","What we\u2019re seeing in the category of running, certainly around runners, we\u2019re obviously seeing the women\u2019s business grow at a great clip. So we\u2019re seeing strong growth among the women\u2019s business, but also amongst the premium business. So that consumer continues to want more dimension, I would say. And also, we\u2019re seeing great things like focus on technology and certainly the focus on color. And all those things are starting to drive that marketplace.","The other part to the running business is also the apparel. We\u2019re seeing a great growth around premium apparel in running. Now, the one area that, again, we continue to see opportunity for is strengthening our product line, certainly around the lower price points. And this is what Mark always speaks about, the complete offense. And this is the opportunity where we can really focus in more around our core business and really make sure that we strengthen that.","But all in all, the running business is still strong. And we obviously can see the pipeline that\u2019s going to be coming, so we feel very confident about the continuation of driving the running business in North America.","Don Blair ","And unfortunately, we do not give category level information for our geographies.","Kelley Hall","Okay, well, thank you everyone for joining us, and we will look forward to talking to you at the end of next quarter.

Thank you for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Kelley, and hello everyone. Fiscal year 2016 was a strong for NIKE. Let's take a look at the highlights. NIKE, Inc revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion despite significant FX headwinds. On currency neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 46.2%. Earnings per share rose 17% to $2.16. And we delivered ROIC of 29.7%. Year end is when we reflect on our success is over the last 12 months. And I am proud to say that there were many for NIKE. But more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead. To focus on the opportunities in front of us. We just kicked off an amazing summer of sport. Lebron, Kyrie and Cavs made Basketball history coming back from an unprecedented 3 to 1 deficit in the finals to win the NBA championship. It was a total team effort to be sure but the storyline of Lebron bringing its championship back to his hometown Cleveland will be down as one of the greatest in recent history. ","In Global Football, we saw a monumental win for Chile taking the Copa America Title for the second time in a row. In the European Championship after some remarkable moments were now down to the final eight. And we can't wait for Rio to watch the best athletes in the world under the brightest lights. As you know, the backdrop of our business is more dynamic than is ever been. But NIKE wins because we just don't adapt to these forces, we create and shape the change. We lead. For example, we are all seeing the growing power of sports. Participation is increasing all over the world. People are leading healthier, more active lives. At the same time, the rise in sport culture is bringing fitness and style together. Profoundly influencing what we all wear everyday. It's clear our amplify category offense is a model that works. We are growing the business across the entire lifestyle of sports, from performance to sportswear. And in retail our industry is in the early stages of unprecedented transformation. Mobile innovation and personal services are dominating the landscape. That's why we invest in integrating digital and physical retail seamlessly, giving our consumers better access to the products they want and while we are working even closer with our best wholesale partners who share our vision for the future of retail.","Manufacturing too is undergoing its own revolution. We are rethinking the fundamentals across our business. And how we make products, how fast we deliver them and what kind of impact they leave behind. With other innovators like Flex or HP, we are deploying projects across our source base to reduce cost and delivery time, improve quality, explore customization and enhance performance. As the global leader this is what we do. Through the power of sport, the transformation of our industry and the shifts in consumer preferences and expectations, we build the foundation for tremendous long-term growth for NIKE. ","In the near term we know there are certain areas where we have work to do. But nobody is more demanding of our business than we are internally. And while outside of NIKE we face macroeconomic and geo political volatility, our complete offense gives us our greatest competitive advantage. It's how we drive profitable, sustainable growth in the near and long term. ","The complete offense puts the consumer at the center of our business. Aligned by sport in the most important markets across multiple channels. This diversity is unique to NIKE and it's our competitive strength. We have the ability to leverage our portfolio and dial up or dial down the many dimensions of our business depending on the need. And in fiscal year 2016 we did just that. Putting a special focus on the areas that we make the biggest impact in the years ahead. Performance innovation, sport style innovation and digital. ","Let's start with performance innovation with just a few of the highlights. The LunarEpic Flyknit, a revolutionary mid- height running shoe. Free run motion with the most natural ride ever. The Kobe 11, a low top that pushes what's possible with Flyknit. The Kyrie 2, a shoe to match the speed and cutting of Kyrie. The Mercurial SuperFly 5, .a fastest football boot ever, adaptive lacing, our first step into personalized performance. Our anti clock traction system which prevents the age old problem of mud sticking to cleats. Thermosphere Max which regulates temperature in cold weather. And our vapor kits with AeroSwift technology, the latest, fastest and most sustainable football kits ever. These are just a few of the highlights that show the breadth and depth of what NIKE delivers over the course of a year. Adding at the fiscal year 2017, we have a full pipeline of innovation on the way. We've never delivered such relentless flow of breakthrough products across all sports. What you saw in March is just beginning to deliver to consumers. And will continue throughout the year. ","Now while our innovative products change the rules or performance, they also create a new static, a new look. NIKE has a way of aspiring an athlete even before they laced up their shoes. And athletes have always told us when look faster and strong they play better. We know that creating an emotional connection through product doesn't just happen by accident. It takes a steady flow of investment, inspiration and talent. Time and again the consumer votes for NIKE because we represent authenticity and thoughtful story telling. We obsess finishing in materials and color and we understand the power for both function and form. At the same time we bring performance benefits to sportswear. What we call sport style innovation. We deliver light weight breath ability and comfort to product for everyday life. And it drives the significant business for NIKE. We see great potential for innovation and growth ahead with sportswear. ","Finally, I'll turn to digital services and experiences. More than any year before it fiscal 2016 saw NIKE deepen our commitment to serving athletes personally at scale. And that means more in person experiences through one to one appointments at retail or support through run clubs and training session. And of course it also means leveraging the power of our family of apps. This quarter the new NIKE+ app is in beta testing with a select audience as we prepare for the full launch later this summer. So far we've received very positive feedback on its simplicity and tailored features.","We are excited about the enormous potential for NIKE + to unite our digital platform and deliver personalized performance at tremendous scale. Through products, coaching and experiences. The investments we make in mobile and online experiences are paying off. With our nike.com business growing 46% in fiscal 2016. And we've continue to expand our global reach with nike.com going live in 20 new countries this year, now totaling over 40 markets around the world. ","We are still in early stages of digital service but we continue to show the building meaningful relationships with consumers' drives growth and strengthen our brand in unlimited ways. So how will NIKE continue to lead in fiscal 2017? Within our complete offense where do we see the greatest opportunities for growth? Our focus will be continue to drive our potential across North America and Western Europe, to expand our leadership in China and across our emerging markets, to unleash the power of the Jordan brand across multiple categories. To accelerate our complete women's business. And to grow the young athletes business globally through premium products and extend our leading position in running, Basketball and sportswear. And specifically how will we get there. We invest in the transformation of the marketplace through nike.com and stronger executions with our best wholesale partners. Return the energy of style and performance in the long-term business momentum. And we drive a continuous cycle of innovation. We've never seen as much opportunities as we do today and I've never been more confident in the future NIKE is creating. ","With that I'll turn it over to Trevor.","Trevor Edwards ","Thanks Mark. I feel great about the results we delivered for the year. Once again illustrating the power of the NIKE brand portfolio. From our geographies and categories, from wholesale to DTC and across men's, women's and young athletes. In fiscal year 2016, NIKE proved yet again that the diversity of our business is one of our greatest competitive advantages. Let's take a look at the numbers. ","On the constant currency basis, NIKE Brand grew 8% for the quarter. For the year revenue was up 13% with double digit growth in nearly all geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 23% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 25% driven by online growth of 51% new store and comp store growth of 10%. And finally Global Futures are up 11%. The growth throughout fiscal year 2016 is a direct a result of a deep relationships we have built with consumers. Our relentless focus on individual athletes around the world bolsters those connections year in and year out. Whether at retail, online or at live experiences, NIKE's unique ability to serve the global consumer to the length of their favorite sport is what drives such consistent growth for the NIKE brand. To see this growth in action, let's take a look at a few of our categories. ","In Running, we delivered 10% growth for the year. With the category reaching $5.3 billion in revenue on a constant currency basis. Contributing to this growth was our Pegasus franchise and statement to power including the dry fit cool top, the AeroSwift short and the Power Speed tight. Q4 was also highlighted by key innovative footwear launch is led by the LunarEpic, a disruptive style that offers an amazingly smooth ride and remarkable soft like fit. Excitement is building for the LunarEpic med and the LunarEpic low which will launch in a couple of days. We also extended our NIKE free platform with the launch of the free run the free run Flyknit and the free run motion, which saw strong sale through for both men and women. At the same time there was incredible momentum with our NIKE inspired sportswear in Q4. This was highlighted by our global activation of the Air Max Day, where we engaged hundreds of millions of consumers create a massive scale end impact. By celebrating classic silhouettes and updating them with new technology, trends and pattern, we fuel the culture of sneakers around the world. ","Finally, Q4 underscored the success of our running -inspired apparel. Our NIKE Tech Hypermesh line including the Wind Runner and the Bomber saw strong sell through thanks for its extra light, ventilated fabric that keeps athletes warm as the weather changes. By taking an iconic product and remixing it with groundbreaking innovation, the Hypermesh Wind Runner is the perfect embodiment of how NIKE drives leadership in sportswear. ","Next let's take a look at Basketball which is increasingly its own portfolio with NIKE Basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. No matter the landscape this complete offense is our foundation that keeps us well positioned to always inspire and serve Basketball fans across the globe through innovative products at both performance and sportswear. As Mark said, we are thrilled for Lebron and the rest of the cast team for bringing home a championship for Cleveland. Lebron's MVP performance in which he was the first player in the NBA history to lead all players in points, rebound, assist, steals and blocks for entire final. That won't be forgotten soon. And consumers have responded. The shoe he wore in the finals, the Lebron soldier 10 has seen incredible sell through in the week since it was released. ","And of course Kyrie who hit the series winning shot in game 7 continue to cement his place as one of the game's best players and the fan favorite. The Kyrie 2 has seen strong sell through across multiple color ways and we are excited about the future of the Kyrie signature line. ","And I'd remiss if I didn't also give a shout out to Kevin Durant who had an amazing player himself. The initial launch last week of the KD9 with its Flyknit upper atop a full zoom airbag sold out completely. ","In Jordan Footwear, we see continued momentum as the Air Jordan 30 and Jordan Ultra Fly drive excitement in the US and around the world. And on the Sportswear side, the Air Jordan Retro 12 celebrating Jordan's epic playoff performance in 1997 was one of the largest launches in the quarter. Also incredibly successful was the launch of the Air Force One Flyknit low which weighs 50% less than the original thanks to an all new ultra breathable NIKE Flyknit upper.","Before I close Basketball I have to mention an unforgettable moment from the quarter. Lebron last game, one of the games greatest went out in storybook style with 60 points and dominant final stretch. The Kobe 11 Momba Day ID shoe was the most successful ID launch ever with incredible demand in North America and Greater China. While the end of Kobe's playing career closes one chapter, we are excited what the future holds for Kobe and NIKE together. Ultimately, no brand can provide what we bring to the sport of Basketball. The power of performance and sportswear, true global reach, the world's best roster of athletes and an incredible pipeline of products to come over the next year and beyond. ","Finally, to appreciate how our entire portfolio of categories comes to light, let's take a look at a key growth driver for us our sportswear category. NIKE Sportswear takes the lifestyle of sport and amplifies it across all our performance categories. For the year, Sportswear grew 22% and reached $8.1 billion, adding nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in this category alone. Our strong sportswear category puts us in a unique position to fuel passion for sport around the world. From the Roshe to the Huarache to the Foam Posit and many more. We have the innovative and stylish products that consumer continue to love. While consumer preferences can shift over time, no brand is better positioned to serve the consumer across our globally diversified portfolio from performance to lifestyle through our category amplified offense. This is the unique power of the NIKE Brand. ","Let's now turn to a few of our key geographies. First, North America which delivered strong growth for the year with revenues up 8% driven by Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running. We continue to work more closely with our key wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods and the Foot Locker to deliver compelling retail experiences for our consumers. And our DTC business also has another strong year, up 17% including ongoing strength in nike.com. For Q4, North America revenue was flat to prior year due to timing shifts related to delay delivery in fiscal year 2015 from the West Coast port congestion. As of the end of Q4, inventory levels in our full price in line channels are clean consistent with the goal we shared last quarter. ","Looking ahead to Q1, we will continue to clear excess inventory through our factory stores and select third party value channels. At the same time, we remain focused on sustaining a healthy pull market in the end line channel and we are practically managing the flow of products into the marketplace with a focus on new innovative products for our consumers. As always we continue to focus on serving the consumer in this critical geography with brand proven time and time again it remains incredibly strong in North America. ","We are confident that the actions we are taken will ensure that we are set up to deliver long-term profitable growth. Now let's turn to Western Europe where we've seen broad based demand with growth of 19% in the quarter and 14% for the year. Growth in the quarter and throughout the year was fueled by our continued efforts to transform the marketplace along the category offense. In Q4, all territories grew double digits and all key categories grew led by Sportswear, Global Football, Jordan Brand and Running. And our DTC business continues to perform well growing 26% in the quarter. In Q4, we also extended our partnership with one of the world's most storied football club FC Barcelona. And with the European Championships currently in force, we are excited about our line of national team kit which offer groundbreaking performance innovations such as engineered mid zones, enhanced fit and breatheability. ","The momentum we've seen in fiscal year 2016 in Western Europe combined with the strength of NIKE Brand reinforces our view that there is tremendous growth potential in this geography. Our focus on the consumer will continue to build on that momentum as we head into the fiscal year 2017 and beyond. And finally in Greater China, we had a truly incredible year. Q4 revenue grew 23% and we posted full year growth of 27% with strong growth in nearly every category and across footwear and apparel. Full year growth was driven primarily by Sportswear, Running, Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand. In DTC, we saw growth of 44% with continued strong growth online as well as in our stores. For our wholesale partner stores that have been re-profiled, they continue to outperform the rest of the fleet. ","As we continue to transform the marketplace, we are starting to reach scale with our doors that we re-profiled along the category offense. We worked with our partners to tailor everything from concept to environment, from assortment to service and throughout the must win trade zones to deliver the best experience for our consumers. A great example of this is the opening of our Running store in Chung Du, a new concept in the marketplace that we plan to scale. This store significantly exceeded our expectations within the first few weeks, further illustrating how consumer responds when you relentlessly obsess serving the athlete. Ultimately we get to close that in fiscal year and start a new one in the best possible way with the summer Olympics. I can't wait for August and how powerful a moment it will be around the globe. The power of the world's great athletes coming together. The power of the reveal of the world's most innovative products and the power of connecting with consumers in even more personal ways to celebrate their passion and love for sport. It's the kind of global experience that promises to further accelerate our momentum and it makes me incredibly excited about what's in store. Thanks. Now here is Andy. ","Andy Campion","Thanks Mark and Trevor. And good afternoon everyone joining us on the call. As we close fiscal year 2016 NIKE is better positioned than ever to continue delivering strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital. While we are an increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have a management team with experience and a proven track record of working all of the levers within our business to deliver strong financial performance under a wide range of circumstances. Even more importantly, NIKE is the number rated brand by consumers in every major market and every key city around the world. From China to Europe and of course here in North America. That is perhaps the most important metric that I'll speak to you on this call. Because it is bestowed upon us by the consumers that we serve and it must be earned. NIKE Brand leadership with consumers is fueled by our authentic and relentless obsession with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. In fiscal year 2016, we brought that to life by executive our category offense like never before. And that drove strong double digit growth on a currency neutral basis. ","We execute our offense through three primary dimensions. Brand, product and marketplace. As Mark and Trevor noted, from a brand perspective we are more deeply connecting with and inspiring consumers leveraging the most iconic moment in sport. And from a product perspective our groundbreaking, innovative footwear and apparel is enabling the world's best athlete to perform at unprecedented levels and make history in those moments. We then bring those innovative products to our billions of consumers around the world. From the Lebron Solider 10 and the Kyrie 2 the LunarEpic in running to Cristiano Ronaldo's Mercurial SuperFly CR7 boot. At NIKE we always start with performance innovation. But what even more is how we are redefining sports culture and leading a global shift in how people express themselves at work and at play. We do that by bringing what Mark refer to a sport style innovation to NIKE's un-rival portfolio of iconic products such as the Air Force One, Cortez and Huarache as well as to the creation of new icons like the Roshe and Air Max Thea. And instant classic from performance like Kobe signature product and the Flyknit Racer. That is something that only NIKE can do on such a global scale as evidenced by 22% currency neutral growth in NIKE Sportswear our largest category. While brand and product fuel our growth, we captured that growth in the marketplace. Globally consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel is outpacing broader consumption. At the same time, the retail landscape is rapidly evolving. ","For other brands, the speed of change in retail maybe challenging and create uncertainty. But at NIKE we've always believed that the best way to predict the future is to create it. That's why as we shared at Investor Day last October, we've been leading a transformation of the marketplace not simply reacting to trends. Over the past year we made significant investments in nike.com and the results have been extraordinary. nike.com grew double to triple digits in all six of our geographies led by Greater China. As we made great progress toward our goal of $7 billion in revenue by 2020. We are also investing to more seamlessly integrate digital and physical retail. And working more strategically with our strongest wholesale partners to shape the future of retail.","Our brand, product and marketplace strategies underscore NIKE's relentless focus on creating extraordinary value for consumers. And that allows us to continue to delivering sustainable, profitable capital efficient growth and value creation for shareholders. In fiscal year 2016, we once again delivered strong top line growth. Growing revenue 12% on a currency neutral basis. We also expanded profitability, growing earnings per share by 17%, outpacing our mid-teens goal despite significant FX headwinds. And we delivered returns on invested capital of 29.7%, up 160 basis points versus the prior year. ","That powerful combination of growth, expanding profitability and strong return is what set NIKE apart in terms of their shareholder value creation. And while there were areas in which we did not execute as precisely as we had planned in fiscal 2016, those areas now represent opportunities to further elevate our game and deliver growth in fiscal year 2017. But before I share plans for fiscal year 2017, let's first reflect on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal year 2016 financial results in a bit more detail.","NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 6% , up 9% on a currency neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $32.4 billion, up 12% on a currency neutral basis. All of our international geographies grew double digit with North America growing at a high single digit rate in line with our long term targeted rate of growth for that geography. NIKE Brand futures orders reflect continued strong demand across our global portfolio growing 11% on a currency neutral basis driven by a 4% increase in units with increases in average selling price contributing seven percentage point of growth. On a reported basis, futures grew 8%, reflecting the impact of the stronger US dollar against nearly all international currencies and in particular developing market currencies. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was flat to prior year at $0.49. Full year diluted EPS grew 17% to $2.16 driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. ","Gross margin contracted 30 basis points in Q4 while expanding 20 basis points for the full year. For the quarter, margin contraction was driven primarily by inventory management in North America, higher labor costs and foreign exchange, which offset sustained increases in average selling price and the benefits of lower oil on materials cost. Four quarter demand creation increased 7%. For the full year, demand creation increased 2% as we strategically invested in digital consumer engagement and sports marketing while gaining efficiencies in traditional advertising. ","Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter and 8% for the full year. This reflected cost associated with our fast growing DTC business as well as strategic investments in consumer facing digital capabilities and operational infrastructure. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 was 18.7%, 350 basis points lower than last year's rate primarily due to a higher mix of non US earnings which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. As of May 31, inventories were up 12% including a 6% increase in NIKE Brand wholesaling unit reflecting continued strong global demand. ","Now let's turn to performance for a few of our largest operating segment. For the full year, North America revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was led by Sportswear, Jordan and Running. Growth also reflected continued momentum in our DTC business led by nike.com growing at 39%. For the quarter, North America revenue growth on a reported basis was flat to the prior year due in part to unfavorable comparison for the timing shipments across Q3 and Q4 in fiscal year 2015. Many of the orders planned for shipment in Q3 of fiscal year 2015 were delayed due to the West Coast port congestion and instead shipped in Q4. Excluding the impact of this timing shift, we estimate Q4 fiscal year 2016 North America revenue growth would have been in the mid single digit range. North America EBIT increased 3% for the full year as revenue growth and full price gross margin expansion were mostly offset by the lower off price margin associated with clearing excess inventory. ","As Trevor discussed, NIKE inventory in the full price in line channels in North America is now clean. And as reflected in our futures orders we are also keeping in line supply tight to ensure a strong pull market. Accordingly, we expect the North America revenue will return to growth in Q1 with growth accelerating over the balance of the fiscal year. North America's gross margin will contract in Q1 as we complete the clearance of excess inventory with a return to gross margin expansion over the course of fiscal year 2017. ","Looking to Western Europe where NIKE's portfolio of category is becoming increasingly un-rival from Global Football to Running to Sportswear to Women's Training as well as fast emerging categories such as Basketball and Jordan. In fiscal year 2016, every category delivered growth resulting in double digit growth in every territory. As a result, Western Europe revenue grew to nearly $6 billion, up 14% on a currency neutral basis. For the quarter, currency neutral revenue grew 19% led by Sportswear and Global Football as we approach the European Championships. On a reported basis, fiscal year 2016 revenue increased 3% reflecting FX headwinds while EBIT expanded 12% driven by SG&A leverage. ","In our emerging markets geography our brand momentum continuous to build. And we created healthy pull markets. On a currency neutral basis, fiscal year 2016 revenue increased 13% led by SoCo, Mexico and Pacific, fueled by double digit growth in Sportswear, Jordan and Women's Training. Revenue in Brazil declined due to the challenging macroeconomic environment, however, our brand is strong in Brazil, our inventories are healthy and we continue to take share. For Q4, currency neutral revenue is up 12% with double digit growth in SoCo Korea Pacific, Mexico and Africa. ","On a reported basis fiscal year 2016 revenue and EBIT were heavily impacted by the significant FX headwinds throughout the geography as a result fiscal year 2016 reported revenue decreased 5% while EBIT increased 9% reflecting gross margin expansion. ","Fiscal year 2016 was another exceptional year for NIKE in Greater China. With currency neutral revenue growing 27%. China continues to be one of the world's largest and fastest growing market in terms of consumption. And NIKE is unequivocally the leading brand in China as we continue to fuel the Chinese consumers' passion for sport. Our category assortments tailored for the Chinese consumer continue to drive growth and increasing productivity and profitability for both our DTC businesses led by nike.com and our wholesale partners. Nearly all categories grew in fiscal year 2016 led by Sportswear, Running, NIKE Basketball and Jordan. For the quarter, currency neutral revenue grew 23% with double digit growth in both footwear and apparel in both DTC and wholesale and across nearly all key categories. ","On a reported basis fiscal year 2016 revenue is up 23% and EBIT expanded 38%. In addition to tremendous revenue growth China delivered strong gross margin expansion and highly leveraged SG&A. In fiscal 2016, NIKE once again delivered another year of strong financial performance. While we are an increasingly dynamic macro environment particularly with respect to foreign currencies, our outlook for fiscal year 2017 is largely in line with a high level guidance that we shared last quarter. Specifically, for fiscal year 2017 we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single digit rate reflecting high single digit to low double digit growth on a currency neutral basis. Our rate of reported revenue growth will be more heavily impacted by FX headwinds in the first half of fiscal year 2017 primarily due to developing market currencies. For Q1, we expect mid single digit reported revenue growth, roughly three points below our reported rate of futures growth. ","We expect gross margin for the full year to expand by 30 to 50 basis points in line with our long-term financial model guard rails. This reflects higher average selling prices, ongoing manufacturing productivity initiatives and continued strong growth in our nike.com business, as well as a favorable impact of lower oil on materials cost. ","However, these benefits will be partially offset by continued labor cost inflation and FX headwinds. For Q1, we expect gross margin to decline approximately 100 basis points driven primarily by FX headwinds including year-over-year changes in our hedge rate. For total SG&A, we expect full year growth in the high single digit range in line with our reported fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance. For Q1, we expect mid to high teens SG&A growth significantly higher than the full year rate as we make strategic investments in demand creation around key sporting events such as the Olympics and European Football Championships. We expect other income to be approximately $20 million to $30 million on average for each quarter. ","For fiscal year 2017, we expect the effective tax rate will be between 19% and 21%. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2017, NIKE is the leading brand in every major market. We have the most talented team, we have strong momentum across our diverse, global portfolio of businesses and we are on the offense as always. ","And now we will open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question is from Kate McShane from Citigroup. ","Corrina Van Der Ghinst","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Corrina Van Der Ghinst on for Kate. I was wondering if we could start with some of the category breakdowns that you gave. It looks like the Basketball category was actually up on an ex-FX basis. Can you just walk us through some of the dynamics of Basketball and how you're looking at it in the year ahead?","Trevor Edwards ","Yes, absolutely. On Basketball I think overall we continue to feel great about the Basketball business particularly as its trend in going forward. What we have -- we certainly have is 2% increase in the fiscal year and what we see is energy for Basketball is really high, it is really an all time high and in Basketball we have a really great relationship with Basketball fans around the world. We have a great fit roster players and what we are seeing is just the sell is actually starting really pickup particularly in key zones, the Kyrie 2 did exceptionally well. The Kobe also did exceptionally well. And we are -- also our Jordan because it's a portfolio of performance and sportswear and also the Jordan business, that is also continue to help to drive our business. So we feel really good about the trajectory of the Basketball business. In particular when you think about what's happen in globally we are certainly seeing strong results around the world. Certainly China really delivers some incredible growth. Also coming out of the playoff, the Lebron 10, Lebron Solider 10 did exceptionally well, also did the Kyrie 2. So we are definitely feeling energized about the pipeline of products that we have come in through and we are certainly excited about way the players continue to playing and our ability to continue to drive connection with our consumers.","Corrina Van Der Ghinst","Great, thank you. And then just for a second question, with the environment maybe a little bit worse than when you gave your long-term guidance in October. Is there any change about in how you're thinking about the long-term growth?","Mark Parker","Actually no, there is not. We feel really good about where we are in general from a growth standpoint. We are obviously very focused on the actions that will get us to that goal and beyond for that matter. That's the basics of developing, keep a relationships with our consumers, obviously delivering the most innovative product and services and then further differentiating in an integrated marketplace. So these are things that I think ultimately are going to continue to drive profitable growth over the longer term. And we remain confident in those long-term projections that we laid out. ","Andy Campion ","Yes. I'll just add that obviously currency markets have become increasingly volatile over the past week. That said our expectations for fiscal year 2017 remain largely unchanged from a growth and profitability perspective. And that includes our best estimate based on the information that we have of late.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. ","Jim Duffy ","Thank you. Couple questions. First, the outlook implies a pick up in North American revenue across the US. Can you speak to the factors that give you confidence in that reacceleration?","Andy Campion ","Yes, obviously I can touch on that from a dimension perspective in terms of growth and Trevor can add some commentary on how he feels from brand and product and marketplace perspective. When you reflect on the fourth quarter for North America, I think it is important to note what I mentioned which is that the flat revenue growth was really more so a result of comparisons to prior year. We continue to see strong underlying momentum in the fundamentals that drive our growth and profitability. As you see in our futures orders, our futures orders are reflective of some of that. Dimensions, leading indicators in terms of consumer demand for the NIKE Brand such as nike.com grew 39% as I mentioned over the full year and actually north of 40% in Q4. So accelerated to some extent, so we continue to feel great about where we are going in terms of the transformation of that marketplace including through nike.com as well as through the relationship with our strategic wholesale partners and obviously how those dimensions capture growth relates back to the strong pipeline and product that Trevor and Mark touched on that we feel great about and are bringing to market currently. ","Trevor Edwards ","Yes. I'll just add that the brand remains incredibly strong in North America. From a full year revenue perspective it was up 8% and as Andy pointed out futures are up 6%. And was really led by some key categories of Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, Running and Global Football. They also really drove the business, going forward we continue to feel very strong about the marketplace, the consumer demand in the marketplace and the consumers' connection with the brand continues to be very strong. And we feel very confident about the pipeline of products that we have come in through. And as I touched on Basketball, that's a key area where we continue to see just great energy in North America. And we are looking forward to actually the products that are coming through and how they will sell through and connect with our consumers. ","Jim Duffy ","Thanks for that. And then on recent conference calls, some of your North American channel partners have made reference to imbalances in the price value equation. What are you seeing from average selling prices in the futures, and are you seeing any evidence that pricing may have taken a step too far?","Andy Campion ","Yes. As I touched on in our futures we are actually seeing seven percentage points of the growth coming from average gross selling price increase. Now that's obviously an aggregated number. Average gross selling price continues to expand, full price average gross selling price in a mid single digits in North America. We really view that as a factor of the innovation we are bringing and creating increasingly premium value for consumers. Running a more complete offense bringing premium value at every price point versus trading with end price points. And then frankly one of the things we've been very focused on as we've discussed is really that supply and demand management at the intersection of those as merchandizing with assortments that are increasingly selling through a whole price. ","Trevor Edwards ","Yes. I think as Andy really touched on our pricing strategy always centers on delivering the right price value equation to our consumers. And certainly the strength of the brand and the ability on some of the technologies that we bring allow us the opportunity to charge the premium price. And we are certainly seeing strong take up from that from our consumers. So if you look across the categories from sportswear to Basketball to running, we are certainly seeing the consumer have really strong appetite for those products. You can take the Kobe 11 is a great example of when you give the right value to that consumer, they are clearly willing to pay the price. So again we continue to monitor it very carefully and our pricing strategy always reflects our ability to adjust as we think appropriately. But certainly we feel that the pricing continues to be strong opportunity for the brand. ","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker","Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. Trevor, you've talked before about the importance of establishing healthy pull markets in periods where there's dislocations in inventory, and I know you've been working through the inventory dynamics in the US for a bit. Could you talk about when you expect the market to finally reach appropriate levels and for momentum to resume to where you think an underlying run rate is?","Trevor Edwards ","Yes. Certainly. As it relates to the inventory level, certainly at the end of Q4 inventory levels in the full price channel were pretty consistent to what we discussed at the last quarter. As we go into the next quarter we expect clearly to remain in excess inventory through our factory stores and also through select third party value channels. But overall the inline full price market is clean and we continue to just make sure we maintain and sustain a healthy pull market and also to bring into new products and make sure that we are actively, proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace. ","Andy Campion ","And Lindsay I'll just add that as we've discussed you have a couple of dimensions at the marketplace at a more macro level as Trevor talked about. The full price in line market and then the other dimensions where we do tend to address those inventory management efforts in NIKE factory stores and through third party value. The mix of that margin full price and half price obviously had a bit of an impact in Q4. And as I talked about will be part of the North America gross margin contraction in Q1. But as I noted, we expect gross margin to return to expansion in North America over the course of fiscal year 2017. So that's more of an answer to your question about how you see things normalizing. ","Lindsay Drucker ","Great. And then maybe just on Europe, where your organic revenue momentum is very strong. Could you talk about the drivers of margin behavior in that market? And just a quick follow up. For the LunarEpic, I noticed that you guys are trialing 30-day free and you can return dirt and all, which I'm excited to get involved in. And I was just wondering about maybe some of your marketing strategies on new products, if that's something we could see more broadly across the portfolio, or if it's really specific to this launch. Thanks.","Andy Campion ","Sure. I'll touch on Western Europe first. The fundamental underlying drivers of our margin are pretty consistent in Western Europe. Western Europe is seeing continued increases in average gross selling price. All of our geographies benefit from some of the efforts we are undertaking in our supply chain. So that would be our manufacturing initiatives which are beginning to have an impact. We saw an impact from those in fiscal year 2016 that increasingly material. Obviously, our long-term perspective is where we are most bullish but we have shifted from plant and pilot program to more proliferation of automation in our manufacturing in Asia as well as we've actually begun production on inline running product with Flex. So those initiatives and then coupled with impact such as lower oil on our input cost particularly materials. Those are the drivers of expansion in Western Europe. ","Trevor Edwards ","Yes. And as relates to the LunarEpic, obviously we are excited about the continued launch of the LunarEpic. One of the things about that product is that when you actually put it on, it is just remarkable in terms of its feel. So in terms of the marketing strategy to launch the product and wanted to make sure that they drove trial and got people who are actually putting on their feet. Also given that it was a high job, we wanted to make sure the consumer could really see how and experience that product. That's what we continue to do. One of the things at the marketplace right now is certainly a high service marketplace and so the opportunities to give consumers the ability to actually use the product were just a key driver. And so I think you expect us doing that more in the marketplace. ","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan ","Matthew Boss","Hey, thanks. So just to switch gears can you talk about trends you're seeing and just the runway remaining in China, specifically where you stand on the reset of the distribution points and just to think about the margin opportunity remaining over time? ","Trevor Edwards ","Yes. On China, China is really just a great example of -- we are certainly seeing really strong brand connection in that marketplace. And the work that we did few years back when we decided to really focus on the biggest growth opportunities and aligned the category offense against that. That's where we are seeing actually playback in the marketplace. In addition, we re-profiled the doors to make sure that we had the right assortments in the right doors delivering. That is actually now getting closer to scale. So we are seeing that continue to drive great results in the marketplace. And so overall the marketplace is very healthy and we still have a lot of room to grow despite the fact that we are certainly seeing these -- these certain tremendous growth numbers. We don't believe that they will sustain forever but we certainly do feel very confident about the growth that we are seeing in the marketplace today. ","Mark Parker","I'd like add to the -- apart from better managing the fundamentals of the business as we reset the marketplace in China and the brand strength that Trevor referenced, we also have an incredibly strong leadership team in China that is really well equipped to continue to sustain the kind of momentum that we built since the reset in China. So feel very confident with all those factors kind of coming together to create one of the strongest performances that we see in any geo around the world. ","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a quick follow-up, as it relates to Basketball, your commentary in matches or checks points to very strong demand for the recent KD launch. Can you just talk about changes that you've made to the product? What we should be watching and judging you on as it relates to signature Basketball, and just overall your confidence in the category going forward?","Mark Parker","Yes. Let me jump on that. First of all, I think we have -- we've always talked about complete offense. And that goes for any categories as well. Certainly including Basketball where we have two obviously leading brands in Basketball. We also have spectrum that goes from performance to sportswear or we call it amplified performance or sportswear business. And we see the shift happening up and down that spectrum from performance to lifestyle or sportswear all the time. It's not so much of shift from one end of the spectrum to the other but was the shift by style preferences across that spectrum. I think the good news for us is that we are really well equipped with a very diverse portfolio that goes from clean, classic, authentic styles like the Air Force One for example or the Jordan style. Then we have modern classics on top of that where we bring new innovation into some of that classic style. New modern performance shoes as well like the Lebron and KD, Kyrie, these are all very strong products for us particularly with what's coming in the pipeline, we feel with the recent launches of KD and the upcoming Kyrie and certainly the Lebron shoe that we really feel like we are striking that right balance between performance innovation and product that really works well for everyday lifestyle. So very confident in the portfolio of product across Basketball. ","Trevor Edwards ","And the one thing I'd just add is also that the Jordan Brand also is another dimension and it plays in a very similar way and we certainly seen very strong demand for the Jordan brand both in performance and also in lifestyle retro product. So, again we feel very energized about the products that are coming through Basketball. ","Mark Parker","Better equipped up and down the price points spectrum too as part of our complete offense. Feel very good about that Basketball.","Operator","The last question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to continue the conversation you were just having around performance versus sport fashion. Obviously, the Company has been great on the performance and innovation side, driven by the category offense, some incredible product over the last few years. But are you seeing a trend -- beyond basketball, but are you seeing a shift in consumer preference towards more of a sport fashion look or a sport fashion category, or is that more of an incremental kind of driver to the overall category growth? I know you talked a lot about also earlier in the call sportswear being a very strong category, so if you could elaborate on some of that stuff it would be great.","Mark Parker","Yes. What I just mentioned we see shift taking place month in month out, season in and season out along the lines of style preferences not so much moving to sportswear or performance per se. But just a type of styling that we are offering in performance and sportswear. So the selection isn't so much moving from one massive shift to another but it's more style specific. And we are seeing really the diversity of style across the spectrum from performance to sportswear with products that are highly priced in some cases that are doing incredibly well both in performance and in lifestyle. But we are seeing that up and down the price point spectrum. We are also bringing like I mentioned one of the things that differentiate NIKE I think from others is the amount of innovation that we are bringing into sport style. I think that's what differentiates NIKE in the end. We have an authentic product that is innovative across performance and sport style. We are not just creating a style just for fashion sake; we are bringing real performance, authentic innovation into those styles as well. So I think that ultimately differentiates NIKE from others out in the market. ","Trevor Edwards ","And one thing I'd just add which is while consumer preferences can sometime shift around; we think we have the brand as best positioned actually to serve the consumer across the spectrum from performance to sportswear. That's why we always talk about the portfolio of the NIKE Brand; this is really that when it comes into action. So right now we are just seeing our ability to leverage that portfolio to connect with our consumers with the right products with the right style at the right prices. ","Mark Parker","Sometimes the innovation is more overt and expressive and on the other hand simpler and more restrained. And we are seeing that consumer choice up and down that spectrum. The point really is that NIKE is I think ultimately better positioned with compelling choices across that spectrum. ","Omar Saad","And if I may, can I ask when can we start seeing some of these sport style innovations that you have coming in the footwear side or the apparel side? Is it out there in the marketplace now? Are there examples you'd point to? We would be interested that too.","Trevor Edwards ","Yes. Actually we mean a lot of products are actually out in the marketplace right now. So take for example the Air Force One Flyknit, that's a great example of, a combination of new innovation grow to classic style. At the same time we are bringing items like the stock dart back into the marketplace, there are Roshe, the Prestos and then on the performance side you certainly have -- we have tech fleet and apparel or the tech NIKE in apparel is also great examples. All of these products are in the market today. And they certainly combined that ability to have both great style and performance having at the same time. ","Mark Parker","And you will continue to see this flow of product continue through this next fiscal year of course. ","Kelley Hall","All right. Thank you, everyone for joining us on the call today. And we will look forward to speaking with you again after Q1. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15569":["Nike, Inc.

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kelley and hello everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter for Nike. Even in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions, we delivered robust growth and we did so in a well-balanced way across our entire portfolio. By the numbers here are the highlights.","Nike, Inc. revenues grew 13% to $7 billion. Gross margins increased 30 basis points to 44.5%. SG&A rose 16% reflecting strategic investments in our brands and our operations. And despite currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.76. We delivered these results because of the breadth and depth of the Nike, Inc. portfolio. For a company that does business in more than 190 countries, volatility is a fact of life. Although Nike, Inc.\u2019s global reach increases the complexity of our business, it also presents us with the opportunities to leverage strength in certain areas while we continue to invest in others. Because our portfolio includes a diverse set of categories, geographies, products, brands and distribution channels, we are best positioned to manage through an ever-changing macro environment.","Our deep connection with the consumers ensures we focused our innovation on products and services that consumers expect and also on those that they never thought possible and our commitment to operational excellence and our supply chain and our financial management and then our resource allocation ensures we remain laser-focused on driving profitable sustainable growth. While we are not immune to the macroeconomic environment, we certainly have a management team that knows the terrain and can effectively drive growth in various conditions. And that is why I am so confident in Nike\u2019s ability to create shareholder value.","While the Nike portfolio is diverse, there is a common theme. It\u2019s powered by innovation. We don\u2019t innovate just for the sake of change. We do it with a clear purpose and that\u2019s to help athletes reach their full potential. The breakthrough performance products we develop with insights from the world\u2019s best athletes become the must-have performance in sportswear products for consumers. And global sports\u2019 moments continue to present the perfect opportunity for us to showcase our innovation. When the world\u2019s greatest athletes compete on a global stage, we are inspired to create some of our most exciting and game changing products and we can connect our brands to consumers when the world is watching.","I want to highlight three examples from Q3. First, for the Super Bowl New York, we launched an array of innovative footwear and apparel for the NFL\u2019s biggest moment. In footwear, we debut the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat designed for speed and quick cuts. As part of our long-term commitment to take advantage of the most advanced manufacturing processes, we have leveraged Nike\u2019s state-of-the-art 3D printing capabilities to inspire this revolutionary new cleat, which we put on the field in record time for football\u2019s ultimate game. As we do with all of our innovations, we plan to expand the transformative benefits of 3D printing across multiple areas of our business.","In apparel, we launched the Silver Speed collection of on-field, sideline, training and sportswear products, including the Aeroloft Summit Jacket, which is constructed to be lightweight and breathable. Warned by players on the sidelines, the Jacket made a great statement of brand innovation in a game that was seen by over 110 million viewers. And for the fans, we updated the Nike NFL Limited jersey combining on-field innovation with premium style to give consumers an authentic way to express their love of the game.","Next, the Winter Olympics, which featured incredible displays of athleticism and accomplishment. Nike was on the ice as both Canadian men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey teams took gold wearing our lightweight game jersey. The jersey leveraged innovations from across our categories, including Nike Flywire, a technology originally developed for basketball footwear. The Olympic hockey jersey provides another example of how we take innovations develop for one category and show them not only across categories, but also across product types.","The U.S. team medal stand apparel featured our Aeroloft 800 Summit Jacket. So, it was a privilege to be there when U.S. athletes like snowboarder, Sage Kotsenburg who won gold in slopestyle, celebrated their greatest achievements in front of a global audience. In the Olympic village and at the many sport venues, the Nike athletes also wore our Tech Fleece with its technical performance elements to provide lightweight warmth. Both Tech Fleece and the Aeroloft Summit Jacket have quickly become go-to-apparel items for consumers.","And then of course in the run up to World Cup, you have seen us launch an impressive collection of cutting-edge football products, the Hypervenom boot with the NIKESKIN mesh upper that provides an amazing level of ball feel. The Hi-Vis boot designed to help footballers see teammates quickly and make critical plays. 10 new national team kids featuring Nike Dri-FIT technology for better cooling and our lightest Nike Pro base layer ever. And the Tiempo Legend V with Nike Hypershield technology to give this leather boot incredible all -weather performance.","And just two weeks ago, Trevor and I were in Barcelona to introduce the new standard in performance football boots, the Magista. With the radical new silhouette, the boot is designed to enhance player fit, touch, and traction for a game that has become faster and more intense. The Magista was a result of four years of work in our sports research lab incorporating insights from the world\u2019s best football athletes, including Barcelona\u2019s Andres Iniesta and Paris\u2019 Saint-Germain\u2019s Thiago Silva. This is the first football boot to utilize Nike Flyknit technology, something many thought impossible. We didn\u2019t set out to invent a Flyknit football boots, but we listen to our athletes and harnessed Flyknit\u2019s power to re-imagine what a football boots could be. We have used Flyknit to revolutionize running and basketball and now we\u2019ve done the same with football which is exactly what you\u2019d expect from Nike.","When it comes to innovation we pride ourselves on being the pacesetter, we get out in front and we stay on the offense. The World Cup is now just a few months away and you can expect even more excitement leading up to the opening match in Sao Paulo. Products we\u2019ve launched so far take the game of football to a new level and before the first whistle in Brazil we will have more amazing products to come. Football is the biggest sport in the world and Nike is the leader in innovation for athletes. That\u2019s a combination that drives us to deliver bolder innovation for the World Cup than we\u2019ve ever done before, so stay-tuned.","So these are just a few of the innovations that represent who we are as a company. And they demonstrate our commitment to athletes and how we drive growth across our portfolio of businesses. And because we are Nike we just don\u2019t innovate for the present, we innovate for the future. The steps we\u2019re taking with digital, Flyknit and 3D printing technologies and with new materials and methods of manufacturing are driving us to improve performance and achieve new levels of sustainability.","When I consider these steps it\u2019s clear to me that Nike has more capacity to innovate in more dramatic ways than ever before. The opportunities are truly unlimited but our resources are not. As a result we\u2019re relentless editors because innovation isn\u2019t about just doing more, it\u2019s about doing things better, it\u2019s about staying sharply focused on the opportunities that have the highest potential for growth and that\u2019s how we unlock our true potential.","There is never an off-season for Nike. We will continue to leverage the power of our portfolio and the power of innovation to connect with our consumers and create long-term shareholder value. So thanks everyone. And now here is Trevor to discuss the Nike Brand.","Trevor Edwards - President, Nike Brands","Thank you, Mark. The Nike Brand delivered another strong quarter as our innovative products compelling consumer connections and effective marketplace management continue to drive growth. On a constant currency basis Nike Brand global revenue increased 14% with growth across all geographies and key categories including double-digit growth in our largest categories of sportswear, running and basketball.","Nike Brand DTC grew 23% driven by 10% comp store growth and an impressive 57% growth in online sales as our digital investments and sharper merchandising increased traffic, conversion and average order on Nike.com. And finally global futures grew a robust 14%. These strong results are driven as always by our relentless focus on the consumer. Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting-edge products, engaging consumer experiences and powerful retail presentations.","Nike\u2019s ability to deliver on all three strengthens our position as the brand of choice with consumers and builds our business around the world. To see these dynamics in action let\u2019s first take a look at running. Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. But as we like to say at Nike there is no finish line and that is certainly true of the running business which continue to deliver strong results with revenue growing at a double-digit rate in Q3.","That growth is fueled by our steadfast focused on bringing innovation to the market. In running footwear we expanded our breakthrough Flyknit platform. The new Flyknit Air Max combines Flyknit with an improved Max Air to create lightweight well conditioned, a well cushioned running shoe. Also resonating with consumers it\u2019s the resilient ultra-light Flyknit Lunar2 with its supportive Lunarlon cushioning. And in running apparel which is fueling growth in the category, we continue to gain share with our new Dri-FIT Knit products. The running shirts with their softer, high stretch knit are best sellers in the market.","We also drive growth by targeting our resources against the biggest opportunities. A great example of this is women\u2019s running, an important pillar of our women\u2019s amplified strategy. That strategy is working and our women\u2019s business grew faster than our men\u2019s business again in quarter three. A key element of this strategy is the Nike Training Club. This concept within Nike stores offers cross merchandise collections from women\u2019s running, training and sportswear, and a high level of service dedicated to helping our consumer achieve our goals. We continue to see strong consumer response to this retail concept and expect to have nearly 50 locations globally by the end of fiscal year \u201814. These retail successes combined with strong wholesale partnerships like the Nike Track Club at Finish Line are growing the running market not just our share.","The other performance category I would like to discuss is basketball. Both the Nike and Jordan\u2019s brands continue to deliver the very best in basketball with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our basketball category. And as the game becomes increasingly global, this growth story is just getting started. Our continued success in basketball is the result of creating the game\u2019s most cutting-edge products. Our lightweight and breathable Hyper Elite uniforms provide Nike college teams a new level of performance just in time for March Madness.","In footwear, the power of our innovation engine is on full display with the LeBron 11, the KD 6 and the Kobe 9 Elite, which since its launch has sold out at nearly every location as soon as it arrives. And our new Hyper Elite Fanatical sock have become a popular performance item, which speaks to the opportunity Nike has in expanding the market by creating new segments. These products come to life in retail experiences that expresses deep love of the game serving those who share that passion. All over the globe, Nike is driving and growing the basketball market from our own DTC stores to Foot Lockers\u2019 House of Hoops. Likewise, the Jordan brand leads by combining innovation with unique sense of style that speaks to the legacy of Michael Jordan.","Quarter three included important Jordan milestones, the largest one day product launch in the brand\u2019s history with the release of the latest Air Jordan 11 and the debut of the exciting new retail concept in partnership with Footaction, we opened the first ever Jordan-only store in New York City called Flight 23. Jordan athletes, Earl Thomas and Carmelo Anthony visited the store at the opening and gave it rave reviews. Consumers agree with the initial results exceeding expectations.","The final category I want to touch on is sportswear. We often talk about our three-pronged Amplify strategy of compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the expressed portion of that equation. It is a key element of the product assortment for our performance categories and offers consumers\u2019 premium, sports-inspired products to express their love of the game. With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and technical innovation in traditional sportswear styles resulted in the category delivering double-digit growth in Q3.","Let me now turn to a few of our geographies. First, the emerging markets, this diverse portfolio offers significant growth opportunity today and well into the future. For the quarter, revenue was up 19% and futures were up 24%. So let\u2019s start with a quick update on Mexico. We continue to work with our third-party logistic provider to resolve the distribution challenges I discussed last quarter. While we still have work to do, we shipped demand in Q3. Over the next couple quarters, we will continue to refine our processes and work to clear any excess inventory. Meanwhile, consumer demand for our product in Mexico remains strong and we are working closely with our wholesale partners to properly manage the flow of product into the marketplace.","Now, across the rest of the emerging markets, we saw 7 of our 9 territories reporting double-digit revenue growth. As Mark described, this summer the entire world will see the full power of the brand with game-changing products, compelling retail presentations and inspiring campaigns as we lead up to the World Cup in Brazil. By amplifying the power of sports, we grow our business in the emerging markets and all around the world. In North America, our category offense continues to drive growth across every category with Q3 revenues up 12%.","The Nike Brand continues to be incredibly strong in North America as demonstrated by our 9% futures growth. And last month the Super Bowl provided an incredible energy point for the brand. As Mark mentioned we drove excitement in the marketplace with innovative products and elevated retail experiences, which included both DTC locations and our wholesale partners such as Field House at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and also the Yardline at Champs.","As I\u2019ve said before Nike is in the business of making big moments bigger which is exactly what we did and we couldn\u2019t be happier with the results. In Greater China revenue grew 7%. Our strategy to reset the marketplace for profitable long-term growth is working and we\u2019re creating more productive retail with focused product assortments that strengthened our position as the number one performance sport brand.","Our results for Q3 reflect progress against that strategy. We work with our wholesale partners to better balance supply and demand and we\u2019ve made changes to the supply chain that are improving inventory levels in the marketplace. In DTC where we tested and deployed new merchandising concepts results remain strong, revenue up 27% with comp growth of 11% and expanding margins. And our wholesale partners are seeing positive results in their re-profiled doors which continue to outpace the rest of the fleet.","We still have work to do in China, in our China Reset but we feel great about our progress. These efforts are improving our business today and importantly they set a strong foundation for our long-term profitable growth in China and we continue to see tremendous growth opportunity in this key geography.","Lastly let me turn to the Western Europe where revenue accelerated to 19% and futures were up 30% with reported EBIT up 54%. Growth was broad-based from both a category and a territory perspective, revenues in the UK and AGS which is comprised of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland were up double-digits for the second quarter in a row. From a category perspective we saw double-digit growth across our largest performance categories, running, football, basketball and women\u2019s training.","Notably sportswear also grew double-digits which amplifies our performance positioning. Our DTC operations which continue to strengthen Nike\u2019s brand positioning and drive growth were up 29% driven by 14% comp store growth and a strong growth online. And lastly EBIT results were also driven by expanding gross margins reflecting a clean marketplace and a strong sell-through of new styles.","This success in Western Europe is no surprise. By restructuring our business two years ago we now work closer with our wholesale partners to better segment and differentiate the market. Our work to transform the marketplace with our own DTC locations and key retail partners such as JD Sports and Foot Locker has improved the experience for our consumers. All told we\u2019ve strengthened our brand and expanded the potential of our business and we\u2019re just getting started.","Looking forward I\u2019m confident in what Nike Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we\u2019re making with them. I like where we\u2019re and better yet I like where we\u2019re headed. Thanks, Don.","Don Blair - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Trevor. As Mark and Trevor both discussed our Q3 and year-to-date growth was strong and well balanced driven by expansion across nearly every dimension of our global portfolio. These results were particularly noteworthy given this stiff currency headwinds we faced and our significant investments in future growth. It\u2019s the strength and diversity of our portfolio expanding multiple brands, categories, geographies, products and channels, which enables us to consistently deliver growth and manage risk. As always, our growth is to deliver profitable growth in the near term while continuing to make the investments that will sustain that growth into the future. Striking this balance puts us in a best position to continue to create shareholder value over the long-term despite the volatility that\u2019s an inherent aspect of a global business.","With that introduction I\u2019ll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for Nike, Inc. increased 13%. On a currency neutral basis both Nike, Inc. and Nike Brand revenues increased 14%. This was above our expectations as strong demand particularly in North America pulled some Q4 futures orders into Q3. Converse revenues increased 16% on a constant currency basis. Also on a currency neutral basis, Nike brand futures orders increased 14% driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by extraordinary growth in the emerging markets and Western Europe as well as double-digit growth in the football, basketball and women\u2019s training categories.","On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, reflecting weaker developing market currencies. Third quarter diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.76 driven by revenue growth in gross margin expansion partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A investments and headwinds from weaker developing market currencies. We estimate changes in currency exchange rates reduced our EPS growth by 6 percentage points for the third quarter and 9 percentage points year-to-date. We expect FX headwinds will continue to reduce our EPS growth rate for Q4 and into fiscal 2015.","Gross margin for the third quarter increased 30 basis points driven by higher average prices and continued strength of our DTC business partially offset by product cost inflation and FX headwinds. Third quarter SG&A spending rose 16%, reflecting 18% growth in demand creation driven by support for the launch of new products, the ramp up to the World Cup and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. The level of spending was slightly lower than we projected last quarter as we shifted some investments for World Cup initiatives to Q4.","Operating overhead grew 15% reflecting investments in infrastructure, supply chain capabilities, DTC and digital. As Trevor mentioned, we are seeing significant acceleration in nike.com growth as a result of the investments we have made earlier and we plan to continue to fund these initiatives to realize our significant global potential in digital commerce. Other expense net was $45 million for the quarter driven largely by FX conversion losses in developing markets, most notably Argentina.","The third quarter effective tax rate was 22.4%, a 40 basis point improvement versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the comparison to a prior year benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D credit.","Our balance sheet continues to be in great shape and our cash conversion cycle continues to improve. As of the end of Q3, accounts receivable grew just 4% versus last year, well below the rate of revenue growth. Inventories were up 12% in line with the growth in futures. As a result, our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 24.2%, a 120 basis point above last year and well within our mid-20s target range.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at our Q3 performance by segment. In North America, revenue increased 12% on both the reported and constant currency basis driven by double-digit growth across nearly all key categories led by basketball, sportswear, men\u2019s and women\u2019s training and global football. DTC revenue grew 19% in the quarter driven by 8% comp sales growth in stores and significantly higher sales for nike.com. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 11% due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher demand creation spending to support new product launches.","In Western Europe, revenue grew 19% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting strength across our portfolio of businesses. Revenue grew double-digits for every key category, except Action Sports and every territory, except Italy. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 22% and EBIT increased 54% driven by revenue growth, significant gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","Revenue for Central and Eastern Europe grew 22% on a currency neutral basis, as every territory except Israel reported higher revenues. In Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece, revenues grew at a double-digit pace. Revenue was also higher in every key category. On a reported basis, revenue grew 17% while EBIT increased 23% as revenue growth in gross margin expansion more than offset higher demand creation spending related to the Winter Olympics.","In Greater China, we continue to see encouraging signs as our market reset actions take hold. In Q3, currency neutral revenue grew 7%, but by expansion in sportswear, basketball and running. On a reported basis, Greater China revenue grew 9% and EBIT increased 7% as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher SG&A spending reflecting investments in our new China headquarters facility and DTC operations.","One of our key objectives in resetting the China market is to increase the productivity and profitability of our retail spaces. As Trevor mentioned, comp sales for our DTC stores grew 11% in Q3 and equally important margins expanded significantly. Comp store sales for partner-operated Nike stores that we have reset with more focused assortments also continue to grow at a double-digit pace well above the fleet average. We are very encouraged by the Q3 results in China. That said, not all of our financial metrics in China will improve in a linear fashion as we optimize the flow of product into the market. As a result of planned changes in our seasonal product flow, futures are down 3% on a currency neutral basis and we anticipate Q4 revenue will be flat to slightly down.","Our business in Japan continued to generate positive momentum with 10% currency neutral revenue growth driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Japan revenue declined 9% and EBIT fell 13%, reflecting the impact of the weaker yen as well as increased SG&A behind the launch of nike.com in Japan. In our emerging markets geography, currency neutral revenues grew 19%, reflecting broad-based growth across virtually every business unit.","Revenues for nearly every category increased double-digits led by running, football and sportswear. And almost every territory and new geography also reported double-digit revenue growth led by Brazil, Mexico and our SOCO territory, which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. On a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets grew 8% and EBIT increased 6%, reflecting the significant adverse impact of currency devaluations, as well as higher SG&A spending on infrastructure and DTC.","For the Converse brand, Q3 revenue grew 16% on both a reported and currency neutral basis driven by continued strength in direct distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the UK. The Chuck Taylor franchise continues to deliver sustained profitable growth and we are making progress extending the Converse brand in footwear and apparel. We are also developing the marketplace for the Converse brand by enhancing presentation in wholesale accounts, expanding DTC and transitioning new countries to direct distribution. So far this year, we have converted Scandinavia and Taiwan to direct distribution and we are preparing for additional conversions in FY \u201815 laying the foundation for continued strong growth. On a reported basis, EBIT increased 10% as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by increased SG&A investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC.","The Nike, Inc. portfolio has delivered strong performance year-to-date and we expect to see continued momentum in our business as we finished the fiscal year. However, as I mentioned earlier, FX headwinds have been a significant drag on EPS growth so far this year and we expect to face ongoing pressure in Q4 and into next year. Our guidance for Q4 and FY \u201815 incorporates the expected impact of these headwinds.","We now expect Q4 revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate. This is below the rate of futures growth largely due to the timing of shipments at the beginning and end of Q4 as well as lower levels of at-once and closeout sales. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth at the top end of our high single-digit target range. We now expect gross margin for Q4 to expand by 50 to 75 basis points somewhat better than our prior expectations due to a shift in mix to higher margin products and geographies as well as ongoing strength in our higher margin DTC business. For the full year, we expect gross margin expansion of about 90 basis points.","For Q4, we now expect SG&A to grow at a high-teens rate. As I stated previously, we re-phased a portion of our demand creation from Q3 to Q4 strengthening our World Cup marketing initiatives. Given that shift and a relatively lower level of spend in the fourth quarter of FY \u201813, we expect Q4 demand creation growth of over 30%. We expect Q4 operating overhead to grow at a low double-digit rate reflecting ongoing investments and strategic initiatives, such as digital and DTC. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low-teens rate.","For FY \u201814, we now expect the effective tax rate will be around 24%. We haven\u2019t yet completed our planning for FY \u201815, but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency neutral revenue growth for FY \u201815 at or slightly above our high single-digit target range. That said, this year\u2019s devaluation of developing market currencies will be a significant drag on next year\u2019s reported revenue, gross margin and profit growth. In addition, we remain committed to investing in the strategies that are driving our growth. As a result, we expect FY \u201815 EPS growth will be somewhat below our mid-teens target range.","As Mark said at the top the call, we feel great about the strong results we have delivered through the first three quarters of this fiscal year. As we look ahead to Q4 and FY \u201815, we will continue to make strategic investments to drive sustainable long-term growth while capitalizing on those investments we have already made to deliver consistent profitability and cash returns to our shareholders.","We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Kate McShane - Citigroup","Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question is on China, one of your biggest distributors had reported that, they are regaining a reasonable profit margin by lowering the cost of purchases and there is new consideration for their performance on new metrics. And I wondered if you could help me understand how this may impact Nike\u2019s profit margins in China if at all?","Don Blair","Well, first of all, we have seen as I said earlier some improving performance in our retail stores and also our wholesale partners are doing better. And I think when we get more productive and profitable in those retail spaces that raises profitability for everybody. So our objective here is to make sure that the marketplace is as compelling for the consumers as possible and that we are generating productivity and profitability at the retail space and we are confident that when we do that both we and our retailers will be making more money.","Kate McShane - Citigroup","Okay, thank you. And then my second question is on basketball, if you could walk us through how you are thinking about managing the launch product as the basketball category grows globally and why you think there seems to be more of an acceptance of basketball in Europe now versus other periods of time?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, it\u2019s great question. Basketball clearly is continuing to become much more of global sport. I think the fact that more people have a chance to see the sport all around the world obviously watch the NBA with the great players that we have from Kobe, LeBron, KD, I think people are having the chance to really experience how those players are just keeping the excitement in the marketplace. In terms of how we continue to manage the launch, we manage everything pretty much from a global perspective we will sometimes put in very specific products in some local markets like in China, which we will launch in specials in China. But across the board we tend to run the \u2013 our offense globally. In terms of in the future we continue to feel that the consumers are becoming increasingly excited about the sport and we look at basketball as a tremendous growth opportunity and all the work that we\u2019re doing with Foot Locker, the House of Hoops, the work that we\u2019re doing in our DTC stores are really helping to solidify the marketplace.","Mark Parker","I would also add that the technology and the style that we\u2019re bringing to basketball both in Nike and Jordan are really resonating with consumers around the world. So we\u2019re just seeing an uptake in popularity in the category for all the reasons that Trevor mentioned, but also I think from a design and innovation standpoint.","Kate McShane - Citigroup","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is open.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks. Great quarter guys.","Trevor Edwards","Thanks, Omar.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Hey, I\u2019d love to hear an update on two of the topics you guys talked about at the Investor Day last year, price and premiumization. Price how are you sing kind of price strategically relative to the cost inflation, I remember you talked about some new systems and processes to think about how to optimize pricing. And then on the premiumization question, could you elaborate or if you\u2019re willing to give some numbers around how the mix is shifting to more premium products? It seems the consumers increasingly willing to pay more for better products and what does that mean for your lower end offerings? Thanks guys.","Trevor Edwards","Yes. On the pricing strategy I think we talked about this once before where we continue to say that our pricing strategy really centers on ensuring that we have the right price value relationship with the consumer. One of the things that our focus on innovation really does is it gives us great credence as we bring more products into the marketplace and have new innovations. You also have the strength of our brand which allows us to command a premium price and so we continue to drive the business from that perspective.","The third zone that we continue to do is we continue to really look at pricing within the context of a particular marketplace and make sure that we\u2019re managing based on the market dynamics. What we\u2019re seeing is an increase in move towards premium products, a lot of our consumers are seeing our premium lines and they\u2019ve been very excited about them. So certainly what we\u2019ve seen in the sportswear Tech Pack in our sportswear lines, what we\u2019ve seen in our performance lines is the same thing. So we\u2019ve really seen limited resistance towards continue to bring premium into the marketplace but it\u2019s really based on given that consumer clear value.","Mark Parker","I think there is also an opportunity to actually take that premium product in that position and that style and that innovation down in the product line as well to create that we like to call are complete offense. So we\u2019re setting the tone I think at the top. We\u2019re not seeing any resistance at all from consumers, I think the product is really resonating and I think we can continue to do a better job of actually leveraging some of that style and innovation down throughout the whole product line.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Hi, good afternoon guys.","Kelley Hall","Hey Bob.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Just the first question that I have is for Don. On the foreign exchange losses how should we model that sort of in Q4 and in FY \u201815 knowing what you know today from your hedge position?","Don Blair","Well, first of all, one thing to bear in mind is there is three things that drive the FX impact on the company, one of them is gross margin. As you know we sell product in many currencies around the world. We buy product in a variety of currencies now probably about two-thirds U.S. dollar, about a third other currencies at this point, but that\u2019s one area of FX exposure. And we did have headwinds in Q3, we actually think the headwinds in Q4 a little stronger, but at this stage we\u2019ve been doing a really good job I think of putting as Trevor said earlier premium products in the marketplace taking price on a surgical basis. So we think we can continue to expand margin but the headwinds are actually getting a little stronger in Q4.","The second impact is on translation of profitability. And at this stage we\u2019re even if we stay where we\u2019re today on exchange rates we\u2019re going to have a built-in devaluation versus where we were for the fourth quarter last year. So there will be ongoing pressure for translation and that will continue until we anniversary the major devaluation. So for most of FY \u201915 we\u2019ll see that headwind as well. And then the third piece has to do with translation of balance sheet items in various countries around the world. And certainly the Argentine peso and the ruble were fairly significant drags from that this year.","I think that as long as the currency stays roughly where they are that one should over time ease off but at this stage it\u2019s hard to tell. But I guess what I would step back from the whole question of currency and go back to one of Mark\u2019s comments which is when you operate in 190 countries this sort of volatility is something that goes with the territory. We have a large number of levers in our business to manage that helps us offset the pieces of the equation we can\u2019t manage. And I think our track record of delivering consistent growth even in periods of time where we\u2019ve got macroeconomic headwinds tells you that we can continue to do that.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Great, thank you. And then my second question is on the basketball category, how many teams does Nike have this year in March Madness versus last year and who do you guys project to be the winner?","Trevor Edwards","I\u2019ll take the last part of that question, first. Your guess is as good as mine. No, no, I say that in a respect way, I think we have around 49 teams out of the 68 teams. So we\u2019re obviously \u2013 that continues to shift as the tournament goes on. But clearly the great thing about March Madness in those movements is that they provide an incredible platform to create excitement in the marketplace and drive demand. So to the earlier question actually those are some of the things that I think that continue to create excitement and allow us to continue to leverage our opportunity. And we\u2019re seeing those things continue to go global. So yes we\u2019ll \u2013 I hate to try and bet on exactly who wins, but as I would say the more hope the more business so we\u2019ll take it from that perspective.","Don Blair","And I think Warren Buffett\u2019s billion dollars are probably safe. I don\u2019t know if anybody is going to get the brackets exactly right.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Already lost. Thanks very much guys.","Kelley Hall","Thanks Bob.","Operator","The next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Great quarter guys.","Kelley Hall","Thanks, Robby.","Don Blair","Thank you.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I think a question maybe this is for Trevor. I was hoping you could maybe talk about Nike\u2019s youth business, you call out women\u2019s on the call, but maybe how the youth business is doing particularly in apparel relative to women\u2019s and maybe men\u2019s and maybe particularly in North America? And then my second smaller question was I apologize if I missed it, but I know that you mentioned Russia did well but is there any change to the outlook for Russia and maybe Don remind us percent of sales Russia is for Nike? Thanks.","Trevor Edwards","Yes. First on \u2013 just on young athletes, our young athletes business actually is doing incredibly well. We\u2019re just seeing an increase of consumers and certainly working with our retail partners, have just clear access to young athlete\u2019s products. Part of that strategy also comes very much in line with what we\u2019re seeing around our basketball category and our performance categories, where the consumers are so they find similar products. So we\u2019re seeing an incredible growth really coming from the same sort of statement items that we\u2019ve created in the adult category. So our ability to leverage those great items makes the difference. Also in the United States we\u2019re also working specifically around with the Kids Foot Locker around the Nike Fly Zone where we\u2019re able to bring new concepts into the marketplace that gives the consumers more access.","And then the third zone would be dotcom business we\u2019re seeing a continued growth of consumers coming to dotcom and looking for young athlete products. So all-in-all it\u2019s been a very strong quarter but going forward we\u2019re very bullish about the young athletes business because it just continues to grow not only in North America but really around the world.","Don Blair","And with respect to Russia, Robby, I mean right now we have not yet seen any impact to our business. Obviously we\u2019re hoping that, that solution, that a resolution comes to that situation peacefully and right now we\u2019re focused on the things we can control which is making sure we connect with our consumers and make sure we provide them with innovative products. I think in terms of that business for us it\u2019s less than 25% of our CEE business. So at this stage we think that whatever happens there we\u2019ll obviously be able to manage it across our portfolio.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks and congrats again on the quarter.","Don Blair","Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. I just had a couple of quick ones. Number one just to clarify your guidance? Number one, can you tell us whether your operating margin, your gross margin contemplates sorry your earnings guidance contemplates gross margin expansion and Don thanks for the clarification on EPS impacts from currency. How much of that is embedded into the FY \u201815 preliminary review?","Don Blair","I\u2019m sorry so the first question was I\u2019m sorry can you repeat the question\u2026","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Is you guidance for next year contemplate gross margin improvements and how much is \u2013 what is the EPS drag for ForEx?","Don Blair","Okay. So with respect to broad outline we\u2019re really at this stage at the preliminary stages. We would expect to see over time expansion of gross margin, how much of it, obviously depends upon a lot of variables many of which are not sales yet including FX. So at this stage I\u2019m not ready to tell you a number of points that I think FX would be, what I can tell you is that when we look at the devaluation we saw in FY \u201814 and the fact that you have to anniversary that in FY \u201815 it will be a drag. The question of how much is going to depend upon where the numbers actually fall out by geography, by territory and where the currency exchange rates go.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Then maybe this is a follow-up on the gross margin side. Is there anything specific on your supply chain initiatives, manufacturing revolution that you can call out as a meaningful driver to your P&L for next year? Thanks.","Don Blair","Yes. I wouldn\u2019t want to get into that level of granularity just yet. What I would say is just to go back to the conversations we had at the Analyst Day and what we talked about in our last few calls we do believe that this is manufacturing revolution is going to be both impactful from a consumer standpoint in terms of the products and innovations we deliver to the market and how responsive we are as well as the cost. At this point I\u2019m not ready to talk about an impact for FY \u201815.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Don Blair","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Thank you. Hello everyone.","Trevor Edwards","Hi, Jim.","Kelley Hall","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Clearly it\u2019s been a terrific great execution across the global business and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s frustrating to not to see the full impact of that flow-through to reported earnings.","Don Blair","Yes.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Couple of questions. The currency volatility in recent devaluation of some of these currencies how does that change strategy for capital allocation at all?","Don Blair","Well I think it depends on your outlook for what you think the economy is going. I mean certainly as we talked about earlier we manage these individual businesses, we\u2019re looking at the consumer value equation. So we\u2019re focused on the inflation in a particular market. We obviously are looking at our deployments of demand creation and so on. But in general terms if we believe that the market over the long-haul is going to be healthy and in most of these markets we believe well and we\u2019re going to see expansion of the middle class. We\u2019re going to be continuing to build our business and connect with consumers and deliver innovative product.","Certainly from a financial management standpoint we\u2019re going to try to minimize the amount of cash relieved in those markets, we\u2019re going to minimize the level of receivables and so on. So financial management absolutely is driven by where we see the currency is going. From a business standpoint sometimes these difficult times in emerging markets there are opportunities for us to gain ground. I mean the last time Argentina went through a financial issue number of years ago we actually remained committed to that market, we built our business and we took a lot of market share.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Great. Makes sense. Second question there\u2019s been a lot of discussion in the investment community around how World Cup orders benefit the futures. Clearly you\u2019ve sponsored some of the important European and Latin American teams. Is it possible to put some shape around the impact of World Cup orders to the futures and how much of the growth that we\u2019re seeing today is from sponsorships, things like the kits etcetera?","Don Blair","Well there\u2019s certainly is an impact, but what I would direct you to is the conversation we had about where the growth and revenue is coming from as well as the growth in futures, we are seeing growth across categories around the world. So running is up, women\u2019s training is up, we are seeing great results as Trevor said earlier from basketball. So certainly, global football is a major driver here as it always is for this sort of event, but we are seeing growth very broadly across categories.","Trevor Edwards","And I would just say that we feel obviously great about our football business and the potential as we head into the World Cup. Futures are up double-digits, revenues up double-digits, we are launching a great array of products into the marketplace. So we are super excited about the opportunity that the World Cup represents, but not only in markets like Brazil or just the emerging markets, but really all around the world. It\u2019s a tremendous platform for us to continue to grow the business.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Yes, good morning or good afternoon. It\u2019s Dave Weiner from Deutsche Bank. So I wanted to ask a question about China if I could and specifically kind of a two-parter. So one, it looks from what we can tell that the kind of macro environment for apparel, athletic apparel and footwear specifically is improving. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the overall marketplace. And then secondly, I think you made a comment that your own stores that have been reset saw a significant margin improvement, could you just drill down a little bit on that? Is that based on gross margin and kind of the mix of product that you are selling maybe the premiumization thesis or something else? Thanks a lot.","Trevor Edwards","Yes. On China, I think the part that we clearly can say is that the reset strategy that we have put in place is working and we are obviously very encouraged by the results that we are seeing in the marketplace. As I think Don sort of pointed to we are very focused on driving both profitability and productivity at retail. What we have been able to do in our own stores is to continue to drive a premium position in the marketplace that is based on performance and then amplified through our sportswear lines. And that combination is driving a better mix in the stores that is leading to a much more profitable business. We are also across the marketplace we are narrowing the amount of categories that we focused on, which is allowing us to go deeper to make sure that we have the right size curves in the marketplace. So the team is working very specifically down to the granular details to really help us build a better foundation for long-term growth in the marketplace by making sure that we are driving against the right operational metrics, but also delivering against the consumers specifically around what the consumer wants in China.","Mark Parker","Yes. It\u2019s really a case of focusing on the fundamentals, executing the merchandising, the product flow, the assortment planning and then the storytelling at retail. Some of the retail executions in those reset doors that we have in China, I would say, are some of the best we have in the world. And then the response from the consumer is obviously quite positive. The Chinese consumer as I will just say as a general point is more and more sophisticated and discriminating in terms of their choice in product and price is not a limiting factor, in the end, the product and the brand are really resonating. And we are definitely seeing that in China as we are in other parts of the world.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks. Do you have time for me to squeeze maybe one more in, quick one?","Kelley Hall","Sure, yes.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Sure, thanks. So someone asked earlier about kind of the payback schedule for some of your initiatives, 3D printing, Flyknit and kind of your other supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies and I understand you don\u2019t want to talk about next year, but could you at least comment if from the investment side if you have already kind of well on your way to kind of starting to apply the some of these initiatives broadly so that at least from an investment point of view, you have already started that to some degree?","Mark Parker","Yes. I will jump into say that there is two factors that are really driving a lot of our priorities in this manufacturing revolution space. One is to create the capability to create new innovation and product that the consumers can experience. Flyknit is a great example of a process. And 3D printing as you mentioned, processes that allow us to do things that conventional shoemaking or product manufacturing process won\u2019t allow us to do. So there is breakthroughs in performance innovation that come. We are also very discriminating when it comes to making sure that we are focused on things that can really affect the bottom line, the product cost. So we are prioritizing our investments. And this is a great example of we have lots of opportunities and we need to make choices, but we are making choices against things that can help us innovate the product as well as actually reduce our product cost and our speed to market. So we actually have a very strong and deep view over the next three to five year period and that\u2019s expanding on the impact that these investments are making. And again, we are prioritizing where we think we can have the greatest impact. It\u2019s one of the areas frankly as an innovation geek I am most excited about.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Yes, great. Thanks.","Don Blair","And Dave, I would say from an investment standpoint I just wanted to make the point that I think to the conversation that we just had from Mark, there is a lot more opportunity and we are not even close to the end of this. And what I would also point out is that a lot of this investment will be made in partnership with our factory group. So you won\u2019t see all of this investment on our books. In fact, in many cases, the factory partners are going to make most of this investment. We are really the drivers of the innovation, the catalyst for this, so where \u2013 we have got a long list of opportunities ahead of us.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Perfect. Thanks for the color.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley Hall - Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations","Well, thank you everyone for joining us this quarter and we will talk to you next time.

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh and hello everyone. In Q3, our teams once again drove healthy growth across NIKE\u2019s complete portfolio, leading to balanced results in our key dimensions. In our geographies, for example, the continued growth in North America was fueled by NIKE Consumer Experiences, where we have our most direct connection with the consumer. China earned its 19th consecutive quarter of high-quality, double-digit growth, as the Chinese consumer increasingly makes sport a part of their daily lives. And the NIKE brand continues to accelerate in EMEA and APLA as we go deep into our key cities to seize new opportunities quickly.","In innovation, we've led with bold platforms like Air Max in Sportswear and Adaptive technology in Basketball. We kept consumers coming back for more with a fast pace of fresh options in our Power Franchises. And with the energy for sportswear at an all-time high, NIKE continues to stand out in the active lifestyle marketplace through our authentic position in sports. And through our digital transformation, we\u2019re scaling the digital capabilities that\u2019ll serve consumers more personally and we\u2019re driving significant growth through our digital ecosystem making Q3 NIKE Digital\u2019s first billion-dollar quarter.","Put together, all of this work led to strong results for the quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 11%. Gross Margin was up 130 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was $0.68. Diving into the details, we launched some incredible innovation this quarter. Let\u2019s start with NIKE AIR. The major leaps we\u2019ve made in new designs for Air Max, like VaporMax and Max 270, continue to energize the consumer\u2019s ongoing love for the whole platform. Icons like the Max 95 and 97 and Tuned Air are a hit with both men and women.","The Air Max Dia, our new women\u2019s-specific design, is performing extremely well across the globe. And the Air Max 720, a radically-unique silhouette, was released in a number of bold colorways, creating a strong consumer response right out of the gate. We don\u2019t, however, take this high demand for granted. It requires constant fine-tuning and the right balance of ceding and scaling to ensure a healthy position in the marketplace. But we know as long as we\u2019re making an impact with distinctive innovation like Air Max, our top platforms will continue to fuel our long-term growth.","At the same time, we\u2019re delivering a faster cycle of fresh assortments of our power franchises. We do that by offering more options of colors and materials, inspired by more targeted and relevant storytelling and the strategy is paying off. For example, in our Sportswear category which continues to grow double-digits, the Air Force 1 is accelerating growth in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s. In the Jordan Brand, where the business grew at a very healthy rate this quarter, the Jordan 1 is a top-seller across all geographies.","And in Basketball, we drove energy with the Kyrie 5 and LeBron 16 through multiple color ways and creative product storytelling. We also know that there are several untapped opportunities within our innovation agenda, and we\u2019ve intensified our focus to amplify them.","For example, we are energizing the marketplace with statement innovation and going forward, you will see us bring more distinction at the core level. Specifically, for next fiscal year, we\u2019ve fast-tracked new collections under the $100 price point and we\u2019re aligning the merchandising and marketing teams to support them throughout the marketplace. Apparel, as we\u2019ve said, is another outsized growth opportunity. Over the course of the next year, you\u2019re going to see a sharper focus on key classifications in NIKE apparel. We\u2019ll accelerate growth by offering fresh options in our top-sellers, much like we do in footwear with our Power Franchises. Our goal is to provide great apparel for every step of the sport journey. For workouts, we\u2019re offering the best core items. This quarter, the bra business continued to expand and our athletic-take on Yoga apparel has moved us into a new market.","For day-to-day life, we\u2019re designing for added versatility. This quarter, the new Tech Knit has been very successful, helping to grow Tech Pack unit sales nearly 200%, compared to last year. And to feed a passion for teams and athletes, we\u2019re offering premium product like the NBA Showtime Hoodie and then cascading to core level fleece, tees and shorts. In just our second year with the NBA, this is tracking to be the largest merchandising season in its history. We\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re leveraging Sports Moments through our athletes and league partnerships. And looking ahead, the sports calendar is full of moments to elevate, starting from today\u2019s first round of March Madness all the way through the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. In the next few months, we\u2019ll celebrate World Cup with our most innovative Team Kits and sportswear collections. In the spring marathons, we\u2019ll unveil the next generation of the Zoom X platform. And building on the energy of the NBA playoffs, Giannis will cap off his incredible season with the reveal of his first signature shoe.","We\u2019ll also continue our streak of industry-defining innovation for the everyday athlete. We\u2019ll introduce a completely-new cushioning system designed to get more people running. In Women\u2019s, we\u2019ll launch more than 40 new styles of bras to expand our inclusive sizing considerably and building off the successful adaptive basketball launch this quarter, we\u2019ll expand the platform into new categories and embed the Adapt technology even further into our digital ecosystem. The innovation pipeline is full at NIKE and it gives us great confidence that we\u2019ll continue to win with consumers for years to come. While we view innovation as NIKE\u2019s number one competitive advantage, our Digital transformation will create even further separation. There are teams all over NIKE piloting new ideas and proving-out concepts. We\u2019re testing, learning and optimizing at an incredible pace. But the real key is to turn these new digital capabilities into growth at scale.","There\u2019s a lot to talk about here, and I\u2019ll highlight a few areas that are leading to broad-based growth. First, we\u2019re supercharging NIKE+ membership for even greater personalization with consumers. When we offer more tailored product and experiences, we bring more value to the consumer and it opens up more opportunities to grow our business. So, this quarter we extended a new, advanced algorithm in our apps that allows us to reward our most active members. We added this data-driven format to the release of the NIKE App in Japan, and it help lead to the most successful launch ever. We continue to show how important membership is to creating an increasingly seamless physical to digital retail experience. In our House of Innovation stores in New York and Shanghai, over 50% of transactions are with members. Across our wider fleet, consumers using the NIKE App at Retail average 40% higher sales than those that don\u2019t.","Our SNKRS app, in particular, continues to be a powerhouse in the world of digital commerce. For the quarter, SNKRS traffic and revenue were up triple digits. 17 of the top 20 SNKRS launches had 100% sell through. And during the record-breaking Air Jordan 11 Concord launch, our digital ecosystem showed its ability to handle scale and drive unrivalled energy processing on average 300 transactions per second. As a whole, our NIKE Digital business was up an impressive 36% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis. Another area where digital is creating company-wide efficiencies is within our product creation teams. We\u2019ve fully digitized our palette of over 6,000 footwear materials, allowing our design teams to build on one another\u2019s work and adapt to market trends more quickly. With fewer physical samples, it also plays an important role in minimizing our environmental impact.","Overall, our advanced digital tools are reducing lead times, driving sustainability and leading to faster design cycles. The third highlight is how we\u2019re connecting the marketplace by digitally tagging and tracking NIKE products, all the way from production through retail. Our RFID initiative, for example, is improving product visibility and is an important step towards integrating our diverse ecosystem of physical and digital experiences, distribution centers and contract factories. This will give the consumer easier access to product and allow NIKE to more accurately match supply to demand across the world and ultimately fuel better, higher quality growth.","We\u2019re seeing the early wins pile up in our digital transformation, and its bringing scale to every facet of our Triple Double Strategy. What\u2019s so exciting is the more we invest in stronger digital capabilities, the more growth opportunities we uncover. Today, the consumer rewards agility. The companies who adapt and scale first are the companies who grow fastest. To do that, NIKE is looking across the spectrum of the value chain from our factory partners to key cities, so we can take advantage of our most important opportunities.","At the factory level, that means staging raw materials so they can be quickly deployed to fill requests for our most in-demand products. We did this in anticipation of LeBron\u2019s move to a new team last summer and it cut our jersey lead times nearly in half, except more of that with all the high-profile free agency moves this summer. But more broadly, this process is a critical component of our 2X Speed initiative and fuels our key city execution, so we can quickly adapt our assortments based on the demands of local consumers. The Express Lane is another important enabler to 2X Speed, continuing to scale and grow as a percentage of NIKE\u2019s overall business. In this quarter in our geographies, the Express Lane in Greater China was responsible for over half of the products in our Chinese New Year collection.","In North America, the top ten styles in our NIKE App all came out of Express Lane. And in EMEA, it contributed to over 20% of our business. Express Lane is just one of the ways we\u2019re driving agility in our value chain to serve consumer demand. We\u2019re also investing in responsive manufacturing and faster delivery capabilities for our key cities. Overall, Q3 demonstrated the strength of NIKE\u2019s complete portfolio. The Consumer Direct Offense is connecting our powerful brand, to compelling innovation, to operational excellence, all in service of the consumer. And it\u2019s a strategy that gives us a very clear path to sustain that momentum over the long-term. This quarter, one of our greatest growth opportunities, our women\u2019s offense, experienced an important inflection point. I was fortunate enough to join our team in Paris for a powerful launch for the upcoming Women\u2019s World Cup, where we hosted some of the greatest athletes in the world.","We were excited to unveil 14 National Team Kits for World Cup 2019, a tournament record for NIKE. The energy of the moment is building on our Dream Crazier, Just Do It Campaign, as narrated by Serena Williams. The campaign is a great example of how NIKE is leveraging the power of Social Media platforms to carry our message. Dream Crazier has broken several of our own consumer engagement records across all four geographies. For example, in North America, it\u2019s NIKE\u2019s most-shared Instagram post ever and one of the most-successful NIKE Tweets of all-time. In Greater China, the campaign reached 600 million views in just the first three days. This inspiring work from our brand teams is just part of our broader strategy to shift resources and accelerate our women\u2019s business. In product, we\u2019ve aligned our merchandising teams for one unified women\u2019s vision at retail and our R&D teams are quickly moving to create the platforms of the future. A more complete offense is taking shape and it\u2019s incredibly energizing.","This quarter, you began to see the early results from those teams. Our NIKE One tight fueled our Training Tights business to strong double-digit growth. Plus Size bras launched this quarter and are off to an amazing start. Jordan women\u2019s is growing strong double-digits. And our women\u2019s sneakers offering is diversifying and growing with products that range from re-imagined retro styles like the Air Force 1 Sage Low and the M2K to new innovations like the Air Max 270 and the Air Max Dia. In Paris, the celebration of NIKE Women was unlike any moment I\u2019ve experienced. The best part is the work that we\u2019re doing this summer is just a start. We want to help create the next wave of growth for women in sport and with a fully-dedicated women\u2019s offense, we see an even healthier, long-term future for NIKE.","It\u2019s a great time to be in the business of sport. The larger movement of health and fitness is growing the athletic apparel and footwear market all over the world. And we\u2019re excited about our role in fueling that energy and capturing even more of that opportunity ahead. Thanks, and now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thank you, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. In Q3, we once again delivered very strong growth and profitability, with 11% currency neutral revenue growth amplified by 130 basis points of gross margin expansion. Most importantly, our growth was high-quality, strategic and broad-based. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is fueling strong demand across all four of our geographies, led by the 12 key cities that we believe offer the greatest platform to impact the world through sport and create Brand distinction.","Our broad-based global growth is being fueled by four underlying strategic drivers; one, editing our product portfolio while amplifying the styles that consumers love most; two, doubling the cadence and impact of innovation that we\u2019re bringing to market; three, operating with greater agility; and four, transforming the consumer experience through digital. This is the Consumer Direct Offense in action, and the direct impact on NIKE\u2019s growth is tangible. First, by editing to amplify, we\u2019ve reduced the total number of styles in our portfolio significantly, while bringing much greater dimension and choice to what we call our Power Franchises. In any given season, our Power Franchises include select icons within Sportswear, such as the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1, performance franchises such as the Pegasus, as well as new innovation platforms such as the VaporMax, Air Max 270 and React. The new dimension we are bringing ranges from collaborations with athletes and influencers, to compelling new elements of design, to infusing new innovation into longstanding performance franchises.","Second, we are well on our way to doubling the cadence and impact of innovation on our business. Once again, in Q3, new innovation platforms comprised of vast majority of our incremental revenue growth. And, as Mark said, our innovation pipeline is more robust than ever. In Q3, we launched the Air Max 720 to strong demand, as well as the Adapt BB on court in the NBA, which was a leap forward into the future of adaptive performance footwear. And we are scaling innovation faster than ever before with React and our new Max Air platforms being leveraged across multiple performance categories and in Sportswear within just the first year of launch.","Third, we are bringing both innovation and our Power Franchises to market with greater speed and agility. Through our Express Lane initiative, we are using closer to market consumer insights to update key styles with new materials, print and colors on significantly shorter timelines. In Q3, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane drove well over 10% of our revenue. These efforts, editing to amplify, doubling the cadence and impact of innovation and operating with greater speed and agility, all come together with the greatest consumer impact through NIKE Direct. NIKE Direct is where the NIKE Brand experience comes to life in its fullest sense, and increasingly that experience is being elevated by digital.","Once again, in Q3, our growth was led by NIKE Digital, which on a currency neutral basis grew 36% globally. We continue to expand our digital footprint with the launch of the NIKE App in Japan, and we continue to enhance our digital ecosystem through the rollout of the NIKE App in our own retail stores across North America and Europe. Our expansion is fueling the acquisition of new members at a strong double-digit rate, and the new experiences that we are creating are also driving strong double-digit increases in member engagement and buying.","Our vision is to create direct, unbreakable relationships with our consumers. And we know the most direct connection is through the mobile device they carry with them everywhere they go. As Mark referenced, we are driving a digital transformation of NIKE with an emphasis on mobile. Over the balance of this fiscal year and through FY20, we will continue investing in this digital transformation. While many companies can build a technology stack, no other brand is able to leverage technology to create the kinds of amazing consumer experiences that only NIKE can.","Our most significant investments will continue to be in the capabilities that enable us to better serve consumers and extend our brand leadership. These include investments in new digital member services, in data and analytics, in demand sensing technology, in technologies such as RFID that enable Connected Inventory across the marketplace and in a new editorial content engine that will keep us engaged with our members 365 days a year. More so than ever, our investments are directly translating into strong and sustainable growth.","But before providing context on our positive outlook, I will first reflect on our Q3 results. NIKE, Inc. Q3 revenue grew 7%, up 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Our growth reflects double-digit currency-neutral momentum internationally and high-single-digit growth in North America. Gross margin expanded by 130 basis points in Q3 as average gross selling prices expanded, strong demand drove higher full price sales and higher margin NIKE Direct growth outpaced wholesale growth. Q3 gross margin was also favorably impacted by the shift of Supply Chain investments out of Q3 and into Q4.","Demand Creation was flat in the third quarter as Other Demand Creation increased and Sports Marketing declined based on the timing of investments. Operating overhead increased 17%, driven by continued investment in NIKE\u2019s digital transformation, as well as year-over-year compensation related accruals. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.7% and third quarter diluted EPS was $0.68. As of February 28, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a continued healthy pull market for NIKE globally and our stronger supply and demand management.","With that, let\u2019s turn to some of the highlights across our reported operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 7% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. Sportswear, Jordan, NIKE Kids and Running, led our growth across the geography. From a product perspective, the majority of our incremental growth was driven by our Power Franchises ranging from the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1 to the Pegasus and Kyrie, to the Max Air family of products, including the new Air Max Dia for Women.","As Mark referenced, the Jordan 11 Concord was also the biggest launch in our history with the product selling out in hours. The strength of our product portfolio and the fastest digital deliveries in our industry fueled a strong, or I should very strong holiday season for NIKE. In that we outpaced the broader retail market by roughly 2X. We also have very strong brand momentum in North America, fueled by the powerful Just Do It Dream Crazier campaign, which Mark referenced, as well as our executions around NBA All Star Weekend.","Creating differentiated retail experiences remains a significant opportunity as the physical retail marketplace in North America continues to go through consolidation. At the same time, we are catalyzing the next generation of retail in North America. And that begins with Digital. NIKE Digital grew 30% in Q3, faster than all other channels. We are also disrupting the physical marketplace, in a positive sense, leveraging digital through new NIKE Direct concepts such as our House of Innovation in New York and NIKE Live in Los Angeles. Accordingly, our growth in New York and LA is over-indexing the broader market. We are also continuing to create new differentiated consumer experiences through the rollout of the NIKE app at retail in our owned stores and the testing of new services and concepts with our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. We expect our strong pipeline of innovative product, the brand heat we have created and an acceleration in our creation of new digitally-led consumer experiences to continue driving healthy growth in North America going forward.","Now, let\u2019s turn to EMEA, where we continue to build extraordinary brand momentum. In Q3, revenue in EMEA grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in Sportswear and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit pace. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the ever-increasing strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA is home to five of our 12 key cities. In all five, NIKE is rated the #1 favorite Brand by consumers, and our growth is far outpacing the broader market. Take Paris, for example. Mark mentioned our Women\u2019s World Cup launch there last week, which was by all accounts powerful. It was just earlier this year that we launched the Jordan\/PSG partnership, which drove incredible energy in this style, culture and football obsessed city. And of course, looking ahead, Paris will host the 2024 Olympics. It\u2019s a great reminder that our 12 key cities were not chosen based on size alone but instead, because we see these key cities as having the greatest potential impact on our Brand and business.","In our APLA geography, revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across both footwear and apparel. From a country perspective, growth was led by Japan and Korea, catalyzed by the great momentum we have in the key cities of Tokyo and Seoul. Across APLA, NIKE Digital is continuing to accelerate with revenue growing over 60% in Q3. We continue to expand our digital ecosystem across this region and leverage digital partnerships. As we look ahead to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, we could not be more thrilled with the momentum we are building in Japan. Both the SNKRs app and newly launched NIKE app are resonating strongly with consumers. Our Running innovation has also resonated with the highly discerning Japanese running consumer, with NIKE now having ascended to #1 in Running across Japan.","So now let\u2019s turn to China. This past quarter, we delivered 24% currency-neutral revenue growth in Greater China, led by NIKE Direct, with digital commerce up over 60%. We have great momentum in China, but we are still far from realizing the long-term opportunity. On our last call, we spoke about four epic growth opportunities; International, Digital, Apparel and Women\u2019s. China is perhaps the best example of our outsized growth potential internationally. China is already the largest footwear and apparel market in the world, but athletic footwear and apparel represents a smaller share of total than in more developed markets such as the U.S.","That said, within the broader market, athletic footwear and apparel is growing double digits in China. Sport has increasingly become more a part of life for consumers in China. While Basketball has long been popular with the Chinese consumer, we are now also seeing a Running boom. And, that is why NIKE has always been a Brand of China, for China. We have always believed that by being authentically connected to the Chinese consumer, we could help catalyze the rise of sport participation and sport culture in this market from sponsoring the Shanghai Marathon, to our partnerships with the China Super League, to working with the Ministry of Sport to expand physical education in schools.","That is why, even amidst current geopolitical dynamics, NIKE continues to deliver strong and sustainable growth in China. That said we are not taking our current momentum for granted. Rather, we are more focused than ever on creating product specifically tailored to the Chinese consumers\u2019 preferences and fit and creating digital experiences that connect us more deeply to consumers through China\u2019s unique digital ecosystem.","With that, I\u2019ll now share outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '19 and provide an early read on FY20. For the full year fiscal year '19, our outlook for constant currency revenue growth and gross margin continues to improve. At the same time, we will continue to invest in the capabilities that are fueling our strong sustainable growth. For Q4 specifically, we expect continued strong growth, with constant currency revenue growth being squarely in the high-single-digit range. It is important to note that we expect roughly 6 points of FX headwinds in Q4, which would result in low-single-digit reported revenue growth.","As you may recall in Q4 of last year, we delivered 8% currency-neutral growth with 13% reported growth. In that quarter, the launch of new innovation platforms, such as React and the Air Max 270 began to materially impact our performance along with the impact of the World Cup. So our outlook for strong currency neutral Revenue growth this Q4 is a testament to the sustainability of the growth that we are delivering through the continued execution of our new offense. We also see the disparity between currency neutral and reported revenue growth peaking in Q4 before narrowing significantly as we enter FY20, based on current FX rates. Recall that during Q4 of last year, the euro approached $1.25, before depreciating to as low as 1.15 in Q1 of this fiscal year, a similar dynamic exists with respect to the renminbi. As a result, we currently expect the FX headwind on reported revenue to largely dissipate as we enter full year 20.","For gross margin in Q4, we expect expansion of roughly 75 basis points, ending the fiscal year with gross margin expansion that will have exceeded our long-term financial model. While we expect continued strong full price sell through and strong growth through our higher margin NIKE Direct businesses, that is partially offset in Q4 by higher input costs, specifically cotton, chemicals and labor, FX sourcing headwinds and the shift of supply chain investments from Q3 into Q4.","As for SG&A, we expect growth in the high-single-digit range in Q4 as we continue to prioritize strategic investments. We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be roughly flat in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be roughly 18 to 20%. With the ongoing finalization of regulations related to U.S. tax reform, we have experienced volatility in our tax rate due to non-recurring items, which favorably impacted Q3 on a net basis. We will likely continue experiencing near-term volatility in our tax rate based on the finalization of regulations. That said, due to the uncertain timing of finalization, we have not factored all of the potential non-recurring impacts into our guidance for Q4.","Now, let me share some preliminary thoughts on our positive outlook for fiscal year '20. We are still in the early stages of our annual planning process. That said our expectations are buoyed by our current momentum, our brand heat with consumers, our robust innovation pipeline and the positive early signals we are receiving from our NIKE Direct business and our strategic wholesale partners. Overall, we expect to deliver high-single digit revenue growth, as well as gross margin expansion and profitability in line with the long-term financial model we communicated at our Investor Day in October 2017. Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment, so we will share more specific guidance for fiscal year '20 in our next earnings call.","We are thrilled with our current momentum. That said, we are still in the early stages of executing the Consumer Direct Offense, with much more opportunity ahead of us. So, we will continue to focus our investments on the digital transformation of NIKE and in the areas of our business where we see the greatest potential to grow and create value for both consumers and shareholders.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask question on the Women's actually. We've noted some greater focus in the marketplace, marketing, messaging and the product side and there seems to be a lot of innovation, obviously, you talked about in the call as well. Maybe give us an update on where you stand on that opportunity, obviously, to keep focus of the company as important part of the long-term plan. Is it growing as a mix of the business, or is the men's business just too strong for women's at this point, still really become a more material next driver? And I had one follow up. Thanks.","Mark Parker","Yes, actually, the women's businesses over indexing our men's growth. And we see me, as we've said earlier, tremendous opportunity moving forward. We are under indexed in terms of our percentage of business in the women's area, as you know. So, the upside there, particularly with the consumer, the market being bigger than the men's, is tremendous upside. We had a great quarter in Q3. The good news is driven by balanced growth, I think across footwear and apparel we had particularly great momentum in Greater China and APLA. So this is, obviously, a global opportunity. We see women embracing the sneaker culture more and more every day. So we're scaling up popular models and creating new models for women specifically and the response, like with the Air Max Dia, for example, one of the newer models has been tremendous also, great opportunity in a parallel. We've had real strong response to the NIKE yoga collection and the tight business, driven by the one tight, some innovation there as well.","And as I said, the broad business is actually a great opportunity for us and we've expanded the broad collection considerably, particularly in the plus-size area of the business, and we're seeing strong consumer demand there. So, it's really an opportunity across all dimensions of our business. Jordan is another one. Women's in Jordan grew a strong double-digit number this past quarter. And the focus for us, it's a huge priority is editing and shifting the resources we have internally to serve women more completely. We're definitely looking at how we elevate our female athletes and influencers more completely, providing membership and access to sport, being very thoughtful in terms of design and our innovation agenda specifically for women. So again, simple conclusion there is under indexed opportunity for us at this point, huge opportunity for us going forward as we shift focus.","Andy Campion","And Omar, an area in which we will deliberately shift investment from a product creation through the retail experiences is to accelerate against what we see as a tremendous growth opportunity.","Omar Saad","Understood, that's helpful. And then while I have, maybe bigger picture on the digital capabilities, very clear the company has developed outstanding expertise in a lot of areas and learning how to scale it. When you look at the other brands in the portfolio Converse maybe isn't form as well. Is there something about the digital learnings you're developing in the NIKE brand that's scalable or not scalable across other brands in your portfolio? Is there a way we should think about that, because clearly working with NIKE brand?","Andy Campion","Absolutely, lots of opportunities to leverage learnings in NIKE Digital across the portfolio; certainly, in Jordan, we're seeing tremendous success; as I mentioned, our speakers at platform; Jordan is a major part of that energy. Converse, we just launched Converse.com and the early response to that is incredibly positive and we see tremendous upside opportunity for the Converse brand as well. Overall, I think the brands in the portfolio, particularly Converse, Jordan and of course NIKE, are all lined up to share learnings and leverage, the expertise and the capabilities we're building in digital. So, we're going to see a lift I think across the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jamie Merriman","You've talked a little bit about in terms of the digital investments, the NIKE athletic retail. Can you talk about where you are in that process and what you're seeing in terms of response and connection from consumers as you've done that? That'd be my first one.","Mark Parker","Well, first of all, obviously, digital is up significantly for the quarter. So we are leveraging what we're learning and its showing up in the results, up 36% for the quarter. I mentioned the SNKRS app. SNKRS app to me is really a signal of what the future potential of how we connect with consumers in a deeper way with storytelling as part of that effort. And then the connection we're making with physical to digital through NIKE Live in L.A. and then our house of innovation in New York and Shanghai. We're learning a lot. I mean every day we're learning and then we're applying those learnings to the rest of our business across our own direct business, but also in partnership with our wholesale digital partners at the same time. So, we're seeing a healthy lift. And we know membership is a key part of this as well. And the membership is really driving a lot of the increase and improved performance in direct retail same time, and we've seen some impressive numbers on that as well.","Jamie Merriman","And then can you just talk a little bit about apparel in North America? You've talked about women's and apparel as being two areas, particularly where you're focused in terms of driving growth and clearly, seeing great results from women's. But can you just talk a little bit about the initiatives in apparel and specifically just wondering about North America as well? Thanks.","Mark Parker","Well, first of all, we continue to see great momentum in our apparel business, not just in North America, but across all geographies. And it's a balance between both performance and sportswear. That said, we see a lot more upside potential, particularly as we 2X our innovation agenda in apparel. We see tremendous opportunity to start to echo much of what we've seen on the footwear side of the business. And we're putting particular emphasis too on the women's innovation agenda in apparel as well. So we've seen some early positive response to some of that product and some of those launches. But we've seen much more upside for apparel around the world really, for NIKE in both sportswear and in performance for women and for men for that matter.","Andy Campion","Yes, just to add that one of the reasons we call apparel as such an extraordinary or outsize opportunity for us long-term is. Athletic apparel, as a percent of total apparel, is much smaller than is athletic footwear as a percent of total footwear. And what we're really focused on is the opportunity to go deeper in some of the classifications where we have been a player and had great response from consumers, but we haven't gone as deep as consistently. And that extends to offering product that is well suited for new occasions. Again, think apparel Monday through Friday, as well as on-court, in the gym and over the weekend. And then that extends to price points, up and down the price points from premium apparel through to the more affordable price points. So, we see a pretty extraordinary opportunity to both catalyze the growth of athletic apparel within the broader apparel industry, and also extend the offerings that we're bringing to market.","Mark Parker","I'll just add that we're in the infancy stages of apparel opportunity on the Jordan side of the business as well as. We've seen a taste of the response to the women's apparel business in Jordan, but we see a lot of upside opportunity for apparel and their overall Jordan business. ","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Good afternoon. I know it's early in the fiscal '20 planning process, so I appreciate the color given. But just wanted to see if there's any other puts and takes you can provide as we think about maybe the composition of the high-single-digit revenue growth outlook, as well as puts and takes on margins. In particular, your long-term algorithm is inclusive of slight leverage on SG&A, which we haven't seen this year. So just curious on how we should think about that going forward?","Andy Campion","We're still in the early stages of our planning process, and I appreciate that you noted that. But we do have increasing confidence in the expectations that we've just shared for fiscal year '20. We have incredibly strong momentum and demand across both footwear and apparel brand heat and as we have shared, an incredible pipeline of innovation that both in the early part of the year, as well as in the latter part of the year as we ramp up to Tokyo 2020. We're already receiving very positive signals from our Nike direct business and our wholesale partners as I shared. All of these really contribute to our competence in our outlook for growth. Our outlook for growth is broad based. We expect growth largely in-line with the guard rails that we've shared in terms of our long-term algorithm across geographies. So continued momentum internationally, as well as continued healthy sustainable growth in North America. Keep in mind that we're operating in a dynamic environment, and so we'll update you with more specifics when we get to our Q4 call.","As far as SG&A, we see the investments that we're making, translating into this extremely strong currency neutral revenue growth and margin expansion. And so, that correlation has probably been more direct than ever, which is leading us to continue to invest in the capabilities that are going to drive. The digital transformation we've spoken about and fuel that growth. Our investments in innovation, which we've spoken about and speed and digital, are clearly having a tangible impact. So we'll continue to make those investments. At the same time, as we said at our Investor Day, we do expect to be able to both make those investments and deliver slight SG&A leverage over that five year horizon. So that is very much still a goal in terms of the profitability of our business going forward.","Mark Parker","And I'll quickly add that the growth that we're seeing that makes up that high single digit guidance at this stage is a very -- it's as balanced as I think we've seen it in terms of complete offense, men's and women's performance in sportswear, I think across the goes driven by the key cities, categories, price points, we do have some opportunity, I think in core, particularly as we head into fiscal '20 and you're going to see a whole refresh core offering from Nike that we think is going to help to fill in our complete offense there as well. And then as Andy said and we say all the time, that truly it's the innovation pipeline is full and I think it's going to drive some great upside for us.","Andy Campion","And the only thing I'd add is I think it is important to note that a lot of investments that we're making are really long-term in nature. They have a compounding impact innovations platform that we can leverage, obviously, and scale faster over time, as well as the investments we're making digitally. As we've said before, from a long term perspective, we see digital comprising the majority of our business. And so these are investments that we think will have a compounding effect as we make them year-over-year.","Paul Trussell","My follow-up is just to circle back on North America, and I think part of the question Jamie was asking, which was around the apparel. Is there anything from a timing standpoint that led to the deceleration in apparel in the third quarter and any other just comments you can provide in North America around what you're seeing with your wholesale partners?","Andy Campion","Yes, very intuitive, insightful question. There were some timing impacts related to our NBA business and the launch of certain products year-over-year. There are always timing impacts in terms of product launches. So yes, nothing in terms of a turn or change in consumer demand. In fact, consumer demand for our apparel in North America is very strong. Frankly to some extent it puts pressure on supply, but that is that's a great point of pressure to have. We've got really strong demand for our apparel in North America. So I wouldn't overly index on the quarterly rate of growth.","Operator","Your next question is from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs, your lines open.","Alexandra Walvis","You mentioned in response to the Paul's question that there was some work that you guys were doing, refreshing the core products and driving more growth across different price points.","You also mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'd be giving more distinction to some of the core level products that products under $100. And you mentioned that you'd be introducing some new cushioning products to get people -- more people running. I wonder if you could dig a little bit more into or dive a little bit more into those strategies. And then more broadly, why is now the time to bring some of that product innovation and process innovation to those lower price points and broader consumer groups?","Mark Parker","Well, it's basically a part of our ongoing complete offense strategy as we see where we have opportunities to improve our offerings and to create more opportunity. And certainly as we look at footwear or our complete footwear offering, not just in North America but around the world, we see the opportunity to strengthen the price to value opportunity for our footwear. So part of that is bringing innovation into that price point, not just taking it down but creating unique innovation for those price points and those consumers. We have to be competitive at every level. And I think as part of our offense and I think there's a great opportunity for us, and I think that can drive some of the under indexing in the marketplace now versus the opportunity.","So yes, we have about three quarters of our product at the core level, and footwear is going to be refreshed starting in back-to-school. And it's not a takedown it's making sure that we have that value at that price point and again, creating some unique innovation platform opportunities. And as far as the new cushioning platform goes, I can't really talk a lot about it other than it's incredibly comfortable, and I think it is going to open up opportunity for part of the running population that actually we might not have at this stage, or at least invite more people in to it. I'm actually wearing a pair now. And I will tell you it's one of the most comfortable platforms that we've had, so incredibly exciting and visually very distinctive.","Alexandra Walvis","My second question was on Jordan, the brand is back to strong growth and you've called out several drivers of it. I wonder if you could reflect on some of the actions taken there in the last year and a half or so to reset that North American market. How you're feeling about the health of inventory in the channel today and about growth opportunities for that brand going forward?","Mark Parker","As you know, we had -- this time last year we're in a reset mode on Jordan. And we're very pleased with where we've come in terms of cleaning up the products in terms of the marketplace. I think we probably over indexed a bit on the retro market. We've got a rein on that, so it's a very balanced management of the Jordan product portfolio, not just in terms of retro but actually balancing that out with performance product as well. And that's the story in Jordan too is we're beginning to see a much more balanced product offering, both performance and sportswear, new performance platforms with retro and retro refresh, but making sure that we're managing that in terms of the marketplace. The inventory is actually quite healthy in a good position right now. Women's is just coming on. So I mentioned women's apparel, but also footwear for Jordan, a big opportunity for us. And there's a lot of great brands energy around Jordan right now, not just here in North America but around the world. It's APLA, EMEA, China, huge brand presence for Jordan in China. So again, we're bullish and we feel like, we've got a good rein on managing that in a healthy and balanced way.","Andy Campion","And I'd just add that as we said, the demand for the Jordan brand has been strong, it was strong even when we are in a reset mode it still is strong. And our opportunity was to, as both Mark and others have said, bring new dimension to the brand. Mark touched on women's a couple of other areas of dimension performance basketball product. We've seen extremely strong demand for the Air Jordan XXXIII game shoe, which we amplified with the Chinese New Year and Travis Scott editions. We're seeing incredibly strong demand for Russell Westbrook's signature shoe, Why Not, also on performance silhouettes. And then as Mark touched on in response to the earlier question on apparel, the apparel coming out of Jordan is extremely strong and we see a big opportunity there. In fact, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, the Jordan PSG launch was largely an apparel launch. We did have footwear in that launch. But what was really a shock and surprise to consumers in a very positive way was what we were able to do with the Jordan Brand on football apparel.","Operator","Your last question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Lauren Cassel","Just a quick follow-up on Paul's question, looking to 2020 on gross margin specifically. Are there any specific factors if any that would prevent 2020 gross margin from being up as much as they have been here in 2019? And then my second question just bigger picture. How do you guys view the resale markets roll, the StockXs, the Goats of the world, in the context of the overall industry? Do you think there would ever come a point in time where you partner with them directly, whether that'd be for collaborations or exclusive products? Just any thoughts on how you view that that portion of the market. Thanks so much.","Mark Parker","Lauren, can you quickly repeat the second part of your question?","Lauren Cassel","Yes, just how you guys view the resale market within the overall industry the StockXs, the Goats of the world. Do you think there would ever come a point in time where you collaborate with those sites?","Mark Parker","We'll start with the gross margin question. As we communicated at our Investor Day, our goal, a very ambitious but we believe achievable goal, was to deliver as much as 50 basis points of gross margin expansion over the next five years. Obviously, in this fiscal year, we are exceeding that goal. And that's fueled by number of factors, very strong full price sell through, the continued outpacing growth in our Nike direct business. As we look ahead to fiscal year '20, as I said in our guidance, we expect gross margin to be largely in-line with the long-term objective that we communicated on Investor Day, which is again a robust amount of margin expansion, especially on top of what we've delivered this year.","Much like this year as we get into the fiscal year, we may see opportunities to expand on that. Certainly, this year, we've just had incredibly strong brand momentum and incredibly strong product pipeline that have afforded us the opportunity to outperform in that regard. At the same time, it's important to note that there are a myriad of factors within gross margin ranging from the impact of real time foreign exchange rates to the timing of the hedges that we put on from a sourcing perspective. So we'll update you with more specifics when we get to our Q4 earnings call and gross margin. But suffice it to say we are really pleased with the drivers of gross margin expansion that we've had in this fiscal year. And as we shared we expect to see continued strong margin expansion next year.","Andy Campion","And just quickly on the resale market. We're not focused on that slice of the market. At this time, we don't have anything to add to that. We're fully aware that we're a huge part of creating that market. And that's our focus is how do we deliver the innovation and the creative energy to the product that ultimately is going to create an opportunity there for others. Right now, we're looking at it but we have no plans in terms of partnerships or business strategy in that particular area.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Lauren. And thank you everybody for listening in today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care, bye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. you may now disconnect."],"15568":["Nike, Inc.

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Kelley, and hello everyone, and happy holidays. It's always good to finish strong, and as we reach to close of the second quarter, that's exactly what we have done. Looking at our results, you clearly see that the Nike, Inc. portfolio is a powerful engine for growth.","Here are the highlights. Nike, Inc. revenues increased 8% to $6.4 billion. Gross margins came in better than anticipated, up 140 basis points. SG&A increased 14%, in line with expectations and reflecting strategic investments in our brands and operations and diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.59. As we discussed at our recent investor meeting, at no time in our history have the growth opportunities been greater for Nike.","Our ability to surgically focus our resources and align our efforts across multiple areas of our business allows us to successfully invest in our biggest opportunities for profitable sustainable growth. This approach ensures we are in a strong position to manage the macroeconomic challenges when they arise and seize new opportunities when conditions improve, like now, as we see initial signs of stabilization in select national economies.","Regardless of the macroeconomic conditions, we know we have to earn our leadership position with consumers every single day, and our management team has the experience to focus Nike's resources on what matters most to our consumers. With this focus we continue to increase our potential and ultimately reward our shareholders with long term, sustainable and profitable growth.","As I\u2019ve said before, innovation is at the heart of everything we do. I continue to see expanding opportunities for Nike to reach new heights of product and performance innovation. We are a successful innovator because of our unique partnerships and first and foremost, with the world's greatest athletes whose insights inform our amazing products and services, but also with other partners who help us advance in areas like digital and manufacturing.","Our innovation pipeline has never been deeper or stronger than it is today. Let me highlight three areas of innovation from the quarter. First, the next steps we are taking with our digital initiatives; second, our new advances in apparel; and third, our continuing efforts to revolutionize manufacturing. At Nike, digital is a powerful innovation engine. As we have discussed, our digital ecosystem has three components; consumer connections, ecommerce, and digital products and services. Together these components form our integrated digital strategy, and I continue to be incredibly bullish on digital's potential to drive both innovation and strong growth for years to come.","Looking at our ecommerce business, we delivered another strong quarter with 33% revenue growth, and at less than 15% of our DTC revenues today, our ecommerce business clearly has opportunity to grow. We also expanded our nike.com footprint in the quarter, launching sites in Japan, the world's third largest e-commerce market, and in Brazil further extending our commercial reach for consumers in this key growth market.","In digital products and services, we launched the next generation of the Nike+ FuelBand, the FuelBand SE. With enhanced features and services for our consumer, it reinforces NikeFuel as the global currency of movement. Given digital's tremendous potential, we will continue to invest in innovation and infrastructure to accelerate our digital strategy and capture significant growth for Nike.","Turning to apparel. We delivered some major apparel innovations in the last six months. Most notably with Tech Fleece, Aeroloft and Dri-FIT Knit. And having just come back from Brazil, where World Cup fever, by the way, is already running quite high, I will touch on our World Cup related advance in apparel, and that's our new Brazilian and French football kits.","Working closely with the athletes and the national federations, we designed these kits to reflect each country\u2019s rich football heritage. Insights from our athletes are reflected in the sharp attention to detail and beautiful craftsmanship. Each kit integrates technical performance innovation with team specific design elements. The kits feature Dri-FIT Knit technology, engineered mesh, and laser cut ventilation for better cooling and our lightest Nike Pro base layer ever.","In fact, the uniforms are actually 16% lighter than our 2012 Euro Champ uniforms, and they are made of recycled polyester using the equivalent of 18 recycled water bottles in every kit. In the weeks ahead, we will launch eight more national team kits as all ten Nike teams, by the way, a Nike record, get ready for the World Cup. These new kits are just one example of the unprecedented level of product innovation we have planned for the World Cup. It's an exciting time as we look forward to being a part of the biggest sports event in the world.","Nike's commitment to innovation extends beyond the products we design to how they are manufactured. As we shared at our Investor Meeting, our manufacturing revolution initiatives continue to challenge traditional manufacturing assumptions, so we can maximize our potential to serve athletes and further extend our competitive position.","Take two examples; ColorDry and Flyknit. ColorDry is a revolutionary new fabric dying process that replaces water with recyclable carbon dioxide. Beyond the breakthrough and sustainability, this impressive technology delivers superior results with brighter and more consistent colors in the fabric. With Flyknit, we have continued to leverage its game changing potential. We have extended Flyknit across all of our running footwear platforms at Zoom, Lunar, Free, and the Air Max, and now with the Kobe 9 masterpiece, basketball is part of Flyknit's new frontier.","Kobe's new shoe includes the best of Nike's technologies, not only Flyknit, but also Flywire and Lunarlon . The technologies behind these visually striking shoes provide support and mobility at the same time, and we are not done with Flyknit, not even close, we will continue to expand Flyknit across categories pushing past the boundaries of what people think is possible to deliver incredible products for our consumers. By the way, we just learned of Kobe's injury, and we want to wish him a full and fast recovery.","We are also able to deliver strong results by remaining focused on the consumer and delivering innovative products into a differentiated marketplace. The strength of our portfolio allows us to leverage a focused group of high-energy brands across a globally diverse set of markets and broad range of categories.","Trevor and Don will provide more specifics, but I want to highlight a few examples that reinforce the competitive advantages of our portfolio. First is Converse. With Q2 revenue growth of 14%, Converse continues to deliver great results. Converse is a global brand with a rich history, and we continue to leverage this legacy to drive growth by making Converse relevant to each new generation of consumers around the world.","Next is Western Europe, where revenues grew 18% in the quarter. In early 2012, we decided to reset our strategy in Western Europe. As our second quarter results demonstrate, with the right strategy and the right execution, we can deliver tremendous results, and our futures orders of 26% demonstrate the clear momentum we have in the market, reflecting strong growth across multiple categories.","As we did in Western Europe, we are also executing a reset strategy in China to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. It's still early, but we are very encouraged by what we are seeing with China delivering 8% revenue growth and continued improvement in our key performance metrics.","We have applied the insights gain from executing the category offense in North America, first to Western Europe and now in China. This demonstrates our ability to translate key strategies into locally relevant executions to unlock Nike's growth potential.","In 2014, we look forward to some of the most compelling moments in sports. The Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and of course the World Cup just to name a few. At Nike, events like these are inspiration points for us. These are the moments when we share the stage with the world's greatest athletes and showcase our most innovative products, the products that will go on to transcend these individual events and catalyze new momentum in the marketplace around the world.","With that, here is Trevor to discuss the Nike brand.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark, and happy holidays everyone. At Nike, we are crossing this quarter's finish line exactly where we always aim to be, out in front. We feel great about where we are halfway through the fiscal year, and at our Investor Meeting, I spoke about the vast opportunity ahead for the Nike brand and our focused strategy to realize that opportunity, and our Q2 results reflect those efforts.","The Nike brand delivered strong results even as we continue to make strategic investments for the future. So, on a constant dollar basis, the Nike brand was up 9% for the quarter with growth across all key categories, product types, and geographies. The Nike brand DTC revenue increased 19% driven by 10% comp store growth, new stores, and the strong increase in online sales. And importantly, global features are up a robust 13%.","Our strategies are working and our investments are paying off. And the reason behind this success is clear, a razor sharp focus on the consumer through the category offense. When you combine our full pipeline of innovative products, our strong connection with consumers and our ability to create compelling retail presentations that elevate the marketplace, it's a winning formula for growth.","Now let's look at how that growth formula is playing out for the Nike brand starting with two of our key categories, basketball and football. Let me start with basketball. This quarter is basketball's largest revenue quarter in our long history with the game. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with consumers through two of the most powerful brands in the world, Nike and the Jordan brand.","Today, with basketball truly a global sport, these relationships now span the entire world. This fueled double-digit growth for the category with combined Nike and Jordan Q2 revenues growing in every single geography. We succeed in basketball for a simple reason. Our relationship with the world's best players gives us unrivalled insight that leads to amazing product innovations which fuel our ability to inspire consumers all over the globe.","It\u2019s that constant innovation that strengthens Nike's position as the world's leader in basketball. With that strong sale of KD 6, the LeBron 11 and the CP 3.7, Chris Paul's signature shoe and anticipation is approaching a fever pitch for the Kobe 9 masterpiece, the first basketball shoe to use the Flyknit technology as Mark discussed. It becomes available in February. You can also see that passion coming to life in the marketplace. Retail destinations, like our own DTC stores or our House Of Hoops with Foot Locker continue to be the go-to places for consumers who live and breathe basketball, in the U.S. and increasingly in Europe. These category focus shopping experiences are a great example of our growth strategy. A focus on the consumer and elevation of the marketplace and the delivery of a superior brand experience.","Now let's talk about the world's largest game, global football. Our business in this category continues to accelerate and with the World Cup just six months away, we will strengthen our position as the world's leading football brand. I feel very confident about our position heading into the World Cup. With 10 teams and the best lineup of products that I have ever seen, I can tell you, it will be an incredible time for football and for Nike.","Above all else, the World Cup let's Nike showcase our game changing product innovations on the global stage. We have already launched an incredible number of products over the last six months alone, starting with the Hypervenom, our most successful boot launch ever. We followed that up with the Hi-Vis 4 Silo, which has a beautiful aesthetic [ph] that enhances the player's ability to see teammates quickly and make critical plays when seconds count.","We also launched the new national team kit for France and the five star champion Brazil and there is still so much more to come. This unmatched pace of innovation and brand energy will continue to drive our growth in this category in the years ahead. Last month, I was in Rio when we launched the new Brazilian team kit and I can tell you the excitement was amazing. The full day of celebration was a tangible expression of Brazil's love affair with the sport. It was a true privilege to witness this shared moment of national pride as we unveiled the team kit.","The electric atmosphere also included the Run Rio 10K and a concert on the beach with tens of thousands of people all there. It was an unbelievable experience that only Nike could deliver. After all, Nike is in the business of making big moments bigger. These are the meaningful experiences that makes the connection of the Nike brand personal for consumers and expand our business potential in key growth markets around the world.","Now, let's focus on our key geographies, starting with the emerging markets. Our Q2 revenue in the emerging markets increased by 3%, well below what we would have expected for this key growth geography, while we had strong growth in nearly every territory, these results are largely offset by a specific significant logistical challenge in Mexico.","In June, we transitioned to a third-party logistics provider in Mexico. The transition did not go as smoothly as planned. As a result, shipments from our distribution center to our wholesale partners were delayed leading to a buildup of inventory in the distribution center and a shortage of Nike product in the market. We are working with our third-party logistics provider to resolve the issue and expect to be shipping to demand by the end of Q3.","As we continue to manage through this logistical issue, we are actively engaging our wholesale partners to ensure the appropriate flow of goods into the marketplace. However, we believe, it will take a few quarters for us to fully regain our business at retail and address residual inventory issues.","Despite these short-term challenges, the Nike brand continues to lead in Mexico and the emerging markets overall. Future orders are strong and we remain confident in the long-term potential of this key growth geography.","Now, let's turn to North America, which continues to be a great example of what the Nike brand offense can accomplish worldwide. In Q2, revenues grew 9% and reported EBIT grew a double-digit for the sixth quarter in a row. The category offense remains a powerful strategy for driving growth and profitability in North America.","By offering an unparalleled consumer experience across wholesale, retail and online, we expand both, the market and our share. This approach drives consistent expansion in our largest categories like running and basketball and allows us to aggressively attack our biggest growth opportunities like our young athletes and our women's businesses. Let me take a second to discuss the last two.","In our young athletes business, we are seeing tremendous momentum with double-digit growth in Q2, which we expect to accelerate through new retail concepts with our wholesale partners like the Nike Fly Zone at Kids Foot Locker, and in women's business, as we discussed at our recent Investor Meeting that Nike training club has helped us build meaningful relationships with women.","We have used this knowledge to create a unique consumer experience in our own retail location and I am pleased to report that our result continues to be very strong. Our women's business in the Nike training club outpaces our other retail doors strong double digits, and because of this response, we are expanding beyond the 20 doors we launched in August and plan to have over 40 Nike NTC doors by the end of this fiscal year.","Overall, we continue to see clear opportunity for growth in North America, as we focus on the needs of our consumers and deliver innovative product in compelling retail experiences.","Now, let's look to China. For Q2, revenues increased 5%, driven by strong growth in basketball and running. We are confident of our strategy will set the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long-term and we are making good progress.","First, we are segmenting and differentiating our points of distribution to create more focused consumer experiences and to increase the market capacity. Our leadership position with the consumer lets us offer innovative, performance-led through more compelling retail experiences.","Second, we are sharpening our merchandising strategies. We have recently tested four new concepts in our DTC stores and with our wholesale partners, including new fixtures and a more refined merchandising. Third, we continue to work with our wholesale partners to create a more seamless operating platform, ensuring we get the right product to the right door, at the right time.","While we are still relatively early in the reset process, the results are very encouraging. Comp store sales in our DTC stores were up over 20% in Q2, and our wholesale partners are seeing improvement in those stores that have been re-profiled. In these stores, revenue and sell-through rates are above fleet averages and inventory levels are improving throughout the marketplace. By focusing on increasing retail productivity, we will continue to grow the profit pool and put ourselves in a position for renewed, sustainable growth in China.","Finally in Western Europe, we delivered a great quarter with 15% revenue growth. About two years ago, we made the decision to put a new, more centralized organizational structure in place to better manage key partner relationships and accelerate the implementation of the category offense in Western Europe. That decision is delivering tremendous results.","Key territories such as the UK, Northern Europe and AGS, which comprises Austria, Germany and Switzerland, are showing incredible growth in both revenues and futures. And as is the case elsewhere for the Nike brand, we are leading with performance, showing real strength in Running, Basketball, Football and Women's Training. And we have seen double-digit DTC growth and strong growth with our wholesale partners, driven by new category experiences that bring the power of the Nike brand to life in the marketplace.","Examples include the House of Hoops with Foot Locker in the UK or shop-in-shop executions with Karstadt in Germany or Futbolmania in Spain. As our results demonstrate, the category offense is having a significant impact on our business in Western Europe, and there are still considerable opportunities ahead.","Our results this quarter prove that by focusing on the consumer, we will continue to build our business throughout the many growth opportunities worldwide. The strategies and investments we create that are critical for the strong foundation and we will make the most of those opportunities, now, and in the years to come.","Thanks, and here's Don.","Don Blair","Thanks, Trevor and Happy Holidays, everyone. I would like to begin by highlighting three competitive strengths that underpin our Q2 results and give us confidence in our ability to deliver profitable growth and consistent returns to shareholders.","Let's start with our focus on the consumer. As Trevor discussed, in Q2, the Nike brand delivered growth across each of our geographies, product types and global categories. The key driver of that success is our category offense. We first saw the power of the category offense in North America, which delivered mid-teens revenue and EBIT growth over the last three fiscal years. More recently, the work we have done to implement the strategy globally is accelerating growth in other markets, most recently in Western Europe.","These results underscore our confidence that the category offense will drive profitable growth in other key markets such as China and Brazil. By focusing more sharply on the consumer, we have improved our ability to deliver relevant product innovations, deeper brand connections and compelling retail experiences. The result is incredible topline momentum as well as the product and brand separation that enables premium prices and gross margin expansion.","The second strength is the Nike Inc. portfolio. For a global business spanning 190 countries, there will always be unforeseen macroeconomic and operational factors that affect our business. The breadth of our portfolio, the capabilities of our operating platform and the strength of our balance sheet, give us the tools to manage the impact of these factors on our consolidated results and the depth of our management team gives us the ability to use those tools to deliver sustainable growth in profits and cash flows.","That brings me to the third strength, which is our ongoing commitment to investing for the future and delivering near term profitability. So far this year, we have delivered strong EPS growth and return on invested capital reached a new high increasing nearly six points to over 26%, and in the first six months of the year, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends.","We were able to deliver these returns because we have invested in growth strategies such as product innovation, digital infrastructure and marketplace development both wholesale and DTC and we will continue to invest in those strategies, allocating resources to the highest potential opportunities to maximize returns.","With that introduction, let's recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported Revenues for Nike, Inc. increased 8%. On a currency-neutral basis, both Nike, Inc. and Nike Brand revenues increased 9%, while Converse increased 11%.","Also on a currency-neutral basis, Nike brand futures orders increased 13%, driven by a 10% increase in units and a 3% increase in average selling price. Futures for most of our geographies increased at a double-digit pace, driven by strong demand across multiple categories, including global football, sportswear, running, basketball and women's training.","On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, reflecting weaker international currencies. Second quarter diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.59, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A investments and stiffer FX headwinds.","We have discussed the phasing of SG&A spending on previous calls. As a result of the timing of investments in FY'13 and FY'14, we expected FY'14 EPS growth to be significantly front-loaded in Q1, with lower growth over the balance of the year.","We have also discussed the significant impact of weaker international currencies, which reduce our gross margin and erode the U.S. dollar value of local currency profits. We estimate changes in currency exchange rates reduced our EPS growth by about 10 percentage points for both, the second quarter and year-to-date. As we have noted on previous calls, we expect FX headwinds to continue to pressure balance of year earnings growth.","Gross Margin for the second quarter increased 140 basis points. The favorability was driven by a mix shift to higher margin products and businesses, higher average prices and lower raw material costs as well as the continued strength of our DTC business. These positive factors were partially offset by higher labor costs and continued FX headwinds, due largely to weaker developing market currencies. As expected, Q2 SG&A spending rose at a mid-teens rate, with demand creation increasing 13% and operating overhead up 14%.","Second quarter demand creation spending was higher to support new product launches, including the World Cup kits and FuelBand SE that Mark mentioned, as well as global running events and the ramp up to the Winter Olympics. The increase in operating overhead reflects targeted investments in long-term infrastructure and capabilities, growth in our higher gross margin higher cost DTC business, as well as continued investments in digital.","Other expense net was $13 million for the quarter, driven primarily by a charge related to an adverse legal judgment in Western Europe. The Q2 Effective Tax Rate was 25.1%, a 170-basis point improvement versus the prior year, due primarily to an increase in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rates.","Q2 inventories grew 11%, below the rate of futures growth. Inventories are generally in good shape, though we are continuing to work through pockets of excess inventory created by distribution center issues in Mexico and some slow moving footwear styles in North America, most notably a line of retro training footwear. With our well-developed liquidation channels, we are confident we have the appropriate plans in place to address these situations.","Now, let's take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 9% on both, the reported and constant currency basis, driven by growth across all key categories, including double-digit growth in basketball and women's training.","For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 10%, while apparel rose 9%. DTC revenues grew 12% in the quarter, driven by 7% comp store sales growth. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North America grew 15%, due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 15% on a currency-neutral basis.","As Trevor discussed, we continue to be very pleased with the growth of our business in Western Europe, following our strategic reset in 2012. Growth continues to accelerate at an impressive rate, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Running, Basketball and Women's Training, as well as in our Young Athlete's business.","Territory performance was led by the UK and AGS, with revenues increasing over 20% in each territory. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 18% and EBIT increased 12%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier.","In Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 5%, led by growth in Basketball, Running, Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue in Greater China increased 8% and EBIT increased 5% as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in our DTC business. As both Mark and Trevor indicated in their earlier remarks, we have seen encouraging results in partner stores we have reset with more focused assortments, and Nike DTC stores continue to perform well, with comp store growth over 20% for the third consecutive quarter.","These results are an indication that our strategies are the right ones and we are now working with our retail partners to refine and scale them. As we have said previously, our futures and revenue growth for China won't necessarily show sequential improvement every quarter as we move through this transition. While we work with our retailers to manage the marketplace with greater discipline, year-on-year changes in cancellations, returns and discounts will create volatility in revenue growth and disparities between futures growth and revenue growth. At this point, we continue to expect overall FY14 revenue to be roughly in line with the prior year with single digit revenue growth in Q3 and flat to down revenue in Q4.","Revenue in the emerging markets geography grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by higher revenues in nearly every territory and double-digit growth in the largest territory, Brazil. Although revenues for the geography were above the prior year, the rate of growth was significantly below the rate we would expect, driven primarily by the impact of ongoing supply chain challenges in Mexico. On a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets declined 4% and EBIT decreased 18% due to the adverse impact of FX headwinds on gross margin and translation. The decline in EBIT also reflected increased demand creation investments in advance of the World Cup and higher operating overhead for new retail stores and the launch of nike.com in Brazil.","Converse revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by continued strength in our largest owned markets, North America, the UK and China. On a reported basis, revenue increased 14% while EBIT grew 10%, as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC. We are pleased by the underlying strength of our business and expect that momentum to continue over the balance of the fiscal year.","That said, FX headwinds have had a significant impact on our EPS growth for the first half and we expect to face ongoing pressure from weaker developing market currencies over the balance of the fiscal year. Our updated full year guidance reflects both the year-to-date and forecasted balance of year impact of this FX pressure.","Specifically, we expect revenue for Q3 to grow at a high-single digit to low-double digit rate and Q4 to grow at a low double-digit rate, reflecting the weighting of futures orders to the back half of the futures window. For the full year, we expect revenue to grow at a high-single to low-double digit rate. Gross margin for the first half of the fiscal year exceeded our expectations as we saw a mix shift to higher margin products, higher average selling prices and continued strength in our DTC business.","While we expect these factors will continue to drive margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, we will be facing new pressures as raw material costs shift from tailwinds to headwinds and we increase discounts to clear pockets of excess inventory. We also expect to face continued pressure from labor costs and foreign exchange. As a result, we expect gross margin to expand by about 25 basis points in each of Q3 and Q4. For full year FY'14, we now expect gross margin expansion of approximately 75 basis points.","For Q3, we expect total SG&A to grow at a high-teen's rate, driven by demand creation growth of over 20%, reflecting phasing of spending in support of key sporting events, as well as comparisons to a relatively lower level of spending in the third quarter of FY'13.","We expect operating overhead to grow at a high-teen's rate in Q3, reflecting ongoing investments in strategic initiatives. For the full year, we now expect SG&A will grow at a low-teen's rate. For FY'14, we continue to expect the effective tax rate will be about 25%.","As Mark said at the top of the call, we feel great about the strong results we delivered in the first half of the year. As we look ahead to the second half of FY'14, we will continue to make strategic investments to drive long-term growth, even as we capitalize on those investments we have already made to deliver appropriate returns for our shareholders in the near-term.","We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question come from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks, guys. I appreciate all the information, very helpful. I was wondering if you could elaborate, you talked a lot about the gross margin dynamic, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the - it sounds like there's a mix shift to more premium products higher price points, and how do you think about the gross margin dynamics long-term, especially as you layer in some of these manufacturing revolution initiatives. Thanks.","Mark Parker","Well, first I would start with the quarter. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, we did see a lot of things go right in Q2. We are continuing to see higher average selling prices and that's driven by both, price increases we have taken as well as very strong growth in the premium end of both the footwear and the apparel product lines; and the revenue mix, as I said, has definitely shifted to higher margin pieces of business. For example, the growth in Western Europe as well as growth in performance basketball and DTC are all positive mix shifts for us.","We also had some lower discounts in Q2, as we were clearing a lot of inventory in China in this quarter last year, so all very positive things and we also had a bit of a tailwind from raw material costs, so all of those were upsides in the quarter and that offset some of the FX headwinds and the higher labor costs.","As we talked about on the prepared remarks, I do think that most of those pluses are going to be positive factors over the balance of the year and certainly the strategies around looking at our pricing each season and making sure that we are taking the benefits from the differentiation of our products and the improved retail presentation that's clearly part of the strategy and certainly long-term.","We are very focused on the premium aspects of our brand and our product lines, and as we bring new innovations to the market, we are definitely trying to use those to help move margins higher. So, as we think about a lot of the long-term things that we do control, we are really focused on long-term expansion in gross margin.","Obviously, there's a lot of factors out there that we don't control and so on the long-term we obviously aim to offset things like currencies and increase labor costs, and we are confident that the strength of our brand and our products lets us do that over the long-term.","Don Blair","Let's take a quarter-to-quarter look obviously at pricing opportunities that will continue to be an important lever here. We are looking at, as you asked about the manufacturing innovations, very committed to that. We are actually accelerating our innovation agenda there and confident that we can take some bigger steps, particularly as we scale some of these innovations to help offset some of those input cost headwinds, so it's a balancing act as always.","Frankly, I think we are in a great position, innovation pipeline is incredibly strong, new products coming in at some premium price points that I think are incredibly compelling, so all that bodes well, I think, to help us on that margin line.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Don Blair","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America","Thanks, guys. A great quarter. Just two questions. Just first to follow-up on -- a little bit of follow-up on Omar's question. Your futures orders, I think you said 10% unit growth to get to the 13%. Can you tell us what that would look like, the split for North America, ASP versus unit growth? Then maybe with the unit growth so high, I don't think the industry is growing that high globally in units, and can you talk about and I don't think I am seeing same-store sales growth like that for some of your largest customers, can you maybe help us understand where this new distribution is coming from the fastest?","Then the second question was just on China. I am hearing a 20% comp in your own DTC and some of the comments on the partner stores that you have done some work on, and then the total revenues, you are being cautious on, maybe just a little more help in understanding when you could return to a more stable, secular, double-digit growth in China? Thanks.","Don Blair","Okay. So let's just start with the first question about futures. You are correct that that 13% futures growth is 10% on units and 3% on average selling price. We are seeing that trend pretty consistently around the world where we have got expansion in average selling price, which as we said earlier and Mark reiterated was driven by pricing opportunities as well as shifting of mix to premium products, so we are seeing that pattern around the world. I would rather not get into trying to reconcile individual geography numbers at this point, but it is a pretty consistent pattern.","As far as the relative growth rates, I mean, in our futures numbers are, first of all, embedded the DTC demand as well. So that DTC growth that we are seeing, both online as well as comp store numbers is driving some of that growth. Then similarly, if you look at our wholesale customers, a lot of them have online businesses as well which are driving accelerated growth, so we feel really good about the momentum we have got in the marketplace.","We are certainly outpacing the growth of our key accounts because we are taking share in those accounts. So as we look at the growth trends, we feel really good about how the category offense is driving that sustainable growth around the world. So with respect to China, let me hand it off to Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, on China, as we said in the prepared remarks, we feel really like we are making great progress around our reset strategy. We are obviously very encouraged by the results of our Q2, and we are seeing continued improvement in our key performance metrics. We kind of pointed out a couple of things. Obviously we talked about DTC -- the comp store is actually 20%, and we are seeing revenue and sell-through in our re-profiled doors outpacing the fleet averages.","Then also, we are seeing an improvement in the inventory level that are in the marketplace. So all those things are really pointing in the right direction. However, one thing that we have said, I think pretty consistently, is that we won't expect it to be a linear path to growth, so when we talk about futures being 1%, we feel good about that because, again, we are continuing to get all the elements of the business back together.","Now in terms of a specific time, we can't really say a specific time. What we can say is that we feel great about the long-term potential of the marketplace. We feel that we have a really strong brand, and we are continuing to position the brand in the right way and we are segmenting the market in the right way and the merchandising strategies we are doing are all working, so it's more a matter of time but I can't put out an exact moment and say its then but, again, we feel very confident about the future.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America","So it's fair to say that it's still a situation that I think you commented on the past that your partners, are maybe ordering more from you than you are currently willing to ship to them in China?","Trevor Edwards","I am not sure I want to address relative conversations we might have with our consumers, Robby, but I think the key aspect of what we are doing in China here is we are really focused on sustainable productive retail spaces and nothing succeeds like success. When these new concepts and these new merchandising assortments are selling the way they are then our partners are very, very eager to get on that path.","Mark Parker","We are taking a very disciplined approach here and maintaining that as we scale.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America","Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane - Citi","Thanks. Good afternoon. My first question is around the higher ASPs, and specifically in apparel, can you talk a little bit about if you are raising prices on existing apparel platforms or is it more on the new technology you spoke about earlier in the call today?","Mark Parker","Yes. It's actually a combination of both. What we are continuing to do in our apparel business, and certainly we have done it recently with the new Tech Pack launch that we did for sportswear. It is a great example of bringing innovation to what can some likely seem as a dormant category, so we were able to bring great innovation there.","Obviously, as we talk about here getting paid for that work is a really important piece, so we are actually driving, obviously higher prices as well as making sure that it's delivering. The Aeroloft is another example as well as Dri-Fit Knit, so you are seeing across the board we are bringing innovation into the marketplace and using that as an opportunity to make sure that consumer is getting the right value, because we bring great innovation into it and our focus certainly has been around our sportswear business making sure that we have the premium segment which we call the Red Label, which is actually growing at a really rapid rate right now, really around the world, we are seeing that consistently.","All those things are pointing to our ability to take premium price based on the strength of our brand as well as the strength of the technology that we put in place, and clearly the consumer is seeing great value from that.","Kate McShane - Citi","Okay. Great. Thank you. My second question with regards to Flyknit and the supply chain, I know it's a multiyear strategy to build this out, but can you walk us through how you are progressing with your investment in getting the Flyknit supply chain more robust and what is still needs to be done?","Mark Parker","Yes. Actually, we have been very aggressive in our investment in scaling Flyknit production capacity, namely, with the couple of major partners here. I actually feels quite good about the pace that we are moving.","We are actually moving it to more technical executions of Flyknit 2, which take actually more time from a production and a design engineering standpoint, very aggressive in terms of how we are innovating using this technology, so that creates more challenges, if you will, all the way through the manufacturing process, but really feel good about where we are.","As I said earlier, we have it scaled across many of the running, actually all of the running platforms. We have it in sportswear, in training, just introduced in basketball and I think you will see Flyknit continue to be a really important technology force as we scale and leverage across even more categories going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my call. Firstly, I just want to touch on Western Europe. You have shown very nice improvement there and I guess more specifically on the footwear side than on apparel, so I was just curious maybe just talk about your progress in Europe on the apparel segment of the business. How we should think about that?","Also, unless I might have missed it, I don't know if you mentioned global running. If it was up, by how much? Then the last question I just had for, Don, for you. Just maybe if you could rank between when you think about gross margin in the second half of the year, 25 basis points in the back half, maybe rank between FX, some of the inventory you need to cleanup, input costs, in terms of where the bigger heavyweights or where the biggest deltas are occurring? Thanks.","Don Blair","Okay. On Western Europe, again, we saw great results for Western Europe as we talked about, 15% revenue growth. We are actually seeing that both, across footwear and apparel, so both of those are actually growing with strong double-digits.","The futures growth, it was also 23%, which has shown continued momentum across multiple categories. One of the keys around Europe and it really goes back to what Mark spoke about earlier, which is we went in and did a strategic reset in Europe, where we really focused on key accounts as well as centralizing our approach to those key accounts, as well as accelerating the category offense. So what we are seeing is, we are seeing really great growth around performance.","We are seeing growth in both footwear and apparel. We are seeing growth in our sportswear and our performance businesses, with actually performance leading the way. So we are seeing great growth in Running, Basketball, Football, and Women's Training. We have talked before about the success we have been having actually in Football. So across the board, we would say that we are gaining strength in the marketplace and delivering even greater separation in our footwear position in Europe.","We truly believe it's part of the total offense that we have got in place in Western Europe. So we are very confident about where we are there and we would say the category offense is actually paying great dividends. Now around Running we are actually seeing, again, we didn't talk about Running this time and we see again, we feel great about the results where we are seeing a continued strong growth in both revenues and futures and it's really a case of the total offense that they are playing in which is both footwear and apparel across multiple geographies.","Obviously it's been a key driver for North America for the period but we are actually seeing growth really across all the geographies going forward and we feel very confident about the innovation pipeline that we have coming in Running. So all those things said, again, we continue to feel really good about our position in Running and we see further opportunity to continue to grow in the marketplace, as we work specifically with our customers on giving new expressions to the Running business.","Mark Parker","And quickly, your question on gross margin. The largest swing between where we were in the second quarter and what we are now seeing for the third and the fourth quarters is that move from tailwind to headwind on materials and that is something that obviously relates to the spike we saw several years back in materials, which has been ebbed. We have now gotten back essentially to stabilization and we see that the second half of the year as that's starting to move into a headwind situation. Next would be the swing in discounts from favorable year-on-year to a little bit higher as we clear some pockets of inventory and then FX would be the third.","Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial","Okay. All right. Thank you very much and all the best on the Holidays.","Kelley Hall","Thank you.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Next question, operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good afternoon.","Kelley Hall","Hi, Jay.","Mark Parker","Hi, Jay.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","Trevor, you said Nike is in the business of making big moments bigger. That's a fascinating statement. Can you talk about that statement as it relates to the Winter Olympics? What sports and athletes, products and marketing strategies will help make that big moment even bigger?","Trevor Edwards","Obviously, thanks for that question and I personally like the words about we make big moments even bigger. What we mean by that is it is our job as a brand and we have always seen at this way to continue to bring excitement to the marketplace to give consumers new opportunity to connect with our brand to bring innovative products into the marketplace and also to elevate how they connect at retail. So, we are very excited about the Winter Olympics as we are preparing for the games. We are still the sports brand of choice in Russia and in Eastern Europe and it's a great opportunity for us to continue to bring inspiration and innovation to the athletes as well as to broader consumers. So at this moment a lot of our focus is on just making sure we have the right products in the pipeline and we are pretty much lined up for that and we feel really good about lineup for Sochi. Interestingly as we mentioned too, we also have the World Cup coming up, which is a very big opportunity for us to bring even more greater innovation into the marketplace.","Don Blair","So just to hit a couple of high points here. We do sponsor the Ice Hockey Federations, and so you will see certainly Nike on the ice. We have certainly got some connections into the Action Sports piece. And as Trevor said, we have got some great connection points with our business in Russia, which has been a fantastic success story for us this year. Our business there is really growing very rapidly and the Olympics are a great ignition point for that marketplace.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley","Right, and thanks. Don, if I ask you one more question. Just on the guidance, you were very clear that FX, input cost, labor cost or headwinds, but it looks like the full-year guidance is up a little bit from where we were last quarter. Can you talk about how much the guidance has just flowed through from what we saw this quarter and how much is based on an outlook that maybe a little bit higher for the second half of the year than you had before?","Don Blair","The guidance that we gave is actually line-by-line, you have to look at all the lines. Revenue, we have seen fantastic momentum and so there is maybe a touch more optimism on the revenue line for the full year. We have also seen more optimism on the spending or on the gross margin side.","Spending has re-phased over the course of the year, so when you look at the year holistically, we have got a lot of puts and takes on the lines but the underlying change really is that currency headwind.","The impact in the first half was about 10 points of EPS growth. You didn't see all of that because of the way our SG&A phasing played out, but that is definitely what's really driving changes in the full year outlook is really the carryover of that from the first half.","Kelley Hall","Operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone. Don, I am looking for if you will a little more clarification on the change in the SG&A guidance. Given that currency is a bigger headwind on the top line, one would think there would be give back there at the SG&A line. Am I thinking about that incorrectly?","Don Blair","It all depends on where it is around the world, so the major changes in currency are developing market currencies, which would be markets like Russia, Brazil, Mexico, some of the businesses where we have fairly businesses and those currencies have been hit pretty hard.","That's not where a lot of our investment dollars go. Quite a bit of the investments we are making around DTC are in developed markets and a lot of investments that we make in innovation are actually right here in the U.S.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Got you. Okay. Then growth in the Converse brand continues to impress. Can you speak to some of the efforts to diversify the business and the contribution to growth from franchises other than Chuck Taylor's?","Mark Parker","Actually, I will jump in. This is Mark. We have introduced this last quarter and it is just beginning of a huge commitment to diversify the footwear business beyond the Chuck Taylor All Star and that's the cons footwear part of the line, feel good about the initial start there. That will ramp up as a bigger priority and a bigger scale play over the next fiscal year or two.","Apparel, we are just in the infancy stages there, really focused on the specific segments of the market, specifically tees and fleece to start and feel really good about where we are in the upside opportunity there as well. Then we see some investments in DTC, e-commerce also yielding some growth for us as well.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Great. Thank you very much.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Great. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you joining the call and have happy holidays. We will talk to you next year.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nike's fourth quarter and fiscal year '13 results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release which was issued about an hour ago and at our website investors.nikeinc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Charlie Denson, President of the Nike Brand and finally you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results.","Following their prepare remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thank you for your help with this.","I would now like to turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Kelley. As you know, last week we announced strategic management changes for our organization. Chief among them is the decision by Charlie Denson to move on from his role with Nike. Yes, he leaves some huge shoes to fill but luckily that's the business we are in, filling shoes. More on that in a minute.","First, a bit of context on our leadership team going forward. I won't go through all the names here, but many of them are people you already know. Even more important, they know Nike, and they know each other. They bring tremendous passion, energy and chemistry to our future, and some people will be providing leverage and continuity from their existing positions while others will be assuming new roles.","These changes reflect our successes and our biggest opportunities and they represent five very specific and ongoing commitments. Number one, to accelerate our innovation agenda. Two, to elevate design. Three, optimize our category and go-to-market strategies. Four, to integrate product creation and merchandising to create greater continuity from design all the way through the retail, and five to sharpen our focus on supply chain and manufacturing improvements.","We spend a lot of time developing our leadership talent and that's something that never stops. It allows us to adapt and evolve our competitive offence and that's what you can expect as this team takes Nike into the future.","Now, the fiscal year 2013, which was an important year for Nike and our industry. New innovations in technologies continue to accelerate the pace of change in the industry and our business, and we are focused on leading on changes. In fiscal year '13, that created greater differentiation and separation for Nike, and that's key to expanding our leadership position.","In fiscal '13, Nike, Inc, revenues grew 8% to over $25 billion. It's interesting, it took us 18 years to get to our first $2 billion in revenue and we added about that much in just the last 12 months.","Gross margins were up slightly for the year in a challenging macroeconomic environment. And earnings per share grew 11% to $2.69. So, how do we do that? While we delivered a relentless flow of innovation consumers across categories that generated tremendous commercial success and we have a pipeline full and staged for the future.","We leveraged and drew inspiration from the never-ending energy of sports around the world. The Olympics, the Euro Champs, the DCs and Superbowl, March Madness and the NBA Playoffs. These are among the moments that inspire Nike to create and display our best work and we connect with the best athletes and teams to do that.","We also collaborated with retail partners to expand capacity in the marketplace and our own DTC business is hitting on all cylinders that's in-line factory stores and online. Those two things together are driving the marketplace transformation we talk so much about. In short, our brand, our products and our distribution have never been stronger.","We also continue to get better and better at financial management and operational discipline, which helps us leverage our portfolio to deliver strong results for Nike, Inc, in total. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we are well positioned to capture more growth in developed and developing markets and deliver more value to shareholders today and over the long-term.","I talk a lot about the power of our portfolio, and it starts with the focused group of powerful brands that have deep connections with consumers. In fiscal '13, revenue for our continuing other businesses, and that means Converse, Nike Golf and Hurley, grew 9% to $2.5 billion, while EBIT grew at twice the rate of revenue.","At Converse, fiscal year '13 was paced by a strong growth in key international markets with revenues up double digits in the recently converted markets of China and the U.K. Franchise product like Chuck Taylor delivered record sales again. And the brand's strong positions, style and music continues to connect with young consumers around the world. This helped Converse deliver $1.4 billion in reported revenue for the year.","Nike Golf also delivered a strong year with revenues up 9% to nearly $800 million, powered by the launch of innovative products like the Covert Clubs, Lunar Control in footwear and the new TW '13 shoe. Revenues at Hurley grew 5%, actually outpacing the action sports industry.","In fiscal '13, we also divested Cole Haan and Umbro. It was the right decision enabling us to focus our capital and our leadership talent on our highest potential growth opportunities. Of course the most powerful part of our portfolio is the Nike brand where revenues grew 9% to a record $23 billion for the year.","The two big market stories continue to be China and North America. But China first, where we continue to drive our strategy to reposition this market for sustainable and profitable growth. As we have said, the reset required discipline and patience. The race from China is a marathon. Its not a sprint. We are set up for the long run.","We own a premium brand position and we partner with the most inspiring athletes. We are the leader in performance innovation and we are making progress reducing inventory levels at retail and taking steps to increase the productivity of retail sales. Our path forward in China is clear. Let's create a pull market fueled by innovative products, compelling and productive retail and strong brand connections with consumers. That's the core of our success around the world and it is setting us up for the next wave of growth in China.","In North America, revenue in fiscal '13 exceeded $10 billion as we added $1.5 billion of new revenue in this geography alone. That growth was broad based across all product types in our wholesale and DTC business and across nearly all key Nike brand categories. It was an extraordinarily profitable growth as EBIT for the geography grew 25% to $2.5 billion. Our performance in North America shows the real power of our category offense and our strategy of innovative products, strong brand connections and premium distribution is equally powerful and relevant around the world.","We had many global competitive advantages but the most important one is innovation. It inspires us and it distinguishes us as a company. Innovation drives everything at Nike. It gives us new technologies and materials, helps us create iconic products and services that people want and the game changers they can't even imagine.","Innovation athletes and consumers. It shatters the traditional methods of manufacturing and distribution and bridges the physical and digital worlds of sport. Innovation makes Nike more competitive, more sustainable and profitable.","I believe there is more opportunity in the world and more capability inside Nike than ever before and that's why we are accelerating our innovation agenda. I call it innovation squared where we can deliver more new ideas and solutions faster than ever before. We are leveraging those across our sport categories, geographies and brands. Amazing things are in the market right now from Nike and even more in the pipeline. Though as we look into fiscal '14, you can certainly expect us to train more and compete harder than anybody else. We are athletes and that's what we do.","We are set to grow to explore, refine and leverage our leadership position. We have scale, power and passion and we are not shy about using them to support the athlete, and by the way, that means every athlete, to push ourselves and our partners to connect more deeply with consumers and to grow this company and deliver more value to shareholders.","Finally, on a more personal note, it's important to me to take a minute to thank two very special people. That's Charlie Denson and Gary DeStefano who have decided to retire after more than 30 years with Nike. Gary played a key role in leading our sales organization around the world, led teams in Asia-Pacific and the U.S., and for six year as leader of our geography teams grow our brand and business around the world. Gary's impacts on Nike over the past 30 years had been significant and I thank him for all he's done.","I have worked closely with Charlie Denson during most of his 34 years with Nike, and as you know almost daily over the last 10 years, and I can tell you, you get to know somebody pretty well doing that. And what I know about Charlie is that he is a brilliant and [operable] man, easy to respect and easy to like, obsessed with sports and the athlete and he has incredible passion for the brand and that's all a great combination. Even more important, Charlie showed the next-generation what it takes and what it means to be a Nike leader, and we go into the future stronger and more focused, thanks in large part to the example Charlie set over the last three decades. Charlie is more than a colleague, He's a friend, a mentor and will always be part of the Nike family.","So, thanks everybody. And now, for the last time, here's Charlie to take you through the Nike brand.","Charlie Denson","Thanks, Mark. That was nice. That was greatly appreciated. Okay. Well, Q4 marked a strong finish to a record year for the Nike Brand. A lot of it has to do with the power of our category offence, but there are multiple dimensions in addition to category. We are able to push and pull levers across the business and around the world to capture growth. Today, I want to focus on two of the most powerful levers in our portfolio, geographies and key categories. In the end, it's all about choices.","Focusing on the biggest, most promising opportunities for the Nike brand and our choices helped deliver very good fiscal '13. On a constant dollar basis, the Nike brand revenue was up 8% for the quarter and 11% for the year. For fiscal year 2013, we grew in every geography except Greater China, and across all of our key categories. Nike brand DTC revenue increased 24% for the year. With online sales, up over 30%, and global futures grew 8%.","The MVP for the quarter and the year really had to be North America. Fiscal year '13 was our first $10 billion year for North America, $10.4 billion to be exact. That brings incremental revenue over the last three years to $3.7 billion. North America EBIT grew 25%. Their revenue grew 18% and their inventory grew only 13%. At Nike when profits grow faster than revenue and revenue grows faster than inventory, we call that the financial Triple Crown. And for fiscal 2013, most key categories grew at a double-digit rate as did footwear apparel and equipment. So, clearly, we are up to our game in products, distribution and how we connect with consumers.","North America DTC delivered a record year for factory stores, in-line stores and online. Revenue increased 20% to over $2.5 billion with double-digit comps in both, our in-line and factory concepts. E-commerce was up over 30%, and our work with our wholesale partners expanded the potential of the market and increased profitability, so a better year for North America. Our biggest and most penetrated market. It's the best example of what is possible and illustrates the potential we have around the world. That said, we take nothing for granted in North America or any market for that matter. That's why we are continually committed to innovative product, strong brand connections and premium distribution to continue to create short and long-term growth for the Nike brand.","Okay. Let's talk a little bit about China. Mark mentioned and has mentioned many times, discipline and patience. Those are crucial to our growth path going forward. Our job is to build strong consumer connections and to increase market capacity to fuel long-term growth. Delivering innovative product, creating differentiation in the marketplace and improving profitability and productivity at retail, are the keys to our long term success in the China marketplace.","Specifically on retail productivity, we are working with our partners to improve supply chain efficiency, accelerate product flow and elevate store merchandising. That improves the experience for consumers, increases store productivity and leads to profitable growth for the retailer and for Nike. We have seen the success of this work in our Nike DTC stores and those partner doors that have been refitted with more focus to performance and product stories.","We are also seeing very strong performance in our new category doors. We opened our first running store and basketball store in fiscal year '13 with strong initial results. Overall, comp growth at our own inline and factory stores is up double digits. We also have initial executions with our retail partners open as well. We are seeing some promising initial results. These are all signs that our strategy is working. So we will continue to go deeper with the consumer, expand our performance and leadership position and elevate and expand the retail experience for the consumer and our partners.","At the middle of all this is the strength of the Nike brand. As the brand leader in this market, we are able to bring an energy and presence nobody else can match. You are going to see that again this summer when LeBron, Kobe and Kevin Durant for Nike as well as Carmelo, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook representing brand Jordan head back to China. If anything can match the excitement of Game 7, it's the reaction these guys get from the young Chinese athletes. We have the roadmap to growth. The progress we have made to date confirms that and we are committed to the long term solutions and potential in this amazing market.","Okay, real quick, what's in Europe. Delivering some good results, especially in the North. We are expanding our number one footwear position in the region led by running and we are gaining share in football across the continent. Inventories are in good shape with European units essentially flat to prior year.","In our Emerging Markets geography, revenue is up 16% on the year and knocking on the door $4 billion in revenue. We see this geography continuing to supply a strong growth story. One of the biggest contributing factors will be the energy coming out of Brazil with World Cup followed by the Rio Olympics.","So lets move over to the category side. Since I am handing out MVP awards, I have to give one to running. For the second year in a row, both running footwear and apparel grew in every single geography. That momentum continues as we head into fiscal year '14 with futures growing at a double digit rate. Running is a tremendous success story for Nike. Has been for more than 40 years.","We lead in running with innovative products like Nike Air, Lunar, Flyknit, Free and Dri-FIT fabrications. All game changers and examples of our commitment to the athlete. We build running on strong brand connections like the Nike Women Half Marathon in Washington DC which sold out in a matter of hours. Or through Nike Plus which now has over 18 million members. We build running on premium distribution through our own stores and online and partnerships like the Track Club with Finish Line and key running specialty distribution.","Our commitment to serving the runner generated 18% constant dollar growth in fiscal year '13 exceeding $4 billion in annual revenue. We have delivered 14 consecutive quarters of double digit growth, broad based growth from both men and women. Running is a big part of the momentum we are creating in the women's business which was very strong in Q4. We have a hybrid strategy in women's that combines running, training and sportswear. It's the cross category version of our Amplify Sport strategy and we have tremendous upside here especially in sportswear.","Then, there is basketball. I would say, a co-MVP. Another category of worldwide leadership. March madness, the NBA, the Olympics, LeBron, Kevin, Kobe, in leagues or on the playground. Wherever the game is played with passion Nike and brand Jordan are there. a quick example for Q4. We released the LeBron 10 MVP shoe for LeBron's fourth MVP in five years. It sold through immediately.","He is the youngest player ever to win it four times. By the way, rounding off the top five, MVP vote getters were Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Kobe Bryant. A Nike Jordan sweep or maybe as Mars Blackmon once said, It's Gotta Be The Shoes!","Brand Jordan is selling 3X more today than when MJ was planned. That's the power of the brand at work. We are seeing even more upside as we continue to leverage our Amplify Sport model to increase revenue across both footwear and apparel around the world. This is truly becoming a global brand. As FY'13 revenues increased at a double digit pace in all of our Nike brand geographies. Nike basketball plus Jordan finished the year up 22% on a currency-neutral basis.","Okay. The last category, Global Football. We are the best football brand in the world, bar none. In boots, cleat technology, upper design, lightweight uniforms or protection from the ground up, we are the innovation leader in the world's biggest game. We get our insights from the best players and teams in the world.","Fifteen years ago, we launched the Mercurial boot, and it changed the game forever. Lighter, more versatile and more beautiful. We changed the game again in FY'13 with the new Mercurial and the amazing Hypervenom. We had Nike teams in five different countries working on this boot. Neymar from Brazil laced it up and scored three goals in three games. That's what happens when the best wear the best. But the real story isn't what we did in FY'13. It's what's coming for World Cup. It's absolutely incredible and that's all I am going to say about that for now.","Q4 in fiscal 2013 showed a lot of what Nike is capable of, but not all of it. Not by a long shot. Mark talked about doubling down on our innovation agenda, what he calls innovation squared. That will prove even more valuable as we head into FY'14 and beyond. We are looking at the Winter Olympics, the Super Bowl the World Cup in Brazil. It's moments like those on the world stage and the countless moments of athletes in every town and city in between that brings out our best. It is what fuels our passion and our potential.","Finally, a couple of thoughts on this retirement thing. People have asked me, why would I retire. Well, I guess the easiest way to answer that is because I can. But honestly, it's a good time to focus on a different path forward for me and my family and the timing is great for this type of transition. The brand is stronger than it's ever been, financially and strategically. The company is in good hands with Mark and the new leadership, incredibly talented and focused and really in line with where Nike is headed, We've done a good job building our bench for the long-term, so all is good here. It's also important for me to thank all of you that have been with us over the years for your interest and insights as we have grown this great company. 52 calls, almost as good as Joe DiMaggio, but that's a long time to listen to me talk.","And, finally, I want to thank Don, Kelley, the entire organization for their leadership and commitment to delivering our long-term goals of shareholder value. To, Mark, a great partner, a great leader and most importantly a great friend, and certainly to Phil for making it all possible. It's been a great ride and a ton of fun.","Here is Don.","Don Blair","Thanks, Charlie. You know I've followed Charlie on these conference calls for well over a decade and worked with him for nearly 14 years. As CFO of Nike, I could not have had a better partner. Charlie understands how all of the dimensions and aspects of our business fit together and he knows how to work the levers. And, while he claims he is not an expert on financial management, he has the most important skill of all. He knows how to create value for our shareholders and has done so year-after-year. That's a great legacy, but probably not the most important one. I think Charlie's greatest legacy will be the people he's developed and inspired over the years and I count myself among them.","Charlie, thank you for 14 years of partnership and the great team you will be leaving behind.","Here at Nike, we have a list of 11 guiding principles we call our maxims. The maxims define our approach to the business as we strive to reach Nike's full potential. I think there are three maxims that characterize our FY'13 performance and speak to our ability to create shareholder value into the future. The first is, Nike is a company. More specifically, Nike is a growth company made up of a broad portfolio of businesses. The diversity and flexibility of the Nike, Inc. portfolio helps us manage risk and allows us to leverage our strengths at scale, driving the kind of growth in revenues, earnings and cash flow we are announcing today.","The second maxim states, we are on the offense, always. This Maxim describes how we drive to create the future rather than simply respond to it. We know that succeeding today isn't enough. We need to continue to raise our game if we are to succeed in the future. That means, we must invest in deeper consumer connections, product and manufacturing innovation and premium retail experiences as well as the operational capabilities to support them.","Over the last three years, we have significantly ramped up our investments in these areas. As Mark often says, we believe our opportunities are unlimited, but we realize our resources are not. Therefore, we will continue to make disciplined investments, human and financial, in the highest potential growth opportunities, while continuously editing and redeploying resources from the less attractive ones. That's how we're able to invest in the future while delivering profitable growth in the near-term.","Today's final maxim is a personal favorite of mine, master the fundamentals. Nike is a global company doing business in an increasing complex and volatile environment. Yet we are consistently able to deliver results at the highest level. That's because our strategies are focused and effective, our leadership teams are deep and capable and our financial strength is unmatched in the industry.","Three maxims, taken together, highlight the focus and discipline that enabled us to deliver the fourth quarter and full year results I will share with you now.","For our continuing operations, full year revenue for Nike, Inc. reached $25.3 billion, up 8% as reported and up 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenue increased 7% on a reported basis and 9% currency neutral. On both a reported and currency-neutral basis, Nike brand futures orders advanced 8%, led by double digit growth in North America, Emerging Markets and Central & Eastern Europe.","Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 27% to $0.76, bringing full year EPS to $2.69, up 11% versus the prior year. The Q4 increase was driven by revenue growth, gross margin","expansion and lower demand creation compared to higher event driven spending last year. We also benefited from a lower tax rate and share count in this year's Q4.","Gross margin for the fourth quarter increased 110 basis points and was up slightly for the full year. Our Q4 results reflect the benefits of higher selling prices and easing material costs, partially offset by the ongoing impact of labor cost inflation, higher discounts, particularly in China and FX headwinds primarily due to weaker developing market currencies. In addition, about 70 basis points of the Q4 improvement reflected unusual costs in last year's Q4 for digital R&D and a one-time customs assessment.","Gross margin for the quarter was better than we guided, largely due to a shift in supply chain investments from Q4 to Q1 FY'14, as well as stronger performance from our other businesses.","Q4 demand creation spend was 13% below last year's fourth quarter, which included heavy investments in the Euro Champs, Olympics and NFL launch.","Operating overhead grew 19% for the quarter due to expansion of our DTC business as well as continued investments to support innovation and growth initiatives, particularly digital.","The Q4 effective tax rate was 22.8%, better than we expected, due largely to a reduction in tax reserves related to foreign operations. Our full year tax rate was 24.7%, roughly in line with the prior year.","Year-end inventory grew 7%, below the rate of futures growth. Inventory on our books is in good shape overall, with the percentage of closeout inventory at historically low levels.","Our balance sheet continues to be very strong, with $6 billion of cash and short term investments on the books at year-end. FY'13 ROIC reached 23.8% and we delivered $2.4 billion of free cash flow, both significant increases versus FY'12 and driven by improvements in working capital productivity.","During the quarter, we raised $1 billion dollars in long term debt at very low interest rates, giving us the flexibility to finance our investments in the business while continuing to increase cash returns to shareholders.","Now let's take a look at our performance by segment, starting with North America. As Mark and Charlie both indicated, North America delivered an extraordinary year, as revenues reached $10.4 billion, up 18% versus FY'12. Q4 revenues increased 12%, driven by strong growth across every category led by basketball, men's training sportswear and running.","For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 8% while apparel and equipment each grew over 20%. Direct to consumer revenues grew 16% in Q4, as comp store sales increased 11%, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth for Nike-owned stores in North America.","Q4 EBIT for North America grew 29% due to robust revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. In Western Europe, Q4 revenues were essentially flat on a currency-neutral basis in comparison to very strong sales in advance of the Euro Champs and Olympics last year. Lower revenues in Italy and Iberia, both down over 20% for the quarter were offset by double-digit growth in our AGS Territory. That's Austria, Germany and Switzerland, and nearly 40% growth in direct to consumer revenues.","On a category basis, running grew double-digits and our basketball business more than doubled. Growth in those two categories offset lower sales in our other key categories. On a reported basis, Q4 revenues for Western Europe declined 1%, while EBIT increased 2% driven by higher gross margin. Central and Eastern Europe continued to deliver strong results in Q4. Revenues increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by strong growth in Turkey and Russia. The geography reported double-digit revenue growth for every category except sportswear and action sports, which declined.","On a reported basis, Q4 revenues for CEE grew 9%, and EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by lower demand creation spending in comparison to last year's event-driven investments.","In Greater China, currency-neutral revenue declined 1% in Q4, as double-digit growth in performance running and basket ball was offset by declines in other categories, primarily sports. On a reported basis, Q4 revenue in Greater China was flat while EBIT decreased 2%.","As we've discussed on previous calls, we are repositioning our business in China for sustainable profitable growth, and most critical step in returning this market to healthy growth is creating more compelling, productive and profitable retail marketplace.","As Charlie noted, we are seeing some encouraging signs for our largest retail partners, overall comp store sales are growing and inventories are declining. Nevertheless, we still have a lot of work to do. As we do that work, our reported results for China won't always follow a smooth trajectory and it's difficult to predict how quickly will return to sustained growth.","While China's futures' orders for the next six months are in line with last year, we expect revenues for the first half of the fiscal year will be below last year as we continue to manage the amount of product we ship into the market. At this point, we believe our revenue in China will stabilize around prior year levels in the second half of this fiscal year.","In Japan, Q4 revenues increased 4% on a currency-neutral basis as every key category except sportswear and action sports grew. On a reported basis, Q4 revenue for Japan decreased 11%, reflecting the impact of the weaker yen. EBIT declined 2% as the drop in revenue was partially offset by lower SG&A.","Our Emerging Markets geography delivered another remarkable year in FY'13 as revenues reached $3.7 billion, up 16% on a currency neutral basis. Q4 revenues also grew 16% on a currency-neutral basis driven by strong growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Among the key categories, running, football, women's training and action sports powered the growth. On a reported basis, Q4 revenue for the Emerging Markets grew 10% and EBIT increased 30% due to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and lower year-on-year demand creation spending.","Fourth quarter revenues for our other businesses increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in Nike Golf and Hurley and 9% growth in Converse. On a reported basis, revenue grew 10% while EBIT increased 21%, driven by higher revenues and gross margins in each business.","Let me now turn to our expectations for FY'14. We expect revenue for the first quarter of FY'14 to grow at a mid to high-single digit rate. Full year revenue growth should be near the upper end of our high single-digit target range, with somewhat stronger growth in the second half of the fiscal year as we build towards the World Cup in Brazil.","Regarding the outlook for gross margin, we are encouraged by the progress we have made increasing our average selling price per unit by strengthening the premium segment of our footwear and apparel businesses and by taking selective price increases around the world. We have also ramped up our investment in manufacturing innovations that will increase the efficiency of existing production methods and over time create more revolutionary improvements in our sourcing base.","That said, we expect Q1 gross margin will be essentially flat with the prior year as continued labor cost inflation and unfavorable FX comparisons offset the benefits of easing raw material costs and higher selling prices. For the fiscal year, we expect gross margin expansion of about 25 basis points, with sequential improvement through the year as higher selling prices, lower discounts and easing FX headwinds should more than offset the impact of labor cost inflation.","For Q1 FY'14, we expect SG&A to grow at a low single-digit rate as we anniversary prior year investments in support of the Euro Champs, Olympics and NFL launch. For the balance of the year, we expect SG&A to grow at a low-teens rate in each quarter, as we continue to invest in our brands, DTC and innovation. The result would be low double-digit growth for the full year, slightly above the rate of revenue growth. For FY'14 we expect the effective tax rate will be about 25%.","Finally, we expect FY'14 EPS to grow at a low double-digit rate, essentially in line with the EPS growth we reported for FY'13. However, we expect first quarter EPS growth well above this rate, as demand creation spending declines in comparison to the heavy investments in last year's Q1.","Our FY'13 results reflect the power of the Nike, Inc. portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues, earnings and cash returns to shareholders while at the same time investing for long-term growth. We are confident we have the asset, capabilities and leadership to continue to do so for FY'14 and beyond.","We are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Bob Drbul - Barclays","Charlie, first of all, congratulations and best of luck and thanks for everything over the last 15 years.","Charlie Denson","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Bob Drbul - Barclays","I am a little busy here. Sorry. So I guess the first question I have for you, Charlie, just as this is your last call is, can you give us any, like Trevor taking over as President of Nike brand, any advice that you have given Trevor that you would share with us and what you should be most concerned about as he takes over at this point in his career?","Charlie Denson","Well, no, Trevor and the entire team are in great shape. Everybody knows Trevor. He has been around here a long time. He is great shape. He is well positioned to take the baton and keep going. I think there is no specific areas of advice that I can give him that I don't think he already knows. He is pretty well positioned and has got a great experience and he is a well recognized person, certainly around here and I think extremely as well. So I think I look forward to helping him make the transition and we will be in good shape.","Bob Drbul - Barclays","Okay and then, I guess as a bigger picture, and I don't know if this will be for Mark or for Don. Can you just talk about the outlook or the macro that has impacted the outlook over the last 90 days or last 60 days in the business and as you look at sort of the expectations on the earning side of it going forward? What have been the biggest factors to sort of alter the view a little bit here?","Mark Parker","Yes. I am glad you asked the question, Bob, because our perspective on the business really hasn't changed. We are absolutely as confident in the business as were 90 days ago. In fact, when we look at our constant currency operating profits, they have actually gone up a little bit in terms of our expectations, but a couple of things have happened. Number one is, the FX environments changed a bit and that's been a little bit of a drag on the numbers.","Secondly, we finished FY'13 with a few more shares than we had expected 90 days ago. Finally, if you look at our tax lines, our FY'14 perspective has not changed, but FY'13 came in a little better than what we had expected as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So, from an operating standpoint, we are just as confident as we have been and very confident going into FY'14. There's just been a few things that have pulled our growth rate down a touch.","Don Blair","I would jump in and add that our ability to sort of work the operational and financial levers to make the adjustments that we need to in light of some of the, or macroeconomic challenges. I mean that's never been better. We still feel like we have room for improvement in areas, but we have never had the ability to kind of surgically manage from an operational and financial standpoint as we do today. Very proud of that, and I think it's served us well, particularly over the last couple of years.","Operator","And your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, guys. And, Charlie, congratulations. Luck with what you do next.","Charlie Denson","I appreciate it. (Inaudible).","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Two questions. The first question is the double-digit North American futures orders. You guys put up today another great number. Can you just give us some color on what channels might be driving that more than others as well as the average selling price component to that? Then if there's any changes in the categories driving that? Then the second question is just Brazil. Some of the unrest that's gone on there, I was just curious if you guys had any color or thought on that? Thanks.","Charlie Denson","When we talk about and we look at North America and both the results and the futures order going forward, they are still pretty broad based, running, continues to still grow at double-digits. Basketball is accelerating and you saw the Q4 basketball results. They were extremely strong. And certainly the NBA Playoff run didn't slow that down at all, and so we are very excited about that going into next year.","We talked about women's. We're pretty excited about the women's piece and then we are moving into our second year with the NFL here in North America, so it's really broad-based portfolio of progress I guess. When you look at the way that the business is being made up from a channel standpoint, we are doing it across all the channels. It's not one specific channel that stands out good or better than the others and I think that that speaks to North America management team and points of differentiation that we have been able to create in the marketplace.","Mark Parker","We talk a lot about complete offense and that means across the product platforms, technologies, categories, geos and wholesale and direct retail, and the U.S. or North America is a tremendous example of really operating a complete offense. And, the exciting thing is as we see that kind of success in the U.S. and kind of turn around all cylinders there, we see the opportunity to really take a lot of that and apply that to other parts of the world. So, leveraging that complete offense and those successes across the other geographies is really our plan. Very exciting.","The other point is as it relates to the organizational shift, Elliot Hill coming on board to lead the geographies. He is incredibly experienced. He has done a fantastic job in North America. Tremendous experience in both wholesale and retail. Great energy, lots of passion. Again, part of what I think is going to be a leadership team and has some tremendous chemistry. So, Elliot and his team, to Charlie's point, deserve a lot of credit.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just on the ASPs in Brazil?","Don Blair","So on the ASPs, Robby, we usually don't get into that level of granularity by geography. But across all the futures, as we talked about, we were up five points on units and three points on ASP and that trend line is pretty consistent. So, we don't usually get into that level of granularity on a geography basis. But all the geos are seeing similar trends.","Mark Parker","Your question on Brazil, obviously there is a lot going on in Brazil with the ramp up to World Cup and the Olympics. We know the unrest and we are watching that situation very closely to-date. There has been no material impact on our operations or our business in Brazil. We remain incredibly excited about the World Cup coming up and all the opportunities around that, and then following that the Olympics. This is, as we have said, our time to shine as a brand and we have some pretty amazing things coming, Charlie alluded to that, in the world of football. So, we are excited about the opportunity in Brazil. But we will stay close to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane - Citi","Charlie, I would like to also add my congratulations and best wishes.","Charlie Denson","Thanks, Kate. I appreciate it.","Kate McShane - Citi","My question is around the supply chain. It was great to hear comments about the innovation in the supply chain and how it could possibly impact gross margins next year. I know it's still early days with Flyknit and other efficiencies that you are finding in the supply chain, but I wondered if you could update us on how this is ramping up as a production discipline.","Charlie Denson","Are you talking Flyknit specifically?","Kate McShane - Citi","Yes.","Charlie Denson","Yes, well, first of all, we continue to be incredibly bullish on Flyknit for a number of reasons that we have talked about before. Performance-wise, sustainability, margin, opportunities going forward, as we scale that technology within running, of course, and then across the other categories. So we are in the midst of a fairly major effort to scale Flyknit across other models.","Over this next 12 months you will see some very exciting new versions of Flyknit. I would say, just from a product standpoint, we are just scratching the surface in terms of the potential that it offers from a performance and an aesthetic standpoint. Let alone the manufacturing capabilities that it brings us.","The manufacturing payoff will come when, as we get this to even greater scale. We are well on our way, in terms of our plan, to leverage, like I said, Flyknit across categories and even across price points as well. So you will see some very exciting executions, actually starting as early as this August, you will see Flyknit actually meet Nike Free, and that's a great combination. I am tempted to say more, but I can't.","Kate McShane - Citi","Okay, great, and if I could just follow-up on that question, again with regards to supply chain and some of the labor costs that you are seeing. Obviously, labor has been a big pressure over the last couple of years. I know you have guided for it. But is there anything different that you are seeing or has anything gotten more accelerated in certain geographies where you are manufacturing currently?","Charlie Denson","Well, as far as acceleration, yes, we have definitely seen some fairly significant increases in wage rates in a couple of countries. I think the one in Indonesia certainly was pretty well publicized. We haven't seen the growth in quite that level in other places. But they have all been added up.","I think, as Mark talked about a little bit with respect to Flyknit, I think the longer term solution to addressing a lot of these labor cost issues is really engineering the labor out of the product and that really is with technologies and innovations like Flyknit and there are a number of others that we have in the pipeline that are aimed at the same thing. It will take some time, and that's why one of the reasons we spoke to this on the prepared remarks is that we are very carefully looking at all the other levers of gross margin, including price as well as just how we manage our mix.","One of the benefits we have seen in the last year or so is a real strength in the premium end of our business, which is the place where we have the most differentiation and the most opportunity for price. So, long-term, innovation we think is one of the ways to get at this labor cost pressure. On the near-term, we are also obviously looking at price and all the other levers in gross margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks. And, Charlie, let me add my congratulations as well. Great career and to Trevor as well as if he listening in. Can I ask you guys about ecommerce real quick? I know, there's lot of great brands out there that have become pretty high penetration in terms of the mix of the business, revenues generate online. I know you guys have been more focused on the digital side, creating ecosystems, communities as well as the commercial side of the business. How should we think about how and when the online platform can be ready to become a big contributor to the P&L as part of the DTC overall?","Mark Parker","Well, DTC and specifically online part of DTC is a huge priority at Nike, and we are investing in that platform fairly aggressively I would say. We see the opportunity there is continuing on, we are investing in mobile for example and seeing some great results there. Obviously, customization continues to be actually a very strong subset of our dotcom business and we see lots of innovation opportunities there that are quite compelling. But overall, DTC, and again specifically the e-commerce dimension, DTC is a huge and growing percentage of our overall business.","I think we are just at the very front end. I mean, if you look at DTC as a percentage of some of the big verticals out there, it's quite significant. So we see ourselves along with our retail partners in terms of wholesale dot-com is that there is some very significant opportunity for us and we are very, very focused and bullish.","Don Blair","And the thing that I would add to that, Omar, is that the work that you referenced earlier that we do around the digital experience for consumers and all of the digital connections we have with consumers on the brand side, we think is the multiplier of the e-commerce site.","Certainly, there is a lot of things we can do to sharpen our e-commerce platforms, but the connection points of all that traffic that's going through our brand sites and all of the connections we have with consumers, through things like Nike+, we think, have a multiplier effect in e-commerce that most pure play e-commerce players can't match.","Mark Parker","As we talked about our digital strategy, we divided into Digital Sport, which is really products and services like the FuelBand, for example, e-commerce and then communications. In communications, there's a lot of the social aspects. And as Don said, we see those all intersecting and that's where the real opportunity for Nike lies, is the intersection of all those pieces of digital in the future.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Got you. And, then Donald, I have a real quick one question on gross margin as they kind of continue to accelerate a little bit here. What's that algorithm going to look like when your highest margin market, China return to more of a growth business and that mix shift, it goes from a drag to a benefit?","Don Blair","That sounded like a statement, Omar, not a question. That will certainly be helpful to put China back on that sustainable growth path and we absolutely are confident that we are going to get China there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Svezia with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial","Charlie, all the best to you in the future in terms of whatever you choose to do but all the best to you and congrats to you.","Charlie Denson","Thanks.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial","My question is, just a follow-up on China for a second. Don, you gave some pretty good color about how we think about revenues first half, second half. Any thoughts about how we think about the margin profile in China? You didn't do so bad here in this current quarter against some easy comparisons but I guess just how do we think about that first half, second half and where maybe some inflection point could really start to happen?","Don Blair","Well, I don't want to get into that level of granularity again, but what I can do is talk to you little bit about some of the dynamics there. Certainly one of the things that was mentioned on the last question was just the high margins we have in China and one of the things that we believe is really exciting about the work we are doing right now with our retail partners is the opportunities still and the economics and productivity of the retail stores is that we can turn inventory faster.","We think we can elevate the presentation for our consumers and we think that ultimately is better from a profitability standpoint for us and for the retailers. So, yes, our margins have held up relatively well in the last quarter, and there's a lot of things that we still think we can do going forward to manage that business for a high level of profitability. But I don't want to get into the weeds of trying to guess where margins are going to be for any one quarter.","Just one thing to keep underlining here is, our goal is to get that market onto a sustainable profitable path. We are confident we can do it. We know how this works. It's just a question of working through the execution and being patient and disciplined as everybody else mentioned today.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, thank you and then just lastly just on the gross margin outlook for you. I would like to think that you guys are being somewhat conservative in terms of how you are thinking about it. You have done better than you have expected in the past two quarters or so. So I guess what maybe could be the opportunity whereby you guys could outperform your thought process in terms of gross margin. What's the biggest headwind? I think everyone might have anticipated you could have done a little bit better on the gross margin profile for this year, just given the pricing increases. So just maybe a little more color about where maybe the opportunities could be?","Charlie Denson","Well, one thing to bear in mind and I have mentioned this in the prepared remarks. There is a lot of currency headwind in these numbers for, particularly, the first quarter. So we do hedge which means that for the major currencies, we are largely protected for a period of time, but we don't hedge a 100% and there is a lot of currencies that we don't hedge, particularly developing market currencies. So, a more favorable FX environment would certainly help.","From a business standpoint, there is clearly a positive impact to managing inventories and keeping the market within that pull mode and one of the things that obviously we have been doing, as you saw our inventory numbers today, is keeping that inventory in check. So the upsides in this business model, as you know, are keep the inventories tight, make sure the brand is hot, sell-through maximum at full price and that's where the upside comes from.","So we have a lot of moving parts in here. I think, as Mark said, we are better and better at this as each quarter goes by and I hope you are right. I hope there is opportunity in the gross margin number.","Kelley Hall","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","I just wanted to follow-up on North America sales. There was a bit of a divergence in your footwear versus apparel sales and I was curious if you could add a little more color to that and talk whether your futures numbers also reflected a similar trend?","Charlie Denson","So, again, I am looking at the futures numbers here, hold on. Actually, they are fairly close. The futures will actually accelerate a little bit in apparel more than footwear, but they are pretty even obviously with the number in '12. We have still got great momentum in the marketplace in footwear. As we talked about over the last couple of calls, we are really focused on improving our apparel position. We think it's one of our biggest opportunities. I think we are starting to see some of that momentum and work payoff a little bit, especially in the North American geography.","Don Blair","I think this comment I made about complete offense is really a major factor in our success over this last year or really few years. It's definitely holding true as we move into, or will, as we move into fiscal '14. So, if you look at footwear and apparel, and you look across the categories, they're frankly up and down the price points. I think, we look actually quite strong in North America from a complete picture standpoint, so we continue to be bullish on the opportunities in North America as we move into fiscal '14.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Great. And, then just when you talk about doubling down on innovation are you talking about doubling down on your investment that we should expect much greater frequency of products with innovation associated with them or much innovation associated with it and maybe just help frame what the practical implications of that statement are?","Mark Parker","Yes. Well, first of all, as I said there has never been more opportunity to innovate than there is today. And, with that comps, it's not just more. It's better. So, we need to edit against that incredible list of opportunities and make sure that we are investing in things that we think we can leverage for the greatest success to fuel growth, improve performance, sustainability, et cetera. And, really, we have a very disciplined process by which we edit against all those opportunities.","So, yes we have some funding that we have put aside to look at getting behind some of these more compelling and innovation opportunities. I won't speak to specifically what those are, but the intent is to really rally behind those opportunities that are going to give us the greatest potential to grow the business. And, frankly, the leverage across categories price points and even the brands within the portfolio, so incredibly excited, but at the same time I know the discipline that needs to go with managing innovation to achieve the greatest impact.","Don Blair","And I would point out as you mentioned earlier. In my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about the significant investments we have been making over the last three years particularly and our guidance for FY'14 does contemplate that as well. So, as Mark said, we've been investing in places like digital and product innovation and manufacturing innovation so on, and we would continue to do that but that is embedded in our guidance that we gave you for FY'14.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Great. And then just one last one, you talked about the higher share count being a headwind to some degree of your EPS growth for next year and I think of a pretty easy solution to that considering. All the cash you guys are sitting on, so maybe just could you talk about what you plan to do with your extra $1 billion and your balance sheet?","Don Blair","Well, we do anticipate continuing to increase cash returns to shareholders and I think you are well aware of our record on dividend. And, certainly, buying our own stock is going to be a component of that as well and we do expect to be strong buyers of our own stock. We try to do that as efficiently as we can. And, obviously, your ability to see into the future is always a little murky, but we are very enthusiastic about returning cash to shareholders as well as investing in the business and that debt offering we felt was well timed to give us the flexibility going forward to continue to do both.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Well, thank you, everyone. Appreciate you being with us today. Thanks to Charlie one more time for his final call with us and we will talk to you all again on Q1 earnings call.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com.","Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally you'll hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who'll give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thank you for your cooperation on this.","I'll now turn the call over the NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone.","We delivered another strong quarter in Q3. Revenues grew 7% to $7.5 billion. Gross margin increased by 140 basis points to 45.9%, and diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $0.89. We were able to deliver results like these for the quarter by leveraging the power of the NIKE portfolio.","Over the last three months, the macro environment has become increasingly volatile. Foreign currency headwinds have intensified. Product input costs continue to fluctuate, and the political landscape is evolving in many countries around the world. This is the environment in which all multinational companies now operate, and NIKE is not immune to it.","The difference for NIKE, however, is that we see this as an opportunity to create further separation in the marketplace. Our globally diverse portfolio of geographies, categories, brands, product types, and distribution channels gives us a distinct competitive advantage. By going deep into the business, we're able to see opportunities to serve the consumer and drive growth, despite the choppier landscape.","This surgical approach to finding new dimensions of growth ensures we capture the full potential of our brands around the world. And that includes driving strong growth in areas of our business that are already well established such as Western Europe, China, North America in footwear, as well as businesses such as women's, young athletes, apparel, and e-commerce, where we are accelerating development.","These are just a few examples of the dimensions of our business where we are continuing to identify further opportunities to expand our reach and drive growth. And we do this while maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in those opportunities with the highest potential for return, so we can drive growth and manage risk over the short and the long term. This complete offense is how we can continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth. As you have seen from NIKE in the past, we know how to operate in a challenging environment better than anyone. And you will continue to see us leverage the breadth and depth of our global portfolio to do just that going forward.","At NIKE, everything we do starts with the consumer. It's our obsession with serving the consumer that sharpens our focus and drives our growth. The expectations of our consumers are evolving rapidly, and we're able to meet and often exceed those expectations because we know the athlete. By working with athletes at all levels, from the elite to the everyday, we have a level of knowledge and insight that is unmatched in our industry. And we are able to use the insights that we gain to create new products and services that drive new levels of performance innovation across all of our categories.","The pace of innovation at NIKE has never been faster, and our pipeline has never been more robust. We're leveraging new tools and processes to unlock significant advancements every day. However, the starting point for innovation remains the same, and that's the athlete. Many of our greatest innovations have come from going deep into an individual sport to solve a unique athletic need.","Let me highlight a few examples in our footwear business from Q3: in running, the LunarTempo, the shoe that merges speed with cushioning for a great ride over the longer runs; and then the newly redesigned Air Max 2015, our most flexible, comfortable Air Max to date. We're seeing very strong response from consumers, and I'm tremendously excited about the pipeline of products in the running category.","In basketball, with his 10th signature shoe, Kobe Bryant returned to a low top, and once again pushed the limits of design. In addition to great consumer reaction to the Kobe X, players around the NBA are wearing it for its great traction and cushioning.","And in football, the NIKE Vapor Untouchable Cleat was created to provide the game's fastest players with power and precision on the field. We've had tremendous feedback on the performance and the look of the Untouchable from the athletes at both the NFL and the collegiate level.","And in men's training, the NIKE MetCon 1, a first of its kind, high-intensity training shoe that has been incredibly popular in the marketplace, and it's just a hint at what's to come in men's training.","These innovations each deliver a new level of performance for the athlete. However, we only truly realize our potential as a company when we continue to leverage those breakthroughs across multiple sports and categories. It's what you've seen from us time and time again.","Many of our biggest footwear platforms such as Lunar and Free, Flyknit and NIKE Air were initially created to solve a specific athlete need in a specific category, but now they serve as the foundation for our greatest products across multiple categories.","Similarly, in apparel, platforms such as Aeroloft and Dri-FIT, both originally introduced in running, set the standard for thermoregulation and moisture management in multiple categories and product classifications. And our NIKE Pro collection continues to drive energy in all sports, especially our Pro Bra and tights collections for women.","Individually and collectively, our product innovation is breaking new ground across all of our categories. And as excited as we are about the technical details of each product, what's most important is how well our products are resonating with athletes and consumers, which we clearly saw in the quarter.","Innovation fuels more than product at NIKE. It also drives how we do business and how we connect with the world. In the case of our digital ecosystem, NIKE is growing a connected community of athletes all over the world. This community is seamlessly engaged with the brand not only by accessing the world's best product, but by fueling activity and improving their athletic lives. We know it's not enough to simply interact. True connections require depth and richness. And in Q3, we strengthened these digital connections and added new dimensions to our digital ecosystem.","So how does NIKE continue to expand our digital innovation? We link experience to commerce. We released the NIKE SNKRS app during the NBA All-Star game in New York, letting consumers on mobile devices see, share and buy our most coveted footwear product. And we broadened access. We announced several partnerships with the Nike+ running app to let runners connect to Nike+ experiences to more of their devices and fitness equipment. And we grow our global reach. We added more sharing capabilities to our Nike+ training club app. We expanded it to 18 languages. It's work like this that will continue to power our digital experiences for years to come.","At the same time, in Q3, we continue to see tremendous growth in our e-commerce business as nike.com was up 42% in the quarter. Traffic and conversion both increased. And for the first time in our history, mobile traffic exceeded desktop traffic helped in part by the introduction of the SNKRS app. Going forward, we will continue to invest in this area to best serve our consumer.","Additionally, we'll continue to drive growth in our e-commerce business by increasing consumer access to product customization. In Q3 for example, we brought exclusive new Flyknit options to NIKEiD, giving consumers the ability to take customization to yet another level. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in our e-commerce business as we leverage our digital platform to continue to deliver premium products, services and experiences for our consumers.","As we head into the final quarter of fiscal 2015 and beyond, I continue to see tremendous opportunity for NIKE around the world. You've heard me say many times that I see more potential for growth going forward than at any time in our history. And I certainly continue to believe that today.","While the current macro environment is challenging, it is not new to us. We have a highly experienced and aligned management team that knows how to continue to deliver profitable growth by turning challenges into opportunities. It's what we've always done in the past, and it's what you can expect from us going forward.","Thanks. And now here's Trevor.","Trevor A. Edwards - President-Brand","Thanks, Mark.","Q3 is a great example of how the strength of the NIKE Brand drives growth around the world even in a more challenging macro environment. As Mark mentioned, the impact of foreign exchange has intensified, and Don will talk more about our work to mitigate those impacts. As I normally do, I'll speak to our results on a constant currency basis.","While we consider the impact of foreign exchange as part of the overall management of our business, currency-neutral results provide a clearer view of the underlying operational performance. So let's take a look at the numbers.","The NIKE Brand revenue grew 11% with strong growth in Western Europe, Greater China and the emerging markets, as well as in our sportswear and basketball categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 29% driven by all concepts in all geographies. And as Mark mentioned, we also saw continued strong growth in nike.com. And global futures are up 11%, reflecting a strong growth despite comparisons to the prior year, which included strong World Cup demand. Excluding the impact of the World Cup, we estimate future orders would have grown in the mid-teens.","Our Q3 growth is a result of the deep relationships we've built with consumers through the Category Offense. Our laser focus on individual consumers strengthens those connections, whether they're online, at retail or at live experiences. NIKE's consistent focus on serving the consumer through the lens of their chosen sports helps enable continued profitable growth.","What's more, only NIKE has the global scale to execute this consumer-focused strategy in markets around the world. As we further drive the Category Offense globally, we continue to prove our ability to connect our brands to consumers and build compelling retail destinations that elevate, segment and differentiate the markets around the globe.","To see the Category Offense in action, let's first take a look at two of our key categories, basketball and running. Both NIKE and the Jordan Brand continue to deliver the absolute best in basketball with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the basketball category. And as the game expands around the globe, we continue to see amazing opportunity for growth in this important category.","Q3 was a great example of the combined power of NIKE basketball and brand Jordan to create excitement and energy in the marketplace. I was in New York City for the NBA All-Star Weekend, and it was clearly an electric experience for hundreds and thousands of basketball fans who took part. All over the city, NIKE and brand Jordan executed retail concepts and consumer experiences that showcase basketball's unique culture and passion.","NIKE basketball invited fans to visit the Zoom City Arena, offering them a chance to play on the first digital LED court in the United States. Brand Jordan transformed the Penn Pavilion into an interactive consumer experience where fans could relive Michael Jordan's iconic game-winning shots. And both brands created elevated retail executions at Niketown at House of Hoops locations with Foot Locker and at pop-up locations around the city. All of this combined to deliver a truly one-of-a-kind experience for our consumers, something only NIKE can do.","In addition to delivering highly engaging consumer experiences, we continued to lead with innovative product. In the quarter, Kyrie Irving, one of the most exciting young players in the game today, became the newest signature athlete for NIKE with the launch of the Kyrie 1, offering superior traction with the Hyperfuse construction, the Kyrie 1 is an excellent example of how we never stop improving. Also, seeing huge consumer response was the Kobe X, the most coveted shoe yet for the popular Kobe line.","Next, let's talk about running. As you know, running is our heritage and our largest performance category. The NIKE brand continues to resonate with runners fueled by the Nike+ Run Club and grassroots running events around the world. And the running category continues to deliver strong results in key geographies, including Europe, China and the emerging markets.","That said, core footwear, within the running category, isn't performing as well as we would like, particularly in North America. As a result, we're highly focused on delivering new innovation into our core product offerings to ensure we continue to serve our consumer with the absolute best.","With our premium performance products, we continue to see strong sell-through for footwear stars like the Air Max 2015, the LunarTempo and the Air Zoom Pegasus 31. In addition, our premium performance apparel continues to drive growth, and we saw strong consumer response to the styles, such as the new Epic Lux and the Epic Run tights. As part of our amplify strategy, we leverage the heritage of our running into sportswear to deliver great style for consumers who appreciate the aesthetic of running. This is our complete offense in the running category.","And running-inspired sportswear performed exceedingly well in the quarter, led by strong consumer response to the Roshe platform and the Roshe Flyknit in particular. The Air Max 1 collection also had strong performance in the quarter.","Looking ahead, we will continue to build on what's working in running as we further strengthen our business to accelerate growth. We are excited to have a robust continuous pipeline of groundbreaking footwear innovations, which we'll bring to the market over the next 18 months. We will also leverage the momentum in platforms such as the Lunar Flyknit and our Air Max 1 to continue to drive growth. Overall, running continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and inspiration for NIKE, and one of our key long-term growth drivers.","Let's talk about a few of our key geographies. First, North America, which delivered 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Consumer demand continue to be very strong in North America, as most key categories grew and futures were up 15%. That said, revenue growth was somewhat lower than expected in the quarter due to challenges led to the port congestion on the West Coast, which escalated late in our fiscal quarter three. As a result, some shipments originally expected for delivery in Q3 were delayed.","Looking ahead, we expect revenue growth in quarter four to accelerate as the flow of product through the supply chain begins to normalize. However, we do expect it will take a few quarters to return to fully normalized product flow as there are significant number of containers to be cleared from the ports on the West Coast.","To be very clear, there continues to be tremendous momentum for the NIKE Brand in North America, thanks to innovative product that continues to resonate with our consumers. And the Category Offense continues to help us deliver segmented and differentiated retail destinations with our wholesale partners in our stores and online.","Executions such as the Field House with Dick's Sporting Goods and the House of Hoops with Foot Locker performed very well in the quarter, as did our DTC business, which delivered revenue growth of 15% and continued strong growth on nike.com. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for growth in North America as demand remains strong and our brand continues to resonate with consumers.","In Western Europe, we're seeing broad-based demand with revenue growth of 21% in the quarter. We saw growth across all categories and territories with particular strength in AGS, the UK, and southern Europe. A critical part of our successful growth strategy in Western Europe is the work we've done to transform the marketplace along the Category Offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions with our wholesale partners in our stores and online while continuing to bring innovative product into the marketplace.","The JD omni-channel store at Trafford and the Pro Direct digital store in London are great example of powerful avenues we have to differentiate the NIKE Brand. In addition, we continue to see strong performance in our stores with DTC up 40% and strong growth on nike.com. It remains early days yet, but the market growth we're seeing in nearly every territory coupled with the market share gains prove the success of our efforts in Western Europe.","Let's turn to the emerging markets where revenue grew 12% in the quarter with six of the nine territories growing double digits. We also saw strong growth coming from sportswear, running and basketball. While we feel good about the third quarter results in the emerging markets, we do anticipate some choppiness going forward. Futures declined 6% for the period, in part the result of tough comparisons to the strong World Cup orders in the prior year. We are also taking proactive steps to reduce the supply to ensure a healthy marketplace in Mexico and Brazil, two of our largest territories in the emerging markets.","In Mexico, as we have discussed on previous calls, inventory levels in the marketplace were higher than we would like, largely a result of transition issues with our distribution center in early fiscal 2014. We've made significant progress in clearing the excess inventory in Mexico, and we expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year 2015.","To ensure a healthy pull market, we've also worked proactively with our wholesale partners to adjust the flow of product into the marketplace, which contributes to the year-over-year decline in future orders for the emerging markets.","In Brazil, Q3 revenue growth was modest, as volatile macroeconomic conditions made for a challenging operating environment. The NIKE Brand continues to be incredibly strong in Brazil, and we see great opportunity to reposition this critical market for sustainable profitable growth.","As we successfully did in North America, China, and Western Europe, we will leverage the Category Offense to segment and differentiate our points of distribution. In doing so, we will increase the productivity and profitability of the marketplace. We will accomplish this by elevating the retail experiences for our consumers and presenting our products in more compelling and premium execution. As we start to reset the market in Brazil, we are working proactively with our wholesale partners to pace the flow of product into the market. As with Mexico, this is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in the emerging markets futures orders.","We are confident that our actions in Mexico and Brazil will help us to reach our goal of operating a healthy pull market in these important territories. And long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the NIKE Brand.","Lastly, in Greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q3 revenue growth was 17% and futures are up 23%. This reflects the continued strength of the NIKE Brand in the market along with our efforts to execute a more consumer-focused distribution strategy.","Our wholesale partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanded profitability in the doors that have been reprofiled. This success aligns with the results we've seen in our own retail doors. Additionally, inventory levels in China continue to be healthy, letting us better serve the consumer and maintain a strong pull market. Given the success we've seen in the marketplace over the last several quarters, we are now focused on evolving from a reset strategy to a new normal of how we do business in China. As we look ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth in this key geography.","Ultimately, I feel great about the results we delivered in Q3. And while we will continue to face macroeconomic challenges going forward, we know there's tremendous momentum in the marketplace. And we know that NIKE Brand continues to resonate with consumers all around the world. And we know our relentless focus on servicing the consumer will keep us in the lead. We know all this, and because we do, I personally could not be more excited about what the future holds.","Thanks, now here's Don.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Trevor.","In his opening remarks, Mark spoke about the tremendous macroeconomic volatility we've seen in recent months. In particular, over the last 90 days the U.S. dollar has appreciated against virtually every other major currency. There's no question that this has and will continue to have an impact on multinational companies, including NIKE. We see these times as opportunities to distinguish ourselves both in how we deliver for our consumers and how we deliver for our shareholders.","The power of our brands in our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet, and the experience of our management team all give us the ability to navigate these conditions in a way few companies can. We've always run our business to deliver appropriate near-term profitability, invest for long-term growth, and manage risk. That approach hasn't changed. That doesn't mean this is business as usual. It does mean we'll use all the levers of our business to deliver profitable growth, even in the face of strong macro headwinds. We'll continue to make focused investments to build strong brand connections, deliver innovative products and services, and create compelling retail experiences for consumers.","We'll leverage our strength with consumers to grow revenues and expand gross margins. We'll apply innovation and operational discipline to increase cost productivity, and we'll continue to deliver increasing profitability and cash returns to shareholders. We've been here before, and we're confident we have the business capabilities and momentum to deliver growth and profitability even under difficult economic circumstances.","With that introduction, I'll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. increased 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, revenue increased 13%, in line with our expectations, as the NIKE Brand grew 11% and Converse increased 33%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand across the NIKE Brand portfolio, led by double-digit growth in North America, China, and Central and Eastern Europe.","From a category perspective, the growth reflected strong demand across multiple categories, including sportswear, basketball, and running. This overall growth is especially noteworthy given last year's robust orders in advance of the 2014 World Cup, which particularly affected futures orders in Europe and the emerging markets. As Trevor mentioned earlier, excluding the impact of World Cup, we estimate futures would have increased at a mid-teens rate. On a reported basis, futures grew 2%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, real, ruble, pound, and yen.","Third quarter diluted EPS increased 19% to $0.89, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments and a higher tax rate. In Q3, the impact of FX was insignificant, as the impact of the stronger dollar was largely offset by our currency hedging programs.","Gross margin expanded 140 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a continued shift to higher-margin products, partially offset by higher product input and warehousing costs.","Third quarter demand creation was flat to last year, as higher investments in digital and sports marketing were largely offset by lower advertising expenses due to changes in the timing of product launches. Q3 operating overhead increased 15%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin, higher-cost DTC business, investments in operational infrastructure, and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.","The Q3 effective tax rate was 24.4%, a 190 basis point increase versus the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of tax expense on intercompany transactions, partially offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit.","At the end of Q3, NIKE, Inc. inventories were up 12%, primarily driven by unit growth in North America and Europe. As Trevor mentioned earlier, our North America business was affected by congestion at West Coast ports reducing Q3 revenue growth and increasing Q3 inventories. While we anticipate the flow of product will soon begin to return to normal, we expect we will have somewhat higher inventory levels and lower margins in North America for the next few quarters as we work to rebalance supply and demand in the market.","Now let's take a look at some of the performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q3 revenue increased 6% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by basketball and sportswear. Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 15%, driven by the rapid expansion of nike.com, 7% comp store sales growth and the addition of new stores. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 14% driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","In Western Europe, Q3 revenues increased 21% on a currency-neutral basis. The growth was broad-based as nearly every territory increased at a double-digit rate and every key category grew, led by double-digit growth in sportswear, women's training and running. Despite the weaker euro, reported Q3 revenue for Western Europe increased 10% and EBIT increased 22% driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","In Central Europe and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Most territories delivered double-digit revenue growth, but revenues in Russia, Israel and Turkey declined. Nearly every key category expanded, led by sportswear, women's training and running. Reported revenue for CEE declined 10% and EBIT fell 35%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, most significantly in Russia.","In Greater China, Q3 revenues increased 17% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in sportswear, basketball and running. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for China increased 15% while EBIT increased 7%, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments in demand creation and DTC.","In the emerging markets geography, Q3 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in all territories except Brazil, which grew at a single-digit rate, and Mexico which declined mid-teens. From a category perspective, the growth was led by sportswear, running and basketball. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue increased 2% and EBIT increased 3%, reflecting significant currency headwinds.","As Trevor discussed, we're seeing the results of our work to clear excess inventory in Mexico. At the same time, we're taking action to realign the Brazil marketplace along the lines of the Category Offense. We're confident these steps will set us up to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth in these territories and for the emerging markets geography as a whole.","At Converse, Q3 revenue grew 33% on a currency-neutral basis, boosted by the acceleration of Q4 shipments in advance of a major systems go live. The balance of the growth was driven by continued strength in North America, the conversion of several European markets to direct distribution and strong growth in DTC. On a reported basis, Converse revenue increased 28% and EBIT increased 23%, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by higher investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation to enable long-term growth.","We've seen strong momentum in our business year-to-date, and we expect that momentum to continue into Q4 and beyond. That said, FX headwinds have intensified significantly in the last 90 days, especially from the erosion of the value of the euro. While our hedging programs have significantly reduced the impact of FX on profitability, we cannot eliminate all currency risk. Based on what we know today, we expect the following for Q4 and full-year FY 2015.","We expect constant dollar revenue growth for Q4 in the low double-digits with reported revenue growth 8 points to 9 points lower, reflecting the significantly stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth 4 points to 5 points lower.","We now expect Q4 gross margin to be flat to up about 25 basis points as the impact of higher closeouts, particularly in North America and Europe, largely offset the ongoing benefits of mix shifts to higher margin products and businesses. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points.","We expect demand creation to decrease at a high single-digit rate for Q4, as we anniversary investments in World Cup marketing in Q4 of FY 2014. For the full year, we now expect demand creation to grow at a mid single-digit rate. We expect operating overhead to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate for Q4 and at a mid-teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation and new operating capabilities. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY 2015 will be approximately 24.5%.","Looking ahead to FY 2016, we haven't yet completed our planning, but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency-neutral revenue growth for FY 2016 slightly above our high single-digit target range. When combined with the impact of our ongoing work to expand gross margins and ongoing investments in our growth strategies, we would have expected EPS growth at or above our long-term mid-teens target.","That said, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency will reduce next year's reported revenue, gross margin and profit. Assuming exchange rates remain in about the same range as they are today, we expect FY 2016 reported revenue growth in the mid single-digits and EPS growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Currency markets remain volatile, so we will provide an update on our FY 2016 expectations on our Q4 earnings call.","On our last conference call, I spoke about one of our NIKE maxims. And today, I'd like to highlight another. We are on the offense, always. As Mark said at the outset, we view a challenging operating environment as an opportunity to create further competitive separation. By staying focused on consumers and leveraging our strengths, we're confident we can continue to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.","We're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question is from Kate McShane with Citi.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon.","Kelley Hall - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Hey, Kate.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And, Don, I just want to say congratulations to you on your announcement.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I have two questions today. One was, there was a very big article this week or late last week from Adidas talking about the NBA sponsorship and walking away from that. How would you view that opportunity? And can you just walk us through just sponsorship in general, and how you're thinking about it for the future?","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, with regard to the NBA, there is really nothing further to share at this time. We are, as you would imagine, always talking to the leagues, clubs and federations, but really nothing more to report on any specific conversations with the NBA sponsorship. But as you know, the relationships that we have with the leagues, clubs, federations and of course the athletes are key. We gain the insights from the athletes that really ultimately drive the innovation that fuels NIKE's brand strength and our growth as a company. So that's always been the case that I can't imagine it wouldn't be going forward.","We're selective in the choices that we make in terms of where we think we have the greatest opportunities, and we look at those opportunities in a very complete sort of holistic way. Very, very happy with where we are in basketball and feel like there's tremendous potential going forward. Trevor talked about Jordan and NIKE basketball. Incredible performance in the quarter, and really strong outlook going forward. So we expect that our relationships with athletes at the collegiate level and the professional level continue to be really an important part of that.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Oka, great. Thank you. And then my second question is on the supply chain. As we see faster speed to market from other apparel companies, can you talk about how you view this opportunity, how quickly the supply chain can be refined to address this?","Kelley Hall - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Kate, are you talking about the congestion at the West Coast ports?","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I'm sorry, no, more of a longer-term strategy. I think a couple of retailers have indicated that they're looking for more freshness in the market. As you see a lot more speed to market from other manufacturers, I wondered if that was something that NIKE talked about and if there was any opportunity within the supply chain to address that.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely, Kate. We have made a number of different investments over time, and we continue to do that both in terms of how we operate our supply chain and more closely tie the timing of production and shipping all the way through to the final consumer. So certainly on that front. We've also, as you know, done a lot of work in the innovation space around how we manufacture product and how we design and develop it.","For example, on the NFL, we've had to do some very different approaches to make sure that we're able to respond very quickly to changes in demand, whether it be for specific teams or specific athletes. And that goes all the way to the manufacturing revolution type of investments we've made around technologies like Flyknit. So we are putting a lot of money and a lot of resources against how our supply chain evolves to increase speed and make sure we deliver to consumers as quickly and as innovatively as we can.","Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys, and great quarter. So there's a lot of talk about Flyknit marquee basketball price points, but can you touch on the mid-tier channel, the segmentation strategy you guys have, particularly any product innovation for us to watch and just kind of how you think about pricing power in that channel?","Trevor A. Edwards - President-Brand","Obviously, we continue to make sure that we continue to focus our pricing strategy, certainly around ensuring that we give great value to our consumers. So it's always a balance of price to value with the consumer. Our ability to bring new innovation allows us the ability to command certainly a premium price, and certainly our brand strength does that too. So obviously, one area that we talked about, which was in the running business, we talked certainly about the core and our ability to make sure we continue to stay focused on bringing more innovation there.","Our basketball business is very strong at the moment. And we feel it will continue to be strong because we have an incredible pipeline of new innovations that we keep bringing into the marketplace. So obviously, as you saw when we brought the Kyrie shoe into the marketplace, we're just seeing tremendous response to those products. So we continue to feel, again, very confident about our ability to keep the excitement in the basketball category while continuing to serve all the various segments, whether you're coming through the House of Hoops like at Foot Locker or you're working certainly more of a mid-tier account.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I just want to quickly add. Our innovation agenda is really about bringing a complete offense, which means across the categories, across the product types, and up and down the price point spectrum. So that's really important to us. We have a major focus on elevating the state of innovation in our core product, and I think you'll see that coming through the pipeline here in the quarters ahead. I'm very excited about that part of NIKE. But certainly innovation is not reserved for the upper price point premium product. It runs up and down the price spectrum, and that's a very, very important part of our growth strategy going forward.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. So we've seen a clear top line and bottom line inflection really over the last 12 to 18 months. Mark, I'm curious. When you take a step back, what do you think has been the largest enabler in the organization here as we've seen this inflection? And as we think about the Category Offense, what's the best way to think about the potential next leg of opportunity?","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of the Category Offense?","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just largely I'd be curious as you think about what's really changed in the organization to drive both the top and bottom line inflection that we've seen over really the last year to two years here.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The Category Offense, just touching on that for a second, is really driving deeper insights into the marketplace, which really, as you know, drive innovation, which creates product, which drives growth for us. But it's not just the product innovation, it's also the insights into the consumer and consumer cultures, making sure the brand is resonating, we're relevant, we're connected.","I think it's not so much a difference from where we've been. We're refining our ability to be highly creative and innovative, but also really disciplined and operating at a much higher level across the various dimensions of the business. We have a management team here that is very much aligned, very experienced. We never take our success for granted. We're always looking for ways that we can improve, which is really important to me and I think NIKE's success to date, but we are probably our own biggest critic. But I think our ability to innovate and our ability to drive operational excellence at the same time is just \u2013 it's never been at the level it is today, and I'm actually quite proud of that.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, best of luck.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks, good afternoon. I actually wanted to ask my first question about the manufacturing revolution in the context of currency. You and the industry largely have been producing in Asia in markets where the currencies are tied to the dollar. As you said, the dollar has seen unprecedented strength against all other major currencies. Is now the time to accelerate the process of maybe pulling manufacturing out of some of these markets and taking manufacturing to the end markets and using some of the automated technologies to allow yourselves to produce in the end markets where the costs will be aligned, at least from a currency perspective, where the sales are, just your thoughts around that if that changes the equation there?","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One of the things that I made a reference to this in the prepared remarks, Omar, is that when we implemented our trading company four or five years ago, one of the things that we did is we started deconstructing our payments to the factories into a basket of currencies as opposed to one currency, which lets us get natural offsets to some of the currency exposure. So we're getting some of the benefit that you're talking about here matching sourcing currencies and selling currencies even within our existing structure.","The second thing is that we've adjusted or we do adjust payments to the factories on the basis of how those currencies move. So we are getting some offsetting sourcing benefits right now from the fact that currencies in a lot of our sourcing countries are weakening. So that helps us also net down our foreign exchange exposure.","With respect to your overall premise of trying to make sure that our manufacturing is closer both in the proximity and time to where the product is sold, that is absolutely part of the strategy from a consumer standpoint. So I think when you look at the financial side of it, we're getting some of the benefits that you're describing through the way we've set up our trading company. And that's not stopping us from keeping the pedal down on driving manufacturing evolution, as we think there's a huge consumer benefit to doing that as well.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We definitely see the opportunity. The innovation agenda is really helping to create some efficiencies and opportunities to automate the manufacturing process, which ultimately will allow us to source more broadly down the road. As Don said, that's a big part of our agenda.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Right, that's really helpful. Thank you. And then a follow-up, Don, as you head into retirement, there's a lot of complex things going on in the global markets and currencies and the trading companies you set up. Mark, also, how do you feel about the transition? Can you talk a little bit about the transition? Don's been there a really long time, obviously knows the business extremely well. Help us understand why we shouldn't be concerned about the transition going on in the CFO position. Thanks.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me take the first cut at that. First of all, rumors of my departure are premature here because I will still be in this role through the end of July. So you're not quite rid of me yet. I am tremendously excited about the next chapter in my life, but I'm also extraordinarily excited about the prospects for NIKE and have tremendous confidence in both the management team as well as my successor, Andy Campion. Certainly, Mark can speak for himself on that, but you're not quite rid of me yet, and I feel really excited about it.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Since you brought it up, I'll just say that Don's impact here has been absolutely tremendous through the years. I personally have nothing but incredible respect for Don and the impact that he's made at NIKE. I wasn't going to go here. It's a little premature, as Don said, but I will say that I'm also incredibly confident in Don's successor. Early into fiscal 2016, Andy Campion is really a seasoned NIKE veteran. And he's been under the tutelage of Don and the incredible financial leadership team here at NIKE. And I have tremendous confidence in Andy's ability to take the reins and continue the momentum that Don's helped create for us going forward. More on that as we move forward.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Congratulations. Great quarter. And Don, congratulations on your retirement.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","The next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Kelley Hall - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Hey, Robby.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good afternoon, Robby.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, so my two questions. First, Trevor, you mentioned in your comments the core footwear and running in North America not performing quite as well as you guys would like. I was wondering if you might share with us sort of more what is going on there. Is it a fashion shift? Is it a product presentation, or what are some of the things that we should be looking for that could get that going again? And then the second question is just, as you look over the next year or so in Europe, the sort of need and inability to raise prices over there to offset all the FX changes and how you guys are thinking about that? Thanks.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Certainly, Robby. I think the first thing I want to just maybe communicate is that running \u2013 our brand continues to really resonate with runners in North America. And one of the things I want to do is maybe unpack a little bit about how we view the business. And we always talk about what we say is the amplified offense, which really gives you a greater view of the marketplace. And so when you take a look at it, you have the performance segment, you have the core segment and you have the running inspired segment.","And so if you break those down, in the performance segment, we're seeing tremendous success of the new products that we've been bringing to marketplace. So whether you take the Air Pegasus 31 or the Max 2015, or any of those products, they're doing really, really well. And so we feel obviously very, very confident about that. As I mentioned in the core footwear, we think there's opportunity for us to do better in that zone. And so as Mark said, we're going to continue to bring more innovation and strengthen that part of the business.","The other dimension is the running inspired business, which I mentioned which are things like the Roshe, which really speaks to more of the aesthetic side or certainly people who like the aesthetic or the style component of running, so, and that's doing really well. So all in all, the running business core performance is where we see some challenges, but the rest of the business really continues to do really well. In addition, the apparel is also doing really, really well in the marketplace. So we feel we're connecting with runners in a great way.","Lastly, I would say that I'm very confident about innovations we're going to continue to bring in the marketplace. Over the next 18 months, we have a robust pipeline. So I'm really excited about doing that and making sure that we continue. Futures are actually up 15%, so we feel confident about the running business and its impact in the marketplace.","Kelley Hall - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Robby, just to clarify, futures are up 15% for North America, futures are also up strong in both footwear and apparel for the total running category globally.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then...","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Your second question \u2013 go ahead, Robby.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Europe. Yeah, Europe, just pricing increases and how much of that is maybe Don, in some of the guidance, the preliminary guidance you gave us? Thanks.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just the first piece would be the way we approach these things, which is we think about managing the business on a long-term and how we move all the levers in the business. So just because the euro has gone down dramatically, doesn't mean we're going to try to get all of that back with pricing in Europe. And we're going to pull all the levers to deliver against our goals. We do have in our expectations for FY 2016 that we will continue to migrate consumers to premium. We're continuing to manage mix. And if you look at the way our business has performed over the last few years, I think we've been very successful in moving average price points higher and we would expect to do that. What I wouldn't look for is trying to get all of a very big move in currency back in the near term with huge price increases in any one piece of geography. We play for the long-term.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks very much, and great work guys.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Bob.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Don, congratulations. Best of luck. Thanks for everything.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And, maybe, I guess the two questions that I have is, the first one is, with the U.S. business like with some of the challenges, I didn't call out the running pieces of it. But would you attribute any of the challenges in the U.S. business this quarter to cannibalization or potential cannibalization given the big increase that you generated on the direct-to-consumer piece?","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I wouldn't. We continue to see great momentum in North America. And as I mentioned earlier, the 15% futures growth continues to give us confidence about the business in North America. Obviously, we do have our DTC business is growing, but we're also growing very well. We have a great relationship with our wholesale partners. So we feel very confident about the way the business is growing and how the brand continues to resonate with consumer. The demand for the brand is really high in North America and actually around the world.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then a question on the futures, with the reported period, can you just talk about like the first half of the order period versus the second half? And was it stronger in the second half or in the first half, like how can we think about that?","Trevor A. Edwards - President-Brand","Futures are a little stronger in the second half of the window.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it, okay. And then just the last question is, which of you guys had UAB in your brackets?","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not going to go there, not now.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","All right, thanks very much.","Trevor A. Edwards - President-Brand","Thanks, Bob.","Kelley Hall - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good evening, everyone.","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good evening.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask about your women's apparel or just the women's business. In North America, you had a couple of very high profile initiatives, some shifts on sponsorship and marketing. And then also, we've seen a number of the Training Club shop-in-shops in Macy's. Can you give us an update on your progress in women's apparel and maybe some of the specific things you have in the pipeline for the next few quarters?","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, yes. Our women's business I'm very excited about the products in our women's business. Our women's business really across not only in North America, but really around the world continues to grow at a really rapid pace. In fact, it's outpacing our men's business. And our strategy to really focus on the run, train and live components of the business, every dimension is actually growing, both footwear and apparel as well as some of the things that we've done certainly around the community work with the services that we're providing. They're also doing really well.","So it really is a case of every dimension of this is actually working really well. So we're really excited. Some of the things to really point to whether it's the Epic Lux tights, the bras that we've just recently launched, some of the great footwear, all of those things are doing really, really well both in our doors, in dotcom as well as with our wholesale partners. So we feel really, really pleased about the progress.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And just a quick maybe housekeeping item. I'm sorry if you answered this already, but beyond the port delays, were there any other factors that drove the disconnect between your North America sales versus what futures orders suggested they might be in the quarter?","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We also had some weather-related delays in the south. There were some ice storms down there, so we lost some shipping and so on. So there's quite a bit of supply chain noise in Q3, which, as we said on the prepared remarks, we do expect that's going to sort out over the next few quarters. But as Trevor said, demand extraordinarily strong in North America, futures up 15%. So feeling really good about the underlying strength of the business.","Lindsay B. Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks so much.","Kelley Hall - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","The last question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, Don, congratulations on the well-deserved pending retirement.","Donald W. Blair - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim.","Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Couple other questions. E-commerce growth has been a standout. I know it's also been a big area for investment. As we look into fiscal 2016, is that business at a point where we can lever some of those investments? Or do you expect the investments there to continue to drag on the profitability?","Trevor A. Edwards - President-Brand","Well, first thing I would say is, the profitability is growing faster than the revenue. So we're continuing to drive both top line and bottom line on e-commerce. So, number one is, this has been a winner both from a growth and a profitability standpoint. The second thing is, we are going to continue invest in digital. We believe that's where the consumer is and is going. And that's where our brand is and is going. So we're going to continue invest there. But from an economic standpoint, it's been a very positive driver for business both top line and bottom line.","Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great to hear. And then, next question on China. Sales turning nicely but the profit growth in the quarter lagged. Is that simply a function of timing of investments? Or is there some broader influence of the repositioning in the market?","Mark G. Parker - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think from the China perspective, obviously we're very pleased with the continued growth. No. It's probably more just at this point in time, but it's not something that we would envision over the long-term.","Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. Thanks for that.","Donald W.

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon, everyone. Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1 that momentum continued at a strong pace. We\u2019re capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term and we\u2019re diving deeper into the areas that will widen NIKE\u2019s advantages over the long term. Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we\u2019re taking a winning formula and executing it across our complete portfolio and it\u2019s leading to the balanced growth that you see today.","For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include double-digit growth in our international geographies and 6% growth in North America. NIKE Digital is leading the way for differentiated retail, up 36% for the quarter. And we saw acceleration in both our sportswear and performance businesses.","While this quarter\u2019s success was broad-based and we\u2019re pleased with our momentum, we know we have even more opportunities ahead. As we\u2019ve described before, a key focus that will create separation for NIKE over the long term is our digital transformation. Ultimately, it\u2019s about becoming more personal at scale. And put simply, it\u2019s how digital is accelerating each of our Triple Double pillars. And that\u2019s how we create through 2X Innovation, how we connect through 2X Direct and how we serve through 2X Speed.","So, let\u2019s look at the quarter through each of these lenses. The success we\u2019re seeing today starts with great products. It\u2019s ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years. As the taste of our consumers shifts faster, strong platforms allow us to continually bring fresh products to market while extending our storytelling and investments. We\u2019re seeing it with NIKE Air and React. Consumers are drawn to their comfort and performance and they\u2019re asking for more style options. VaporMax and 270 are both proven there is still vast growth potential in NIKE Air as we develop more comfort innovation in new forms. This spring, we\u2019re taking the exaggerated air you see in the Air Max 270 and going a step further with the introduction of the Air Max 720. This new platform is engineered for maximum comfort, cradling the entire foot. And the Air Max 27 -- or 720 is distinctly NIKE and will deliver it to consumers in early 2019.","NIKE React is a great example of how we\u2019ve capitalized on the appeal of performance innovation and immediately scaled it into sportswear. The React Element 87 is considered one of the industry\u2019s top new designs, and we\u2019ve applied the comfort of React cushioning to more performance and lifestyle shoes at several price points.","ZoomX continues to power the world\u2019s fastest runners including Eliud Kipchoge during his epic world record smashing run at the Berlin Marathon this month. This quarter, we took the magic of the Vaporfly 4% and merged it with an iconic running shoe, creating the Peg Turbo. The launch has created incredible energy for the whole Pegasus franchise and helped lead our overall running business to solid growth this quarter.","One of our most versatile and ever-advancing platforms is Flyknit. Through digital knitting, we can now place breathability, stretch and support exactly where we need it. In basketball, for example, the KD11 and the LeBron 16, each leverage specific yarns and different knit structures to match individual athlete needs. The LeBron 16 with its Battleknit 2.0 has had a great early read with consumers, both men and women.","As part of our broader commitment to scale sustainable platforms, we\u2019re expanding NIKE Flyleather through iconic styles like the Air Force 1, Cortez and the Air Max 95. Flyleather is a super material that looks and feels like premium leather, but it\u2019s lighter, more durable and more sustainable. It uses at least 50% reclaimed leather and helps eliminate waste.","And in the coming year, for the first time ever, NIKE will bring digitally powered adjustable footwear to professional sports. Building on the auto-lacing platform from HyperAdapt, this breakthrough creates a custom fit. We had a group of elite athletes on campus this summer for an intense wear test. And their feedback was that they never felt more secure or more in control of their movement. This next generation adaptable innovation will set the standard for optimal fit. And we\u2019ll offer it at more accessible price points and in greater quantities.","In addition to platforms, we\u2019re executing the fundamentals across our categories at a high level right now. We know that it\u2019s newness and freshness that wins with the consumer today. So, with our edit-to-amplify approach, we\u2019re providing deeper assortments and greater options of our top sellers. Our footwear power franchises, for example, consistently outperform our overall footwear sell through. ","Apparel too continued its momentum with 11% growth, driven by fleece, tops and bottoms, jackets and pants. We delivered a number of sportswear apparel collections over the last 90 days like the City Ready and the Metallic Sheen collections in women, and NIKE Sport and Tech Pack and ACG. We\u2019ll continue on this path and extending the performance because collections give consumers more complete looks and allow for better merchandising and storytelling.","Overall with apparel in our categories, we saw a consistent sell-through of our football national teams collections drafting off the energy we created from the World Cup, where we had our first all-NIKE men\u2019s final.","The growth in our women\u2019s apparel business was led by sportswear and sports bras, where our strategy to blend style and comfort is working.","And in NIKE Basketball apparel, we\u2019re capturing the excitement for LeBron\u2019s move to the Lakers. As you\u2019ll see in just a few weeks, we\u2019re bringing more creative designs with the NBA City jerseys this year.","When we look across our complete portfolio of products, we still see areas with significant upside. We\u2019ve talked before about the opportunity in women in Young Athletes and Jordan. Delivering innovation and fresh product in these areas brings balance to our portfolio.","A strong roster of core footwear at entry price points is equally important to NIKE\u2019s overall growth potential. We\u2019re not yet where we want to be in core footwear, particularly in North America. But two priorities for the business are to develop innovation specifically for the core consumer and to better leverage pinnacle performance platforms like NIKE Air in this zone.","Another product strategy that\u2019s driving incredible energy is our ability to create unique intersections between sport and style across our brand. A few examples over this past quarter include the on and off court collaboration between Serena and Virgil Abloh for the U.S. Open; Converse\u2019s limited edition Chuck Taylors and One Stars with creative partners in fashion and music; and our first Jordan Brand football kit with PSG.","As I said before, it\u2019s not lifestyle versus performance or fashion versus sports, the consumer continues to be inspired by seeing those worlds come together.","Overall, 2X Innovation is at the heart of our continued momentum right now. We have versatile platforms; we\u2019re mixing sport and style in unexpected ways; and we have a deep line-up across our product portfolio that\u2019s creating value across all dimensions of our business. And while our product innovation is fueling demand, our 2X Direct strategy is driving new ways to connect with our consumers. It\u2019s building confidence in our vision for smart retail, where we remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments.","2X Direct is in the early stages, and it\u2019s already creating an impact, resulting in strong growth and margin expansion for our NIKE Direct channels. We continue to see unprecedented demand for our highest heat product through our SNKRS app, which has become the world\u2019s number one footwear shopping app. And we\u2019ll continue to expand the reach of SNKRS, launching in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia next quarter.","The NIKE Live retail concept, we unveiled with our Melrose store in LA was incredibly successful this quarter. The premise behind the concept is to create a live and ever-changing experience. We\u2019re testing a number of new features including product assortments that update frequently based on what\u2019s trending with the local consumer; a service that allows consumers to reserve an item on our apps and then pick it up curbside or in the store from a personal smart locker. And through Swoosh text, our store athletes can now provide expert advice for consumers after they\u2019ve left the store.","And what we\u2019re learning in Melrose, we\u2019re bringing to 2 new flagship stores in our 2 most important key cities, New York and Shanghai this next quarter. Both will be the combination of all we\u2019ve learned about personalized and experiential shopping over the last several years. There\u2019ll be incredible showcases for the NIKE brand.","Our obsession with the store experience is also paying off with top strategic partners. While retail consolidation has not finished its course in North America, our growing NIKE consumer experiences with Foot Locker, Nordstrom and other key partners are already driving higher growth rates as compared to non-differentiated doors.","We\u2019re equally energized by the momentum we\u2019re building with new digital commerce partners. We just moved from a pilot stage to a fully operational program with Flipkart in India. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Jet.com to sell selected assortment of both NIKE and Converse in key cities in North America. With Jet, we\u2019re partnering to develop consumer insights and create a better branded experience on their platform. And we\u2019re doing same with our key partners in China. This quarter, we made it possible to combine NikePlus member accounts to Tmall accounts. We\u2019re seeing an impressive increase in new members in China as a result. And lastly, we launched partnership with WeChat, making 1 billion monthly active users just one click away from becoming a NikePlus member.","Ultimately companies will be judged on their ability to be more personal with their consumers at scale. And NIKE\u2019s taking a lead on this promise, leveraging more insights from all over the world and reshaping the shopping experience through smart retail. To make that a reality, we\u2019re unlocking opportunities to quickly and seamlessly design, manufacture and deliver our products to consumers through 2X Speed.","We\u2019re sharpening our sensing capabilities and develop a fully responsive product manufacturing. We\u2019re actively building a portfolio of innovation and automation that impacts the entire spectrum of our process. Our goals are ambitious and we have high standards. Our vision is to leverage automation to deliver amazing innovative products, faster and more responsively, while being more sustainable and cost efficient. And we\u2019ve had some great success.","For example, we invented a flat assembly process for uppers in our Advanced Product Creation Center at our World Headquarters using 30% fewer steps and 50% less labor. We tested this process with our partners including Flex and in our Asia store space as well. Transforming traditional footwear manufacturing is a significant undertaking. We\u2019ve learned a lot and are building new high-impact capabilities, yet we continue to face specific challenges together with our partners including Flex where the goal has been to deliver responsive, automated, close to market manufacturing of high-quality product at scale. This is a dynamic process and we\u2019re continually assessing and refining the best path forward, leveraging our breakthroughs in areas like rapid prototyping, 3D and digital printing, and new methods of make all in service of cutting the overall product creation cycle in half.","Another key initiative accelerating us towards that goal is the Express Lane, which continues to be the engine that\u2019s creating the most agility in our supply chain right now. We\u2019re driving double-digit growth in many of our key cities through the Express Lane as we capitalize on the local energy for key icons like the Cortez and sports moments like the World Cup.","With this end-to-end view, our entire value chain, we\u2019re delivering the right product to the right consumer in the right moment. And across product lines, through GOs [ph] and with our partners around the world, we\u2019re relentlessly driving speed at a scale that is creating impact for our business. We\u2019re off to a great start in Q1, managing the dynamic environment. More importantly, we\u2019re setting a new foundation for long-term, sustainable growth for years to come.","Thanks. And now, here is Andy.","Andy Campion","Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We are extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world than the expectations we set entering the fiscal year. We had continued strong growth in international markets, led by Greater China growing at 20%, and our international growth is now being amplified by very strong, sustainable growth in North America.","As for the quality of our growth, our momentum continues to be directly tied to execution of the Consumer Direct Offense and more specifically, the Triple Double. First, take, for example, our 2X Direct initiative. 2X Direct is about connecting the NIKE brand more directly to our consumers. And today, the most direct connection to the consumer is through the mobile device in the palm of their hand.","In Q1, we continued to enhance and expand our NIKE Digital ecosystem, leading with mobile, and the result was 36% NIKE Digital growth. NIKE Digital was once again our fastest growing channel in each and every geography.","Now, while NIKE Digital is leading the way, we believe physical retail will also play an important role in doubling our direct connection to consumers. We see growth in the physical environment being driven by smarter retail, experiences that leverage digital technology to better serve consumers.","In Q1, our vision for physical retail became more tangible. We continued to roll out what we\u2019re calling the NIKE app at retail, starting with our own in line stores. And we also launched a new concept called NIKE Live. The NIKE Live concept came to life in Q1 through the opening of NIKE by Melrose in Los Angeles.","NIKE Live leverages our NikePlus membership platform and other digitally enabled services to provide a truly differentiated consumer experience at retail. The results to-date have been phenomenal. For example, at NIKE by Melrose, the conversion of in-store shoppers into digital NikePlus members is 6 times higher than in the rest of our fleet, as consumers seek to gain the full benefits associated with being more directly connected to NIKE. Our approach has been to task, learn and then scale new concepts such as these. Accordingly, we\u2019re now in the process of scaling these new concepts across our fleet of own stores. And these tangible proof points are also accelerating new concept development with our strategic wholesale partners.","2X Innovation is another key pillar within the Consumer Direct Offense that is fueling our broad-based momentum. Suffice it to say that our recently launched innovation platforms VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have already generated in aggregate over $2 billion in revenue at retail. Further, these platforms are driving brand distinction and catalyzing growth across our broader product portfolio in both performance and sportswear. For example, as Mark noted, the new innovation we are bringing to the NIKE Air franchise has ignited double-digit growth across our multibillion dollar family of NIKE Air products.","Newness and innovation are also favorably impacting our gross margin, as our full price sell-through is significantly outpacing off-price sales. Our current inventory levels are also tight in relation to the strong demand that we\u2019re creating.","Underlying our strategic momentum is the digital transformation of NIKE that Mark mentioned. A year ago, we aligned our teams around the world on our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. Over the past year, we\u2019ve been ramping up investment in the new digital capabilities that will reshape how we operate at NIKE for the long term.","Our investments in new digital capabilities are coming in the form of both organic development and acquisitions. As we closed fiscal year \u201818, we announced the acquisitions of Zodiac and Invertex, both of which are already having a profound impact on how we better serve consumers. Another acquisition that we made back in fiscal year \u201817 was Virgin Mega. That team has now become known as Studio 23 at digital hub in New York that\u2019s driving the explosive growth of the SNKRS app.","Within fiscal year \u201819, we\u2019re also investing significantly in the organic development of new capabilities, including digital demand sensing, consumer data and analytics, connected inventory, digital product design and creation, a digital content engine and a new enterprise resource platform that will help unlock speed and flexibility in our supply chain. As our long-term financial model implies, we believe that NIKE\u2019s unrivaled scale and resources afford us the ability to over-index on investment in these differentiating capabilities, while still delivering expanding profitability over the five-year horizon.","Execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is clearly beginning to transform NIKE\u2019s business model and how we will create value for shareholders over the long term. So, let\u2019s recap our Q1 results in a bit more detail with a focus on how strategic execution is the driving force behind our current financial performance.","NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Our stronger than projected currency-neutral growth was driven by acceleration in North America and continued strong momentum in international markets, albeit slightly offset by FX dynamics within the quarter.","Our growth across geographies was led by NIKE Direct with NIKE Direct growing 12% and NIKE Digital growing 34% on a currency-neutral basis. The impact of innovation, NIKE","Digital growth outpacing all other channels, and our tighter supply and demand management also fueled roughly 50 basis points of NIKE, Inc.\u2019s gross margin expansion in Q1.","Demand creation grew 13% in the first quarter, primarily driven by sports marketing investments, as well as brand campaigns that amplified key moment sport such as the World Cup.","Operating overhead increased 5%, driven by investments in digital capabilities, as well as in our supply chain and enterprise technology platforms.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14%, which reflects the implementation of U.S. tax reform.","First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. Finally, as of August 31st, inventories reflect to prior year, primarily driven by a strong pull market across all geographies, coupled with the efforts we\u2019ve taken over the past year to right size supply.","So, now, let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, we have returned to strong sustainable growth. Q1 revenue grew 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by a accelerating growth across both footwear and apparel, driven by new innovation platforms as well as strong owned and partnered digital growth.","Wholesale has also returned to growth, yet we see even greater opportunity to drive differentiation across the wholesale marketplace going forward, in part by leveraging our learnings from the NIKE app at retail and NIKE by Melrose.","Another growth opportunity we see ahead of us in North America relates the Jordan Brand. In the second half of fiscal year \u201818, we tightened supply. We also reset our approach to Jordan Retro, creating more current stories and collaborations with respect to Jordan\u2019s most iconic styles. We\u2019re now bringing those icons to life in more compelling ways for the new generation of Jordan consumers. And as a result, the Jordan Brand is back to a pull market. ","We\u2019re also beginning to have greater dimension for the Jordan Brand, for example for women, we\u2019re extending sizes and the icons we know they already love and also creating silhouettes and new collaborations made specifically for her. Apparel and performance basketball also represents significant growth opportunities going forward.","As the football and basketball seasons ramp up, our brand momentum will continue to build in North America. At the same time, we\u2019re not taking that momentum for granted. We continue to identify and attack opportunities to elevate our game and drive strong, sustainable growth in this important geography.","So, now, let\u2019s turn to EMEA. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in sportswear and healthy growth in Running and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit rate. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA accounted 5 of our 12 key global cities, and in all 5 of those key cities in EMEA, NIKE is rated number one by consumers, and our growth is over-indexing in the broader market.","By connecting more deeply with consumers in key influential cities and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, NIKE is creating increasingly greater distinction as a brand in Europe. One of those sports moments was the incredibly exciting World Cup in which both of the finalists were NIKE teams. And soon after the World Cup final, we launched our Awaken the Phantom campaign, generating over 50 million views in the first few weeks and driving strong sell through on the launch of our newest global footwall franchise, the Phantom. And finally, after celebrating the French National Team\u2019s World Cup victory, we continue to bring energy to global football with the launch of a Jordan branded Paris Saint-German team kit and collection of apparel. That launch has been phenomenal with the key style selling out immediately.","While NIKE has become the leading brand in EMEA, we are far from having achieved our full potential. We see the opportunity to both grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel across Europe, and also create even greater separation from the competition as a brand. That is why we believe we can sustain the strong growth in EMEA over the long term.","Next, let\u2019s turn to Greater China, another geography in which the NIKE brand continues to lead and sustain strong growth. We\u2019ve now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China\u2019s growth was 20% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by Sportswear, Jordan, Basketball and across Women\u2019s and Young Athletes.","Growth was also strong in balance across both footwear and apparel. We are winning with the Chinese consumer, first and foremost through the key cities of Shanghai and Beijing. We\u2019re also continually innovating in this large, digitally native marketplace. NIKE Digital growth remained strong and actually accelerated in Q1. We\u2019re also driving growth through our partnerships with China\u2019s leading digital platforms like Tmall and WeChat.","And finally, we\u2019re beginning to leverage digital in the largely NIKE branded physical retail environment in China. Say for example, our partner Bai Li [ph], which was acquired last year by Hillhouse, [ph] a leading firm in technology and consumer services. Bai Li [ph] has already rolled out connected inventory that enables a more direct Nike consumer experience with a faster and easier way to fulfill consumer demand, fully leveraging their roughly 2,500 touch points.","Now, let\u2019s turn from China to another fast-growing and fast-developing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel and led by Japan, Mexico, and Korea. Two areas of increasing focus for us in APLA have been our women\u2019s business and digital. Women\u2019s growth continues to accelerate, driven by distinctive brand marketing campaigns such as the Come Out in Force, and Rally Cry campaigns focused on inspiring and empowering women through sport.","NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 70% in Q1, the highest rate of growth across all of our geographies as we continue expanding our digital ecosystem across this region. We will continue to sustain strong growth as we roll out the NIKE SNKRS app in markets such as Mexico and Brazil, and bring the NIKE Live retail concept to Tokyo later this fiscal year. Beyond NIKE Direct, we\u2019re also expanding our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through entrepreneurial commerce partnerships such as those with Flipkart, ZOZOTOWN and several others.","We see continued momentum in APLA over the course of fiscal year \u201819 and we will continue to invest in this fast-growing diverse geography as we move even closer to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.","And finally, at Converse, revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth digitally. That said, Converse also experienced declines in undifferentiated wholesale, primarily in the U.S. and the UK. As we move through fiscal year \u201819, we will be expanding Converse\u2019s product portfolio while also elevating the Converse branded digital ecosystem.","We are off to an even stronger start to the fiscal year than we initially expected. Our currency-neutral growth and profitability is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics have resulted in the dollar strengthening and foreign exchange shifting to a slight headwind over the past 90 days. Taking into account all of these dynamics, we are maintaining our full year guidance for fiscal year \u201819. Specifically, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range as operational upside will likely be somewhat offset by FX headwinds. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points or slightly greater, SG&A to grow in the high single digits and our effective tax rate to be in the mid teens. Other expense net of interest expense is now projected to be an expense of $100 million to $125 million.","Based on the FX volatility of late, let me briefly explain more specifically how FX impacts NIKE\u2019s financials in the short term. First, it\u2019s important to note that the revenue line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. Therefore, our reported real dollar revenue growth reflects nearly all currency movements real time. We do have a robust hedging program that delays the impact of FX on our profitability for 12 to as much as 24 months, most notably with respect to developed market currencies, for example, the euro. However, it is not economical to hedge FX risk in many emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil. And as for China, we\u2019re able to partially, but not fully hedge our net exposure.","Our focus is on sustaining strong, currency-neutral operating momentum over the full year and even more importantly, over the longer term. But, I\u2019ll provide a bit of context on Q2. For Q2, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth in line with the 9% currency-neutral revenue growth we delivered in Q1. That said, taking into account real time FX dynamics, reported real dollar revenue growth for Q2 is likely to be 2 to 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth.","For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion approaching the same level of expansion that we delivered in Q1. As a reminder, we expect less gross margin expansion in the first half of the year, as compared to the second half of the year. In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the low-teens driven by the timing of our investments in sports marketing, including the kick-off of the NBA and NFL seasons, and the timing of strategic investments in new digital capabilities. For other expense, net of interest expense, we expect expense in Q2 to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.","Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is creating brand distinction with consumers around the world and driving strong financial performance. At the same time, we see ourselves as being in the early stages of this transformation. There is no finish line for NIKE, particularly as it relates to digital. So, we will continue to invest in the capabilities that will differentiate and create competitive advantage for NIKE long-term. Those capabilities include product innovation, brand marketing, digital, and speed within our supply chain.","We are thrilled with our momentum out of the gate in fiscal year \u201819. And nonetheless, we remain on the offense, identifying and attacking opportunities to elevate our game, build on our momentum with consumers, and ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the 6% North America growth you saw this quarter, I wondered if you could help us understand how much is being driven by ASP growth versus unit growth, and how much of a drag is the undifferentiated retail.","Andy Campion","Hi, Kate. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take that one. In North America, we\u2019re actually seeing expansion in average selling prices as well as units. Our growth is relatively well-balanced, as you saw in our reporting across footwear and apparel. So, it\u2019s very strong and balanced growth. And we see that strong and balanced growth continuing over the balance of the year.","Kate McShane","Okay.","Andy Campion","And for undifferentiated retail, as I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing growth across all dimensions of the marketplace. We have had relatively strong growth with our strategic wholesale partners being Foot Locker, Finish Line, Dick\u2019s and others. That\u2019s being driven by the elevation of the consumer experience with those partners and also by the extraordinary impact of the new innovation and newness that we\u2019re bringing to our product portfolio. We\u2019re in the early stages of some of the more truly transformational change. But, what we\u2019re really encouraged by is that the learnings that we\u2019re having, particularly with the Nike app at retail and Nike by Melrose, in other words, the Nike Live concept. Those conversations are really picking up steam in terms of new concept development that we see a great opportunity for across that bricks and mortar fleet in wholesale.","Mark Parker","Yes. I\u2019ll add that the demand that we\u2019re seeing in North America is actually quite balanced across the portfolio. And on top of that the inventory situation is actually quite clean as that demand has been increasing. So, we\u2019re in a good position here.","Operator","Next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","I guess, the question that I have is more of a bigger picture question for you. I was wondering if you could address your demand creation advertising marketing approach. There has been a little bit of news the last couple of weeks and some controversy around it. And I was just wondering if you could maybe address how you approach these types of situations, the concerns that you have but the benefits that you see around certain campaigns?","Mark Parker","Yes. Well, just generally, we\u2019re motivated to inspire our consumer to connect and engage and inspire. We feel actually very good and very proud of the work that we\u2019re doing with Just Do It, introducing Just Do It to the new generation of consumers, on the 30th anniversary of the campaign when it first debuted. We know it\u2019s resonated actually quite strongly with consumers. Obviously, here, in North America but also around the world, it\u2019s really transcended to North America market to touch people around the world. We have an incredible line up of athletes in that spot. When you look at the Just Do It campaign and the list of athletes we have there, it\u2019s actually quite impressive including Serena and Odell, Colin, Shaquem Griffin, Lacey Baker, these are actually very inspiring athletes. And again, we feel like that campaign has delivered on that that message in a way that\u2019s really connected with people around the world.","Like any campaign, it\u2019s -- not any campaign but many campaigns, it\u2019s driving a real uptake, I think in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially. We\u2019ve seen record engagement with the brand as part of the campaign. And our brand strength, as you well know, is key dimension that contributes to the ongoing momentum that we\u2019re building across the NIKE portfolio. And that\u2019s really how we look at it. It is how do we connect and engage in a way that\u2019s relevant and inspiring to the consumers that we are here to serve.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thanks. And I guess, the second good question I have is, after this weekend\u2019s golf results, I was wondering if you had any perspective on how Phil Mickelson feels ahead of the match-play event in November with Tiger?","Mark Parker","Yes. He\u2019s probably feeling more pressure, I would imagine. It\u2019s great to see Tiger back and the reaction to his performance on Sunday was pretty inspiring. So, yes, I think Phil might be feeling little bit of that pressure.","Operator","Next question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Lauren Cassel","First, is there any color you can share on North America DTC growth specifically during the quarter? And then, just bigger picture, there\u2019s been some caution or nervousness in the market about potential slow down in the Chinese economy and consumer spending there. Obviously, you guys delivered some really nice growth there this quarter. But, are there any fines or signals that you\u2019re seeing that would suggest a slowdown there? Thanks so much.","Andy Campion","Sure. I will take North America NIKE Direct or DTC, as you put it, growth. I\u2019ll hit it on all three dimensions. We had extremely strong double-digit growth in digital and acceleration in that regard. We have taken a number of actions to remove friction, enhance the consumer experience, allocates product to that channel where we know consumers\u2019 demand is robust. And we\u2019re actually using data and demand sensing to better lineup supply with demand digitally. So, incredibly strong growth digitally.","In our in-line stores, we\u2019re actually seeing strong comps as well. We\u2019ve seen traffic up and even more notably conversion. And conversion in the in-line stores we\u2019re seeing as a direct result of two things. One, the brand distinction that Mark mentioned in response to the last question as well as the product that we\u2019re bringing to market; we\u2019re seeing incredibly strong full price sell-through on our line right now, our closeout mix is down in inventory and are off price sales are down as a percent of total.","In our factory stores, our factory stores continue to be a very profitable dimension of the business. And frankly, the only challenge I would really highlight in our factory stores is that its full price sell-through is so strong and in-line and digitally, it leaves some gaps in terms of the assortment that we bring to market in the short-term in our factory stores. But, we\u2019ve identified opportunities in that regard and are looking at supply to fill those gaps. So, again, it\u2019s a nice ","So again, it\u2019s a nice problem to have.","Mark Parker","Yes. Let me touch on China. Yes. I mean, as Andy has mentioned in his remarks, we\u2019ve seen 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and really strong underlying fundamentals within the market, things -- factors like the growth of the middle class, sports participation, obviously a very digitally savvy consumer, and we\u2019re well-positioned in that regard in the marketplace. In terms of the NIKE brand and its position, we have a very strong connection with the Chinese consumer. We have for a long time, we\u2019re leading the market in digital, growing 40% in Q1. We\u2019ve had great relationships with our digital partners there; I mentioned Tmall, WeChat is starting up with the tremendous potential there. So, there\u2019s great momentum in the marketplace and across multiple categories, sportswear, running, basketball. The Jordan Brand is incredibly strong in China. So our fundamentals in China are actually quite silent and strong.","We\u2019re not seeing any pushback from consumers. On the contrary, our relationship with actually consumers is strong as they can possibly be. We feel confident in our ability to continue to grow, and that\u2019s reflected in our outlook for China over this next year. And we feel like there\u2019s great momentum and that we\u2019re in a good position for that to continue. Now, that said, we\u2019re mindful of the dynamics. But, we are focused on serving that Chinese consumer, strengthening our position there. And I\u2019ll just I guess close by saying, we are the most popular brand with the Chinese consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your lines open.","Jim Duffy","Good balance in the quarter, a lot of good indicators. The inventory looks well-managed and you\u2019re seeing strong results in DTC and also spoke about improving margin from DTC. I\u2019m wondering, can you speak about some of the elements of cost inflation that are offsetting the mix benefits in the gross margin. And Andy, can you detail the FX impact considered in the gross margin outlook for the year?","Andy Campion","Sure. I\u2019ll hit both dynamics, cost and FX. But, let me first give you a little bit of overall context on our margins. We\u2019re seeing strong structural improvement in our margins, and that\u2019s being driven by the innovation we\u2019re bringing to market and in turn the strong full price versus off price mix. Second, it\u2019s being driven by the over indexing growth in our NIKE Digital business. And it\u2019s also being amplified by the initiatives that we have around product cost management. In the first half of the year, there is one element of material so to speak that it\u2019s a bit of a headwind, and that\u2019s in the chemical space, namely rubber. That will ease in the second half of the year.","As we look at FX as well, FX is much more of a tailwind in the margin line item of our P&L in the second half of the year, as compared to the first half of the year. So, if I refer back to the guidance that we gave as we entered the year and we reiterated today, we have strong gross margin expansion forecast for the entire fiscal year. At the same time, we see slightly less margin expansion in the first half and more margin expansion in the second half.","Jim Duffy","Very good. And then Mark for you. Last nine months, particularly strong period for new product introductions and bringing new innovation to the marketplace. Can you talk about how to think about the cadence from here? Will there be a gap or is there a predictable launch cycle you expect to work with as we look out over the next couple of years?","Mark Parker","Yes. Our 2X Innovation initiative is really all about a steady flow of innovation. I feel very positive, very confident with what\u2019s in the innovation pipeline and what\u2019s coming. I mentioned a couple of things earlier. The new iterations of our Air cushioning platform with the 720, a very exciting product that\u2019s building on the VaporMax and 270. So, that\u2019s exciting. I also mentioned the adaptable -- adaptive footwear technology coming into performance sport, and you\u2019ll see that on professional athletes very soon. We have an incredible lineup coming I think throughout the fiscal year of product. We\u2019re actually focusing on bringing innovation into the core price points as well. So, we have a balanced portfolio of innovation across both footwear and apparel. And then we have opportunity to further dimensionalize the incredible platforms that we\u2019ve got. I mean, I mentioned Air, React, ZoomX. There\u2019s still a tremendous amount of potential to leverage those, both in performance across categories and then also across sportswear.","And then, I have to tell you, I can\u2019t really shed too much light on this at this stage, but my excitement around what\u2019s coming as we, believe it or not, ramp up our portfolio around the Tokyo Olympics. NIKE is -- that\u2019s always a time where we showcase our innovation and the build up to the Olympics is an incredibly exciting time for NIKE, and the innovation that we deliver. So, I guarantee you, we won\u2019t disappoint with some of the things we have coming up. And you\u2019ll start to see some of that ramp up over the next 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Good afternoon. Solid results. Just on North America, given the acceleration that we saw throughout the first quarter, is it fair to assume that the exit rate was more in the high single-digit range? And while I know overall global revenue outlook has not changed, has your thought process on what is achievable in North America maybe been upped a little bit?","Andy Campion","Sure. Thanks for the complements, Paul. And I\u2019ll take that one. Our goals for North America are long-term focused. It\u2019s a large important geography. And as you may recall, at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid single digit revenue growth over the next five years, as we innovate within the marketplace from a digital perspective and transform the broader retail landscape. On that note, we said there might be some disruption in the short-term as well. So, to some extent, we hedged a little bit with respect to fiscal year \u201819.","To be clear, we\u2019ve returned to strong growth in North America, even faster than we had expected. We have demand that is outstripping supply. You saw our inventory in North America was flat. And so, what we\u2019re focused on and we\u2019re always focused on, you can rest assured is capitalizing on every opportunity that we see to serve demand in the North America marketplace.","We\u2019re not providing specific guidance from a geo perspective. But, I will tell you that the brand is incredibly strong, our product\u2019s resonating, sell-through is strong. And even beyond what\u2019s working and what you can see in our numbers, we see opportunity to go beyond that and potentially even more importantly drive that sustainable growth over that five-year horizon. And those opportunities fall under the overall umbrella of what Mark often refers to as our complete offense. So, at any given time, even when we have extraordinary momentum, there are areas underneath that umbrella where we see greater opportunity than we\u2019re capitalizing on. Specifically in North America, I touched on Jordan. We see acceleration in Jordan over the coming months and certainly out of this fiscal year and into next year. Women\u2019s is growing strong. Women\u2019s was very strong dimension of growth for us as a company. But we see even more opportunity, it\u2019s not so much about the rate of growth, it\u2019s how much more opportunity is out there in the women\u2019s business, especially around athletic footwear and apparel.","And then, finally, another dimension, a huge opportunity in North America is our Young Athletes business. It may surprise some people to know that it\u2019s one of our largest categories. At the same time, we see the opportunity to bring new materials, colors, prints, and even designs directly targeted at young athletes. We have a silhouette called the Future Series, which is actually an innovation that\u2019s made specifically for kids. So, we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in North America. Suffice it to say, we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum we have and we\u2019re bullish on being able to sustain growth in North America in fiscal year \u201819 and beyond.","And then, you also asked about global growth. You made a comment that said it\u2019s pretty consistent. I just want to be clear, on a currency-neutral basis, our momentum on the top line from a revenue perspective is stronger globally than we expected when we came into the year. While we maintained our high single digit reported revenue growth guidance that takes into account that over the last 90 days since we last spoke to you, FX has been pretty volatile. And as I touched on that line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. So, while we protect the profitability through hedging, we see those impacts real time and that\u2019s also why I gave you a little bit more color on Q2 guidance.","Operator","Your last question comes from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jamie Merriman","Thanks very much. Andy, you touched on how you\u2019re using data, a little bit earlier, but I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about, is it inventory allocation by channel, by geography, is some of that data starting to help drive your product creation efforts and are there other ways that it\u2019s being deployed at this point? And then, just as follow-up, you talked about the Jet.com partnership. Can you just talked about how that compares to the Amazon partnership? Thank you.","Andy Campion","Sure. I\u2019ll start with data and analytics. It is truly an end to end initiative at NIKE. It starts with consumer data and analysis around consumer data. And I\u2019d say, that is manifesting itself right now already and most importantly, in terms of digital demand sensing. Us continuing to leverage the intuition that we have, but amplifying that intuition with real data as to what consumers preferences are. And one of the best examples is NIKE by Melrose. That store, that NIKE Live store in Los Angeles, the entire assortment is based on data that we\u2019re analyzing around what consumers in those ZIP codes have purchased and are interested in and some of the key themes. ","You move from digital demand sensing to digital product creation. So, taking that insight and designing and creating product leveraging digital technology that allows us to bring that insight to life in a product faster. And then, absolutely, we\u2019re using data in our supply chain to tighten our demand and supply management. And you see that already beginning to impact our full price versus off price sell-through. On the very front end, of course, from a consumer perspective, data and analytics helps us personalize the consumer experience on the NIKE app, as well as the SNKRS app, and even in our physical retail environment, as we use things like the NIKE app at retail. And in that regard, one of the most notable successes or pilots early on has been connected inventory. So, using RFID and using data and analytics, in terms of where inventory is and where consumers are looking to buy to get them the product they want more seamlessly.","And then, as for your second question, you asked about Jet.com and how that might compare to some of our other partnerships. And I\u2019ll say that -- Mark will probably want to add something here, we\u2019re excited about this partnership with Jet because it is a partnership that is really about creating a compelling consumer experience around the NIKE brand, leveraging NIKE membership to help better serve consumers in that channel, helping ensure that there\u2019s a clean assortment of product that\u2019s presented to that consumer across the marketplace. So, there are several aspects of it that we view as distinctive in terms of the offering that we\u2019ll make to consumers. At the same time, it\u2019s one of several initiatives across a range of digital commerce platforms.","Mark Parker","Yes. I\u2019ll just add on Jet. We\u2019re starting off with a more focused pilot as we look at offering a select amount of product in key cities across North America. It\u2019s an assortment that\u2019s tailored to those consumers, what we would call a brand friendly shopping experience. We\u2019re looking at our digital partners to help co-create elevated consumer experiences and how they partner with NIKE. And so, we can work together on advancing our connection to consumers through digital commerce.","We are looking at how we partner with these digital platforms to advance the consumer connection in terms of product selection, in terms personal service, in terms of how the brand is presented online. And we\u2019re optimistic and feel very strong that the relationship with Jet.com is going to offer us those opportunities. So, we\u2019re excited about that.","Amazon, our business with Amazon is performing well, not a huge update here, other than we\u2019ve seen really good sell-through on a limited selection of products that we\u2019ve offered. We\u2019ve said before that we want to work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that\u2019s important in any digital partnership that we enter into. We get the most out of our relationship when we work together to elevate that brand presentation. And one of the things we\u2019re going to continue to focus on is how we share data with our digital partners to advance that consumer experience. But we feel like the partnership with the Amazon is working or moving toward a mutually beneficial space. So, we\u2019re actually feeling good about where we are. And it\u2019s important that we stay focused and continue to look for those opportunities together.","Nitesh Sharan","Excellent. Thank you. Thank you, Jamie. All right.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon everyone. NIKE delivered strong results in fiscal year '19 growing 11% on a currency neutral basis, which outpaced our expectations from the beginning of the year. Our results are further proof that the demand for sport performance and athletic lifestyle product is thriving and our consumer direct offense is capturing more of that opportunity every day. ","What's most exciting is that we delivered broad-based growth through our complete portfolio. We saw that balance across our geographies, men's and women's and key categories. Overall fiscal '19 was the defining year for NIKE as we accelerated the high-impact capabilities of innovation, direct and speed that fuel our triple-double. Innovation continues to win with consumers not only in performance product but also in sportswear. In fiscal '19 new innovation platforms drove roughly 100% of our total incremental growth, which is exceeding the long-term target we laid out at Investor Day 2017. ","In digital we know we're just getting started. NIKE is accelerating our digital advantage and that focus led to 35% digital revenue growth. Speed remains an incredible opportunity, and we're well on our way towards cutting our product creation cycle in half and we're investing in responsive manufacturing, connected inventory and optimizing data to capitalize on real-time consumer demand. And finally throughout the year, our brand connected emotionally with a wider audience in more meaningful ways. ","Our triple-double, our focus on the triple-double is especially important in an environment like we're in right now, where geopolitical dynamics have led to trade tensions and foreign exchange volatility. We\u2019re certainly mindful of the risks, and more importantly we're in command of the conditions that are under our control. And that's serving the consumer and managing the leverage we have, delivering great products, engaging experiences and building our brand. ","Our greater China business is the blueprint for how all those dimensions come together. We added more than $1 billion of incremental growth in the geography over this past year. We are and remain a brand of China and for China. NIKE is proud of the investments we've made and the relationships we've developed in energizing this marketplace. We're confident that we will continue to grow sport and our business in China for decades to come. ","Now let's go deeper on the three capabilities that are NIKE's greatest catalysts for growth, and that's innovation, direct and speed. And I'll start with innovation. The consumer continues to tell us they want innovation to perform better as well as innovation that creates distinctions in their lifestyle product. Refueling that demand with styles like the Max 270, VaporMax and Max 720 which were amongst NIKE's top volume drivers for the year. ","The React platform too, expanded into sportswear led by the React Element 55, 87 and the Presto. In both React and Air innovations helped fuel sportswear to another 20% plus growth quarter in Q4. Looking ahead to fiscal year '20 we see great opportunity for both platforms to continue to carve out new space in the lifestyle markets. ","In performance footwear, basketball accelerated in Q4. The greatest growth continues to come from NIKE's own digital platforms where we have the most direct connection with the passionate basketball consumer. And signature shoes continue to lead the way, with KD, LeBron and KYRIE all growing double digits. And next month were looking forward to adding another exciting personality to the mix with the addition of Giannis and his first signature collection following his incredible MVP season. ","The Jordan Brand had a very strong year growing 12%. Jordan returned to a poor market in North America after we reset the marketplace earlier in the year. The Air Jordan 1 continues to be a global phenomenon, as we see success in both High Heat and In Line [ph] styles. ","In China we see a healthy balance between Jordan Lifestyle and performance product and we know there's still more opportunity for performance footwear in all geos. The new chapters of the Jordan growth story, apparel, women's and international are showing great potential. It's hard to overstate how important this year has been to the evolution of the women's offense at NIKE. The business grew double digits in fiscal \u201919, accelerating in the back half of the year. ","Our momentum in women's a great example of how our renewed focus is really moving the needle through thoughtful designs, powerful brand messages, and digitally led distribution. You're obviously seeing it now with all the energy around World Cup. ","To start the tournament nearly two-thirds of the teams wore NIKE kits and half the players wear our boots. The exposure is driving outstanding sell through in kits, high performance bras and lifestyle extensions. In fact, the USA Women's home jersey is now the number one soccer jersey men's or women's ever sold on NIKE.com in one season. ","For me personally, the groundswell of support around the world for the athletes and teams has been truly inspiring. Tomorrow, all eyes are going to be on the U.S. versus France. I know I can't wait to watch these two NIKE teams in what should be one of the top matches of the tournament. ","We're equally focused on delivering for the everyday athletes as we continue to fuel the broader movement of health and wellness around the world. Across the portfolio, we're serving women in more dimensions. This quarter we claimed the number one position in market share for bras in North America for the first time in NIKE\u2019s history. ","Through [indiscernible], and women's specific sneakers like the Air Max Dia, we fueled sportswear, footwear and apparel to strong double digit growth this quarter. And we're expanding our inclusive size and collections with over 90 styles across run, train and live. And later this year we\u2019ll unveil geography specific women's apparel for the Asian market based on our research of body types and sizes. ","One question I get asked a lot is how we plan to accelerate the growth in our Women's Business? In addition to the right product and inspirational brand experiences, the major unlock we see over the next several years is the opportunity that digital provides. Distribution is often one of our biggest barriers. And we continue to find that when we present product in a more future forward way, we\u2019re able to take the female consumer someplace new. And they're responding. ","Our Women's Business in NIKE Direct and through our digital platforms continues to outpace our performance in the wholesale channels. Digital and where digital meets physical will be tremendous sources of growth in women's moving forward. ","Another massive opportunity that we continue to obsess is apparel. At NIKE we have a number of advantages in our favor that we leverage. We work with the best athletes, leagues and federations and we celebrate them through moments like the World Cup, leagues like the NBA and partnerships like Jordan and PSG. We have multiple categories that surface deep consumer insights. ","Our apparel businesses this quarter grew double digits across basketball, training, and women's. And we have a world class design team that connects culture to sport in very creative ways. In fiscal year \u201819 we grew NIKE sportswear apparel over 20% into an over $3 billion business. ","With our core footwear business, we've talked about the importance of refreshing our collections for today's demanding consumer. Looking ahead, we're doing that with a steady flow of new core footwear that features Air Max and Zoom Air and we will introduce more innovation in the space. One example being our Renew platform. You'll also see added retail support from many of the new collections in this price range.","As we start fiscal \u201920, we're reloading with new platforms that will shape our innovation agenda for years to come. This week, we launched the new shoe that merges two of our most celebrated platforms, the Air Max React 270. And we have more hybrids in footwear on the way for the next several seasons. ","In the end of Q1 we\u2019ll unveil Joyride, which is a platform that I'm incredibly excited about. This new approach to cushioning will deliver a more personalized feeling for runners at every level. I've been wearing different versions over the last year, and it's extremely comfortable. We think the design has great potential to stand out with the consumer in both performance and lifestyle.","And finally, as we head into the back half of the fiscal year, we'll give full view into NIKE'S innovation pipeline for the Tokyo Olympics. We'll evolve 4%, a shoe that dominated metal stands [ph] into what we call next percent, which will deliver even greater measurable benefits to more athletes. You'll see sustainability that plays an even more elevated role in our design. And we'll deliver collections with more commercial potential than any other Olympics in our history.","As we look ahead, these innovations will serve as the foundation for NIKE products and collections well into fiscal '21 and beyond. These platforms are the launchpad for the future growth of our company.","Fiscal year '19 was also a year that we saw NIKE accelerate our digital advantage. I noted earlier that the 2X Direct is catalyzing our growth. Within Direct its digital, within digital, it's mobile. And within mobile, it's our apps. And all of this leverages and builds membership.","Our investments are enabling us to identify and better serve our members personally, which is driving higher consumer lifetime value. We've just passed 170 million total members in the NIKE Plus ecosystem ahead of the pace we communicated at Investor Day.","The sneakers app has become an incredible asset to our brand, with users checking in daily, and has acquired more new members than any other digital channel for NIKE. For the fiscal year, sneakers more than doubled his business, doubled its number of monthly active users, and now accounts for roughly 20% of our overall digital business.","The NIKE app, our most comprehensive one stop shop for NIKE products is quickly expanding with triple digit revenue growth in Q4. And in the first half of fiscal year '20, we will launch the NIKE app in China and in 13 new markets in EMEA. This will be an incredible addition to our business through a potential pool of hundreds of millions of new members.","The digital opportunity alone is tremendous. But just as promising is how digital and physical environments are intersecting and amplify each other. Our most effective test case thus far has been the NIKE app at retail, which links features of the NIKE app to our physical retail experiences. The NIKE app at retail is live in over 30 doors across the U.S., the UK and France. And we'll be scaling considerably throughout fiscal year '20, including in select factory stores.","A few of the insights that we gained in our early pilots are that physical retail can be an exponential driver of membership. Product scans in-store often fuel online purchases later. And in-store exclusive offers through mobile tend to drive higher conversion rates and outsized spending. We're in the early stages of this elevated way of serving the consumer in our own environments. ","At the same time, we're moving quickly to scale these features and connecting inventory with our wholesale partners. A stronger use of digital and physical retail is everyone's opportunities. Seamless, frictionless shopping is what the consumer expects today. This quarter, we introduced a new digital concept to address one of the most significant problems consumers face. And that's sizing in footwear. ","Our solution NIKE Fit scans the foot either through your smartphone camera, or through an in-store experience. We believe a more accurate understanding of a consumer size will not only minimize returns, reduce costs and drive healthier growth, the insights we gain will also improve the way NIKE designs and manufactures product. We're excited to roll out NIKE Fit in the U.S. and EMEA later in 2019. ","Our success through digital also relies on getting product to market faster. One way, we do that is through more responsive manufacturing. This summer we're making a significant investment in our manufacturing capabilities with an additional NIKE Air manufacturing center here in the United States. The consumer demand for NIKE Air is currently outpacing supply. This investment will help us better meet that demand and accelerate new innovations for one of our most distinct platforms. We will have more details coming in July. ","We also continue to build our capabilities in data and analytics, digital demand sensing and connected inventory to create a supply chain that anticipates and response to shifts in consumers demand quickly. Beginning in Q1, we placed RFID in nearly all NIKE footwear and apparel, which is hundreds of millions of products. RFID gives us the most complete view of our inventory that we have ever had. It's quickly becoming the most precise tool in our arsenal to meet an individual consumer specific need at the exact right moment. We will go live with this capability in Q1 across 20 NIKE Direct stores and then continue to scale across the fleet. ","Our sharper understanding of what's selling will also continue to inform our express lane, which is already driving higher full price sell through and better gross margins. In EMEA the Express Lane now totals over 20% of their business. A smarter use of data is also providing even more value to our most engaged NIKE consumers. One new model we're testing offers concept car footwear innovation from NIKE's leading designers to our most valued members in North America. This is a great opportunity to leverage member insights to serve them better and inform which products to scale. ","Finally, 2019 was a year in which the NIKE brand rose above and connected emotionally with consumers on another level. We broke through with a number of Just Do It campaigns that\u2019s celebrated our athlete's strengths. Over the course of fiscal '19, Just Do It generated an unprecedented 1.5 billion consumer engagements across our geographies and versus last year Google search volume for the words NIKE and Just Do It increased well over 100%. ","This quarter we also released our Impact Report showing the various ways that NIKE is taking meaningful action to protect the future of sport. We're working with communities of young people to increase activity with programs like Made to Play that reach 16 million kids. And we are investing in the training of over 100,000 coaches this year to mentor girls worldwide.","We're also minimizing our environmental footprint with a target of 100% renewable energy globally by 2025. We are driving sustainability at scale through recycled material in our aerosols, which is diverting 50 million pounds of waste from landfills each year. These are the kinds of steps and transparency that consumers expect today and as we share our stories we're bringing even more dimensions and value to the NIKE brand. ","NIKE itself, in making amazing products, inspiring through an iconic brand and leading through digital advantage. We're pushing the pace in all three facets and ended up with a formula for creating strong shareholder value. We're proud of the results our team delivered in fiscal '19, but more importantly, with an earnest future were confident that NIKE is investing in the right areas to extend our competitive advantage and continue to deliver sustained growth over the long-term. ","With that here's Andy. ","Andy Campion","Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon everyone on the call. As we close fiscal year '19 and we look ahead to fiscal year '20 three key themes stand out from the financial perspective. First NIKE is a growth company. Growth is how we measure the value we're creating for consumers and growth is paramount in terms of how NIKE creates value for shareholders. ","Second, NIKE's growth is being fueled by strategic transformation. Transformation is about deliberately driving acceleration toward what you aspire to be in the future, not about just extrapolating what you are today. Accordingly, transformation requires innovation, it requires continuous learning and it requires investment. ","Third, especially in times of geopolitical and FX volatility NIKE's currency neutral financial performance provides a clear view into our fundamentally strong growth, expanding profitability and potential to create extraordinary value for our shareholders. ","Let's first go a little deeper on growth. At our Investor Day in October 2017, we said that our new consumer direct offense would generate high single digit revenue growth on average over the next five years. In our first full year executing this new strategy we accelerated out of the box, with growth in fiscal year '19 that exceeded expectations. ","For the full year NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 11% on a currency neutral basis and 10% in the most recent quarter. At NIKE Scale that is roughly $4 billion of incremental revenue in just one year. Our growth is also broad-based with all four geographies growing at or above the long-term targets that we communicated for each geography at our Investor Day. ","Now that brings me to the second key theme. Our growth is being fueled by a strategic transformation of NIKE globally. At our investor day we said that over the next five years, we aspire to double the cadence and impact of innovation, to operate with greater speed and agility and to double our direct connection to consumers, leading with digital. These three pillars of our strategy were designed to drive global transformation and growth across our 12 key cities and 10 key countries. ","To help gauze the quality and impact of our growth, we also communicated several key measures of success. Today we are on pace to exceed on all of those measures. Take for example innovation. In fiscal year '19, we've already doubled the percentage of total revenue generated by recently launched innovation platforms as compared to fiscal year '17. We are delivering 2X innovation by prioritizing investment in platforms like React and Air that have greater potential to scale across both performance in sportswear.","As for Direct we are also ahead of pace, NIKE Direct drove roughly 50% of our incremental revenue growth in fiscal year '19, with NIKE digital growing 35% for the full year. Digital commerce own and partnered is on track to comprise at least 30% of our business by 2023. And longer-term we see digital driving the majority of our business. This kind of transformational growth doesn't happen by accident transformation requires investment. ","In fiscal year '19, we invested over $1 billion in new capabilities and consumer concepts that include significant investment in the sneakers app, the NIKE app, new store concepts leveraging digital, our NIKE Plus membership platform and enterprise wide data and analytics capabilities that are helping us serve NIKE consumers in new and better ways. ","With these long-term focused transformational investments, equating to nearly all of our incremental SG&A versus prior year we're clearly also editing and shifting within our legacy expenditures. As for the sneakers app we acquired Virgin Mega two years ago, a little over two years ago and have since invested organically in the team, digital tools, content creation and the geographic rollout of sneakers into 22 countries, and the returns on our investment has been extraordinary. The sneakers app that has accelerated from less than $70 million in revenue in fiscal year '16 to an annual run rate of over $750 million based on Q4 fiscal year '19 performance. ","We also invested significantly in the NIKE app. The NIKE app has extraordinary growth potential offering broader mobile access to NIKE's portfolio of products. In North America, NIKE app revenue is growing triple digits and we're just starting to roll out globally. As Mark mentioned, we'll launch the NIKE app in greater China in fiscal year '20. We're also investing in new store concepts that leverage digital including our two new houses innovation in New York and Shanghai and the smaller digitally enhanced format NIKE Live. ","These store concepts are exceeding plan revenue as they bring to life new ways of serving the consumer through the use of the NIKE app at retail. That brings me to the six significant investments we're making in our NIKE Plus membership platform. These investments have been largely organic, focused on building capabilities that help us know our consumers better to serve them in new ways. ","That said, we also acquired both Zodiac and Invertex roughly one year ago, to accelerate our membership offense. Zodiac has accelerated our ability to measure the impact of targeted service and product offerings on an individual's consumer lifetime value. While Invertex brought us computer visioning and volumetric based data and analytics that helped us create and bring NIKE Fit to market within just one year. ","As I said earlier, the third key theme from a financial perspective is that in times like these, NIKE's currency neutral financial performance, offers a clear reflection of NIKE's fundamentally strong growth, expanding profitability and potential to create value for shareholders. ","18 months ago, it appeared that harmonized global growth was beginning to turn foreign exchange into a slight tailwind for NIKE. However, geopolitical dynamics over the past year have led to dollar strengthening fueled largely by uncertainty around Brexit and U.S. China trade. ","So within fiscal year \u201819, alone, dollar strengthening drove FX headwinds of over $1.4 billion on our reported revenue versus our plan entering fiscal year \u201819 and nearly $300 million in EBIT after taking into account our hedges. ","We know that the foreign exchange headwinds of late may be transient. So we've remained primarily focused on the levers we can control in executing our strategy. And you see that in our currency neutral performance. Our strong currency neutral growth and margin expansion reflect NIKE's brand heat and distinction in North America and in all key international markets. The strength of our product portfolio and the transformation we're driving in the marketplace leveraging digital. ","Our SG&A growth in fiscal year '19 was a function of accelerating the investments required to drive transformation while gaining leverage in our core legacy expenditures. We are editing and shifting to gain leverage most notably within our geographies, where we're creating differentiated consumer experiences leveraging digital while optimizing on differentiated retail. ","That includes, for example, shifting many wholesale customers to what we call NIKE.net, an efficient digital platform for buying at wholesale. We're also testing new digital business models with respect to off price sales and optimizing our NIKE factory store fleet. Over the next three years, as we scaled it digital and drive more focused growth, we will increasingly edit and shift resources in targeted areas. ","One key financial measure that reflects NIKE's unrivaled ability to turn strategic investment into competitive advantage and growth is return on invested capital. In fiscal year \u201919 NIKE\u2019s industry leading adjusted ROIC expanded over 400 basis points. Going forward, we see continued strong growth, expanding margins, and high returns on invested capital as we drive strategic transformation at NIKE through the consumer direct offense. ","But before I share outlook for fiscal year '20 let's briefly touch on our strong Q4 results. NIKE Inc. Q4 revenue increased 4% on reporting real dollar basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis, with both meaningfully exceeding the expectations we communicated 90 days ago. For the full year NIKE Inc. revenue increased 7.5% on a reported basis, as strong 11% currency neutral growth was partially offset by FX headwinds. ","Gross margin expanded 80 basis points in Q4, also exceeding our guidance. Margin expansion was driven by strong full price sales, enhanced product profitability and NIKE Digital growth. For the full year gross margins expanded 90 basis points. SG&A grew 9% in Q4, and 10% for the full year as we drove brand distinctions, and heat through the Just Do It Dream cape crazy campaigns and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, while accelerating our investment in NIKE's digital transformation. ","Our effective tax rate was 20.4% for the quarter, and 16.1% for the full year, slightly above our guidance driven by earnings mix and quarterly volatility associated with the continuing impacts of U.S. tax reform. ","Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.62 and full year diluted EPS increased to $2.49. As of May 31 inventories were up 7% reflecting continued strong full price sell through and tight supply and supported strong forward looking demand. ","Now let's turn to the financial performance for our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 8% on a currency neutral basis with NIKE Digital leading all channels have strong double-digits.","Well, NIKE Digital continues to power our growth. NIKE is also growing double-digit and gaining significant share with our strategic wholesale partners. That includes strong double-digit growth for NIKE within Foot Locker, Dick's Sporting Goods and Nordstrom. Growth and share gains within these leading wholesale partners reflect NIKE's branding distinction in North America, and the strength of our product portfolio. ","Our footwear innovation continues to resonate and in apparel we see very strong demand. In some classifications so strong that it's putting pressure on our supply short-term. For the full year, North America's revenue increased 7%, amplified by strong gross margin expansion. ","Now let's move to EMEA where the NIKE brand continues to lead and drive meaningful separation. Revenue grew 9% in EMEA on a currency neutral basis in Q4, driven by double-digit growth in NIKE Direct across footwear and apparel and in all territories. In EMEA, the NIKE brand is stronger than ever. We're the number one brand in all five key cities in this region. And as we speak, we're creating an even deeper emotional connection to consumers through the Woman's World Cup in France. ","NIKE Digital continues to lead in EMEA, up 35% in the fourth quarter. Yet EMEA is another market where we are truly just getting started. As Mark mentioned, we will more fully leverage the power of mobile, launching the NIKE App into 13 additional countries in fiscal year '20. ","The strength of the NIKE brand in EMEA is also translating into strong double-digit growth and significant share gains with our strategic wholesale partners, most notably JD and Zalando. Note that our strong overall growth in EMEA in Q4 was also comping strong football apparel growth in the prior year fueled by the men's World Cup. For the full year, currency neutral revenue grew 11% and was amplified by strong gross margin expansion. On a reported basis, fiscal year '19 revenue grew 6%. ","Next, let's turn to Greater China, which grew 22% on a currency neutral basis in Q4. This marks the 20 consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in China. Growth was broad based across men's and women's performance in sportswear and led by digital.","NIKE digital grew 37% in Q4, fueled by the sneakers app and the strength of NIKE branded experiences with partners such as Tmall and WeChat. For the full year revenue in Greater China increase 24% on a currency neutral basis. On a reported basis, FY19 revenue was up 21%. We see continued strong growth in China in fiscal year '20. As a brand of China for China, we are building deep and meaningful relationships with the Chinese consumer. ","We're investing in our local team and talent, creating products specifically designed for the Chinese consumer, sponsoring China's top athletes federations and team and working closely with the Ministry of Sport and Education to fuel the passion for an increasing participation in sport and fitness in China. On that note, we're excited to amplify consumer's passion for basketball around the FIBA World Cup coming to China in Q1. ","Let's turn to APLA, where Q4 revenue grew 9% of the currency neutral basis. Growth was strong across nearly all territories. NIKE is a number one favorite brands in all 3 of our key cities in this diverse geographies, Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico City. NIKE is also the leading brand in Southeast Asia growing strong double-digits. Our growth in APLA is led by digital fueled by the entrepreneurial mindset we're taking with digital partners such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others. ","Looking ahead to fiscal year '20, we will signify expand out our NIKE own digital footprint through the scaling of our app eco system. ","For the full fiscal year APLA revenue increased 13% on a currency neutral basis and 2% on a reported basis, and finally at Converse fiscal year '19 revenue increased 3% on a currency neutral basis and 1% on a reported basis, fueled by China and Converse's new digital commerce platform. ","Looking forward, we have a new energized leadership team at Converse focused on fueling growth through product diversification, including reigniting Converse's authentic brand positioning in basketball. And that begin with the launch of the All-Star Pro BB basketball shoe in Q4. ","With that let's turn to our outlook for fiscal year '20. Our taxes intensified over the past couple of months, creating more of a headwind on a reported basis, then we envision when we spoke with you last quarter. That said, our currency neutral outlook continues to improve taking these offsetting dynamics into account, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal year '20. ","Our outlook for full-year reported revenue growth remains in the high single-digit range slightly exceeding our reported revenue growth in fiscal year '19. We expect another year of broad-based growth with all four geographies delivering on our long-term financial model. ","As for gross margin we expect expansion potentially approaching 50 basis points. To be clear, we see continued strong operational margin expansion that would otherwise exceed our long-term financial model but for two items, foreign exchange, and strategic supply chain investments such as RFID and expanding Air manufacturing innovation will create a roughly 50 basis points headwind on margin. That headwind is factored in to our guidance. ","As for SG&A we currently expect strategic investment, offset by productivity initiatives to result in very slight SG&A leverage in fiscal year '20. SG&A should eventually grow in line with revenue growth. As for OIE net interest expense we expect $50 million to $100 million of income for the year. We see our effective tax rate, in the mid to high teens range. That said we expect continued quarterly volatility based on the publishing of guidance relative to U.S. tax reform and other discrete items. ","Our primary focus is on the full-year and long-term. However, I'll provide a few specifics with respect to dynamics impact in Q1. In Q1 we expect reported revenue growth in line to slightly above our reported revenue growth in Q4. We expect currency neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range, offset by four points of the FX headwinds. Based on current FX rates the FX impact on revenue should largely abate from Q2 forward. It's also worth noting that in Q1 of fiscal year 19, we were already scaling React and Air Max 270 which had been launched in late fiscal year '18. ","Now in fiscal year '20 we will launch Joyride at the tail end of Q1 with scale and the launch of other new innovative products coming from Q2 forward. As for gross margin we expect to deliver flat to potentially 25 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q1. This reflects very strong underlying margin expansion fueled by NIKE direct growth and strong full price sales. That said FX will be an anomaly with gross margin in Q1. FX will be a 50 to 70 basis points headwind based on year-over-year foreign exchange rates, which moved significantly within Q1 of last year, as well as the timing of our hedge gains and losses. ","Assuming current rates we expect the impact of FX on margin to be much less material over the balance of the year.","As for SG&A we're projecting growth in the high single digit range in line with the rate of currency neutral revenue growth. As for OIE net of interest expense we expect roughly $0 to $15 million of income in Q1 and we see our effective tax rate in the mid to high teens range in Q1. ","As we enter fiscal year '20 we are poised for another year of strong sustainable profitable growth and value creation. The NIKE brand is stronger than ever. We have a robust pipeline of innovation to bring to market. And we will continue to strategically transform NIKE and extend our digital advantage. ","With that will now open up the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. ","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. Good afternoon, sorry. It's been a long day. I guess just the first question I have is on China, I was just wondering if you could, go a little deeper in terms of strength of basketball and China apparel running. And just sort of what you see on the ongoing basis with the strong results and your expectation. I think you said continued growth the next decade. Just are you seeing any pressure there from the consumer around American brand? ","It doesn't appear so in the numbers, but I just wonder if anything's changing, from that perspective. And just wondering if you could maybe just update us a little bit on how you guys are thinking about, some of the trade discussions that continue to unfold here in the U.S. ","Mark Parker","Great, thanks for the question, Bob. Firstly, your first question, which was around the drivers of growth in China categorically. The short answer is over the course of fiscal year \u201819. All categories real growth in China with the exception of global football, and that relates to the comp versus last year's World Cup. The primary drivers of growth of the biggest drivers of growth. We're making sportswear, basketball, Jordan, running group training, but in general, extremely broad based across men's and women's and while led by digital, also broad based across the marketplace.","And then to your question about seeing impact from the U.S. China dynamics of late we have not seen any impact on our business to-date. And we continue to see strong momentum as we enter fiscal year \u201820. ","The consumer sentiment around NIKE in China has been actually quite strong. We've made a lot of effort through the years to connect with the marketplace to take insights to use to drive innovation and messaging that is really, as we said, urban for China. So we're seeing that continue. And it's showing up in the results. I'm really proud of the team in China, we have and the complete offense kind of results that we're seeing coming out of China.","Bob Drbul","And just on basketball. I just wonder if I could just zone in on a follow up. But it sounds as if NIKE has capitalized on the NBA jersey opportunity, recently created by designer RJ Barrett, ahead of the NBA free agency, what raw material colors have you guys staged, blue and orange or purple and gold? Can you just give us some insight in terms of how you\u2019re positioning for this weekend and the next few weeks?","Mark Parker","Good one. Okay. You obviously figured out March [ph] in my hometown? Yeah. Right. You got the coast covered? Well, okay. We got the spectrum covered -- the color spectrum. So we're ready for anything, certainly blue and orange, and purple and gold. But, yeah. No other insights other than I think we got the bases covered. Yeah. Thanks Bob. ","Bob Drbul","Thank you. Good luck. ","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, operator we\u2019ll take the next question, please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Lauren Cassel ","Great, thanks so much. Could you maybe quantify the impact that the supply chain investments had on gross margin during the fourth quarter? And then my second question is just where do we sit here at the end of the fiscal year in terms of your manufacturing exposure to China? What percentage of that is coming into the U.S.? And then just any, any commentary on -- if he wouldn't raise prices, et cetera, should this go through?","Andy Campion","I'll take your first question on supply chain investments. The short answer is roughly 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. And just to clarify, those, that is because we capture investments that may be for the long term and our other cost of goods sold within margin. So it can be somewhat distorted in terms of current quarter product profitability. ","Mark Parker","And Lauren, your second question again, sorry, was pricing levers with respect to China is that\u2026 ","Lauren Cassel","Yeah just the current manufacturing exposure to China? I think you guys have been, actively sort of trying to diversify just where do we sit at the end of the year and how much of that is coming into the U.S.?","Andy Campion","Sure, I'll take that one as well. We, we continue to source product in China. We continue to source product in China. We do externally report that we produce about a quarter of our product in China for the globe. Our exposure in terms of product produced in China to North America is relatively modest. At the same time we see a great opportunity to continue and potentially expand the production of product in China, for China and for other markets. ","The short of it is we've got a relatively agile approach to sourcing multiple nodes from a production and distribution perspective. And so while the dynamics are certainly -- while it is certainly dynamic out there with respect to trade, we're relatively well positioned as we always have been for macro dynamics. ","Mark Parker","And we see China continuing to be a critical part of our source space. For China, but also other parts of the world that will continue. Thank you, Lauren. ","Lauren Cassel","Thank you so much. ","Nitesh Sharan","Operator will take the next question, please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions, I appreciate it. So of course, I want to talk a bit. We -- there -- clearly your currency neutral results were quite strong here, actually, very strong. There were indications of weakness elsewhere in Southwest in the United States. The question I have on that is, as you look at the data closer than we could, was there any more -- were there any more top line challenges through the period that maybe not been totally reflected in the aggregate results?","Andy Campion","One challenge from a top line perspective is frankly a nice problem to have, Brian, which is, as we enter the year we've got a particularly strong demand. Its broad based and a couple of years where we have very strong demand relate to Air, NIKE AIR, which is obviously a distinctive innovation relative to NIKE. So to your point about dynamics out there in the marketplace, we've got an innovation that is obviously closely tied to and really powerful within our portfolio that being NIKE AIR. And as Mark mentioned, in his remarks, we are actually expanding our investment in Air manufacturing in the U.S., and that is directly related to demand that we weren't able to fully capture in the second half of this past year. ","In other areas and apparel got very strong growth in apparel. And we're ramping up supply with respect to a few classifications where our revenue growth could have been greater based on the demand in the marketplace, particularly around fleece. ","And then just overall, when we speak about our growth, we said that it's not really an extrapolation. It's not really just a correlation to what's going on in the market. It's about a transformation in NIKE. And most notably, that transformation is being fueled by innovation. So we're creating something new and different in the marketplace and digital. Again, we're creating something new and different in the marketplace in terms of the digital connection we have with consumers. ","Mark Parker","A couple of other areas I call out quickly. There's the performance has actually been very strong. But I think there's more opportunity for us going forward. I mentioned women's and how we have double-digit growth for the year and it's been accelerating through the fourth quarter. But we're actually very bullish on the opportunity in women's going forward as we move into fiscal '20. ","And then also called out core product under $100 price point products within footwear. And we have a whole refresh coming in the sort of core zone, not only with existing technologies being leveraged in that space, but unique design work that is going to refresh about 75% of that the styles in that product zone for NIKE. So that's going to create some more opportunity for us.","Brian Nagel ","That's all. ","Andy Campion","Thank you, Brian.","Brian Nagel ","I appreciate the detail. Thank you.","Nitesh Sharan","All right. Operator, we'll take our next question, please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Omar Saad ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two questions actually, I wanted to ask first about your comments on RFID inventory, sharing the inventory in the wholesale channel. Kind of wondering what you're thinking about longer term, how you see inventory and inventory management evolving. What the opportunities are to either manage it differently, especially as you talk about matching kind of more diverse consumer demand more accurately? ","And then my second question on the SNKRS app, obviously explosive growth there. How do you think about as you scale that platform, I don\u2019t know the saturation is the right word but how do you keep that growing and also keep it special and did you see, how big is that runway to create those unique experience for consumers through that platform before it starts to lose the special? Thanks.","Mark Parker","Let me just touch on the RFID question first Omar. As I mentioned you were launching RFID across essentially we're in apparel beginning in the fall '19 season and that\u2019s going to enable all the footwear, the majority I should say of non-licensed apparel, through RFID and there QR technology. So that\u2019s a big upside for us in terms of our capability to dramatically improve our inventory visibility and accuracy. I think across the marketplace and throughout the supply chain. And ultimately that's going to allow us to serve consumers with the product that they want, when they want it. ","So the consumer up upside on this is actually quite powerful. And then we're going to rollout through fiscal '20 and scale the capabilities that we have within RFID globally across our own doors and over time I think we see RFID is a key capability throughout owned and partner retail supply chains. So I think this will help us create the capability to grow profitably across the breadth of the portfolio and ultimately, again it's putting ourselves in position to serve consumers in a way that gets them the product that they need when they want it and where they want it. ","Andy Campion","And then Omar I will take your question on sneakers. We still see tremendous opportunity with respect to sneakers. I will give you some dimension on where we see that opportunity. In terms of what you referred to as kind of special nature of the product that were launching on sneakers. We still supply a very small percent of the demand that were seeing on sneakers. In fact just this morning, we launched a few pretty unique collaboration and again saw sell out within minutes. That\u2019s fantastic in terms of the heat that some of our styles create, but also an opportunity. ","Couples of other opportunities within sneakers are apparel. What we done with apparel and in limited cases where we've launched apparel either collaboration or apparel innovation we see an incredible demand and we really have. It's almost overstating it to say we scratched the surface in terms of the heat we can create and connectivity to consumers around apparel. ","Women's is another great opportunity through the sneakers app and then two last dimensions I speak to product creation, that's done with the membership data that we get through the sneakers app in mind. ","We launched the shoe in this past year. Based on data and analytics relatively Dominican community in New York, which was incredibly well received based on demand and branch. Around that we also see the opportunity, as Mark touched on, to launch innovation directly to members. Sneaker is for people who love the innovation that we provide in the app. ","And then finally, what both of us touched on is we often focus on the businesses that we have here in North America because we all experience them as consumers here in North America but we got a tremendous potential to continue to expand the sneakers app globally geographically in markets around the world. ","Mark Parker","I have to add that the core answer to your question about sustaining the heat in sneakers is going to be the product itself. So the strength of the product, how we refresh it, making sure supply demand is in the right ratio and now the whole experience on sneakers is going to continually evolve I think to make it a very compelling kind of have to check back in day to day comp experience.","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you, Omar. ","Omar Saad","Understood. Thank you. ","Nitesh Sharan","Operator we will take our next question please. ","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Jim Duffy","Thanks. Hope you're all doing well. I\u2019m interested in the comments on digital and physical intersection and how successful that's been recruiting new customers to the digital ecosystem. Does that make you rethink the role of physical retail in the go to market strategies? And then maybe this will dovetail with my second question. With respect to the key city strategies, are there cities you would highlight as being further along in demonstration of the efficacy of that strategy? ","Mark Parker","Well, we see the first of all, the intersection of physical and digital is going to continue to be more and more intimate relationship. I think we're looking at a lot of experimentation, trial and error learning from some of the tests that we're doing. Ultimately, it's about making the experience physically or digitally more richer, more dimensionalized experience for consumers. We are saying where we have those digital connections through like NIKE app at retail, we're seeing the engagement from consumers rise significantly. And the actual spend per consumer in those cases actually jumps up dramatically. ","So this is something that we don't think it's just a -- it's not just a current trend, this is the future of the fusion of digital and physical is going to continue. And this is a huge priority. It's a source of investment for us. It's ultimately around how do we better serve customers members. And you'll continue to see us evolve that dramatically. And our ambition is to lead in that space. ","Andy Campion","And then to your question, on key cities, we're seeing over indexing growth in our key cities as compared to the countries in which they are. We're also seeing over indexing results from a brand perspective. Our brand is the number one brand in each of those key cities. I would tell you that in terms of prioritization, which I think was the spirit of your question, our priorities have been in bringing our Consumer Direct Offense to life, first in London, New York, and Shanghai. ","So that's where you see us having invested in the new houses of innovation in New York and Shanghai, which do -- that is a bit of a segue from what Mark was just speaking to merging physical and digital in an experience that the consumer really hasn't had for NIKE or anyone else in the marketplace. Those experiences have well exceeded our expectations. ","LA is another market where we've started to bring this to life with our smaller format, concept NIKE Live. So I would say that to answer your question, in short, London, New York and Shanghai, I think, are the cities where we're furthest along. But we've got really energized teams in each of the key cities. In fact, we just had all of our key city teams not just jammed together here a couple of weeks ago, at our headquarters to share best practices and learnings and align on how to leverage what we can create globally or in one key city and another key city. So we really think feel great about the progress we're making against that offense. ","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Jim. Operator, we will take our last question, please. ","Operator","Your last question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Your line is open. ","Sam Poser ","Thank you for taking my question. I was really wondering, about how you view your brands. As a follow-up on how you view your brand's perceived in China. Somebody said that you were perceived -- other brands were perceived as American or U.S. brands or German brands. But NIKE is perceived as NIKE. Love to get your comment on that. And I have one other question.","Andy Campion","Sure, Sam, thanks for the question. I'll start. Yes, as both Mark and I said, our approach has been to be of China for China. And that's not a new approach. That approach is not based on dynamics of late. That's been the approach we've had in for China for two, three decades. And it ranges from the strong leadership team we have in place there with local talent that understands the consumer. Obviously, in our history, it dates back to our sourcing of product in China. ","Over the years, it's been about us fueling the passion for sport and participation in sport, not simply being a commercial enterprise in China, but having a bigger view in terms of the purpose and the impact that we could create, in terms of the lively consumers in China. ","And then that last point extends to our relationship with the Ministry of Sport and Education. Our partnerships there as well as our partnerships, more probably out in front in terms of the global impact of the teams, athletes and Federation's in China, but why we're invested in sponsoring those teams and athletes and federations is because of their impact on local consumers in China.","Sam Poser","Thank you. And then secondly -- ","Mark Parker","And also as the insights that we're getting for China are actually helping us create China -- products that's more relevant for China but also other parts of the world. So this isn't about importing Western concepts into China as much as it is trying to actually take the insights we gain in China and use it to enrich our global position as a brand and as a product offering. So it's truly not just local for local. It's China putting us in a position to be a better global company. ","Sam Poser","Thank you. And then just to follow-up on a prior question. The RFID, does this mean with your core partners, Nordstrom and Foot Locker and so on Dick's and so on, that you will be able to overtime, interact with them and maybe interact between your systems to be able to make your inventory act as a whole more efficiently?","Mark Parker","Yes. Sorry. Sam, did you add more to that question. Go ahead. ","Sam Poser","Well, yes, and I'd love color and may add something else. But go from there.","Mark Parker","Yes. RFID provides us an opportunity to do what we aspire to do, which is connect the marketplace and do that through our NIKE Direct business, but also through strategic wholesale partners, partners that we view as being part of the NIKE Network of the future. We are already testing the use of RFID in being able to give consumers greater visibility into product down to the style, color and size that they're looking for. ","And I'd say that's probably the sharpest and most intuitive aspect of this opportunity is visibility into the inventory for a company like NIKE with the breadth and depth of our portfolio is somewhat limited across our broad distribution within the marketplace, being able to leverage our RFID to give almost 100% visibility into what we have, by style, color and size across our marketplace is an incredible opportunity in terms of meeting consumer demand real time in the moment. ","Sam Poser","And then lastly, for your speed initiative -- with your speed initiative, how long do you get to double the speed or beyond that this RFID will certainly help that?","Andy Campion","Yes. Well, that's one of the measures of success. We feel really good about the progress we're making. On doubling the percentage of products and what we call one half the time to market. We've seen some really strong results over the past year. And we expect that to continue through the next year. And a lot of that effort is led by what we call the Express Lane. And Express Lane as I mentioned, I think, I commented that 20% of our product, sale revenue in EMEA is actually coming from our Express Lane initiative. ","So we see the speed initiative for NIKE, the time to market cut in half initiative, really accelerating through this next fiscal year. And it's ultimately going to be a big competitive advantage for us.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Sam. And thank you, everybody. Thanks. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. Bye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2012 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Charlie Denson, President of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark G. Parker","Thanks, Kelley, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter of double-digit growth for NIKE, Inc. NIKE, Inc. revenue for the quarter grew 15% to $5.8 billion. Earnings per share grew 11% to $1.20 and NIKE Brand global futures grew 15%.","That performance illustrates what NIKE is all about, and as the relentless flow of innovation to serve athletes, celebrate sports and create opportunities for everyday athletes to connect with NIKE and each other around the world.","Collaboration is essential to how we innovate and grow. At NIKE, that always starts with insights from athletes, from the elite competitor to the everyday athlete. And it expands from there to include partners inside and outside our industry who inspire new ways of thinking; our retail partners, our manufacturing partners, universities, technology companies, NGOs, entrepreneurs and many more.","In our business, it's collaboration and the ability to consistently innovate that create momentum and fuel long-term growth. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.","When all met here on the NIKE campus last June, I said, \"We're entering a time of unprecedented and game changing innovation.\" And that's what you saw from NIKE in Q3, and there's much more to come. We introduced the NIKE FuelBand, incredibly simple, intuitive and powerful. Not only are we leveraging digital technology, we're advancing it by creating broader assets for people who love sports, seek fitness and thrive on competition.","The FuelBand is more than a digital device. It's really an invitation for athletes of all levels to pursue their true potential. We also delivered a new generation of Nike+ in basketball and training, extending the reach of digital tools to make athletes better.","The FuelBand and Nike+ deliver on the most important aspects of a young athlete's life, and that's the ability to train more efficiently, compete more successfully and then connect more personally with the global community of athletes. And because we give consumers opportunities to reach their potential, we create opportunity for NIKE to reach its own.","In the last 90 days, we redefined state-of-the-art and lightweight performance product, digital connectivity and sustainable innovation. We are going to see it all come to life on the Olympic stage in London. The NIKE Pro TurboSpeed suit, our leanest most sustainable fastest tracksuit ever; Nike Hyper Elite basketball uniforms, ultra light and sustainable; the Nike Hyperdunk basketball shoe, with the latest in Flywire and Lunar technology. And my personal favorite innovation of Q3, Nike Flyknit technology. Flyknit allows us to knit a shoe upper in one piece. It's a revolutionary manufacturing method that requires less labor and virtually eliminates waste. The result is a shoe that represents the very pinnacle of performance and a new standard in sustainability. Flyknit has the potential to change everything.","And the Olympics are just the beginning. The real power of NIKE comes to life when we commercialize these innovations for our consumers. We did the same thing in 2008 at the Beijing Games. That\u2019s where we reintroduced Flywire and Lunar line. Today, Lunar alone generates nearly $2.0 billion in revenue at retail.","Q3 was a milestone in performance technology. But it's not just performance technology where NIKE, Inc. delivers. We have 7 high-energy brands that connect with consumers on all levels in and around sports; physically, culturally and emotionally.","Converse is a great example, very strategic in how we combine franchises like Chuck Taylor, with ways for consumers to customize their products in store. A great Q3 for Converse, delivering another quarter of double-digit revenue growth.","It's clear that we have some serious innovation in our pipeline and powerful momentum in the marketplace. And our timing is great as we head into an exciting season of sport that starts in a few days with the Final Four, and then builds toward the Olympics and Euro Champs. These are the moments we love.","We thrive on world-class competition, on the field and in our industry. We're ready to compete on all fronts and well positioned to win because of the strength of our portfolio. As I've said many times, our portfolio is not just our brands but all the products, categories, geographies and people that bring them to life. And we're continually looking for ways to become smarter, quicker, more connected and creative.","The momentum at NIKE is not defined by events. And it's not just a burst of energy that burns bright and then fades quickly. We create and leverage momentum by investing in big ideas over the long term. Ideas that deliver benefits to consumer and value to our shareholders.","Look at NIKEiD, Nike Free, Nike+ or Flywire. We knew we have radical new concepts that offer tremendous potential. What we didn't have was a guarantee of their success. But we knew that they were big ideas that deserved our full focus and investment. And that focus continues to pay off.","Today, they're all icons of performance and design that help NIKE grow the marketplace and drive differentiation and separation for our brands around the world.","Looking to Q4 and beyond, we'll see continued challenges from the global economy, mostly around unemployment, debt and currency issues brought on by political uncertainty. And while some raw material costs are starting to ease, we have not seen them retreat to their previous levels, for other input costs such as labor, upward pressure continues.","That said, I believe there are some stability easing back into the broader marketplace as consumer confidence moves higher in most parts of the world. At the same time, we don't let these external forces define us. Our innovation agenda, brand strength and supply-chain leverage are among the many levers we have to drive margin expansion over the long term, and we see opportunity to do so moving forward.","My job as CEO and that of my entire leadership team is to optimize every resource, to fine-tune our competitive advantages and deploy them against the biggest opportunities, and there are many. I see incredible potential for growth right in front of us in our core businesses and out on the horizon driven by growing economies, new technologies and the evolving global marketplace.","I see a new era of innovation where more products are high performance and sustainable, for digital technology continually expands the experience and the community of athletes, where kids have more access to sports, where new technologies usher in a revolution in manufacturing and sport rises to unite and inspire young people around the world. And we will continue to invest wisely and aggressively in those game-changing ideas that will drive us toward our full potential.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Charlie to take a look at the NIKE Brand.","Charles D. Denson","Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everybody. Well The NIKE Brand delivered a lot of great innovation this quarter. Consumers expect that from us and is what fueled the type of results we're seeing.","On a constant currency basis, global revenue for the NIKE Brand was up 16%. Global futures are up 18%. We grew revenues in every geography except for Japan, which is still recuperating from that devastating event from last year. And all 7 of our key categories increased revenue, with 5 growing at double-digit rates. And our brand DTC revenue increased over 20%, driven by comp store growth in both factory and in-line doors, as well as online sales increasing by over 25%.","We consistently refer to 3 key components in our ongoing success: product innovation, brand strength and premium distribution. That's what drives our growth. So let's start by looking at Basketball.","In Q3, we saw the return of the NBA and we launched 4 signature shoes: the Air Jordan 2012; the Nike Kobe VII System Supreme; the 5th signature shoe for L.A. Clipper Chris Paul and a new Kevin Durant shoe called Zoom KD 4. We also saw a new Air Force 1 Low Supreme and a little shoe called the Zoom Foamposite \u201cGalaxy\u201d One, which brought people out to the stores by the thousands.","On the Apparel side, we launched the new Hyper Elite uniforms for 9 leading college teams heading into March Madness in the NCAA tournament.","On the Brand side, we're extending the Nike+ community of more than 6 million registered users into the world of basketball with the release of the Hyperdunk Plus [ph]. For the first time, you can digitally track your speed, quickness, vertical jump, as well as generate NikeFuel points. And the data transmits directly to your smartphone, where you can share it with all your friends.","As Mark has said many times, the power of digital technology and social media is undeniable. And the Nike+ platform is the perfect way to engage in your quest to become a better athlete.","Driven by the strength of our innovation and unique consumer connections, the Basketball category delivered another great quarter, with revenue up double digits again in Q3.","That takes us to Running. The Running category continues to post strong results as we head into the home stretch of the fiscal year. Participation is way up, road races are seeing capacity levels, and we're heading into the Summer Olympics. We have a heritage of innovation in Running, and not just incremental changes but fundamental shifts and performance, things like Nike Air, Nike Shox, Free, Lunar and many more. And we're doing it again with a new generation of digital products and services that help the Nike runner -- that help Nike Running increase revenue by strong double digits. It's the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for the Running category.","The last call out on a category basis would be Football. We're working on with the national teams from France, Poland, Holland, Portugal and Croatia as we head into the 2012 Euro Champs. And, of course, we have Umbro on the inside, working with the English national team, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland.","Football is really a case study in how we dimensionalize innovation for our consumers. A great example will be the product lines for the French national team. We built footwear and apparel for every part of the athlete's life; when they compete, when they train and when they want to express themselves off the field. We call it Amplify Sport, and it's a very powerful way to expand and grow both our performance, as well as our Sportswear business around the world.","This summer is the perfect showcase for our Football business. And as I mentioned on the last call, the Olympics are the biggest sporting event in the world. But if you're a European, it's the Euro Champs that really stoke your national pride. And we're going to see some amazing stories play out in Europe this summer.","Before I leave Football, I want to mention the kind we play here in the U.S. If you watch the Pro Bowl game, you caught a glimpse of what's coming with our Vapor cleats, gloves and socks. Initial response to the product has been great, and orders so far have exceeded all of our expectations. We're incredibly excited about the potential of our partnership with the NFL. I'm confident we'll create a lot of positive energy when we launch this product on April 3 in New York City and when the jerseys hit the shelves during the NFL Draft later in the month.","All right. So let's visit a few of the key geographies and starting with North America. In Q3, we saw another great performance in North America with revenue increasing 17% and 6 of our 7 key categories growing at a double-digit pace. I consistently refer to the North American marketplace as the best example of our category offense in action. It's where we have our deepest retail partnerships and where DTC business is most advanced.","DTC in North America grew 19% in Q3 with all concepts in line, factory and digital as compared to last year. Truly amazing results. If I haven\u2019t been working here for the last 33 years, I'd swear, North America might even be considered an emerging market.","We talk a lot about our mission and our ability to lead and transform the marketplace. In North America that means having our hands on all the levers, across channels, up and down price points, online and in-store with our partners. It also includes our NIKE-owned category and brand stores. We believe this comprehensive approach as relevant in other key markets around the world. Not all markets are alike or at the same level of development, but the fundamentals are the same.","Let's go to Western Europe. Today, we reported a 6% constant currency revenue growth for Q3 and double-digit growth in futures. These results were driven by strong sales of performance products. Going forward, we're encouraged by the energy and the passion that the Olympics and the European Championships will create this summer throughout the European marketplace.","That said, we are nowhere near our full potential in Europe. Yes, the economic challenges are significant but so is our ability to inspire athletes and reward consumers.","We represent 2 of the most powerful forces in any market, innovation and sports. As we leverage these forces, we are focusing on what matters most. We will use our strong performance positioning in Running and Football to drive our Sportswear business across the geography. And we're looking to our Apparel and Women\u2019s businesses to supply additional growth. We believe Western Europe is still a growth market.","Finally, let's take a minute on China. Q3 revenue in China grew 21%, driven by a 30% growth in Footwear but only a 6% growth in Apparel, a strong performance for sure. We continue to hold the top spot for sports brand in China by a considerable margin. Consumers there are becoming more sophisticated and discerning. They, too, value innovation and premium experiences, and that plays to our strengths. Of course, China is a very dynamic marketplace, and we've seen the benefits and the challenges of that.","While our brand in Footwear business is strong, we're working to elevate the product and presentation in our Apparel business. We're doing that in 3 ways: first, clearing the market of excess inventory; second, bringing more performance product into the market and using that to position and drive Sportswear, consistent with our Amplified Sport approach; and third, optimizing the performance potential of our distribution footprint.","Before I hand it off to Don, I want to offer some brief context on the inventory and gross margins. Both are improving, but not as fast as we had expected and the reasons for that are connected.","Inventory growth slowed in Q3 and the number of units on-hand at the end of the quarter was actually lower than we expected. We're very encouraged by this. However, the per unit cost of that inventory was higher than we expected, driven largely by input cost inflation and product mix.","Year-end inventories were a bit higher than we'd like in some parts of our business, most notably sportswear apparel in China and Europe. We're applying strategic product discounts and leveraging our factory stores to clean up this legacy inventory. At the same time, we're answering new demand, driven by innovations like the partnership with the NFL.","As a result, we expect to see inventory growth above revenue growth through the first half of FY '13, striking the right balance to assure we seize new opportunity and deliver on top line growth.","On gross margin, we're also seeing improvement. Although again, not quite at that pace we expected. Just as higher input costs are showing up in our inventory numbers, gross margin continues to be affected by these headwinds. Additionally, gross margins were impacted by our efforts to manage down our inventories in select markets and keep the marketplace clean.","On the plus side, we're beginning to see the benefit of higher prices flow through. Generally, we are seeing consumer acceptance on pricing around the world. This continues to be validated by our futures numbers. We know that consumers will continue to seek out innovative, compelling products, consumer services and the overall consumer experience. Our intent is to continue to provide them with that, with a couple of surprises along the way.","So finally, looking ahead, Mark opened with a reference to our ability to make smart, strategic investments and big ideas that have long-term potential. The products and services we released in New York this past quarter is exactly that, an incredible opportunity for franchise and technology concepts that will take NIKE well into the future.","And we have more leapfrog moments just around the quarter in Brazil with World Cup 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. But first, we're going to go to Europe. We have an amazing story to tell. And we're going to make sure we tell it well.","Thanks, everybody. So here's Don.","Donald W. Blair","Thanks, Charlie. I'd like to begin with 3 key points we'd like you to take away from today's call. One, that our largest businesses continue to demonstrate powerful momentum, fueled by innovative products and deep consumer connections. Two, that we have tremendous opportunities for growth, and we're investing in them. And three, that we'll continue to balance investing for long-term growth and delivering near-term financial performance.","Let's take the first point. Powerful momentum in our largest businesses. As Charlie told you earlier, the NIKE Brand delivered tremendous performance in Q3 with broad-based growth across the NIKE Brand portfolio, particularly significant are the results we're seeing in North America, where execution of the category offense across product, brand and distribution is driving tremendous growth in all of our key categories in both Footwear and Apparel, performance product and Sportswear, Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s.","We've made great progress over the last few years but haven't yet reached the full potential of the category offense even in North America. And we believe we have greater opportunities internationally.","We also see tremendous growth and potential at Converse. Year-to-date, Converse revenues are up 17% to $1 billion, reflecting consistent growth in North America and successful market conversions in the U.K. and China over the last 18 months.","On a wholesale equivalent basis, Converse is already a $2.5 billion global brand with incredible, untapped opportunities for growth.","Point two, we're investing in our growth opportunities. I share Mark and Charlie's excitement about the innovations we launched in the third quarter, as well as what is yet to come. These innovations are delivering game-changing products for lead athletes and compelling products and experiences for consumers. They also give you an early look at some of the technologies we're deploying in our supply chain to make high-performance products using fewer resources, both materials and labor.","I also shared their enthusiasm for this summer's global sporting events. Sport at the highest level, NBA, Olympics, European Championships and NFL, are unique opportunities to drive our brands and showcase innovation. We're convinced that delivering disruptive innovation and telling those innovation stories on the world's biggest stages will drive our growth and profitability into the future. We'll be investing in both.","My final point is that we remain committed to investing to the future and delivering near-term profitability. As we've said today, we\u2019re very excited about the momentum of our brands in the marketplace, the quality of our innovation pipeline and the unique opportunities we have to tell those brand and innovation stories on the world stage. These strengths give us confidence in our ability to deliver profitable growth into the future.","At the same time, we continue to face near-term headwinds from input cost inflation and a stronger dollar. Against this backdrop, we're optimizing our business by proactively managing the gross margin equation through pricing and cost reduction initiatives, while focusing our resources on the highest potential opportunities.","Our ultimate goal remains sustainable, profitable growth. And to achieve that, we'll continue to invest for the future, while delivering appropriate profit growth in the near term.","With that context, here\u2019s a recap of our Q3 results. Third quarter revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 15%, reflecting a 16% currency neutral increase, driven by continued robust growth by the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses led by Converse.","As Charlie mentioned earlier, NIKE Brand futures orders advanced 18% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting double-digit growth for each key category except Sportswear, which grew at a mid-single-digit rate. Unit orders increased 10%, with an additional 8 points of growth from a higher average price per unit, largely the result of price increases we implemented for spring and summer.","Third quarter diluted EPS grew 11% to $1.20 as strong revenue growth, SG&A leverage and the benefits of a lower share count were partially offset by a decline in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate.","Gross margin for Q3 decreased 200 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by product cost inflation, partially offset by higher prices. While these higher prices have only recently reached the retail marketplace, so far, we're pleased with sell-through at retail.","Gross margin continue to improve sequentially in Q3, although still not as fast as we had anticipated given actions taken to manage inventories in some markets.","SG&A grew significantly slower than revenue in Q3, partially offsetting the impact of lower gross margins. Demand creation grew 6% for the quarter, well below the rate of revenue growth as we concentrate our marketing investments on telling innovation and brand stories in Q4.","Operating overhead grew 12% for the quarter, reflecting high-teens growth in Direct to Consumer costs and low double-digit growth for wholesale and corporate overhead.","The effective tax rate for Q3 was 27.3%, 1.3 percentage points higher than the prior year, mainly due to onetime items that increased the rate this year and reduced the rate last year. We now expect a full year effective tax rate of 25%.","Our balance sheet and capital productivity remained strong as we continue to increase our return on invested capital and generate cash. Although working capital levels have risen from unusually low levels last year, our trailing 12-month ROIC increased to 22.9%, up 1.7 points versus the prior year.","And in Q3, we generated $215 million of free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $517 million.","As Charlie indicated, inventory growth showed sequential improvement as a result of slowing growth in unit inventories. At both the NIKE, Inc. and NIKE Brand levels, inventory value increased 32% versus last year. About 20 percentage points of the NIKE Brand increase came from higher cost per unit, primarily the result of input cost inflation and a higher proportion of footwear units versus apparel.","The remaining 12 percentage points of growth were due to higher unit inventories, the result of strong demand and increased inventory in transit due to improved factory deliveries. We place a high priority on managing the inventory on our books and in the marketplace. For most of our businesses, we're comfortable with inventory levels and trends. The majority of the growth in inventory is in North America, the emerging markets and China Footwear, businesses where demand is extremely strong. And we continue to strengthen our network of factory stores, which give us a highly profitable vehicle for managing the marketplace.","We do have higher inventories than we'd like in some areas, most notably sportswear apparel in Europe and China. We're working with our wholesale partners to manage existing inventory. And we've been adjusting our buys to rebalance supply and demand for these businesses. Going forward, we'll continue to work diligently to manage inventory risk and maintain a healthy retail marketplace.","That said, we now expect a rate of $1 inventory growth to remain above revenue growth through the first half of fiscal 2013.","Now let's take a look at our performance by segment. Q3 revenue for North America grew 17% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, fueled by double-digit growth in every key category except Nike Sportswear, which grew at a high single-digit rate.","For Q3, Footwear revenue increased 15% and Apparel revenue grew 19% as we continue to see the benefits of aligning the marketplace with the category offense.","Direct to Consumer sales grew 19% as comp-store sales increased 13% and online sales grew 29%.","EBIT for North America grew 18%, as robust revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset lower gross margins.","In Western Europe, revenue increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory.","Every category except Action Sports grew versus last year, led by double-digit growth in Basketball and high single-digit growth in Running.","On a reported basis, revenue for Western Europe grew 4% but EBIT declined 9% due primarily to lower gross margins, as higher product costs and inventory management efforts more than offset the positive impact of higher prices.","In Central and Eastern Europe, Q3 revenue grew 16% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in all categories except Men's and Women\u2019s Training. All territories except Greece grew versus the prior year, led by double-digit growth in Russia and Turkey.","On a reported basis, revenue for CEE grew 9% and EBIT increased 2%. The EBIT improvement was driven primarily by revenue growth and SG&A leverage, which more than offset lower gross margins.","In China, currency-neutral revenue grew 21% reflecting growth across all territories and all categories except Women\u2019s Training. Footwear continues to perform extremely well as revenue advanced 30% for the quarter, while Apparel revenue grew 6%.","As Charlie mentioned earlier, we're evolving our China Apparel business in line with the Amplify Strategy. As part of this effort, we're clearing the market of slow-moving styles and sharpening our product offering for future seasons. While these steps may affect Apparel revenue and gross margin in the near term, we're confident they'll fuel sustainable growth in revenue and profits into the future.","Reported revenue for China grew 25% and EBIT increased 28% as higher revenues and SG&A leverage more than offset lower gross margins.","Japan continues to deliver mixed results with currency-neutral revenue down 3% in Q3, as growth in performance products was more than offset by lower Sportswear sales. Running was a bright spot, delivering double-digit growth for the quarter.","Reported revenue for Japan increased 3% but EBIT declined 23% driven primarily by lower gross margins and SG&A deleverage.","Our Emerging Markets geography continues to drive strong growth and creates competitive separation as Q3 revenue grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis.","Every category and territory posted double-digit revenue growth, with Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea driving the largest share of that growth.","Reported revenue for the Emerging Markets grew 23% and the EBIT increased 24% as revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset lower gross margins.","Third quarter revenue for our Other Businesses increased 12% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth at Converse, Umbro and NIKE Golf. EBIT for the Other Businesses increased 2% as solid revenue -- solid profit growth at Converse and NIKE Golf was mostly offset by losses at Umbro, Hurley and Cole Haan. While revenues have increased for these smaller businesses, profitability has been challenged principally by lower gross margins.","As we head into the final quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to expect strong revenue growth, driven largely by the strength of the NIKE Brand and Converse.","On a reported basis, we expect low double-digit revenue growth for Q4 resulting in mid-teens growth for the full year. Our expected Q4 revenue growth is lower than reported futures growth due largely to lower At-Once sales versus the prior year quarter.","For gross margin, we expect sequential improvement in Q4 gross margins as the cost headwinds that drove our year-to-date results begin to ease and we benefit from a full quarter of higher prices.","On the other hand, we anticipate actions to manage inventory levels, particularly in China and Europe, will mute these benefits. As a result, we now expect Q4 gross margin will decline about 100 basis points resulting in full year gross margin roughly 200 basis points below the prior year.","We continue to expect SG&A leverage for the year with low-teens growth in Q4. For the quarter, we expect operating overhead to grow at a mid-single-digit rate reflecting increased DTC investments, offset by leverage of wholesale and corporate expenses.","We expect demand creation to grow about 25% as we invest to support our brands and the launch of major product innovations on the global stage provided by the NFL, European Championships and London Olympics.","Although we haven't yet completed our planning for fiscal 2013, we can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see full year revenue growth at or slightly above our high single-digit target range as the category offense and strong consumer demand continue to drive our top line.","Gross margin should improve as we expect to benefit from higher prices and some easing of material costs, but see ongoing headwinds from currency and labor cost inflation. And we'll continue to invest SG&A in our brands and our business most notably in first quarter demand creation and ongoing investments in Direct to Consumer and innovation.","Overall, we're targeting full year EPS growth approaching our mid-teens long-term goal as we continue to manage all aspects of our business to balance investing for long-term growth and delivering near-term financial performance.","As usual, we'll provide more visibility to our 2013 expectations when we report our year-end results in June.","We're pleased by the strength of our businesses and the results we've delivered so far this year. Even more important, we're really excited by the opportunities for continued growth that lie ahead.","Realizing those opportunities in a volatile world is not without challenges but we control our own destiny and are committed to investing our resources and capabilities in the opportunities with the highest potential to deliver sustainable, profitable growth for our shareholders.","We're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question that I have for you is on the inventory comments earlier, can you put any numbers around the unit issues? The units, the excess units that you have? And any more numbers around the Sportswear dollar numbers in China and in Europe?","Donald W. Blair","First of all, with respect to the units, we were up 12% for the NIKE Brand in units, Bob. And over 1\/2 of that increase was in transit and the biggest driver there as we talked about earlier is the change in factory deliveries. Last year, as you know, we were very short on Footwear capacity. We have largely caught up now, and we've seen deliveries come back to normal. And that's really driven our Footwear inventories higher. So that's really the biggest driver of the 12% unit increase. With respect to the pieces in China and Europe, I don't have those value numbers right off the top of my head. But I would tell you based on the comment I made earlier in the script over 1\/2 of the increase in inventory in value terms is coming out of the businesses where we have the strongest momentum, North America, Emerging Markets and China Footwear.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a question on the futures side of it, can you comment a little bit on how much the NFL early orders impacted the futures and any commentary around the early orders on Hyperdunk or Flyknit that are in these numbers today?","Charles D. Denson","Bob, this is Charlie. As you know, we don't disclose specific information around either events or specific product. It's obvious that those are 2 now reoccurring items that are new to the mix, and we've had some very strong success coming out of both of those arenas. So the good news is they're now both reoccurring and we're looking forward to the growth both out of the Nike+ introduction into basketball, as well as the relationship with the NFL.","Donald W. Blair","Yes, Bob, I think just to dimensionalize here, too. If you look at our sales trends before the events and the NFL were in the futures number, we've been growing double digits. And we just told you that for FY '13 we're expecting revenue growth at the high end or slightly above our long-term target range. So there is obviously an impact to the NFL and the events, but we've got very strong underlying demand curve as well for the rest of the business.","Mark G. Parker","And we're just getting started.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kate McShane with Citi Investment.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could walk us through some of the drivers of growth in China. I know Footwear sales have been very strong as you called out before. But is there any more color you can give us on how much comp increase is driving your growth there and how much is from new product introduction and incremental distribution?","Donald W. Blair","Yes, Kate, I don't have the comp store numbers right now. I would say that we are still seeing growth coming out of both, both in retail expansion as well as comp-store door growth. And I think that we would expect to see both of those continue.","Mark G. Parker","And I think Kate, just to reinforce something that Charlie said earlier in his prepared remarks, we do believe there's a large opportunity to increase the productivity of our distribution in China. And as we really move the category offense into distribution there and Amplify Sport on the Apparel side, we're really confident we're going to be raising the productivity of that distribution.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is more longer term, your shop-in-shop initiative has been very successful in the U.S. And is there any opportunity in the rest of North America or maybe in Europe to build out this initiative?","Charles D. Denson","Well, yes, definitely. I think as we continue to see the category offense takes shape in some of the other markets outside the U.S., one of the most productive pieces of that execution has been some of that shop-in-shop work. So we are emphasizing both the shop-in-shop, as well as trying to define and proof of concept category destinations. We're very bullish on both of them. And I would expect to see more of the above in all of the markets around the world.","Mark G. Parker","And I would add, our category offense is really coming into its own, and that's putting us in a better position to really execute some of that type of retail.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I guess first on the -- with regard to the inventory, I'm just curious about how long would you expect it to take, to kind of get through the inventory both in Europe from the Sportswear business and in China, just sort of what's the timing on that.","Charles D. Denson","Well -- this is Charlie. We -- as we always talk about, this is one of the things we focus a lot on. I would say that we have very aggressive plans in place to continue to move through some of those situations that you spoke to. At the same time, we've got great brand strength in both markets. We have a very strong Footwear business obviously in both markets, and it complements where we're at in Apparel. So the biggest issue is around that Sportswear piece in Europe and in China in Apparel. And I'm pretty confident that we're going to move through that certainly over the next 6 months.","Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then Don, just a quick question for you. When you talked about just sort of preliminarily, when you look at 2013, you expect gross margin rate to improve. Any thoughts about if that turns positive? Or are you just talking about directional improvement? Or you're actually talking that to be positive? I think it would be positive, but I'm just kind of curious, if you can elaborate.","Donald W. Blair","Yes, what I meant by that is we expect it to be higher in fiscal 2013 on the full year than it will be for 2012 full year. So we do expect it to be higher.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could clarify just I think this is what you're saying, but on the gross margin adjustment to your previous plan in Q4 and the miss in Q3, is the vast majority of that, these pockets of excess inventory that you have on the Sportswear side?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, the main variance versus what we had expected was what it cost us to move inventory a little more aggressively. And just to put that in context there really wasn't much of a difference year-on-year on those costs. We just expected them to improve in the third quarter, and they really didn't. So it's really been that. The input costs are overwhelmingly the biggest impact year-on-year. But in terms of where we thought we were going to be when we talked to you on the last call, it really was a little bit more aggressive moving of inventory.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as we look forward and think about kind of the big pressure points that you've been experiencing on the margin, the IMU pressure because of product costs relative to pricing, the closeout pressure that you've had and the supply-chain issues that you've had on some of the hotter products, when we think about the time frame for those to become -- each of those things to become year-over-year upsides drivers, when do each of those 3, in your mind kind, of roughly start to kick in?","Donald W. Blair","Well starting at the tail end, I mean we've talked about capacity a minute ago, but we are largely caught up on capacity. When I say largely caught up, I mean the growth rates that we're seeing here both in terms of what we reported in the third quarter and the order book, I mean, there\u2019s still very, very rapid growth. So there is no finish line on that as we would say. But right now, we're really in good shape in terms of factory deliveries. Charlie talked a little bit about the perspective on inventory. And we gave you some sense that we think that's an equation we think works out over the first half of fiscal 2013. With respect to raw materials costs, that one is, as Mark said, easing but not yet or maybe not returning to where it ultimately was 2009 or 2010. And then as everyone has said labor costs continue to go up. Now balancing against that, in the third quarter, we were probably at 4% to 5% up in unit sales price. And you heard the futures disclosure around unit increases about plus 8%. And as Charlie said earlier, we have a lot of confidence that the innovation pipeline and the brand strength we have right now gives us the flexibility to continue over the long term to improve our gross margins.","Mark G. Parker","And I'll add, we continue to be as aggressive as we've ever been and looking at innovation in product and the supply chain to offset those margin pressures and look at ways to actually expand our margins through new manufacturing methods. I mentioned Flyknit. There's quite a few other major initiatives along the same line that we're investing in that we think will have some significant impact over the longer term on the margin expansion opportunity.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And is there's any kind of more help you could give us on when the pricing that you're starting to take actually starts to re-extends some of the IMU against the cost kind of curve that you're starting to see or that you see through the next several quarters?","Donald W. Blair","Yes, at this point, Michelle, we wouldn't want to start giving quarterly guidance on margin. We're, I think, providing quite a bit of direction around where we think 2013 is. But as I said earlier, we really haven't gotten our planning process completed. But we do expect sequential improvement as we said in the fourth quarter and then overall for 2013, I think we'll be better.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of quick questions. On the inflation piece, if we think about the persistence of the inflation issue, and it's not just you guys a lot of other companies is in this kind of soft goods world going through the experiences, is it possible that we've just come off of this period of really extended deflation? And I know you have decades of deflation and maybe perhaps we're entering an extended period of inflation especially given commodities, as well as labor rates in emerging markets. And how do you think about that long term in how you position the business, the brand, the pricing, the cost structure? And I also had a follow-up question on the Flyknit, too, if I could.","Donald W. Blair","Okay. Well I guess to tee this up, I think Mark made the comment earlier, I do believe that we do expect there's going to be ongoing volatility in input costs. And certainly, over the really long term, we would expect these costs to generally go up. So we don't plan for a radical return to low commodity prices. And as Mark said also, we think labor generally is going to be headed higher. That's why for us, the long-term strategy really is about innovation, which I'm going to turn over to Mark on the Flyknit side. But also it's about continuing to strengthen our brand. And as you put that innovation in the marketplace and you have a very strong brand, it gives you the ability to have flexibility in terms of how you price the product. And over the long term, brand strength, innovation, those are the things that really let you manage the margin equation and continue to expand it.","Mark G. Parker","Yes, we're not sitting around waiting for prices on materials. Certainly, labor to come down to any historical levels. We're acting very aggressively to apply any opportunity we think is meaningful to really innovate in other ways to take those input costs down and again, like I said, to improve our gross margin picture. And that's a very active, aggressive part of our innovation agenda for the company.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, got you. And Mark, while I have you, on the Flyknit, how -- should we think about this as a platform? Kind of in the way in the past, you've had the Air, the Shox, the Free, the Lunar that can be just kind of taken out across categories. Or is it different because it's a different production technique? And I'm assuming it's a proprietary production technique as well. If you could respond to that too, it would be great.","Mark G. Parker","The quick answer is yes, yes, and yes. Yes, it's something that we can leverage across the categories, no doubt. I think the potential to leverage this technology is greater than anything we've seen in the past. It really applies to literally every category of footwear that we produce. And frankly even Apparel, as we move forward. So there's -- that's why I'm incredibly excited about this. There\u2019s the leverage we get from a production standpoint, the sustainability story and then, of course, performance. It's really all of those things in one. And we're at the very front end of the potential here. We do see this as a way not only to create a higher performance, more sustainable product but one that actually will gives us significantly better margins as we scale this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari with Jefferies.","Taposh Bari - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question about just the moving parts around price and cost. So on the pricing side, it looks like you're up by 4% to 5% in the quarter. Futures indicated, up about 8%. And then on the cost side, it looks like up about 20% versus up 15% last quarter. So can you just give us some directional color as you see it now in terms of your visibilty? Are those kind of like the peaks on both the pricing and costing that we should expect going forward? And should we start to see some deceleration over the coming quarters?","Donald W. Blair","All right. So forgive me on the math here a little bit. I think you just quoted a 20% number on cost. So let me just -- I think you're taking that from the inventory cost per unit.","Taposh Bari - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Correct.","Donald W. Blair","Okay. So first thing, as Charlie mentioned in his script and I did too, there's really 2 factors driving up average cost per unit in the inventory. One is higher cost per unit of individual styles of footwear and apparel. That's about 15 points or so. There's about 5 points in there which is just a higher mix of footwear. And that's because the factories caught up, and we've got more footwear on the water. So the actual cost number in the inventory is more like 15%, not 20%. And one thing to bear in mind here is that cost of goods is about half of revenues. So if you were trying to equate the 2, you'd be talking about more like 7.5%, if you follow me. So that -- just to dimensionalize, that's about what's in the inventory, plus or minus. And I think as all of us have said here along the way, this is a very dynamic equation. There is constantly moving parts here around both the revenue equation, around price and mix, and on the cost side in terms of materials and labor and innovation that goes into how we design and produce products. So what we would point you to is that 2013 perspective right now, we do expect year-on-year to be above 2012 on gross margin in 2013. And over the long haul, we are still committed to expanding our margins over time.","Charles D. Denson","I just want to add couple of other qualitative pieces to that, too. I think as we've talked about on the cost side and especially looking at the inventories, I mean the quality of our inventory right now with on-time deliveries and some of the things that we've been challenged with over the past year are in a much, much better condition. So we feel really good about that as we move into summer and fall into these big events. So that's something we feel really good about. And I think with regards to how it affects some of the pricing and our ability to continue to put new and innovative product and consumer experiences into the marketplace, the consumer continues to see the value in those things. And we have confidence both from a brand and a product-innovation standpoint that we're going to continue to deliver on those things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I guess maybe we can start with some of the price increases in some of the early reads you're seeing. And maybe you could -- I was a little surprise to hear Europe Apparel come up as an area where you had to clear some inventories since the reported revenue number actually grew a bit and looks a little better when we got the press release. So you had such success here with double-digit growth in the U.S. and it seems like it's taking longer to roll out that strategy in Europe. I'm wondering if you can tell us maybe a little bit more on the forensics on the state of the Apparel business over there, what do you think is not catching on and what's some of the changes that you think you need to make?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, I think maybe we're guilty a little bit of overreacting to the European Apparel piece only in a sense that the performance side of the equation is performing extremely well. And we're very happy with that. And as kind of reflective of my commentary, we're really going to leverage that performance success and better align some of the sportswear. So sportswear apparel inventory situation, that is the issue. So we feel very good about that. And to your point, I think one of the challenges is we haven't been able to -- or we haven't executed, I guess, the category piece, as well as we should. And I think we called that out. And it is the focus going forward in Europe is to get that in a better place. And we think it will have, really, a very positive effect on the overall position of the business. The brand continues to be extremely strong. We're still the #1 brand in Europe. The Footwear positioning is -- market share lead is still very considerable. And we feel -- like I said, Western Europe is still a very, very big growth opportunity for the brand.","Mark G. Parker","We have a very strong performance position in Europe like we do around the world. And our unique proposition in Sportswear is to leverage that performance position. And we think we have some good room for opportunity to do that in Europe, maybe more so than any other region or territory around the world. So that's really our focus, is to take our unique proposition and performance that is going to come to a new crescendo here with the European Championships and the Olympics and really leverage that much more effectively like we have in North America and the Emerging Markets particularly, and do that in Europe.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I don't think we've had enough questions on gross margin, so I'll go ahead and throw one in. But on the -- as you think about how to guide us for the following quarters on gross margins, I have to think that you want to -- the numbers you've been giving us for the guidance for the last few quarters really haven't been hitting the optimistic scenario that you probably like to come out and tell us, right? Last quarter we thought it was going to be down 50 in the fourth. And now, down a little more than that. So as you think about how to set the guidance and where to be conservative and how to think about where the pricing is working versus where we should set expectations for how much we're going to have to clear product, is there anything different about how you approach guidance for the fourth quarter here that said maybe we're a bit more conservative considering we came in a little bit below where we wanted to be here in the last couple of quarters?","Donald W. Blair","Well that's a tough one to respond to there, Michael. But what I would say to you is there's a lot of moving parts in gross margin. And what I would tell you is we feel fantastic about the fundamental drivers that we control. We always talk about the fact that there are some pieces of the equation we control, some we don't. We have taken more wide scale price increases for spring and summer. We're really pleased with how those are playing out in the marketplace on sell-through. The strength of our brand and the innovation pipeline give us good opportunities to take price and have it stick and both of those are strong as they've ever been. We've got some great innovations coming that I think -- we talked about Flyknit that take labor out, take waste out. In the long run, those are all the things that are going to let us move this equation. I would love to get it exactly right every quarter. I don't always do it exactly right. But if you look at the long-term equities that we have in the business, our ability to manage gross margin, we feel great about where this is playing out. And we are seeing sequential improvement. It's getting better, not quite as fast as we hope but it is getting better.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And just a quick housekeeping question. You guys are usually helpful in telling us if the futures window is stronger in the front half or the back half. Can I ask that how that looks?","Donald W. Blair","It's balanced across both halves of the window.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And is the futures window now reflecting all the price increases that are planned? Or is there another incremental step-up from the price increase that might be rolling out a little bit later anywhere?","Donald W. Blair","Well the current futures window would include spring and a little piece of summer. And that would include the current price less basically.","Kelley Hall","That's all the time we have for questions today. So I want to say thank you to everybody for joining us.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Matt, and hello everybody.","As most of you know, this is my final quarterly earnings call as NIKE's CEO. And while I'm tempted to go right to the results to let another strong quarter speak for itself, there are a few things I want to say right upfront.","I'm excited to take on a new role as Executive Chairman, remaining a part of the management team and leading the Board. This has been a very thoughtful transition that has been planned for many months. I strongly believe the best time to make change is from a position of strength. And our brand and our business are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been. We're focused, we're competitive, and we\u2019re creating a future of our own design. Most of all, the time is right because of the team we have at NIKE, and of course, John Donahoe himself.","I can't say enough about the incredible people I get to work with every single day. With their expertise, their commitment and their enthusiasm for the business, the entire NIKE team has been fueling our current momentum. And because of the depth and the quality of the leadership team we have at NIKE, the transition with John will be seamless.","As for John, his proven experience in leading global strategy, digital commerce and enterprise technology will be invaluable as we continue our digital transformation. And his passion for sport, his commitment to developing teams and talent, and his growth mindset will make him a great NIKE CEO. John will help elevate NIKE to the next level and accelerate our strategic transformation. I look forward to working with him even more closely.","With that let's take a look at our Q2 results where we continue to show the greater focus is the key to accelerating growth. Overall revenue for the quarter grew 10%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis. The big takeaways from the last 90 days are proving that innovation is NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. The consumer is voting for our brands across the whole portfolio and up and down price points. The passion for sport and active lifestyles is thriving around the world. Our international business grew 18%, led by Greater China at 23% and we continue to grow NIKE\u2019s digital advantage in the marketplace. The Nike app and the SNKRS app are outperforming all other channels, driving digital growth of 38% for Q2.","I\u2019ll get into the details by sharing some of our Q2 product wins and insights, and to how our session on product and innovation is creating separation for NIKE. Starting with Sportswear, we're opening new lanes of opportunity by reimagining our top products. One example is how we're bringing fresh points of view to some of our most loved iconic footwear with the Air Force 1, the Air Jordan 1 and our deep line up of Air Max. Our deliberate strategy is to add new styles and colors to the Air Jordan 1, which allows us to bring one of the world's most popular sneakers to more people while offering consumers more choice.","And with women and the Air Force One, we're running a nimble key city offense through the Express Lane using local feedback to create and move product to meet shifting consumer tastes. We\u2019ll apply that process to a new classic strategy for women that will ramp up in the back half of the fiscal year.","2X Innovation is creating a continuous cycle of scalable distinct platforms. For example, in this quarter, the top three growth drivers in Air Max were all introduced in the last year with the Air Max 270, 720 and the 200. In basketball footwear, we're leveraging signature athletes to create innovation that matches different styles of play and creates real differentiation across price points.","It starts with new expressions of platforms like Zoom Air, among articulated cushioning unit in Kyrie 6 for quick-cutting to a higher stack height for more response in jumping with the new AlphaDunk. With the LeBron 17, we created a new cushioning system to propel the game's most explosive player during his incredible run with the Lakers this season. We're seeing very strong sell-through in our signature athletes\u2019 footwear, especially through digital and in China. Next quarter gives us a number of storytelling opportunities to create even more energy with Chinese New Year, the first NBA regular season game in Paris and the NBA All-Star game in Chicago.","Running continues to create tremendous energy with consumers across both performance and lifestyle. At NIKE, we leverage innovation to help athletes perform better while catalyzing energy and growth in running inspired sportswear styles. That starts with serving the widest range of runners. And over the past two years, we've introduced several performance innovation platforms into the running category, including React, Vaporfly 4%, NEXT% and Joyride. Vaporfly 4% and NEXT% continue to transform the sport, taking over the fields and marathons around the world, including this quarter\u2019s sub-two-hour marathon from Eliud Kipchoge in Vienna and Brigid Kosgei\u2019s women\u2019s marathon world record in Chicago.","While Joyride and React continue to fuel the everyday runner, early next year, we will keep the cadence of new platforms going. In January, we'll start with a Nike React Infinity Run, which blends responsiveness and comfort for both efficiency and impact reduction. And for Tokyo 2020, we\u2019ll introduce a new Zoom Air running platform that will scale across both performance and lifestyle. A more complete running offense also means delivering greater value at core price points and a number of initiatives are developing, such as our exciting Renew platform offering a plush resilient ride, similar to the properties of React Cushioning. We're selectively leveraging one of the NIKE's most iconic innovations Air Max into core price points. And we're designing women's core products from the ground up, bringing both unique style and tuned cushioning to her preferences.","In apparel, we delivered strong 10% growth in the quarter and we see a major opportunity ahead. We're getting better every season at capturing the value of one of the world's strongest brands. Obsessing the fundamentals of fleece, T-shirts and outerwear is giving more consumers access to the NIKE brand across a range of price points, and that's being led by seasonal capsules and collections which encourage consumers to keep coming back to the latest chapters of storytelling, color and prints. And this formula has been an especially strong driver for women's sportswear apparel, which grew revenue double digits for the quarter.","We've also piloted a new model of launching High Heat apparel on the SNKRS app this quarter. We're taking the energy and storytelling we drive in footwear and amplifying one of our biggest growth opportunities. We're seeing strong sell-through of our apparel collections that we\u2019ve co-designed with collaborations on SNKRS. The Jordan brand on a wholesale equivalent basis just earned its first $1 dollar quarter, an incredible milestone, and just as important is that it was very high quality growth. The brand is very strong internationally and in North America. The marketplace is healthy and in many cases demand is exceeding supply.","Performance innovation like the Jordan 34 is complementing one of the world's hottest franchises in the Air Jordan 1. And women's and apparel continue to reach new audiences. What's most exciting is we're still in the early stages of diversifying the Jordan portfolio. And we've continued the momentum into Q3 with a significant holiday launch of the Jordan 11 Bread, meeting demand for one of sneaker culture\u2019s all time favorites at an incredible scale.","So, as we look ahead, we're about to enter a hyper-intense cycle of new product introductions with the Tokyo 2020 games and the football Euro Champs on the horizon. Both will be a springboard for new innovation that will help define the performance and aesthetic of NIKE product for years to come.","Euro Champs will be another great catalyst for EMEA apparel in the back half of the year. And for the Olympics and Paralympics, we will be revealing the specifics about our Explosive line up next quarter. But you can expect to see the next Air revolution with new approaches to Zoom Air and a renewed VaporMax platform, a celebration of women's basketball like never before, highlighting the opportunity we see to grow the women's game and our business, and our teams using the world stage of Tokyo 2020 to elevate sustainable design at an incredible scale.","Across the board, our product teams are proving that innovation is NIKE's greatest competitive edge. Returning athletes\u2019 insights into breakthrough innovation or offering more choice on the industry's top icons, we\u2019re delivering more complete and more productive assortments and we're being opportunistic with the consumer in real time.","Another way we continue to create separation is through NIKE's digital advantage. Our digital commerce revenue grew an impressive 38% in Q2, powered by an outstanding performance during our most important holiday moments in November. For Black Friday, digital sales grew over 70% in North America and broke records for the weekend across many of our metrics including our highest week of member engagement ever. Buying members also grew 45% versus last year. We also saw phenomenal success in EMEA with an increase of nearly 50% in demand as Black Friday week grows an importance to the European consumer. Singles' Day showed the current strength of our brand and product portfolio with the Chinese consumer. Through Singles\u2019 Day, we created demand, generating nearly $0.5 billion in revenue. We strengthened our relationships through NIKE+, adding 3 million members. We served our consumer faster, delivering 20% of the 11.11 orders the same day, and we finished as the number one athletic brand on Tmall.","China is in many ways the world's most compelling digital marketplace. And while the digital share of the business in Greater China is larger than any other geography for NIKE, we still see so much potential ahead. At the end of Q2, we added the Nike app to a powerful portfolio in China that includes nike.com, SNKRS, NRZ, NTC and our branded experiences with Tmall and WeChat.","The Chinese consumers already telling us they're excited about the Nike app, downloading 1 million times during launch. Incredibly, it\u2019s already the number one shopping app in China. Of course, we continue stay engaged with all of our stakeholders in Greater China, monitoring trade conversations and state of consumer across the region. Overall, we feel very good about. The sell-through of our product and the health of our marketplace about our support of the growing community of everyday athletes as well as China's top leads and federation and the immense opportunity to create tailored experiences for the Chinese consumer. We talk a lot about scale of the investments we've been making to fuel our digital transformation, and there are many components. Industry-leading consumer retail experiences that merge online and off-line, new operational capabilities, New operational capabilities and powerful partnerships and all enabled by the digital talent we've added through five recent acquisitions and investments in our teams. The common thread to these work streams is that they put the consumer at the center. They are all designed to reduce friction and create a more direct connection with our customers and ultimately invite them to become members. Membership is the sharp point of our growth. For the quarter SNKRS app grew strong double digits, the Nike app more than doubled and both apps now make up over one-third of our digital revenue. And active users for our apps are growing almost triple digits.","The Nike app at retail continues to be one of our greatest opportunities to create scale as we pair the app with physical retail across our owned and partnered doors. Through the Nike app at retail, personalization and convenience moved to another level. Inside the store, members can unlock tailored offers based on their past engagement with NIKE and shop at their pace on the retail floor, scanning products for information and checking out on their own. NIKE's also changing the experience of finding product and how it\u2019s delivered. Members can reserve product online and have it waiting for them at their nearest store, so they can try it on first. Where if they can't a find product they want, new investments in RFID will enable the consumer to instantly track one -- another one down somewhere else in the store, online or potentially in another retail partner\u2019s channel.","We have a culture of testing and iterating new retail concepts very quickly, and we're in the early-stages of scaling some of our best ideas around the world at our own doors and with our partners. For example, our first test of Nike Live internationally opened in Shibuya, our smallest Nike Live door in the world, but serving millions through the power of digital.","NIKE's not only deeply committed to using our digital advantage to make the consumer experience better, we're also using data science to inform how much product we supply and where. Through our acquisition of Celect, we're applying and developing new unique algorithms to make us better attuned to what the consumer is telling us. We're leveraging data that includes past and present consumer interest in products and purchasing signals to better predict demand, so we can decide how to stage inventory in our distribution centers and our stores in different ways.","For Singles\u2019 Day, we shipped products from over 200 stores, instead of DCs, to meet the needs of consumers faster and more profitably. Bringing science to the art of retail remains one of NIKE's greatest opportunities.","Before handing it off to Andy, I do want to take a moment to recognize you, our shareholders. Many of you have been invested in NIKE for years, some even decades, and I greatly appreciate your engagement and your long-term focus. As you know, I tend to think more about what's coming than reflecting, but my time as CEO really has been a humbling experience. I\u2019m leaving this role with so much optimism for the future of this Company.","Sport continues to inspire and move the world forward in incredible ways. Our brand is connecting deeply with consumers everywhere. Our innovation is helping athletes prove that there are no limits. We're challenging the conventions of retail at every turn. We're growing our biggest businesses and focused on our greatest opportunities, and we're bringing tremendous talent into Nike to add to our already deep bench of leaders. It's clear that sport is thriving, that Nike has the right people and the right plan. What's great is I won't be a spectator to all this success. I'll be part of the team that's creating it.","So, with that, for the last time, I'll say thank you, and here's Andy.","Andy Campion","Hello and happy holidays to everyone on the call.","First, I want to thank and recognize Mark. We've all been fortunate to be guided by Mark\u2019s extraordinary vision and leadership as NIKE\u2019s Chief Executive Officer over the past 14 years. I told Mark this personally, he's the most creative, inquisitive and frankly also the most demanding leader for whom I've ever worked, and at the same time, he's the most patient, thoughtful and balanced. We will all continue to benefit from Mark's leadership as NIKE\u2019s Executive Chairman.","We're also extremely fortunate to have John Donahoe joining us as Chief Executive Officer. Few companies are guided by an inspirational founder, as well as a 14-year former CEO and 40-year veteran of the Company and now John Donahoe. John is clearly a proven CEO who brings extraordinary people leadership and talent development experience, as well as deep expertise and strategy, consumer digital technology and enterprise technology. This abundance of strong leadership is yet another competitive advantage that we enjoy at NIKE. And this planful transition is happening as NIKE\u2019s momentum is accelerating, driven by the increasingly deeper execution of our consumer direct offense by our talented teams around the world.","As we're still in the early innings of our digital transformation, now, as Mark said, is the perfect time for John to be joining and leading our team. Simply put, I'm extremely excited about the future for NIKE.","Before we talk more about the future, let's focus on the present for just a few moments. In Q2, we delivered revenue growth of 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our strong top line growth was amplified by gross margin expansion and significant SG&A leverage. The result was EPS growing 35%. There are three key strategic and financial themes that stand out as we reflect on our strong Q2 results.","First, as we\u2019ve said before, NIKE is a growth company. Growth is how we measure the value we create for consumers, and delivering strong sustainable growth at scale is how NIKE creates extraordinary value for shareholders over the long term.","Second, while we will continue to prioritize investments that drive focused growth and build capabilities that differentiate NIKE, we're now also increasingly editing and divesting more deliberately in other areas.","Third, we are extending NIKE\u2019s digital advantage, and we're positioning NIKE for even greater competitive separation over the long term. As we transform elements of the consumer journey, our individual investments will have an exponential impact on NIKE's long-term growth, profitability and returns in the aggregate. I'll provide just a bit more context on each of these themes. ","First, NIKE is a growth Company. In fact, our rate of growth in constant currency terms has exceeded the long-term financial model that we communicated at our Investor Day in October 2017. More notably, our growth has been profitable, capital efficient and broad-based across our entire global portfolio. That's because our growth is being fueled by focused strategic execution of the Triple Double by our teams around the world. At our Investor Day, we said our goal was to double the percent of revenue generated by recently introduced innovation platforms. In other words, we would 2x innovation. As of this quarter, we have in fact more than tripled innovation as a percent of revenue, and we're not slowing down. We will sustain this level of innovation driven by the incredible breadth and depth of our innovation pipeline, in particular all that we have in store for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.","Our strong growth also continues to be fueled by an increasingly more direct connection to consumers in the marketplace. Nike Direct grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, led by Nike Digital, growing at 38%. Our digital growth was driven primarily by the Nike app and SNKRS app with both now live in over 20 countries.","In Q2, we also opened two Nike Live stores in Long Beach, California and Shibuya, Tokyo, which leveraged digital to better serve members within a more moderate sized and efficient physical retail format. Our growth also continues to be balanced across all NIKE brand geographies, that's because we are executing our offense first and foremost in the 12 key cities and 10 key countries with the greatest potential impact.","Our growth in Q2 in those cities and countries continues to over index the broader market. That brings me to my second key takeaway. Our investments continue to be focused on the areas where we see the greatest potential to drive growth and on building capabilities that will truly differentiate NIKE. At the same time, we're now increasingly editing and divesting in other areas.","Again, at our Investor Day, we told you that we would focus and invest in the following areas, innovation, speed and direct, our priority categories and the 12 key cities and 10 key countries that would deliver over 80% of our incremental revenue growth over the five-year horizon. Over the past two years, that is precisely what we have done, and our results are giving us even greater confidence that we're investing in what matters most.","As we all know investing in the future always comes before editing and divesting legacy operating models, but we are now increasingly doing both. We are editing and shifting how we deploy resources within our marketplaces, across our categories and geographically. While we are investing in differentiated NIKE brand experiences, owned and partnered, we are also more efficiently managing the broader retail marketplace, leveraging digital tools such as our NIKE.net business-to-business platform. As a result, we are delivering strong overall revenue growth, despite intentionally flat to declining sales and undifferentiated multi-brand retail.","Quite frankly, we could sell more in the short-term in these undifferentiated channels, but our focus is on building a more compelling marketplace for the consumer and unbreakable relationships with Nike members. In early Q3, we also sold the Hurley brand, which has become one of the leading brands in surf apparel. Hurley will benefit from new ownership\u2019s focus on the surf category. Our sale of Hurley will further sharpen NIKE\u2019s focus and investment on the key categories that will drive our long-term growth.","Going forward, we will refine our operating model with respect to dimensions of our business that have historically been less profitable and\/or have lesser growth potential. For a bit of context, today we currently operate essentially the same business model in over 45 countries. One of our many competitive advantages in Nike is that we have unrivaled resources. The more focused and efficient we are in deploying those resources, the more we will extend NIKE's lead with the consumer and the greater the value we will create for our shareholders.","Finally, the third key take-away from the quarter is that we continue to expand NIKE's digital advantage. As we systematically transform individual elements of the consumer journey, the more exponential the impact is on our long-term growth, profitability and returns on invested capital. In Q2, more than half of our total digital traffic came from logged in members. A NIKE member is a consumer host chosen to create a profile with NIKE. Even in just these early stages of digital transformation at NIKE, the average order value for members is significantly greater than for nonmembers. And we're seeing revenue growth from members continue to expand based on two factors, one, strong rates of growth in new members; and two, greater member engagement year-over-year as measured by monthly active users.","As we consider investments in transforming how we operate, we always look to our consumer first and more specifically, our members. And assess where we have the greatest potential to improve their experience. It starts with digital demand sensing. Our acquisition of Celect accelerates our ability to better predict the right supply of products that consumers love down to the style, color and size. Celect\u2019s tools will also enable more accurate forward positioning of inventory in stores, online and in our distribution centers. Note that Celect also brings other tools that improve pricing and mark down efficiency","As consumers shop, our investments in connected inventory provide our store employees near 100% accurate visibility into the precise location of specific inventory, whether that one payor is in the stock room or elsewhere on the floor at a partner store or one of our distribution centers. And thanks to our investment Invertex, NIKE Fit will give consumers confidence that they are getting the right size in that specific style.","Our investments in data and analytics help us learn from each of these consumer experiences and translate those learnings into, for example, curated content, product offerings and more personalized digital experiences for members. And as they say, that which is measured, improves. Our acquisition of Zodiac allows us to assess real-time how each new offering impacts engagement and consumer lifetime value. Transforming the consumer journey also has significant financial impacts. We will capture greater demand at the moment of truth; we will have stronger full price sell-through and more efficient markdowns, we\u2019ll have fewer days in inventory, and we\u2019ll have greater member retention and repeat buying.","This digital transformation is beginning to impact our results. In fact, our constant currency revenue growth and margin expansion excluding foreign exchange headwinds over the past two years has exceeded the financial model we communicated at our Investor Day. And we believe that building on our digital advantage is certain to further extend NIKE's lead and amplify our long-term growth potential.","Before providing more context on our outlook, I'll first reflect on the details of our financial results overall and for our key operating segments. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 10% in Q2, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong, balanced growth across the portfolio, led by Greater China and digital.","Gross margin expanded by 20 basis points in Q2 as strong gross pricing margin, which is essentially average selling price net of average product costs and strong growth in higher margin Nike Direct was partially offset by the impact of new tariffs implemented in September, strategic supply chain investments and foreign exchange headwinds. SG&A leveraged as compared to revenue growth, growing just 6% in the quarter as investments in digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity within our operating overhead, efficiencies within our demand creation spend, and our decision to defer demand creation to the second half as we ramp up to Air Max Day, the NBA All-Star Weekend, European Championships and the Tokyo Olympics.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.7% compared to 15% for the same period last year, due to greater stock-based compensation benefits. Second quarter diluted EPS was $0.70, growing 35% versus prior year. Inventories were up 15% in dollar terms, 10% in units, reflecting strong consumer demand globally, strong growth in Nike Direct and a higher rate of on-time factory deliveries versus the prior year. ","With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 5% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. Nike Digital grew 32% in the quarter, fueled in part by a strong Black Friday. Overall, growth was fueled by those dimensions of the marketplace that we are transforming. In particular, Nike Direct and through differentiated wholesale partners like Foot Locker, JD, Finish Line and DICK\u2019s. We continue to intentionally right size undifferentiated dimensions of the marketplace. We have strong momentum in North America, which makes it the ideal time to affect this transformation.","Our key city focus is also fueling North America's transformational growth. New York and Los Angeles are outpacing the broader market. In New York, for example, Nike Direct is already well over 50% of our business and digital is already well over 30% penetrated. We see our momentum continuing in North America over the second half of fiscal year \u201820 with comparable growth in the strong mid-single-digit range. That said, our reported rate of revenue growth will not be comparable. Year-over-year revenue growth in North America will be negatively impacted in the short term by our value-accretive sale of Hurley. This transaction will create a 2-point, roughly 2-point unfavorable comparison on North America revenue growth versus the prior year unadjusted, which equates to roughly 1 point for NIKE, Inc. That said, this is accretive from a capital deployment and profitability perspective. And our North America business on a comparable basis remains strong and we're right on plan.","Now, let's turn to EMEA where the NIKE brand is on fire and continues to take significant market share. In Q2, revenue in EMEA grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Jordan. NIKE continues to be the number one brand in all of our key cities within EMEA. To deepen our brand connection with consumers, we launched two powerful locally relevant campaigns in EMEA in Q2. We launched a kids focused Just Do It campaign, celebrating girls. And on the back of that campaign, we saw our kids business grow strong double-digits. We also launched a campaign around the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down, with the focus on the power of sport to Unite. Notably, our increasingly localized approach has resulted in NIKE becoming the number one footwear market leader in Germany.","Our women's business also grew faster in EMEA than in any other geography in Q2. Through our Express Lane, we brought the T-100 [ph] women's apparel pack to market in less than 120 days from initial consumer insight. The product sold out immediately through Nike Direct, ASOS and Zalando.","On that note, NIKE Digital in EMEA grew 27% in the quarter, faster than any other dimension. We also continued to expand our brand accretive partnership with Zalando including rolling out a connected inventory pilot to 7 countries, based on the strong incremental revenue generated from the initial launch in Germany. We have extraordinary momentum in EMEA and we expect to extend our lead fueled by the Euro Champs and the Olympics over the second half of fiscal year '20 and into fiscal year '21.","In APLA, revenue grew 18% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by growth in Korea and Japan. Nike Digital in APLA was up 67% in Q2 and continues to lead all dimensions of growth. We are also putting the NIKE brand in the path of more consumers through our partnerships with digital platforms such as ZOZOTOWN and Flipkart. These partners are affording the NIKE brand and our product premium positioning while also serving as an on-ramp to NIKE membership. In Q2, we also opened our first international NIKE Live store in Shibuya, Tokyo, next to one of the busiest train stations in the world. At the same time, we leveraged our Express Lane to create a unique Air Force 1 inspired by the Shibuya neighborhood and launched through the NIKE SNKRS app.","Finally, our running business has tremendous momentum in Japan. NIKE's market share in running reached a record high in Q2, led by the success of the Vaporfly 4% and NEXT%. We're excited to build on this energy with the launch of new styles like the NIKE React Infinity Run next month, and the strong portfolio of innovation to come around the Tokyo Olympics.","Now, let's turn to Greater China. This past quarter, we delivered 23% currency-neutral revenue growth in Greater China. We saw a strong double-digit growth in every key category and every dimension of the market. NIKE Digital once again led our growth at plus 44% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by record-breaking single stay that exceeded our own ambitious expectations. We continue to deliver strong digital growth in Greater China despite only having just launched the NIKE app earlier this month. That is one of the many reasons we believe that we -- while we have great current momentum in China, we're still far from realizing our full potential. While we are of course very mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Greater China, the Nike brand continues to deeply resonate with consumers and our growth continues to be strong and sustainable. We are proactively managing inventory in the Hong Kong market based upon the more recent declines in Hong Kong retail traffic. These actions will create a short-term headwind on what will remain a very strong rate of growth for greater China.","With that, I will now share outlook. On a currency-neutral basis, our outlook for the full year continues to improve. For the full year, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth approaching the low double-digit range, even after taking into account the non-comp impact from the sale of Hurley. With continued geopolitical volatility, we expect foreign exchange to remain at 2 to 3-point headwind on reported revenue growth. Taking into account all of these factors, we continue to expect high single-digit reported revenue growth for the full year. We also continue to expect gross margin expansion within the 50 to 70 basis-point range and SG&A growing in the high-single-digit range, even including the impact of acquisitions. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid teens and for OIE, net of interest expense, we now expect roughly $100 million to $150 million of income for the year.","Based on quarterly volatility, let me provide more context on our Q3 outlook. We expect reported revenue growth in Q3 to be in the high single-digit range, albeit at the very low end of that range. Our continued strong currency-neutral revenue growth will be partially offset by roughly 2 points of foreign exchange headwinds and the non-comp impact related to the sale of Hurley. Put differently, Q3 reported revenue will be in line with our reported revenue growth in Q1.","We expect gross margin in Q3 to be flat compared to the prior year. We expect continued strong underlying product margin expansion, reflecting the strength of our product pipeline. However, that expansion will be largely offset by tariffs in North America and investments in our supply chain. In addition, foreign exchange headwinds within gross margin will be more in line with what we reported back in Q1. The impact of geopolitical trade dynamics on FX and more recently tariffs do create quarterly anomalies. That said, as we all know, one quarter or one data point does not equate to a trend. Over the past two years, our gross margin expansion has significantly exceeded our goals but for these dynamics. And again, for the full year, we continue to expect 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion.","We see continued strong fundamental expansion in our margin fueled by our strong product pipeline and the higher rate of growth in Nike Direct. In Q3, we expect SG&A growth in the low-double-digit to low-teens range, driven by our decision within Q2 to shift demand creation into the second half in order to amplify the NBA All-Star Weekend, European Championships, the Tokyo Olympics and our launch of innovative new products. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid teens range. For OIE net of interest expense, we expect income in Q3 to be roughly $50 million to $75 million.","Q2 was another strong quarter, fueled by execution of the consumer direct offense by our unrivaled team around the world. That said, as Mark will continue to remind all of us, there is no finish line. We are still in the early stages of this transformation at NIKE with tremendous growth potential ahead of us. I could not be more excited about the future for NIKE.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hey. Good afternoon. And Mark, good luck on the next chapter. And thanks for all of the help over the last numerous years. It\u2019s been a lot of fun.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that. Yes.","Bob Drbul","I guess, the first question I have is, if we could just talk about in quarter, but can you talk a little bit about the North American apparel market and sort of the performance and\/or the outlook, and sort of some of the assumptions, there's been a lot of press recently around the MLB partnership that you are launching right now?","Andy Campion","Yes. I\u2019ll take that one, Bob. Overall -- I'll start just overall with our apparel business. We've got incredible momentum in the apparel business overall. Globally, apparel grew 10% in the quarter. And frankly, we think we have much greater opportunities ahead that we haven't even yet capitalized on and we've spoken quite a bit about that. Our international geographies growth has been phenomenal, Sportswear and Jordan are leading the growth, lifestyle apparel for both men and women. In North America in particular, the rate of growth in the quarter was impacted by prior year comparison. So, in the prior year, this may sound like not that significant of an impact, but it actually was. The shift of LeBron James to the Lakers and the initial impact from the sale of his jerseys was significant. But for that, the growth rate in North America would have been more in the mid-single-digit range. For context, what I would tell you is that in the prior year North America apparel actually grew 10% in part, aided by that comparison. So, we continue to feel one, both great about the state of our apparel business and brand in North America, but at the same time nowhere near satisfied in terms of the opportunities ahead that we have to really drive more epic growth in apparel.","Bob Drbul","Got it. Okay. And then, if I could just ask a follow-up for Mark, sort of a closing question for you. With all the attention on the Vaporfly NEXT%, I was just wondering, can you just share with us how much you shaved off your personal record or personal best with the pair of shoes that you've been using?","Mark Parker","Okay. Well, I can just tell you that the time it takes me to walk across the NIKE campus here, at headquarters, has dropped by at least 4%. So, feeling good about it, feeling really good. ","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Paul Trussell","I wanted to touch on gross margins, a number of puts and takes going on. Maybe just touch first on what transpired in the second quarter, especially relative to your expectations? And maybe give a little bit more detail around the updated kind of third quarter and second half guidance. Thank you.","Andy Campion","Sure. I'll start with that one, Paul. In the quarter, as you know, our gross margin expansion landed about as closest we\u2019ve ever been to the guidance that we have provided. So, at the same time, there are some really important highlights to call within our margin. Our gross pricing margin as we call it, so that's our average selling prices net of product costs were very strong. We had strong average selling price increases, thanks to the strong product pipeline that we have and the innovation that we\u2019ve bringing to market. Of course, some of the other impacts in the quarter included tariffs. Tariffs in the quarter were roughly 40 to 50 basis-point impact, obviously pretty significant, if you were to add that back alone. So, that's the second impact I'd call out.","We also continue to make investments in our supply chain. A little bit of detail there. We are expanding our distribution center capacity in the Memphis and Mississippi areas to increase both, capacity and speed, especially with our growing digital business and omnichannel strategy with online to offline services. We are expanding some apparel distribution capability in EMEA, which again is reflective of just a great opportunity we see ahead in apparel and the momentum that we have in that market. Tokyo and Mexico City are also areas we\u2019re investing in our supply chain. We\u2019ve invested more broadly across our entire supply chain, putting RFID in our product. We now have RFID in about 100% of our footwear, about three quarters of our apparel. And for a little context, the benefits of that are still to come. So, the RFIDs in the product, the ability to scan and the distribution centers is significant with at least eight of our distribution centers having that ability. We're still in the early stages of growing out the ability to leverage that in stores, but it\u2019s happening, but more in the dozens of stores.","FX was an impact. Although that's one of the things -- I'll end there by saying, there are a lot of puts and takes within margin in any given quarter. And I would tell you not to focus on a quarterly margin expansion results, especially in these times as indicative of the trend. The real trend is strong gross pricing margin, the shift to our Nike Direct, the ability to capture more-full price sell-through et cetera. But, if I was to give you one of the more distinctive variances between Q3 and Q2, FX was in maybe the 15 basis-point headwind zone in Q2, and we see the impact of FX being more in line with what we saw in Q1, which is, say roughly 50 basis points. So, that alone more than more equates for the difference between what we delivered in Q2 and guidance.","Paul Trussell","That's helpful color. Thank you. Maybe turning now to SG&A. Just maybe talk a little bit more about the timing shift and just also how should we be thinking bigger picture as we move towards all of these key sporting events, especially the excitement around Tokyo 2020 as it relates to demand creation expenses, and how maybe some of that will be offset by where you are finding some efficiencies in the operations. Thank you.","Andy Campion","Yes. I guess, what I\u2019ll start by saying is, if you reflect on Q2, we both had stronger revenue than we expected going into the quarter. And obviously what you can infer is we felt less of a need to spend demand creation in the quarter to drive it. We\u2019ve got an incredibly strong pull market and just had and have great momentum. And so, in the spirit of realizing we\u2019ve got unrivaled resources in this industry, it's even more important than what we see an opportunity to really leverage those resources in a focused way. We make decisions and shift real-time. So, we looked at the situation and said we didn\u2019t mean that demand creation in Q2, we want to save that powder so to speak for the big events and the big launches that we have in the second half of the year and going into fiscal year 2021. So, that\u2019s really the biggest driver of that shift in SG&A.","To your question about Tokyo, Mark's probably the best person to give color on how excited we are about the product. But, you can infer from us wanting to shift. Part of demand creation is getting our voice out there and communicating the benefits of our product and how excited we are, and we in fact are. That\u2019s why we have deferred that demand creation.","Mark Parker","Yes. I\u2019ll just quickly add that the excitement around Tokyo is tremendous here at NIKE in terms of what's coming in the innovation pipeline. I mentioned, performance product that we have coming for Tokyo both in footwear and apparel. And then, we're leveraging that across sportswear and I think for men and women. So it's really a complete offense plan around Tokyo. And we think we have, to Andy's point, a lot to leverage with that demand creation spend. This is a big moment for us. This is every four years and we really rally around this event in a major way. So, the impact on the revenue you're going to see in the year but you're also going to see it carry on and influence our potential going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Alex Walvis","Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question here. So, first question is on North America footwear and strong acceleration in that category and the region during the quarter. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what's driving that from a styles and channels perspective, and perhaps any feedback from your partners on the new styles that are selling into that channel?","Mark Parker","Yes. I speak to complete offense quite a bit and the second half of the fiscal year we're really trying to dial up our offense, particularly in the core product, footwear product innovation, states and some of the new styles we have coming there, I think will give us a real boost in the second half. The reaction from retailers has been very positive, in terms of some of the new styles we got including the React product that we have coming. It\u2019s a new version React called Infinity React Run, which is actually higher performance shoes that we think will give us more access to that core runner. We have new core running styles coming in underneath that as well, both in men's and women's styles. We also have Air Max coming down into the core price range selectively leveraging the Air Max platform. We have others. If you look at some of the other styles we've got on the sportswear side, we've got Dunk, Blazer, the MJ product is -- the MJ Air Force -- or I'm sorry, the Air Jordan 1. Our Air Force 1 continues to be actually very strong for us. We\u2019re continuing to iterate new styles on both of those franchises. And with the addition of the Blazer and the Dunk in the mix, we think that that'll continue to create some good momentum for us on the footwear side. So, it's really a more complete offense for the second half on footwear with a big emphasis on core for us, particularly on our own channel in the digital direct space. So, we think that's going to be a good boost for us.","Alex Walvis","Second question, if I may is on Converse, really strong momentum in that brand now for another quarter. Can you talk about what's driving this growth rate there? And then, it seems to be that that is focused on international regions. Is there anything you can share on the outlook for North America and whether that can meet the growth rates seen elsewhere?","Mark Parker","Yes, much of the growth at Converse is being led by international, specifically Asia Pacific, really led by China, and then we're also seeing strong performance in EMEA, and much of that also is driven by digital. So, we're seeing incredible momentum for Converse really starting to build in those markets. We have some gaps to close in North America. I think. We are continuing to differentiate our product line beyond the Chuck. And I think that all creates more opportunities for us in basketball or looking at running and some other dimensions of the Converse footwear portfolio, apparel as well. We are seeing by the way strong growth in North America for Converse in the digital space. So, we think that's a sign of some optimism for us for Converse in North America going forward. And I think, the expansion of our digital platform for Converse is going to be a driver globally, certainly led currently by China, but we'll start to see that happen more and more in North America and for Europe.","Andy Campion","And I'd just add one thing. Mark spoke about adding diversification relative to the Chuck business. We've got some real momentum within the Chuck franchise, in particular driven by a style called the Chuck 70, which is growing really strong double to triple digits in all geographies. In fact, it's already a pretty significant percent of total Chuck business in markets like China and elsewhere and it's ramping up quickly in the U.S. So, we see great energy in terms of, as Mark would say, providing more choice and differentiation within a style that has the kind of expansive opportunity that the Chuck has. And that is a more premium version of the Chuck, which also kind of raises tentpole and adds the opportunity to expand on that franchise.","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Omar Saad","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great run, Mark.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Omar Saad","So, while I have you in a reflective mood, I'd love to hear your thoughts on two things. Number one, the decision to terminate the Amazon trial, maybe you could get into a little bit into the why, and what might get the NIKE brand to come back? And the second question I have, as the NIKE, Inc. CEO and having seen the various evolutions of the portfolio, do you think NIKE is going to be a multi-brand or a monogram company 10 years from now. And the reason I asked is, on the one hand you're talking about kind of shutting some of the legacy assets and you've divested Hurley, but on the other hand you are talking about -- describing this amazing kind of asset [Technical Difficulty] capabilities from back end to front end, and it feels like maybe there is an opportunity to plug some great brands in your platform and leverage what you we felt. So, I would love your kind of musings on those two topics. Thanks.","Mark Parker","Yes. Well, we have a clear framework for partners in the digital space, and what's guiding us is really to be in the path of the consumer in a way that's really right for the brand. We continue to see, just on a macro basis great momentum with our partners, including partners like Instagram and Google and Tmall and WeChat. So, brand right is really what's important here. And that's building those relationships with the consumer through better presentation I think elevated, authentic, consumer experiences on whatever digital platform. And this means ensuring that we have an environment where the consumer can be certain that they're buying authentic NIKE product from authorized retailers. So, that's been our focus as to really be -- to elevate the brand, strengthen the connection with consumer much like we do with the differentiated wholesale strategy. So, that's kind of led us to our decision in terms of moving forward.","We have -- your second question on multiple brands or one brand, mono brand, I would say pretty convincingly or confidently that we will be a multi-brand company in the future. We have multiple brands now, Nike, Jordan, Converse. We see tremendous upside potential with those brands. We're in the early stages of strengthening our portfolio and expanding our portfolio within the Jordan brand. Obviously, Sportswear is very strong, performance basketball, there is more upside, other performance categories, there is upside, apparel, women's, international growth. So, there is tremendous growth opportunity within that Jordan brand for NIKE.","And then, Converse, likewise. So, I think, as we just talked about, as we diversify that portfolio, strengthen our position in North America, tremendous upside I think for the Converse brand. And taking some of that pressure off of NIKE to be everything everybody, I think that's important. And then, we can leverage our capabilities, our digital capabilities for example, across the portfolio. And then, I think as we transform our operating model, we\u2019ll enable more and more opportunity for that broader NIKE portfolio.","Omar Saad","Congratulations on job. Well done.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Omar. Thank you very much.","Matt Friend","Operator, one last call before we wrap up.","Operator","Our last question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Matthew Boss","Great. Thanks. Nice quarter. And Mark contras on the transition.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Matthew Boss","I guess, so with this -- with five straight quarters of double-digit constant currency revenue growth, I guess maybe at a higher level, Mark, what do you see that\u2019s been driving the upside versus your high-single-digit growth algorithm? And what\u2019s your confidence in the multiyear product and innovation pipeline to sustain the stronger momentum.","Mark Parker","Well, I can honestly say, I\u2019ve never been more confident than I\u2019m right now. What's driving those results, those consistently strong results are not only the innovative product that really is where the consumer votes ultimately. So, the product has to be strong, the complete offense of products, footwear and apparel up and down the price points across the categories, men's and women's. I think we\u2019ve been driving a more complete offense, and much of that has been driven by the innovation that represents so much more of the percentage of our revenue growth than it had even just a few years ago. So, that's absolutely critical. And then, of course, I\u2019d say we get teased for saying digital transformation, as much as we do. But, it's clearly driving some incredible results for us. And I sit here today firmly believing and more confident than ever that that will continue to drive great opportunity and upside for us. And I\u2019m excited to have John come in and be a part of accelerating that transformation for us going forward. It's going to be to me a win-win situation between the incredible team we have on the field today. John with his expertise, my guidance, continue to focus on things that I think are really important for the Company, particularly in the innovation, design product, marketing space. I think, those continue to be core fundamental driving principles for Nike's and that's exciting for me going forward."," And then, lastly I will say is, what's really driving all of this, all the above is the team that we have here. We have incredible talent at Nike, not only individual talent across the Company, the functions, the geos, the categories, but the collective team and how that teams come together. It\u2019s really -- the chemistry of the team is one of those things that does get talked about its business very often. But we have great chemistry and incredibly competitive driven team and that ultimately is what's going to drive the success of any company. And that's certainly the case here at Nike.","Matthew Boss","That\u2019s great. Congrats again on the quarter. Thank you, Mark.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Matt Friend","Thanks, Matt. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Happy holidays to everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com.","Joining us on today's call will be NIKE Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh. Hello and happy holidays, everyone. We've seen some amazing highlights in sports this past year. Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon World Record. Simone Byles dominated the world championships. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 became a global star at the World Cup and LeBron James continued to inspire on and off the court.","It was a year of incredible achievements for NIKE as well and Q2 was another strong proof point on our journey. We continue to show progress against our key long-term objectives of driving innovation, direct connections and speed and agility around the world.","Our teams are doing a fantastic job of delivering sustainable, profitable growth through the Consumer Direct Offense, while aggressively pursuing our highest potential long-term opportunities. We set high goals and each success makes us hungry for more.","The marketplace in which we compete is highly dynamic. Consumer expectations are accelerating and the macro-economy is increasingly volatile. A key part of our strategy to win in this environment is to double down on digital. Our digital transformation is taking hold through a series of positive disruptions across the business.","For example, we're leading the industry through a retail revolution. We're creating sports first, smart adaptive footwear. And we're investing in a global supply chain that delivers personnel at scale. It's all incredibly energizing and we find that the more disruptive we are, the more we grow.","Our digital disruption is fueled by breaking old models, building new commerce partnerships, emerging new talent with our years of industry experience. Our teams are driving change and it's yielding excellent results.","For the quarter, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 10%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 14%. Gross margin was up 80 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was up 13% to prior year.","Specific highlights include 9% growth in North America and nearly 20% constant currency growth in our international geographies. Digital growth of 41% on a constant currency basis and continued momentum in both sportswear and performance categories, including a return to growth in the Jordan business.","The momentum we're driving is grounded in strong product innovation. We're increasing the pace of new concepts and bringing a new discipline to how we manage the life cycle of our innovation.","We have a clear road map of how we stage our new platforms, giving each one the space to shine through high-energy storytelling and then ramping up scale and choice to serve diverse consumer needs. Put simply, we're increasing the return on investment in innovation.","One of our great differentiators is, of course, NIKE Air. It's being energized through platforms like VaporMax and Air Max 270, two of the world's top-selling athletic footwear models. New interpretations of our icons, led by the Air Max 95 and 97. And this spring, we're excited to add a new distinct Air platform to the mix with the Air Max 270. The consumer is already anticipating its arrival and will keep the interest high through multiple iterations early in its product life cycle.","NIKE React too will enter a new phase as we expand the platform beyond running and basketball into lifestyle product, with the Element 55, and the shoe of the year, the Element 87. Both styles will scale significantly in 2019. Next year, we'll also add NIKE React hybrids to combine multiple cushioning platforms, along with a redesigned Epic React 2.0 coming in spring.","As we broaden platforms across categories, we're also broadening them across price points to bring them to more people. As we mentioned on our call - last call, we see greater opportunities for moderately priced footwear from NIKE right now. So we're creating a more complete consumer offense for core footwear by creating performance and lifestyle icons and core-only innovations.","At NIKE, it's our mission to make athletes better. But perhaps no innovation delivers on that promise by ZoomX and the Vaporfly 4%, which has dominated the world's marathons since 2017. We've started something special with the 4%, enabling a dramatic improvement for the world's best runners, and you can expect more exciting breakthroughs to come here.","That reputation has made its way to every day athletes, making 4%, the most sought after shoe on race day, and it's created a halo effect for many of our NIKE's fast footwear styles, especially the Peg 35, driving double-digit growth in the running category in Q2.","I'm excited to announce that in the New Year, we'll launch a new adaptive performance platform in Basketball at the $350 price point. We have a smart shoe designed for the perfect fit and it's a major step in advancing and connecting our digital transformation to product. This is just one better fit solution amongst many that we're working on. And we look forward to rolling them out throughout the year.","We have a full innovation pipeline ahead, including new cushioning platforms, which will carry our strong product momentum into fiscal '20, all the way to Tokyo Olympics and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the Olympics team and the Tokyo 2020 collection is the boldest we've ever assembled across performance and lifestyle in footwear and apparel.","We're growing our competitive advantages in many ways. Sustainability is one example, where we're reducing waste at a scale that creates change for our entire industry. NIKE Flyleather made a 50% reclaimed leather, will scale to over 1 million pairs starting this summer. NIKE Flyknit represents a multi-billion dollar business and uses 60% less waste than traditional manufacturing. And NIKE Air uses 50% recycled manufacturing waste in hundreds of millions of pairs. As a whole, we're making great progress to lower our environmental impact as a company, driving greater efficiencies and fueling growth in our business.","Another area where our 2X Innovation agenda is making a dramatic impact is in apparel. As designers, there is no greater challenge than innovating for the body in motion. We think about many things, such as how to account for different environments through moisture management, creating breathability that adapts as needed or keeping our gourmet comfortable, the climate comfortable when it's twisting and turning.","Through new materials and methods of make, our apparel teams are continuing to push the limits in performance silhouettes, and in the process, creating new style. Our strategy starts with taking sports into new places.","For example, in basketball, our partnership with the NBA is fueling strong growth. Our NBA apparel accelerated in year two, especially with our city editions jerseys, led by Miami, Minnesota and Brooklyn. And to no one 's surprise, LeBron has moved to the Lake, who has also created opportunity. We already booked 3x more NIKE lakers gear this year.","And our work with the NBA has also created a lift for NIKE in line basketball apparel. We built on the success of our showtime hoodie and added Therma Flex pants, which has seen great sell-through. Overall, the traction we've gained for basketball in NIKE Direct and internationally led to strong global growth for the Basketball category this quarter.","In sportswear, our biggest category apparel grew over 20% this quarter. Sportswear fleece and women's apparel were up double digits. In sportswear, we are anchoring our communications around head-to-toe collections, which makes it easier for consumers to shop to complete look and strengthens our presentation and storytelling.","Apparel continues to be one of NIKE's greatest growth opportunities, and in the back half of the fiscal year, there's a lot to be excited about. We're launching new high-performance kits for the Woman's World Cup in France. Yoga collection, that includes men's yoga apparel for the first time at NIKE. New types innovation and expanded NIKE Tech Pack collection.","Two other areas of our business where we're accelerating, but we know we have much more opportunity ahead is Women's and Jordan. There's incredible momentum for women in sport right now as athletes elite and every day lead a movement of health and wellness, while driving a strong appetite for athletic footwear and apparel. This energy is manifesting in a number of ways.","For example, footwear for women overall was up 20% for the quarter, and sneakers for her are really taking off with the Sage Air Force 1 emerging as for favorite franchise, owning the number one spot on nike.com for 5 weeks running.","Our edit to amplify strategy to offer more color and material choices and fewer styles is also proving successful. NIKE has the top three selling women's athletic footwear models above $125 with the Air Max 270, VaporMax and Epic React. And in apparel, our broad business remains a strong growth opportunity, up over 20% in Q2.","Looking ahead to this summer's World Cup, NIKE will dominate on the pitch. A total of 14 of the 24 national teams will compete in NIKE, including the favorite U.S. national team. And throughout the year, we'll continue to - our Just Do It campaign that celebrates elite and everyday female athletes around the world. We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for woman in sport with more participation, more coverage and overall more energy.","Meanwhile, with the Jordan Brand, we're seeing positive results from the strategic shifts that we are making. In Q2, Jordan grew double digits and we returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. At the same time, we continued our pace of double-digit growth internationally.","We're making great progress in diversifying Jordan. Apparel had a very strong quarter, especially internationally. Sell-through of the Jordan and PSG collaboration exceeded expectations and we'll come back with a refreshed collection in January.","Jordan's performance footwear is also contributing to solid growth, led by the new Air Jordan XXXIII [ph] game shoe and the Max Aura that's doing well in China at $120 price point. And from a Sportswear perspective, we're elevating our storytelling with icons like the Air Jordan 1, which is more coveted than ever.","At the start of Q3, our team executed an incredible effort with the most successful NIKE sneaker ever launched, with the Air Jordan XI Concord. It was a well-orchestrated plan, complete with geo targeting that offered preheat paris [ph] to our members, total integration across our business with partners like House of Hoops and Footaction and locally driven storytelling in our key cities.","The Concord shows that the Jordan Brand yet again has the power to drive launches with incredible volume and create energy for the brand. We're bringing much greater balance to Jordan with much more opportunity ahead.","In 2X Direct, we're beginning to realize a multiplying effect as we scale our most innovative experiences. This quarter, you could feel the momentum swing in the conversation around retail. We saw at over the Thanksgiving shopping week, fueling more than 30% increase in our digital business in North America for the quarter.","In China, Singles Day once again broke records. NIKE earned a number one sport brand on Tmall with our overall business for the day, up over 40% from last year's Singles Day. It's clear that the consumers craving experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn and scale new features.","We know not every one of our new experiences will be successful and not all will be scalable. But when we do find features that improve our services, NIKE's advantage is how quickly we deploy them across our global footprint.","In November, we opened our House of Innovation concept in both Shanghai and New York. The energy and performance at both locations has exceeded expectations. Both stores create the most personal and responsive retail environment in the industry. It's a digital experience brought to life in a physical space. And uses our most exciting features to date, such as the ability to scan barcodes to check availability and by the full look of mannequins, instant check out that requires no waiting at the register, expert studio that gives personal guidance, and special unlocks and notifications when members enter the store.","The gateway for consumers to get the most value out of these new experiences is membership. We want more doors to feel like a personal home for members, where we can elevate one-to-one service. And we want to leverage mobile apps to make sure NIKE is serving our consumers wherever they are"," One way we do that with members is to create ways to be in their path more organically. For example, the LeBron Watch, which will deliver 25% of the LeBron 16s in the marketplace this year makes these on court shoes available in the moment through sneakers and our partner mobile apps.","In China, this month, we gave early access to the Kyrie 5 through a QR code and a live streamed NBA game on WeChat. And users can now buy directly on our NIKE Run Club and NIKE Training Club apps, personalized to the way they train.","Another key to making NIKE commerce a part of people's lives more seamlessly again and again is to develop unique experiences with some of the world's most engaging and brand-friendly platforms. And this quarter, we did that with a new feature in Instagram, that allows NIKE product to be shopped directly from stores.","On the Apple Watch, where we continue to serve our most active and highly-valued NIKE Run Club members. And with Google, where consumers can now buy directly from NIKE through search and Google Assistant. And to further leverage partnerships that amplify our brand, we're making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, Nordstrom and Dick's Sporting Goods, where elevated experiences are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel.","We know that to fully leverage or fully offer consumers what they want in the moment requires a high level of agility in our business. And through 2X Speed, we're elevating the industry, creating an end-to-end value chain that's centered on the consumer.","The pillars are demand sensing and insights, so we know our consumer, responsive product creation and manufacturing to provide the best product, delivery at speed for product to arrive when they wanted and connected inventory so they're never disappointed and starts with better demand sensing and insights.","In Q2, our Express Lane business grew double digits, supporting key cities with hyperlocal product and faster fulfillment to drive higher full price sell-through. Responsive product creation and manufacturing has many components.","Digital product creation allows for greater precision and creativity and design, planning and staging materials drastically reduces lead times and automation increases speed and quality in manufacturing.","Today, more than half of our total footwear production has been modernized through initiatives started in the modernization centers of our top six manufacturing partners and our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters.","We're also investing in delivery at speed. Take Singles Day as an example. To deliver against this massive opportunity, we had coordinated fulfillment strategy across our 12 Greater China distribution centers, and we shipped direct from over 50 retail doors to consumers on the day. Overall, we fulfilled over 5 million units in 5 days.","And finally, our connected inventory strategy with partners like Zalando and JD will help us realize many of our Speed initiatives. In support of that initiative, we'll introduce RFID into footwear and all not licensed apparel in 2019. This will lead to vastly improve product visibility and accuracy across the supply chain from product creation to point-of-sale. And it further opens up the possibility to integrate more widely with our wholesale partners, contract factories and distribution centers.","Each of these work streams is a building block for NIKE to become more personal at scale. And as a system, they demand enterprise-wide coordination and innovation. NIKE's ambitious digital transformation is driving the strong results you see today. We're staying competitive and opportunistic with every shift in the marketplace.","As a leader, NIKE has high expectations. And as good as this quarter was, we know we have the ability to do much more. We're going to continue to use our scale, speed and agility to grow sport and our business around the world.","Thanks. And now here's Andy","Andrew Campion","Thank you, Mark, and happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year.","Our strong growth was also broad-based across all four of our geographies, as well as across footwear, apparel, men's, women's and most categories. This broad-based momentum is not happening by accident, but rather is being fueled by our focus on what matters most to consumers globally.","The common theme across our portfolio is the Consumer Direct Offense. More specifically, we are bringing the triple-double of 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed to life in our 12 key cities and 10 key countries around the world.","Take innovation, for example. We've said we expect new innovation platforms to drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fact, year-to-date, new innovation platforms, including VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have driven over 80% of our incremental growth.","Another significant contributor to our growth from a product perspective are our Power Franchises. By leveraging an approach that Mark calls editing to amplify, we're bringing new dimension and driving the growth of iconic franchises like the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. We do that, for example, through fresh new designs and collaborations for both men and women, as well as color and material updates through our Express Lane.","Our broad-based growth is also being fueled by new experiences that more directly connect NIKE to our consumers globally. We expect NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE experiences physical and digital will contribute over 50% of our incremental growth and outpace undifferentiated retail over the next 5 years, leading the way once again in Q2 with NIKE Digital.","Our NIKE Digital ecosystem continues to grow faster than all other channels, growing 41% on a currency neutral basis. And as we drive deeper, more organic, one-to-one engagement with consumers, mobile now represents well over 50% of our digital commerce revenue.","Our 2X Speed initiative is also driving our momentum. Cutting our time to market in half is not an all or nothing proposition, we're already infusing greater speed and agility into our product creation and supply chain processes, allowing us to amplify what's working with the consumer closer to real time.","For example, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane is growing double digits and now represents a double-digit percentage of our total business. This is significant as Express Lane product also largely sells through at full price, favorably impacting margins.","2X Speed also includes initiatives ranging from leveraging automation to a more focused materials power and material staging. These initiatives also reduce product cost and enhance inventory efficiency, the greater labor productivity and less waste.","In short, we are very pleased with our strategic execution and the strong performance we have delivered to date. That said, more importantly, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward.","While FX headwinds have intensified, we now expect stronger currency neutral revenue growth in fiscal year '19 than previously planned. And as we're beginning to gain greater insight into fiscal year '20, we're seeing continued strong demand.","Our positive outlook is not merely optimism, but rather is founded on fundamental changes in how we operate at NIKE. One fundamental change is how we bring innovation to market.","In addition to driving faster innovation cycles, we're also focused on innovation platforms that have greater potential to scale across geographies. Accordingly, as Mark detailed, we've an extraordinary pipeline of innovation to come over the balance of fiscal year '19 and throughout fiscal year '20.","That begins in spring with the launch of the Air Max 720 and HyperAdapt in Basketball, and extends the innovation platforms launching in early fiscal year '20 and through and beyond the Tokyo Olympics.","We're also digitally transforming NIKE and driving positive disruption in our industry, unlocking new opportunities for growth long-term. While we already have extraordinary digital momentum, we're still in the early stages of this transformation. We are executing against a 3 year road map of new digital capabilities that will enable us to continually serve consumers better. We're aggressively building those capabilities in-house and accelerating our development of those capabilities through acquisition.","Our 3 year road map also includes the global expansion of our digital ecosystem in the key cities and countries, where we see the greatest opportunity for growth. For example, just last month, we launched the NIKE App in Japan, where it immediately became the number one rated shopping app.","Over the next 5 years, we see the Consumer Direct Offense delivering on the financial model and measures of success we communicated at our Investor Day back in October 2017. But we are already setting our sights even higher longer term. We see the opportunity to expand the definition of sport, to be even more inclusive, including competition and training as well as movement and play.","By using this broader lens to inspire and enable more active lifestyle, we will grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel. There are four areas where this purpose-driven approach to growth is creating outsized opportunities for us, international, digital, apparel and women's.","The overall footwear and apparel industries in our international markets are already significantly larger in aggregate than in the U.S. That said, in international markets, the athletic segment of the overall footwear and apparel market has historically been less penetrated than in the U.S., but that is changing fast.","Sport participation and culture continue to accelerate in international markets. And when sport grows, NIKE grows. China is perhaps the best current example of this phenomenon.","And second, we said at our Investor Day, that digital owned and partnered, would comprise 30% of our business by 2023 as compared to roughly 15% of our business today. Frankly, we're already thinking bigger as we look longer term.","Our industry has lagged many other industries in terms of digital penetration. Many consumer products industries are already at 50% digital penetration and projected to be well over 80% digital by 2030.","We all know that disruptive new consumer-centric digital experiences have catalyzed the shift to digital in those industries. So as we increasingly innovate and lead with digital, we are intentionally disrupting our industry. We see this as positive disruption that widens the aperture for growth long term. We now see 30% digital penetration as just a milepost on our path to the majority of our business being digital.","Third, apparel is another extraordinary opportunity for growth at NIKE. Apparel is a larger market in footwear globally. And at the same time, athletic apparel accounts for a smaller percentage of overall apparel than athletic accounts for within overall footwear.","That dynamic is also changing fast. Consumers are increasingly choosing performance and sportswear apparel for more occasions as it better serves their more active and expressive lifestyle.","And finally, as we aim to redefine and expand the definition of sport, that is with a sharp focus on women. Similar to the strong returns we are seeing from having doubled our investment in innovation, we see the potential for asymmetrical returns by editing and more aggressively shifting resources towards our women's business.","The women's footwear and apparel markets are larger than men's. Yet today, women's represents less than quarter of NIKE's total revenue. And we're already on this journey, as our women's business grew double digits in Q2, but we see step change growth opportunities ahead by serving women more deeply within classifications and across more occasions for her.","In short, we have strong current momentum and we have extraordinary growth potential long term. But before I share more specifics regarding our outlook, let's reflect on the drivers of our current momentum.","NIKE Inc. Q2 revenue increased 10%, up 14% on a currency neutral basis. This exceptional growth reflects double-digit currency neutral momentum internationally and strong high single-digit growth in North America.","NIKE Digital was the fastest growing channel in each geography with 41% growth in aggregate on a currency neutral basis, again, led by mobile. That said, FX headwinds had a slightly larger impact on our reported revenue growth than the roughly three points we anticipated 90 days ago.","We also delivered strong gross margin expansion of 80 basis points across NIKE Inc., fueled by NIKE Direct's growth and a higher mix of full price sales. Demand creation grew 4% in the quarter with our focus being on increasingly connecting with consumers through digital experiences and platforms.","Operating overhead increased 18%, reflecting strategic investments that are accelerating NIKE's digital transformation and will fuel long-term growth. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%.","Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 13% versus prior year. And as of November 30, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a healthy pull market for NIKE and a lower mix of closeout across all geographies.","Now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 9% on a reported and currency neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew high single digits with NIKE Digital up well over 30% in North America.","As Mark mentioned, we are now turning our vision for the next generation of retail into a reality. In our NIKE Live concept on Melrose, we're aligning data-driven, bi-weekly flow of the product to the store with digital storytelling and one-to-one connections between the store team and local consumers.","As a result, the store is driving strong digital member acquisition, engagement and buying. And we're seeing even more impressive early results at our new House of Innovation in New York.","While the overall retail marketplace in North America is still going through consolidation, and we do expect that to continue, our NIKE wholesale business in aggregate has returned to strong growth with improving profitability, led by our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and increasingly JD.","In Q2, we also reignited brand heat in North America through the Just Do It campaign that was launched in early September and by amplifying key moments in sport like the launch of the NBA season.","We see our brand tee across both NIKE and Jordan, our strong pipeline of innovative product and digitally like consumer experiences continuing to fuel strong growth in North America.","In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth across sportswear, running, training and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace growing over 30% versus prior year. We have extraordinary momentum in this geography as we're taking significant share and we're growing the market. We are mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Europe.","That said, we have a long track record of delivering growth and profitability amidst a wide range of macroeconomic circumstances. As we look ahead, we expect our momentum to continue in Europe. In all five of our key cities in EMEA, consumers rate us as the number one cool and number one favorite brand, and in fact, those ratings strengthened even further in Q2. We're connecting more directly and deeply with consumers locally through our key city focus and we're seeing the impact globally.","For example, through the PSG-Jordan partnership, we connected authentically with consumers in Paris, while the product sold out at launch around the world. We also recently introduced the NIKE App at Retail and NIKE Town London, as well as the sneaker's past experience in Paris, allowing consumers to reserve shoes from high heat launches and pick up in store. Those services are removing friction and personalizing the shopping experience, driving significant new member acquisition in two of our key global cities.","Next, let's turn to Greater China, where yet, again we delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q2. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in China. In Q2, growth accelerated to 31% on a currency-neutral basis with digital growing over 40%.","As evidence of the scale and digital nature of this important market, as well as the strength of the NIKE Brand, our sneakers app community in China, and recall that the sneakers app was launched just last year, it's already the same size as our sneakers community in North America.","In Q2, with the opening of House of Innovation in Shanghai, we also began to more fully leverage digital in this largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment. It's still early days, but the results have been extraordinary.","While there has been uncertainty of late regarding U.S., China relations, we have not seen any impact on our business. NIKE continues to win with the consumer in China. For over three decades, NIKE has been a brand of China, for China. We've connected deeply with the consumer here through our key city focus on Shanghai and Beijing.","Through partnerships with sports federations, teams and athletes and by partnering with China's Ministry of Sport to fuel greater sport participation in schools across the country.","In fact, just last month, leading up to the Shanghai Marathon, we took Eliud Kipchoge on a tour of Shanghai and other key cities. And then on Marathon Day, we launched a Shanghai-focused Just Do It campaign. In just the first 24 hours, the campaign was watched more than 16 million times. We are bullish about our potential to continue delivering strong, sustainable and very profitable growth in this important geography.","In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis with balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel, as well as double-digit growth in sportswear Jordan and NIKE basketball.","NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 75%. We also continue to expand our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through commerce partnerships, such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others.","APLA is a market in which we are extremely entrepreneurial, testing new concepts that leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience at retail. As we mentioned on our last call, we'll be opening a NIKE Live experience in Tokyo in Q3. And in Seoul, we are testing our connected inventory strategy. We have connected the inventory across 19 NIKE branded doors, including doors owned by two of our strategic partners. This connected inventory pilot has yielded very promising early results, serving thousands of consumers whose demand would otherwise have been unmet due to product being out of stock in a particular store.","And finally at Converse, revenue increased 6% on a currency neutral basis in Q2. Growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and a sharp acceleration in own digital growth globally, approaching triple digits.","While Converse wholesale in the U.S. and U.K. remain challenged in Q2, Digital also accelerated in those markets. We see significant opportunity to grow Converse by expanding the product portfolio, including within Basketball as well as launching a new digital platform.","And with that, let's turn to our outlook. There is increasing volatility and uncertainty of late on a macro level. That said, what is certain is that NIKE's execution of the consumer direct offense is driving consistently strong and sustainable broad-based growth across our diverse global portfolio. That is because we are focused on what matters most to consumers and they are responding globally with strong demand for NIKE.","Accordingly, our full year guidance for fiscal year '19 reflects stronger currency-neutral revenue growth, stronger gross margin expansion and accelerated strategic investment.","For the full year, we now expect currency neutral revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range, potentially approaching low double digits. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported full year revenue growth to be over 3 points lower than our currency neutral revenue growth. In other words, at the low end of the high single-digit range.","For gross margin, our outlook has also improved. We expect our full year gross margin expansion to be roughly in line with the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points that we delivered over the first half of fiscal year '19.","We expect SG&A for the full year to grow in the high single digits as we continue to invest in new digital capabilities that will differentiate NIKE and fuel our long-term growth. We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be between $50 million and $75 million for the full year. And we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens for fiscal year '19. That said, the finalization of regulations-related U.S. tax reform may result in discrete adjustments that impact our tax rate.","While our focus is on sustaining profitable growth over the course of fiscal year '19 and for the long term, I will provide a bit of context on Q3 considering the current macro environment.","In Q3, we expect strong currency neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range. Based on FX dynamics, our reported real dollar revenue growth will likely be roughly 4 points lower than our currency neutral revenue growth in Q3.","For gross margin, we expect Q3 expansion to be roughly in line with our full year guidance. As for SG&A, we expect growth in the low double-digit range in Q3 as we continue to prioritize strategic investment. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be between 16% and 18%.","Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is driving consistently strong performance. Yet, we are still in the early stages. As we continue to execute, we're not only building current momentum, we're also gaining greater insight into NIKE's potential to transform the industry, drive sustainable growth and create extraordinary value for shareholders long term.","With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Lauren Cassel","Thanks so much and really nice quarter. I just want to ask about gross margin. So 70 basis points for the full year and in the third quarter. I think previously, you were expecting second half gross margin to be a little bit better than the first half. Is there anything that's changed or maybe just being a little more conservative given the macro backdrop? That's my first question.","And then, maybe just talk to us a little bit about how much of the 9% growth in North America has been driven by ASP versus units? And perhaps given the robust innovation pipeline that you guys have, if there's an opportunity for that region to potentially grow a little bit faster than 3% to 4% over the long-term? Thank you.","Andrew Campion","All right. Thanks for the question, Lauren. As for gross margin, I'll touch on that question first. We are expecting our gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expected in Q2.","We're seeing structural benefits to our margin from our over-indexing growth in Direct, which has had very strong momentum and momentum that's exceeded our expectations, specifically in digital, as well as a greater mix of premium innovative product and stronger full price sell-through.","We're also benefiting from a clean marketplace, particularly for NIKE. So as noted in my remarks, we do have an improved outlook for '19 with our expansion been roughly in line with the year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points. And as we noted when we entered the year, we expect that the second half margin to be stronger than the first half. And in the first quarter, our margin expansion was lesser than in the second quarter. I would note that in any given quarter, there can be anomalies that impact margin.","And finally, I'd note that, Q2 is a quarter in which our margin is historically lower. Q3 and Q4, we have higher margin. And so the expansion we expect in the third and fourth quarters is actually strong expansion on an already relatively higher quarterly margin.","And then you asked about ASP and units. What I would note is that ASPs were up across our portfolio in both footwear and apparel. Again, new innovation, strong full price sell-through, our shift to Direct, clean marketplace are impacting ASPs. We see continued ASP expansion in our order book going forward.","And so very balanced. Again, single-digit rates of increase in footwear and in apparel, with apparel ASP is even expanding a little bit stronger than footwear, but both strong. And then, like I said, balanced with strong unit expansion in both footwear and apparel.","Lauren Cassel","Great. Thanks very much\u2026","Andrew Campion","Thank you, Lauren. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question today was on Jordan. I know you don't talk or guide the magnitude of growth that you expect for a particular line or brand. But I wondered if you could talk generally the direction of what you expect for Jordan for the rest of fiscal year '19? And what are the key drivers that's going to be accelerating that growth?","Mark Parker","Yes. As we said, the growth for Q2 was exceptional and we had a great start for Q3, with the largest product launch that we've ever had in our history. So that's a good signal right there. I think that the great story in Jordan is that we're managing the business more holistically between performance, product and retro. It's a clean market, a healthy market, particularly in North America.","So we're in a good pull market situation now. We got great brand heat, I think, and that's really driven by strong product and storytelling. I mentioned the Concord of late. The PSG collaboration was a great source of energy that was kind of unexpected. But incredible sell-through in energy, not just in Europe, but around the world.","So I think the potential in Jordan is the return to growth in North America and on the energy and the enthusiasm for the brand and the product around the world, and including and maybe I'll especially call out China there.","And then, we have more potential as we diversify the portfolio of product, particularly around the Woman's offense in both footwear and in apparel. So again we're actually quite bullish on the future opportunities and continued growth for Jordan in the second half and beyond as we move into fiscal '20.","Andrew Campion","And just to emphasize the point that Mark made, Kate, Jordan's growth was strong in the quarter and it was based on growth across all geographies. We had strong growth in North America as well as Mark said, very strong double-digit growth internationally.","Kate McShane","Okay, great. Thank you. And if I could just \u2013 all right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from\u2026","Andrew Campion","Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. Your next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good evening. I guess, just if we could stay on North America for a minute. I think you highlighted, I think, athletic specialty a little bit. Is the growth in the other channels having an outsized impact on this - the high single digit in this very strong outlook, can you talk maybe to some of the change to yourselves, and how you're doing in that area, please?","Mark Parker","Yeah, I think the growth is - I mean, we feel really great about the growth in Digital as we've stressed continuously in our prepared remarks, but we also mentioned the increase on the wholesale side beyond expectations there. And I think that's driven by the elevation of the experience, the doors with, particularly with Foot Locker and Dick's for example.","We're seeing - where we have invested in elevating and differentiating the retail experience for the consumer that we're seeing tremendous response. Obviously, the backbone of that demand and that response is great product. So we feel really good about that in terms of where we began this first half and then obviously with what's coming.","But our - the strategic relationships with our bigger partners, who are really investing in the consumer experience is what we're seeing paying off. And we're bullish on that as we move forward. But, again, the big driver here is the combination of wholesale, including - in addition to our direct Digital.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And I'm just curious if, in the Jordan business, there's some momentum there, has - did the Michael Jordan and Malik Monk little exchange, did that help the business at all coming out of the quarter? Or has it had no impact?","Mark Parker","Well, any news is good news in a way. There is - a little bit of energy is always good. So we will take it.","Andrew Campion","We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Paul Trussell","Congrats on the great results. Could you just give a little bit more detail on your confident outlook outside of North America? Certainly, we see it in the results, but certainly, there have also been other companies that are maybe flat incremental discounting or concerns around a slowdown in sneaker sales, both in Europe and in China. So if you can just speak in more detail to your success there?","And then second, if you can just go back and maybe talk a bit more about the opportunity for more moderately price point products. I think you mentioned early in your comments. Just elaborate on where you see that opportunity from a geography or channel or stall opportunity? Thanks.","Andrew Campion","Yeah. Sure. I'll touch on the first part of your question related to the momentum in China and Europe in contrast of what you referred to is what some others maybe saying in those markets. We're seeing extraordinary momentum in both markets. I'd say the headline in China is our growth continues to accelerate. We are the number one brand with consumers in China. We are brand of China, deeply connected with teams, federations, athletes. And, again, even the government to some extent, the Ministry of Sports in terms of our joint venture to fuel sport participation.","We're seeing incredibly strong demand for our product, the innovation that we're launching, our Basketball product, our Jordan product. And then, as we've noted, our Digital business, both our NIKE Digital ecosystem and through our partnership with Tmall is fueling extremely strong growth.","We have not seen any impact from our business from some of the U.S., China dynamics that we're all reading about. We're mindful of those. But in the context of being mindful of those, we continue to see very strong signs of momentum in China.","As per Europe, very similar. Europe, we have great momentum. In both geographies, ASPs are strong, comp store sales are strong, closeout mix is low, inventory is healthy. In EMEA, in particular, we're taking significant share. That's also amplifying our growth.","Mark Parker","Yes, the core footwear, let me touch on that briefly. We see basically our approach to complete offense. One of the things we look at is where are the opportunities on the offense to actually grow the business even further than what we see today. And core footwear, more excessively priced product in that core footwear zone, particularly in North America, but really around the world is a big opportunity for us.","We're doing well with the business, but, we think, there's more upside opportunity. We want to leverage some of the platforms that we've introduced more completely with more accessible versions of those products for those products within those platforms, as well as actually creating unique innovation that is targeted towards that core, more accessible price point. And actually, amp [ph] up our storytelling around that product. We think that there's tremendous opportunity for us as well there.","Andrew Campion","Operator, we'll take the question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jamie Merriman","Thanks. The first question is, Andy, you talked about that 30% Digital target that you laid out at Investor Day last year as maybe more of the mile marker. So I guess, can you talk about whether you think you will achieve that faster than what you had laid out? And then, what you think that ultimate opportunity is? And you used a reference 50% or 80% in other categories, I mean, how you get there?","And then the second piece is, Mark, you mentioned that you're introducing RFID into footwear and non-licensed apparel. But how will that work with your wholesale partners who may or may not all have RFID capabilities? And what do you think that will enable NIKE to do?","Andrew Campion","All right. Jamie, I'll touch on your question regarding our long-term vision for digital. Frankly, we're not taking a year-over-year incremental rate of growth approach to Digital. Looking out longer-term, we do see the potential to have Digital be the majority of our business.","And as I noted, when we look to other industries, which you referenced, other industries, consumer products industries, not just Digital or content industries, but other industries ranging from toys to electronics, books, et cetera, we see that in each of those industries, there was positive disruption that catalyzed that shift. And as the leader in our industry, we're going to continue to invest in this digital transformation of NIKE, and even more importantly, a consumer-centric digital transformation of the industry.","Some examples of that are the services that we're providing within our NIKE App, the sneaker's app, which really has been a source of explosive growth. Our membership program, which, we believe, is a uniquely compelling proposition within this industry in terms of the friction that it removes for consumers and the personalization that it gives our consumers.","And then as Mark touched upon on the call, we think, driving digital penetration in our industry also has quite a bit to do with leveraging the power of digital in the physical retail environment.","And again, as we always have as NIKE, we tend to catalyze that change by putting innovative new experiences into the market, that then catalyze the change not only within our owned store base because that's something within our control but that's an example for the strategic wholesale partners that we've referenced. In terms of the experience, we would like to see them continue to evolve.","So we're very ambitious, but we see the goals is very achievable when you look at benchmarks in other industries. So again it's less about when we would get to the 30%. And it's more about our extreme confidence that, that we're going to go well beyond that number over the long term.","Mark Parker","And quickly on RFIDs, connected inventory is a way that will enable us to meet demand - consumer demand much more effectively, more efficiently. We're going to be scaling RFID and product as I mentioned throughout 2019.","We'll be working closely with our retail partners, obviously and obviously all of NIKE Direct so that when consumers is really looking for product, we're in a position to provide it if it's not in the store that they're looking for.","So we think that this, as Andy pointed out with the example in Korea, that, we think, that the opportunity here to affect the consumer - satisfying consumer demand is going to be actually pretty significant throughout the year. And that's just going to grow across 2019. So we're very bullish on that.","Andrew Campion","Operator, I think, we'll take one last question, please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Happy holidays, everyone. Great to see the innovation. It's great to see the innovation being rewarded, but building momentum. I want to talk a little bit about the Women's business in the context of the size of the opportunity, that's very encouraging. What's been the big unlock with the recent success? I'm sure there's more to it than just the other [ph] amplified? Are you speaking the female consumers in a different way? Or is there some sort of structural or cultural tailwind that's strengthened recently?","Mark Parker","Well, as we mentioned, women's is outpacing men's growth for the quarter, and we see that continuing as we move forward through the fiscal year and beyond. I think there's a number of factors. I think women are embracing sneaker culture. We're seeing that with some of the iconic franchises that we've had like the Air Force 1 that are actually designed specifically for women with deeper insights, that, I think, resonate.","And that's one example, but that's true across the product offering. Using the insights that we gain in that connection that we have with the female consumer, we're creating better product and we're seeing that reflected in the demand.","The capsule collections that we've introduced in apparel Nike Metallic Sheen was one, Terra Perma was another capsule collection. Great response to those. I think it's relevant product in the end. Compelling relevant product is the foundation of that demand.","And then, I think, the brand is actually speaking to women more directly and personally. And as I said in my remarks, that's going to be amped up throughout this 2019 as we head towards World Cup. You're going to see Just Do It with a big emphasis on women's.","And then sports is affecting lifestyle and fashion in a way that we're seeing dramatic impacts around the world. There's a real appetite for more active lifestyle and that's expecting fashion and what - the product that we're creating is more sensitive to that and we're seeing the response from that work.","Jim Duffy","And you mentioned women's 25% of the business globally, can you speak about how that shakes out across the regions?","Andrew Campion","Sure. It's relatively evenly distributed across the regions. And from a categorical perspective, it's largely comprised sportswear, running and training, which is, in part, why it's relatively well distributed across the regions. In terms of the rate of growth, it's outpacing in all geos, outpacing the men's business.","Now in terms of where opportunity is, as Mark touched on, we've got tremendous momentum, and that momentum is opening the aperture in terms of our vision in terms of where incremental growth is longer term. The women's footwear and apparel market is 1.5 times the size of the men's footwear and apparel market globally; and as you noted, it's less than quarter of our revenue.","So we see extraordinary potential to drive continued strong growth and even step change growth as we really do two things, open the aperture in terms of the definition of sport, again, that's with a sharp focus on women and movement and activity.","And then second, editing and more aggressively shifting resources within NIKE towards the women's opportunity. So in short, we've got great momentum in the women's business, but we're chasing something much bigger.","Andrew Campion","Thank you, Jim. Okay, that's all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us. Happy holidays. We'll speak with you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15567":["NIKE, Inc.

President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, the new President of the NIKE Brand; and finally you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results.","Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we would do our best to get back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I will now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks Kelley and hello everyone. 25 years ago NIKE launched its first \u201cJust Do It\u201d ad. Those are three simple words that remain a rallying cry for people striving to reach their full potential. It's a source of inspiration for me, this company and for consumers all over the world. It\u2019s that no excuses voice of the athletes that's really driven the success of this company from the very beginning. And it's what motivates us to achieve even more as we move forward.","Last quarter, I told you what to expect from NIKE in fiscal 2014. I said we were set to grow, that we would push ourselves and our partners to better serve the athlete and consumers, because that's how we will reach our full potential and deliver more value to shareholders.","Looking at Q1 results, I would say we're off to a great start. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8%, gross margins grew 120 basis points better than projected and diluted earnings per share increased 37% to $0.86. These are outstanding results and they demonstrate our ability to grow and more specifically that NIKE is able to generate profitable sustainable growth.","So how are we able to succeed in a challenging global economy? By focusing on the fundamentals, the competitive advantages that help us win and expand our leadership position. And today I want to highlight three, our ability to innovate, the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio and our ability to continue to make meaningful connections with consumers.","So let\u2019s take a look at the first one, our ability to innovate. It\u2019s what fuels our growth and it always starts with the athlete. How can we make the athletes faster, stronger, better and help them push themselves to new levels of performance.","In Q1, we launched a whole array of products that deliver on that promise, including, the Nike Free Flyknit, the next-generation of Flyknit products in our Running category. This shoe demonstrates how we take Flyknit and combining it with other footwear platforms, like Free in this case to continue to innovate and serve the athletes.","As you\u2019ve heard me say before, Flyknit is high-performance visually iconic and manufactured in ways that reduce labor and waste. We\u2019ve seen a strong response from runners to the Free Flyknit and we look to continue to drive innovation using this revolutionary upper technology both in the Running category and beyond. The potential for Flyknit is tremendous and it\u2019s safe to say, it\u2019s going to be a big year for Flyknit.","We launched the Hypervenom football boot, which features revolutionary design changes to improve the fit, touch and traction of the boot. This allows the player to have better ball control and improved agility on the pitch and as Trevor will detail, the Hypervenom has resonated with consumers making it the most successful boot launch in NIKE history.","We also extended our offering of Dri-FIT Knit incorporating different knit patterns to improve breathability while maintaining a seamless construction and comfortable fit. This product is one of many that have helped accelerate our premium apparel growth. And we brought a new level of sophistication and performance to Fleece with the NIKE Tech Pack, a new line of premium apparel that deliveries better fit, breathability and comfort by leveraging construction method to originally develop for technical performance product.","The Tech Pack is quickly becoming the go-to product for consumers, and will be a big driver of growth for our sportswear category going forward. This is only a small sample of our new products, we're accelerating our innovation agenda and it\u2019s paying off, and there is a lot more to come, including some real breakthroughs and game changers over the balance of this year and into the future.","The second competitive advantage I want to highlight is the power of our NIKE, Inc. portfolio. We\u2019ve built the company with the focused group of high energy consumer relevant brands that create opportunity in the world of sport and youth culture. We\u2019ve leveraged these brands across geographies and categories, further dimensionalizing the business. And we create innovative products to serve the consumer in their chosen sports all over the world.","The breadth and depth of the NIKE, Inc portfolio is unmatched in our industry and that means we\u2019re able to manage risk and deliver growth even when there is variability in the results of any of the individual components. We\u2019re able to leverage the strength in some areas of the business while investing in others, all with a focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth at the NIKE, Inc. level. And our Q1 results reflect just that, we delivered a great quarter which Trevor and Don will discuss in more detail. However I would like to highlight two specific areas of our portfolio and that's Converse and China.","Let me start with Converse, Converse delivered tremendous growth in the quarter with revenue up 18% and EBIT up 36% contributing incremental growth to NIKE, Inc., on top of the strong performance of the NIKE Brand. Converse is a brand that has been bringing energy and style to consumers for many years and the opportunities ahead are even greater. We continue to diversify the Converse portfolio, expand the brands reach with new market conversions, grow the DTC business and unlock growth in apparel. I see tremendous long-term growth potential for the Converse brand.","Now let me turn to China. The NIKE Brand remains on top as the leading sport brand in China, as we continue to make progress on repositioning this market for long-term sustainable growth, I have to say, I\u2019m truly excited about the progress we\u2019re making in this key market and the opportunity it represents. We\u2019re laying a strong foundation and mastering the fundamentals that will enable the next wave of growth in this very dynamic market.","I\u2019m seeing a whole new level of engagement with our wholesale partners, as we work together to increase store productivity by creating a [pull] [ph] market fueled by amazing products and elevated retail presentation. We\u2019re increasing the power of our Category Offense by focusing our assortment with a greater level of precision on the sports and the products that mean the most for the Chinese consumer.","And in those stores that have been retrofitted to the new product assortment, we\u2019re seeing performance that significantly outpaces the rest of the fleet. The knowledge we\u2019ve have gained from these early results can be leveraged and scaled to drive significant improvements across the entire market. And together with our partners, we have a shared vision. We both know the companies that will win in China are those that build their brands, capabilities, and connections with consumers.","And that brings me to the third competitive advantage I\u2019d like to talk about, and that's our ability to make meaningful connections with consumers. And that really is key, as those connections ensure we continue to be the brand of choice for consumers. We connect with consumers in a number of ways through digital, which allows us to listen to the athlete and build communities and services that help expand the experience of sport, through key events, which brings consumers together to experience their favorite sport with other as passionate as they are. And through our retail stores, where we can interact directly with our consumers as they decide, which products are best for them.","A great example of these consumer connections is taking place in a market I recently visited and that\u2019s Russia. I feel great about the work our team is doing there. The energy for the NIKE Brand is incredible and that stems from the meaningful connections we\u2019re making with consumers and we\u2019re helping to increase activity levels and bring greater access to sport.","Let me share a few examples from Running, a category where we\u2019re bringing tremendous energy and seeing participation levels rapidly increase in Russia. We had Run Moscow and other NIKE We Run events, which bring out thousands of runners and the summer of running digital campaign created connections that lasts long after the last runner crosses the finish line.","These are just a few examples that show how NIKE is making meaningful connections with those consumers and it is really no coincidence that we see our revenues in futures growing at double-digit pace in Russia, quickly gaining share and growing the market. These are the kind of connections that excite us, our consumers and ultimately serve as building blocks to grow our business.","And that brings me to the final point I want to make today, and that\u2019s how we use these three competitive advantages, our ability to innovate, the power of our portfolio and our ability to connect with consumer to build our business. We do that by focusing on the greatest opportunities for growth.","Looking ahead, there are both risks and opportunities for NIKE. However, we\u2019re confident we have the strength across our brands, businesses and balance sheet, as well as a deep experience team to manage the risks and seize the opportunities. So thanks everybody and now I\u2019m happy to welcome Trevor Edwards, our new NIKE Brand President. As you know, Trevor is new to this call, but he is certainly not new to NIKE. Trevor brings two decades of NIKE experience to the role, as well as a relentless focus on the consumer and a deep knowledge of the Category Offense.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor to take you through the results of the NIKE Brand. Thank you.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. As I start my new role and after more than 20 years with NIKE, it\u2019s exciting to see so much opportunity in front of us, and we are focused on realizing that opportunity. At NIKE, we always start with the consumer and as we\u2019ve shared before our Category Offense brings us closer to the consumers, it focuses our teams, and underscores our competitive advantages.","Our pipeline of innovative products to make athletes better, our ability to create deep and meaningful connections with consumer and our capability to elevate and transform the marketplace creating more space and more opportunity for our brand to grow. This is the complete offense we often talk about, it is the foundation of our growth strategy and allows us to continue to drive growth in both developed and developing markets. It\u2019s a strategy that only NIKE can execute at such a global scale and it's the basis for the strong financial performance we share today.","So on a constant dollar basis, NIKE brand revenue was up 7% for the quarter with growth across most of our key categories and geographies except Greater China. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 18% for the quarter with comp growth up 9% and online sales up 12%. And in addition our global futures grew 10%. Our strategies are working and our portfolio of businesses delivered during the quarter across product types, geographies and categories. Now let's focus on three of our key geographies.","Our business in North America continues to be a tremendous source of growth for the NIKE Brand. North America provides a great benchmark what is possible around the world, we continue to deliver innovative products, we deepen our consumer connections, we elevate our distribution strategies in the market and in our largest and most penetrated market, we continue to see further opportunities to growth.","For the quarter, revenues grew 9% to $3 billion and we grew in all key categories except Golf. Our two biggest categories Basketball and Running led the growth continuing their double-digit rate and it was very profitable. We continue to grow in North America, because of our focus on leveraging and integrated, yet differentiated marketplace as we consistently work to provide unique consumer experiences across wholesale, DTC and online. We are able to expand both the market and our share, this integrated approach ensures we continue to maintain a strong pool market and drive profitability.","Let me illustrate with one key example, our Women's business in North America. We\u2019ve been building deep and meaningful relationships with women through our digital app called the NIKE Training Club. To date, we have 10 million downloads and 600,000 workouts every week. This virtual club creates a community of women who work out with us every single day.","This past quarter, we extended the idea of the training club to launch a new retail concept for our women's business to create new marketplace capacity. This catalyzing concept started with our own DTC doors and online and will eventually rollout to our retail partners. The concept is simple and powerful one stop shopping for our running, training and sportswear needs. It's where personal training meets personal shopping and styling. It starts with great premium product from footwear to apparel, performance to sportswear with style led presentations and limited edition offerings.","Next come Pinnacle Services, certified retail staff, personal stylist, and fitting room services. Finally we create community in-store studios events and our running and training clubs. This is one example of how we're continuing to capture growth opportunities in North America. Let me turn your attention now to China. As Mark mentioned, we continue to make progress against our strategic reset. However, the results in China will not always be linear.","For Q1 revenue declined by 3% and our wholesale comp performance slowed this quarter. However, the subset of our apartment doors that have been retrofitted with more focused assortments are performing well and in our own NIKE DTC doors, comp growth was up over 20%. The knowledge we've gained from these early successes can and will be leveraged across the entire markets. We are fully confident and committed to the strategies that we've laid out and more than ever believe in the long-term enormous opportunity in China.","I opened today talking about the consumer is at the centre of everything we do. This couldn't be more true than in China, we are the sport brand of choice and we continue to drive energy into the marketplace. Over this summer, we brought an All Star lineup of NBA athletes to China. LeBron, Kobe, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook connecting them with hundreds of thousands of Chinese consumers.","Now, at the heart of our reset in China is the goal of creating more productive and profitable retail for our retail partners and NIKE. There are three core elements to these plans. First, we segment and differentiate our points of distribution to create more targeted consumer experiences and to increase marketplace capacity. Second, we are sharpening our merchandising strategies assorting at the door level focusing on the products and categories that the Chinese consumer wants most and third we are working to create more seamless operating platform ensuring we get the right product to the right door at the right time. We continue to be aggressive and take decisive action to reset this market, but we\u2019ll do it the right way, creating a foundation for long-term sustainable and profitable growth. ","Finally, let me touch on Western Europe. About 18 months ago, we made a decision to reorganize our business in Western Europe, to drive a more centralized and consistent consumer experience across the geography and elevate the distribution strategies, with North America serving as the blueprint, we invested in a market reset to create a platform to capture the next wave of growth in this geography.","I just got back from visiting the teams and seen the market. Great progress has been made and the teams are energized and passionate about the opportunities ahead. In the Northern territories, we are seeing tremendous results led by double-digit growth in two of our largest territories, the U.K., and along with AGS, which is made up of Austria, Germany and Switzerland.","The strength of the northern territories help balance the results in the southern territories which face macroeconomic challenges. Our results in Western Europe, demonstrate that our strategies are working, there is still a lot of work to be done and opportunity to be captured, but the early returns are very positive. We see Western Europe as a strong driver for growth for the NIKE Brand for the long-term.","Now let\u2019s move to the category side and start where this company started over 40 years ago with Running. Q1 marks the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Running, the success was broad based in footwear and apparel with men\u2019s and women\u2019s in North America and Internationally and our future orders are up double-digits as well. We lead in Running with the launch of innovative products, Nike Free Flyknit, LunarGlide 5, Pegasus 30 and our premium apparel Dri-FIT Knit all designed to help athletes perform better and there is a lot more on stage and ready to go to deliver for the balance of the year.","We continue to deepen our connection with runners at retail online and at events, our Nike Running Clubs continued to gaining popularity at the same time we are adding 100,000 new runners per week to Nike+. We also continue to elevate distribution. In our own DTC doors, we have seen strong performance in Running and the success of the Running category door like Flatiron in New York City and also Covent Garden in London. These stores validate our strategies and that wholesale were seeing results n the Running concepts like the Track Club with Finish Line that significantly outpaced the balance of their fleet of their fleet in North America. But we still have room for further penetration in North America and we are just getting started across our other geographies.","The last category I would touch on is global football or soccer to many of you. Even on the back of the prior year numbers, which include the European Championship, football grew double-digits in the quarter one, with futures order book also up double-digits. With the energy around the World Cup next year in Brazil, we intend to build on our position as the leading football brand in the world. And as we\u2019ve said many times, we gain our insights from the best athletes on the planet, which allows us to deliver unparalleled innovation to our consumers globally from Rio to Paris to Tokyo. ","A great example is the new Hypervenom boot, rooted in insights from the best players in the world like the Brazilian and FC Barcelona star, Neymar. We work with him and other football players to create this new boot, and as Mark mentioned, it has become the most successful boot launch for NIKE Football ever. I was in Brazil in May working with the team as part of the launch, the result was a phenomenal global marketplace execution, creating energy and excitements in all geographies. The Hypervenom is already our number two selling boot behind our iconic Mercurial boot. ","You can expect to see us bring more amazing innovations, connect more powerfully with our consumers and drive more energy into the market, as we head into the World Cup in Brazil and well beyond. We\u2019re off to a great start on the fiscal year and our results show that NIKE is more than a brand, it's a portfolio of growth opportunities and we are set to capture those opportunities, because of the focus and investments we make for NIKE's long-term potential.","Thanks. Now, here is Don.","","Don Blair","Thanks, Trevor. Earlier on this call, Mark and Trevor described how our Q1 results demonstrate key NIKE assets and capabilities that enable us to drive growth and competitive advantage. I\u2019m going to build on that by illustrating how we use those competitive advantages to create value for our shareholders.","Let me start with the NIKE portfolio. As Mark indicated, our global portfolio of businesses gives us the ability to deploy our innovation, marketing and operational capabilities across the broadest range of opportunities in the industry. It also provides us with the diversification to deliver consistent growth and manage risk. Our Q1 results certainly reflect the strength of our portfolio.","Revenue was higher for every geography except China as our European geographies led the way with accelerated growth in revenues and futures. Converse also posted high-teens revenue growth. On a category basis, strength in Running, Basketball and global football set the pace. And on the product side, premium performance apparel outgrew moderately priced sportswear driving higher average prices and gross margin.","The second competitive edge is our ability to connect with consumers to our brands, our products and our retail presentation all through a category lens. As Trevor said, those connections have never been deeper or stronger allowing us to expand the market and gain share. They also enable us to move the consumer to more premium products and price points increasing productivity and profitability for NIKE and our retailers. You\u2019ve seen this reflected in our Q1 results as our gross margins expanded 120 basis points due in part to higher net average prices and a shift in mix to higher margin products.","The third competitive edge is innovation. As Mark and Trevor both noted, innovative products such as Flyknit and Hypervenom footwear and Tech Pack sportswear apparel were examples of our innovation leadership in Q1. As we continue to invest in innovation, we expect to deliver even greater impact on revenue, gross margin and overall profitability.","Underlying those competitive edges is the financial and operational discipline to allocate resources to the highest potential opportunities and maximize ROI. We demonstrated that in Q1 as we delivered record revenues in EPS, raised our overall working capital productivity and increased our ROIC to a record a 25.4%, 410 basis points higher than last year.","With that introduction let me walk you through our first quarter results. First quarter revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 8% on both reported and currency neutral basis as revenue for the NIKE Brand including NIKE Golf and Hurley increased 7% and Converse increased 16%. NIKE Brand futures orders accelerated to 10% growth on a currency neutral basis reflecting a 7% increase in units and a 3% increase in average selling price.","The increase was led by double-digit growth in North America and both European geographies. Weaker foreign currencies reduced reported futures growth to 8%. First quarter diluted EPS increased 37% to $0.86 driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and leverage of SG&A expenses which were flat for the quarter. On our last call, we said we expected FY 2014 growth to be significantly front loaded in Q1 due largely to the comparison to last year's heavy demand creation investment and that's indeed been the case.","Gross margin for the quarter increased to 120 basis points, driven by lower raw material costs, a mix shift to higher margin products, higher average prices and lower discounts, as well as growth in our DTC business and Converse. These upsides were partially offset by higher labor costs and FX headwinds, due largely to weaker emerging market currencies.","Q1 demand creation decreased 16% versus heavy investments in the prior year to support the European Championships, Olympics and product launches. Operating overhead grew 12% for the quarter, due to continued investments to support growth initiatives particularly digital and our DTC business. Other expense, net was $28 million for the quarter, driven primarily by FX conversion losses due to weaker emerging market currencies.","The net year-over-year impact of these conversion gains and losses combined with the translation of our foreign earnings resulted in a $38 million downside to EBIT for the quarter. As I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, we expect FX headwinds to put pressure on the balance of year revenue and earnings. The Q1 effective tax rate was 25%, 190 basis point improvement due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on operations outside the United States.","Working capital productivity continued to improve in Q1 as accounts receivable fell 3%, while inventory grew only 6% below the rate of revenue and futures growth. Closed out inventory levels are healthy, reflecting tighter management of inventory supply as well as the expansion and increased productivity of our factory stores. We will continue to monitor both the inventory on our books and at retail as we work with our retailers to maintain a healthy marketplace.","Now let's take a look at our performance by segment. In North America Q1 revenue increased 9% on both reported and constant currency basis, driven by growth across all key categories except Golf including double-digit growth in Basketball, Running and Men's Training. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 9% while apparel and equipment grew 9% and 13% respectively. DTC revenues grew 12% in the quarter driven by 5% comp store sales growth.","Q1 EBIT for North America grew 26% due to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. In Western Europe, Q1 revenue growth accelerated to 8% on a currency neutral basis. As Trevor noted, the growth was broad based and particularly impressive given the strong results last year driven by the London Olympics and the European Championships as well as the ongoing macroeconomic weakness, in the region.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for Western Europe increased 11% and EBIT increased 25% driven by revenue growth and lower demand creation spending, partially offset by gross margin compression driven primarily by FX. Central and Eastern Europe also delivered strong results in Q1 with currency neutral revenue growth of 10% led by double-digit growth in Russia, Turkey and Poland.","On a category basis revenue for Football, Running and Basketball also grew at a double-digit rate. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues for Central and Eastern Europe grew 12% and EBIT increased 50% driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and lower demand creation spending. In Greater China, currency neutral revenue declined 3% in Q1 as growth in sportswear and basketball was offset by declines in other categories.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in Greater China decreased 1%, but EBIT increased 3% due to gross margin expansion and lower demand creation spending largely offset by investments in our DTC business. You\u2019ve heard from both Mark and Trevor about the progress we\u2019re making in resetting the market place in China. This work will take commitment and patience and we\u2019re confident the steps we\u2019re taking now will set the foundation for a continued market leadership and profitable growth well into the future.","As we\u2019ve noted on previous calls, our reported futures and revenue growth for China won't always follow a smooth trajectory as we reset the market. At this point, we\u2019re expecting revenue growth in Q2 with overall FY 2014 revenues roughly inline with the prior year. In Japan, Q1 revenue increased 1% on a currency neutral basis, driven by double-digit revenue growth in football and basketball offset by declines in running NIKE sportswear in men's and women's training. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for Japan decreased 20% reflecting the impact of the weaker Yen, while EBIT increased 4% as the drop in revenue was more than offset by lower SG&A spending and gross margin expansion.","Q1 revenue for our emerging markets geography was up 5% on a currency neutral basis, driven by strong growth in Brazil and Argentina. This performance was partially offset by weaker results in Korea and more prominently in Mexico where shipping delays caused by a distribution center transition reduced our revenue. Excluding the impact of the shipping disruption in Mexico emerging markets revenue would have increased at a double-digit rate.","Weaker currencies were also a significant financial drag in the emerging markets geography, reducing Q1 reported revenue growth to 1% and compressing gross margin. EBIT decreased 5% due largely to these FX headwinds and higher operating overhead, partially offset by lower demand creation spending.","For Converse, first quarter revenue increased 16% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong result in the U.S. and U.K., two of our largest owned markets. On a reported basis, revenue and EBIT increased 18% and 36% respectively. The growth in EBIT was driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion due to a shift in mix to higher margin territories and products.","For the fiscal year, our expectations for the underlying performance of our business are essentially inline with the guidance we gave last quarter. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect increased currency headwinds to put pressure on our reported revenue and earnings for the balance of the fiscal year. We expect revenue for the second quarter and full fiscal year to grow at a high single-digit rate reflecting FX headwinds. On a reported basis, this would be slightly below our earlier expectations.","On the other hand, we are encouraged by our gross margin performance, which exceeded our expectations in Q1. We continue to increase average selling prices by strengthening the premium segments of our business and by taking selective price increases around the world, and we are expanding our high margin DTC business. For the second quarter, we expect to see gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points driven by continued benefits from higher average prices, easing raw material costs and growth in DTC, partially offset by higher discounts to clear inventories in Mexico, start-up cost for our expanded U.S. distribution center and stiffening FX headwinds.","For the fiscal year, we also expect gross margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, a modest increase from our prior guidance as the ongoing impact of the upside that drove our Q1 results are expected to more than offset FX headwinds and labor cost inflation.","For Q2, we expect SG&A to grow at a mid-teens rate reflecting shifts in demand creation facing and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives. As we indicated last quarter, there will be more volatility in the year-over-year comparisons of SG&A due to the timing of key sporting events this year and last.","For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low double-digit rate, as we invest in our brands, DTC and Innovation. For FY 2014, we continue to expect the effective tax rate will be about 25%.","Q1 was a great start for fiscal 2014 delivering strong growth in revenue and profitability. Over the balance of the year, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and gross margin expansion, while making the investments in demand creation and innovation that will deliver sustainable profitable growth and consistent value to our shareholders in the future.","We\u2019re now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good evening.","Kelley K. Hall","","Hey Bob.","Trevor Edwards","","Hi, Bob.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital","Trevor welcome.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you very much.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good luck. The question that I have on the European business and the business in China can you talk about the macro impacting you, I mean the numbers have been very impressive and especially both Western Europe and Central Europe especially in the futures side. So is the macro a big factor there and how sustainable do you think these impressive results can be?","Mark Parker","Well Bob, first of all I just want to reiterate one of the things that we\u2019ve seen over the course of years with our businesses is the strength of our business is much more a function of whether we've got the product right, the brand is strong and our distribution is really compelling than the macro. So I think we certainly have seen in Southern Europe some impact from macros, but I think our overall results in Western Europe and China is really driven by what we\u2019re putting out there in the marketplace.","Trevor Edwards","Yes Bob this is Trevor obviously. And probably what I would add is that, in both of those marketplaces that we\u2019re talking about what we've certainly seen is our ability to stay connected with our consumer and build the brand has been sort of like paramount in driving the growth that we've been seeing. Certainly the thing that we're working on and did in both markets was to reset them to ensure that we continue to maintain a really strong pull in the marketplace. And we\u2019re working through that in China, but obviously we\u2019re seeing some really good results come through in Western Europe.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay and then the other question was just on the Women's business in U.S., the training business, and I think some of the legend product. Can you just talk about -- if you feel like you\u2019re getting traction there and a lot of the initiatives if you could elaborate a little bit more just in that specific product?","Trevor Edwards","Yes I\u2019m actually super excited about the work that we\u2019ve been doing in the women's business. We are actually seeing some really good positive momentum as we talk about putting those new concepts into the marketplace. The things that we focused on really was first and foremost get the product right and so as you commented on the Legend Pant, we\u2019re seeing some great success with all the parts we are putting through. We\u2019re really focused at the premium end and that\u2019s been doing really well for us.","We continue to connect with our consumers, obviously the Training Club is a great example of how we do that. And so the third area that we\u2019re focused on right now is really the distribution. And really making sure that now we can get \u2013 give the consumer access to that product. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created these concepts. As these concepts get better, we\u2019ll roll them out into more of our retail stores. We\u2019re super excited about what we\u2019re seeing and the results that we\u2019re getting.","Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley K. Hall","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","And your next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. Good afternoon. One of the themes like kind of heard throughout the call and seems to have been present the last several quarters is your own retail business really performing extremely well, not that your wholesale business is struggling, but this relative out performance really sticks out even in places like China, but also in the U.S. can you talk about this shift? How much of it is strategic that you\u2019re directing or is that where your consumer is taking you, what does this mean for some of your wholesale partners? Kind of looking at this bigger picture here, any insight you could provide, because it\u2019s pretty interesting what\u2019s going on?","Trevor Edwards","Sorry Omar, great question there. I think part of it is our strategy around our DTC, we clearly use DTC as an opportunity for us to really improve our assortments to make sure that we have the best lines. And so what we\u2019re able to do is really use it as a spearhead and so what you\u2019re seeing in our DTC doors is really great performance, because we have the right assortments coming through those doors. The more we learn, the more we then take those to our retail partners. And so what we\u2019ve been seeing is our ability to drive a really integrated marketplace is really helping to drive these kinds of results. But obviously, we use our DTC as a lab, as it were and also is a way to ensure that we can get our premium products to the marketplace.","Mark Parker","Yes, I\u2019ll jump into the \u2013 I have always said that focus on our DTC business, this effort to become a better retailer will make us a better wholesale partner, which is what Trevor just talked about, and I think that's really paying off. We\u2019ve learned so much as we\u2019ve committed to being a great retailer that we\u2019re applying to becoming a really good wholesale partner that\u2019s most obvious in the North America, in the U.S. market, where we are more advanced in the market segmentation that we\u2019re doing with some of our top accounts and that\u2019s the model that we\u2019re working diligently on in Europe, Western Europe, especially and then certainly in China. We are in different stages of that development. But very confident that that model will actually translate well around the world.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. And then really quick on China, as you kind of go through the reset there, how do you think about maybe reducing or resetting all those lower volume concession shops and maybe doing more of these kind of high volume, whether it\u2019s DTC or with partners? Is that the kind of shift that\u2019s necessary on the ground at retail there?","Trevor Edwards","Yes. I would say that our true intent in China is to make sure that we drive a more productive and profitable retail. And we believe that you do that by segmenting the market and creating greater differentiation, I mean in the marketplace. That gives the consumer more targeted experiences.","At the same time, we\u2019re working really on driving our merchandising strategies, working at the door level. So that we can ensure that the consumers are getting exactly what they need. And then at the same point, we\u2019re also looking at driving a better operating platform that allows us to get the right product to that consumer at the right time. And so that obviously doing that will create more shifts, so that we have the opportunity to go for the next wave of growth that we see in China, because we truly see tremendous potential.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks, great quarter guys.","Kelley K. Hall","Thank you, Omar.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, great quarter guys.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley K. Hall","Hi, Robby.","Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, I just had two quick questions, one just a follow-up on North America. Some of the retailers have been talking about how great their business is with you. We\u2019ve heard it start to come more from places like Kohl's and Macy's and even some of the shoes that have been highlighted, have been things like the Roshe, which is a lower price point so the ASPs still are positive and look strong in your futures. But could you maybe help us understand or is your channel distribution shifting a little bit in terms of what\u2019s leading the growth either with the family channel, or again Macy's et cetera and how that might play into the ASP outlook as we look over the next year? Thanks.","Mark Parker","Well, let me just jump in and say there is no shift in our channel strategy. What you I think are seeing is a result of our focus in we often like to say our complete offense. So you see shoes like the Roshe, which has been widely successful, more accessible price point in some ways. And that\u2019s actually taking place in many, many different channels. But really it\u2019s bringing that kind of innovation to more accessible price point in general.","But our fixation, our obsession on bringing performance not only to the very top of the line, but throughout the line is continuing. And I think you\u2019ll see some shifts here and there, but overall you\u2019re going to see us over the course of this coming year drive some incredible innovation that\u2019s going to keep the focus on premium and our unique position is then to draft off of that and create this complete offense down through the price points as well.","Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just quick follow-up question, small business for you, but Golf, could you sort of walk us through what's made that business weaker and when you see it turning more positive?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, the issue with Golf is really \u2013 it\u2019s really much more of an operational issue that actually drove the weakness in this particular quarter. We had some supply chain challenge in Canada and that's really the impact that drove that. But other than that, the business continues and fundamentally being at really good place. So that was really just a result of just a small thing.","Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Kelley K. Hall","Hi, Kate.","Mark Parker","Good afternoon.","Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","I think you had mentioned in your comments that you saw some gross margin expansion in China and I wonder what that implies for where you are with working through your inventory in the region?","","Don Blair","","Well, I would go back to some of the language we used, which is there\u2019s going to be a lot of volatility in China, and I would say overall, we are continuing to make progress in managing inventory. I don't think I would read the gross margin results as any sort of milestone along the road. We are making progress. We do feel that we are getting that market set in right place. I think it's really more the broad global drivers that helped our margins everywhere. Things like easing raw materials cost, shifts and mix, those are the things that I think were the more powerful drivers of what was going on in China.","","Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. Great and my second question is, as you reset China, is there any change in mix of product in apparel versus footwear with the changes that you\u2019re making or is the mix of products generally staying the same?","","Trevor Edwards","","I would say that the broader mix will probably stay the same how the mix actually affected at a store level will be different because we really are working on just making sure that we have the right assortments in each of the doors, but I think overall the mix will generally be the same.","Mark Parker","Let me add that the category focus in China is going to be more intense, we\u2019re actually trying to zero-in on the shorter listed categories that have the greatest potential for growth. So we\u2019ll have the more targeted mix of products, but the ratio of footwear and apparel we\u2019re not seeing a dramatic shift in that ratio.","That said see tremendous upside in the apparel business in China for NIKE to move forward and frankly around the world. That\u2019s one of the \u2013 what I would call underpenetrated segments of our business today. But no specific targeted change in the overall mix in China except for maybe more of a focus in terms of the category breadth.","Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone.","Kate Mcshane","","Hi Lindsay.","Mark Parker","","Hi Lindsay.","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","On the gross margin front, can you talk about the key differences versus your original guidance that led to the upside to be versus your expectation and then as you think about the next quarter where you expect those tailwinds to moderate so that you see a little bit more modest improvement?","Don Blair","","Well it\u2019s one of the things that were little better than what we expected. We did have an even more favorable product mix than we expected that was one of the pluses, we also had our investments in our North America distribution center come in a little bit later than what we had originally expected. We have had tremendous growth in North America and we\u2019ve been doing some work in our Memphis hub putting some new capacity in down there and we expected a lot of those cost to hit in the first quarter and they came in the second.","So those are two other things that really shifted versus our guidance. I think if you look at the year-on-year drivers as I said, it was easing raw material costs, shifts to premium price increases. We had some great results out of Converse and DTC has been quite strong. We think those really will carry through a lot of the balance of the year plus or minus.","But couple of things that are changing. We are seeing the FX headwinds get a little stiffer and we also expect that we\u2019re going to have those supply chain investments particularly in North America start to flow in a little bit later in the year. So those are really what I would call out of the major shifts from the first quarter into the balance of the year.","","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks. And on the North American Direct-to-Consumer piece, can you maybe I missed it, but what was your e-commence growth in the region in the period, and can you talk about some of the initiatives you have in place to drive growth in that platform?","Don Blair","Yes usually we don't give that level of granularity by geography. Overall we were up. I believe it was 12% online. And one of the things to bear in mind is we had an extremely strong year last year. So we\u2019re about 50% two year growth on the online business and we are continuing to be extremely enthusiastic about the potential for that piece of our business.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, I mean I would say as Mark pointed out that's one of the most critical growth drivers for us in the future. So we expect to see continued momentum and growth in that part of the business. ","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Is there anything in terms of functionality or marketing or otherwise we can look forward to specifically in the U.S., balance of the year or in the next couple of years?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, we continue to make sure that we improved the site and all the experiences. But you will kind of see those as they rolled out in the months coming up.","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","Okay, thanks.","Operator","You are next question comes from Matthew Ross with JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.","Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes, congrats on a good print. I wanted real quick, share repurchase was almost doubled last two quarters and you took on $1 billion of debt also in the quarter. Can you speak to the mindset around capital allocation and how should we think of this as part of the earnings algorithm going forward?","Don Blair","Well, the debt issuance does not signify any change in our approach to capital allocation. As we\u2019ve been pretty consistent over the last few years that we believe we\u2019re going to be throwing off quite a bit of cash flow. We expect to be continuously raising our return of cash to the shareholders, at the same time that we will be investing in the business.","And that pattern of consistent increases in cash return to shareholders as well as consistent increase investment in our business is what we\u2019ve actually demonstrated over the last decade, so no change there. The offering of debt at the time we did it, I think gives us tremendous flexibility in our capital structure and frankly those interest rates were outstanding.","Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then more of a clarification, on your full year guidance is EPS still expected to grow at a double-digit rate for the year?","Don Blair","We don\u2019t give that level of EPS guidance. We try to give people parameters to help them understand what\u2019s ahead. But at this point, I\u2019d rather stay with the guidance that\u2019s in the prepared remarks.","Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Was there any change from last quarter?","Don Blair","I think the conversation was about line-item guidance and I think that's where I\u2019d like to stay on the guidance.","Kelley K. Hall","","Matthew feel free to follow-up with the IR team. We'll walk you through it.","Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, great.","Kelley K. Hall","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And your last question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","","Thanks, hello everyone.","Kelley K. Hall","Hi, Jim","Mark Parker","Hi, Jim","Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I\u2019m interested in some more commentary on the strategy to continue to take prices higher, have you seen any evidence of resistance to price, and has the reception to price been consistent across regions?","Trevor Edwards","","I think we\u2019re looking at in sort of a really two ways right, one is sort of making sure that we have great price value in the marketplace. So we always want to make sure that each season we go in and we\u2019re evaluating the pricing that we\u2019re currently setting to make sure that we actually are taking the opportunities when that there to go back to the right price, at the same time what we\u2019re also doing is driving the change in the mix of our business.","So you will see us really drive a lot of premium concepts certainly we\u2019ve seen that across the board, and we\u2019re certainly seeing really not a lot of resistance to that at all. In fact we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth around our premium businesses. So as Mark talked about process really the complete offense, making sure that we are competitive on the one side, but also taking price when the opportunity prevails itself.","Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Great, thanks. And then Don so some of the increased FX headwinds seem to be from emerging market currencies does that make it more costly or difficult to hedge against the exposure?","Don Blair","Well, you are exactly right. And in fact for many of those currencies it's really not very economical to hedge them, but over the last few years we've taken a number of steps to reduce our overall exposure, we have built an internal trading company we have really done some adjustments to how we source.","And so we think we\u2019ve done some things that have reduced the exposure. But the currencies like the Reais, the Argentine Peso, the Russian Ruble, it's not great tools out there to economically hedge them. So to some degree, we are exposed at some level for those currencies.","And what we do is we really manage our overall P&L equation across the whole portfolio. So as we talked about these adjustments are there, but we're not so exposed to anyone currency and we've got lots of levers to pool across the portfolio to continue to deliver consistent growth.","Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","That's helpful. Thanks, see you in a couple of weeks.","","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley K. Hall","Thanks everyone for joining us. And we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15718":["NIKE, Inc.

As the operator indicated, participants on today call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release which was issued about an hour ago and at our website, investors.nike.com.","Joining us on today\u2019s call will be NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the NIKE Brand, and finally you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results.","Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We\u2019d like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh, and happy holidays everyone. Q2 was another quarter of positive momentum for NIKE, Inc. Let's start with the numbers. NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter revenues were up 6% growing to $8.2 billion, and on a currency neutral basis NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8%. Gross margin declined approximately 140 basis points to 44.2%. Earnings per share increased 11% to $0.50. And we delivered ROIC of 31.3%.","In the fast moving world of sports and youth culture, results like these come from our obsession with the consumer of knowing what they need and what inspires them. That\u2019s what drive innovation at NIKE and innovation is what drives growth. Our approach has fueled 28 conservative quarters of growth at a scale that is unrivaled in our industry. We have a strong track record and more importantly we have an even better runway ahead.","With the energy we see in sports right now along with today's more active lifestyle, it's no surprise that our industry continues to attract competition. As in sports, competition is a positive thing, it sharpens our focus. And we know there are areas in the short-term, but we haven\u2019t executed as precisely as we would have liked. As good as we are, we can be even better by hyper-focusing on our most compelling growth opportunities.","Starting with the consumer who is not asking for more products but looking for more choice of the products they love. We are responding by giving the consumer more distinctive options with fewer products, what we call edit to amplify. Reducing styles and highlighting key items in concepts has the huge impact across our entire value chain. And this is especially important in North America and our key geographies as we better manage supplying demand to drive productivity and profitable top line growth, while highlighting and scaling our most compelling product stories.","Look at our success in China where we amplify what's working and edited out what's not to accelerate growth. Beyond product, e-commerce is one example as we double down on the power of digital in this mobile first market. We also know from our consumers the speed matters. That insight is driving several speed and agility initiatives throughout our company. For example we're scaling a process we called the express lane, which allows us to go from creation to market in weeks instead of months. The express lane is becoming an important competitive advantage and it led to new product called the LunarCharge this quarter, which is seeing strong consumer demand.","We've always given consumers high energy product in the right place at the right time. We're now leveraging and creating capabilities on a much larger scale. The investments we make in manufacturing revolution and throughout the supply chain are going a long way and helping us realize that. Editing to amplify and driving speed and agility are keys to winning now. They also help set the foundation for growth in the future. The other focus for us of course is innovation, my top priority for the Company. Innovation is what offers differentiation for consumers and takes them somewhere new. It's how we lead the market. To be clear without innovation there is no such thing as sustained growth.","We have some exciting new platforms on the way starting with Air Gate for Max, our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max cushioning system ever. We see a growing anticipation around Air VaporMax from Runner to sneaker retailers. It's a great example of innovation that stands at the intersection of high tech pure function and aesthetic beauty. We expect big things from Air VaporMax in running, and we have an ambitious roadmap to bring it to life through other sports. In apparel, we launched Therma-Sphere in running, adding to our diverse line up of apparel that offers warmth without wait in cold weather. The sphere family including its lead style Element Sphere is performing very well in the market place.","We also launched the Strike Series featuring AeroSwift technology, establishing the new look of football training. This quarter, we delivered on the promise of personalized performance with our first adaptive product the HyperAdapt 1.0, and there's a reason we call this the 1.0, generations 2 and 3 are in the works expanding adaptive performance products across other sport categories. There was huge demand for the HyperAdapt 1.0, but we plan to drive that momentum into adaptive products at a much larger scale.","And there's a lot more on deck with new cushioning experiences in running and basketball, digitally integrated products, advancements and customization and personalization and breakthroughs in lightweight performance. Our pipeline is very strong, covering the near, medium-and long-term horizons we've created both platforms and category defining products designed in a distinctive style that expands all categories. We're driving up taste and a scale of innovation that will deliver growth for years to come. Right now, the consumer continues to respond to new generations of our state-of-the-art platforms in Flyknit 3 and Lunarlon.","This year, we redesigned NIKE Free and brought a whole new sensation to Lunarlon with the LunarEpic. Both continued to be huge drivers of our business in both training and running for both men and women. Flyknit is also advancing well beyond our expectations. Its versatility is allowing us to create unexpected forms across multiple sports for all weather conditions and even blending with other materials to advance both performance and style. And you're about to see even more firepower coming out at basketball. You will hear more from Trevor on this, but we are in a good position to build on recent successes in NIKE Basketball in Jordan for the back half of the fiscal year.","Another advantage we leveraged is NIKE's deep reservoir of iconic styles and innovation. It's a source of inspiration to our design teams and a tremendous source of growth for our business. There has been a huge consumer appetite for reinterpreted franchises and icons. Take the Air Force 1 is one example this past quarter. Before this, the regional remains at stable, but this quarter consumer responded to some of our long weighted reissued Air Force 1 versions like the New York City, the LA, the Chi-Town and the in the Linen. But we also give it new ways through a weather repelling SneakerBoots, a featherweight climates style and a NikeLab version with premium materials.","Once out, they drove tremendous heat in the Air Force 1 family this quarter was the Special Field Air Force 1, bringing the new look to an icon. This exciting new model has been selling through very quickly. I think there is a mid conception that growth in our lifestyle business comes at the expense of growth in our performance business. The reality is they fueled each other. Performance and lifestyle are not tradeoffs.","Consumers want innovation that is styled right and they want style with real innovation. In one product that helps and do more and get better, that\u2019s comfortable and light, and look straight on the court and on the street. Ultimately, they want choices that looks and feel good across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle including performance products that are on high demand and fueling growth like the LeBron Soldier, the Jordan 31, the Kobe A.D., the Flyknit Racer, the LunarEpic Low and the upcoming Air VaporMax.","NIKE's opportunity is to continue to deliver across that spectrum to accelerate our leading performance position and the world's largest sportswear business. Part of our role as the industry team leader is to continue to grow the whole market for sport, and that means knowing where the consumer is headed. We are leading through digital. We made a move long enough to integrate brand, service and commerce in a meaningful way for consumers. No one in our space is close to connecting all three and turning into value for the business the way that we do.","We brought this to light in a powerful way this quarter with Nike Soho, the five-storey store is built around trials on, personalize services and amazing product. It's bringing digital and physical retail together to deepen our relationships with our customers. It's clear that DTC continues to be one of the greatest returns on investment. In Q2, our DTC business grew 23% with nike.com leading the way at 46%. There continues to be much more growth potential ahead for NIKE in DTC.","We are also accelerating partnerships with our multi-brand wholesalers. We share our vision for serving our customers with elevated and differentiated consumer experiences. This is a great example with its full service footwear departments. Other examples this quarter include our women's lifestyle concept shop with Nordstrom. Our first European Jordan store in Paris with Foot Locker and the most digitally integrated multi-brand consumer experience with JD.","More and more consumers want a seamless shopping experience across physical and digital, and we're delivering that completely through our DTC wholesale partners and wholesale.com. I feel really good about where NIKE stands for the long-term. We're earning our number one position every single day. We're facing our challenges head-on and we're accepting the fundamentals while seizing opportunities to be disruptive in leading our industry. We are well positioned for the back half of the year and more importantly we're clear on the opportunities in front of us and confident in our plans to drive long-term growth and shareholder value for years to come.","Thanks and now here is Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays everyone. The NIKE brand delivered another solid quarter of growth in Q2. As always my remarks are on a constant currency basis. The NIKE brand revenue grew 8% lead by broad-based growth across our largest geographies and categories. And NIKE brand DTC revenue increased 25% driven by continued strong growth in digital e-commerce, 11% comp store growth and new store expansion.","In Q2, we attacked opportunities across our portfolio to strengthen and extend our leadership position. In particular, I'd like to mention three of note. First, we're seeing incredible momentum in basketball, to be clear basketball is back. Second, we have made tremendous progress aligning supply and demand in North America, returning this important geography to a pull market. And third, we continue to see strong and steady momentum in greater China as we to invest in that market to fuel growth.","Now, let's take a look at some of our key categories starting with running. Running is our largest performance category and continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and growth with Q2 revenue growing at a double digit rate. It also continues to be one of our most influential and largest drivers of our sportswear business. Now, even as the weather turns, our runners never slowdown. They inspire us to provide solutions to help them get out and run more.","Mark mentioned the popular LunarEpic, and in Q2, we launched the LunarEpic Flyknit Shield with its all weather construction design to keep the foot warm and dry. It's another example of how NIKE expands the market by adapting our popular platforms to new audiences and serve consumer needs. Other running footwear successes included the Pegasus 33 and the Air Max 2017, which features up Flymesh upper and the full length Max Air unit.","In apparel, products offering lightweight yet breathable warmth are also showing increased popularity with athletes from the most elite to the everyday, highlighted by the AeroLoft in this sphere platform. And I'll be remised, if I did not mention the excitement we're seeing around the Apple Watch Nike+ as it sales well ahead of our plans. Lastly, Mark mentioned the Air VaporMax which is not only an amazing start with its own rights, but an innovation that will fuel growth across the entire NIKE Air family of products, and I\u2019m really excited about this platform which will be in the market this spring.","Next, basketball, as the leader in basketball we never settled. We note there is always work to be done. Last year, we knew we didn\u2019t perform to our potential in basketball whilst we have a diverse portfolio across NIKE Basketball JORDAN and Sportswear. We recognized that two of our signature styles were not resonating with consumers to our expectations. We sold the opportunities and we addressed it. First, we went back to the fundamentals and redesigned our products with stronger aesthetics and delivered better priced value to our consumers. That work led to dynamic products like the Kyrie 2, LeBron Soldier 10, the KD 9, the Jordan 31, the Kobe A.D., and the Westbrook 0.2. All of these have been incredibly popular with consumers on and off the court.","Second, we created demand and energy in the market place with our out of nowhere campaign. And third, we delivered all these powerfully through retail for example with our House of Hoops partnership with Foot Locker. The end results, our basketball business is much healthier today than it\u2019s ever been over the past 18 months. And the energy continues with the Kyrie 3 and the LeBron 14 generating off the chart anticipation. With the upcoming launch of our first new signature shoe in years, the Paul George 1 get ready for even more consumer and commercial energy in NIKE Basketball over the next few months.","With all this strong sales through combined us what\u2019s coming, we expect a return to growth in NIKE Basketball over the back half of the fiscal year. At the same time, Jordan footwear continued to electrify the market place with products that generates excitement through vibrant storytelling. In Q2, this was highlighted by the global launch of the much anticipated space jam 11 collection in both performance and lifestyle. And when combined with other releases this quarter like the Jordan 1, the True Blue 3s and the 9 and the Original Colorway, we surprised and delighted sneaker fans across the globe.","This is the power of what we do the ability to drive energy through a combination of history, culture and performance. When we combined many of our hottest style together as we have showed with our 12 sold collections that launched in our several store, it brings together performance and sportswear with apparel no other brand can match. And our strong momentum in the next truly global sport is coming at the right time as we approached the launch of our partnership with the NBA.","In Q2, our sportswear category grew high teens its 12 consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Today, we\u2019re driving our amplified sports strategy as we go deeper with our best products mix in innovation and style, creating sneaker heat from running to basketball to women to young athletes. As Mark mentioned, we have showed creativity and versatility in dimensionalizing our footwear franchises across these categories. We've also showed disability in the marketplace by connecting these products to consumers with a twofold approach. We create energy through targeted releases while also giving consumers easy access through broader launches across the market place.","Throughout this work, we\u2019re seeing strong sell-through for silhouette that makes our past with the modern simplicity like the Presto Mid Utility, the Flyknit Racer and the new style the LunarCharge which we brought to market in roughly a quarter of the time it usually takes. Thanks to our accelerated footwear creation capacity. That's the power of our express lane process. We also have the successful launch of our beautiful power collection for her which featured great styles like the Cortez Classic and the Air Max Thea Ultra in all-black premium leather. At the same time, we drove traffic into our dedicated women spaces with two exclusives to these styles for the Air Max 90. All this work, and so much more goes to consistent efforts to serving women who covered sneaker style.","Now, before I move on from sportswear, I want to make one very important point, we continue to see extraordinary growth in our sportswear apparel business across men's and women's up-and-down the price points and fueled by our Fleece Collections. This marketplace energy comes from the power and creativity we're using to expand what sport means to the lifestyle of today's consumer. Now, let's take a look at a few of our key geographies. In Q2, North America revenue was up 3% from the cast of the clubs sports in North America have never been more inspiring, and the energy is set to continue with the upcoming playoffs in college football and the NFL fields entirely with teams wearing Nike.","As we continue to serve these athletes and celebrate these heroes and story lines, it's no surprise our brand is so strong. From a marketplace perspective, we're seeing continued improvement with inventory down 4%. We continue to keep supply tight, which you'll see reflected in futures. And as a result, we expect a stronger sell-through to the end consumer which ultimately results in stronger revenue growth. Andy will talk more about this in our guidance, but this is another area where we would identify the challenge we attached it and now we're starting to see the returns.","Q2 growth in North America was led by DTC where we experienced a strong start to the holiday season over the Black Friday weekend. Compared to last year, we saw double-digit traffic increases and higher conversion and higher dollars per transaction across our stores and nike.com. And our new Soho store in New York is not only a source of growth in this important market, it's a powerful look at the future of sports retail, product trials with experts, elevated personalized experiences and heightened member engagement all while seamlessly combining digital and physical.","We create environments that bring our products and services together in a way that allows consumers to experience the NIKE brand in its most sublime state. And we're executing this strategy through our DTC businesses as well as with our key strategic wholesale partners who share this vision. We still see tremendous potential in North America and with the strategies in place we'll grow both NIKE and the overall marketplace.","Now let's turn to Western Europe where we saw our 13th consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth with strong growth across maybe all categories led by sportswear and running. Mark mentioned our first European Jordan store in Paris. Just as in Soho, we see the Jordan Bastille store as a future of retail, future in premium products and services like customization and interactive wear testing. And there is always our footprint in football continues to expand across Europe, as our recent resigning of the French, English and Turkish federations as well as the recent Golden Ball Winner, Cristiano Ronaldo.","And with the start of our new relationship with Chelsea Football Club next season, our brand in Europe is only getting stronger. Lastly, greater China continued its strong results with its 10th conservative quarter of double digit growth, highlighted by another quarter of triple digit growth in nike.com. We at our biggest singles stay ever reaching nearly three times last year sales. Our success followed our decisions to feature exclusive product to nike.com and at NIKE only stores and give early access to highly products for our NIKE+ members. And we also saw tremendous results with Tiempo.","The greatest China marketplace continues to be fueled by highest sports participation with 38,000 runners taking part in the Shanghai Marathon while nearly four times that many consumers try to sign up. Runners were introduced to NIKE's premium services by customizing the Nike Pro Bras and creating custom shoes at NIKEiD stations just to name a few. In fact, I was in China few weeks ago, and I met one athlete who achieved a personal dream to run the Shanghai Marathon, who was struck me, it wasn\u2019t just her desire to reach her potential, but the importance of NIKE's role in meeting her complete lifestyle needs, to look good, to feel confident and to connect with others throughout her journey.","I left China reminded of the amazing potential for our brand as we move at her speed and authentically serve athletes like her. All-in-all, we are still in early days of marking the growth in this important geography. In the end, we have the strategies in place that yield results. Consumers have so many choices more than ever, which is why we are glad that we have the foundation in place to connect consumers with energy and excitement. We know what works and we know how to create amplify and sustain our opportunities. Make no mistake. In 2017, we will stay on offense. This mentality is one of our greatest competitive advantages -- that relentless drive to serve our athletes and consumers is what keeps us in the lead.","Thanks, now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thanks, Mark and Trevor. And, happy holidays to everyone on the call. The enduring passion for sport around the world and consumers desire to lead a more active lifestyle continue to fuel new opportunities for growth in our industry. And the growth potential in our industry has always attracted competition. That said, as Mark noted, Q2 was NIKE's 28 conservative quarter of growth. Each and every quarter over the past seven years, NIKE has grown despite healthy competition within our industry, extreme macroeconomic volatility, discontinuities in the retail landscape and rapidly evolving trends in consumer preferences. That track record does not happen by accident.","As the leading brand in sport, we are on the offense always. We take nothing for granted. We continuously evaluate how we can better leverage our unrivaled portfolio of businesses and competitive advantages to grow the market and win. From a brand and business perspective, we are obsessed with staying one step ahead of consumer expectations and maintaining that focus and pace is what ultimately separates NIKE from the competition over the long haul. From a financial perspective, we're obsessed with delivering. One strong growth, two expanding profitability, and three high returns on invested capital.","We continue to manage all of the operating levers in our business to deliver across all three dimensions of our financial model, and that had afforded NIKE unmatched scale and resources. Like the world's best marathoners, the results that we post always reflect moments where we have pushed the pace and moments where we took stock of the circumstances, and made adjustments. In the second quarter we executed on the plan that we shared with you 90 days ago. We pushed the pace with innovation because as Mark noted there is no such thing as sustained growth without innovation.","We also made important adjustments, for example with respect to supply and demand management to ensure the sustainability, profitability and capital efficiency of our growth long term. From a product innovation perspective we launched several innovative and beautifully designed footwear and apparel styles across both our performance categories and sportswear. Perhaps most notably, we launched the HyperAdapt 1.0 which is an innovative product in its own right and also a glimpse into the future of personalized performance. As we look ahead to the second half of fiscal year '17, we will continue pushing the pace with products such as the Air VaporMax that merge innovation and style.","In Q2, we also innovated at retail. As we've said in the past NIKE's growth trajectory is not highly correlated with macroeconomic trends, nor is our growth solely a function of market share. Our primary focus has always been on growing the overall market, creating greater capacity for the Nike brand over the long term, today we see the potential to increasingly leverage digital to more personally and fully serve consumers unlocking new growth and productivity within and well beyond the four walls of a retail store. As Trevor mentioned in November we opened Nike Soho in New York which sheds light on our vision for the future of retail. Finally we continue to innovate within our supply chain.","Our investments and manufacturing revolution, our partnerships with Flex and Apollo and the speed and agility initiatives that Mark referenced all enable us to bring product creation closer to the consumer while also enhancing labor productivity and reducing materials waste. As the world becomes increasingly dynamic, we could not be more pleased with the head start that we have in terms of supply chain innovation. While we pushed the pace with innovation in Q2, we also made important adjustments in areas where we knew we could do better.","Trevor referred to the work we've done to reignite strong momentum in Nike Basketball. We also took the actions required to return North America to a pull market. We have grown our business in North America for seven consecutive years. No other brand has near our scale or our proven ability to expand the market in this important geography. That said, we are relentlessly self critical at NIKE. Several factors led to elevated inventory in North America including the west coast sport congestion, issues in our North American distribution center, third-party retail discontinuities, and lower than expected sell-through on a few key items last year, most notably two signatures styles in basket ball. The actions we have taken to rebalance our supply negatively impacted our gross margin over the past two quarters. But at NIKE, we manage for the long-term. Based on the progress we have made, we now expect North America to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year with a return to expanding gross margins and tighter inventory levels.","With that context, let\u2019s turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results and our outlook going forward. In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased over 6%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue grew 8%, led by double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China, and the emerging markets. Second quarter diluted EPS of $0.50 increased 11% versus the prior year driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower average share count.","Gross margin contracted approximately 140 basis-points in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations. Full price average selling prices continued to expand. However, margin contracted overall due to higher product cost, FX headwinds, and a higher mix of off-price versus the prior year and the more discreet or temporary items that we referenced last quarter.","Demand creation decreased 1% for the quarter according to plan following significant Q1 investments in the Olympics and Euro Champs. Operating overhead decreased 3% as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains as we increasingly edit to amplify within our core operations. The effective tax rate for Q2 was 24.4% compared to 19.1% for the same period last year, primarily due to an increased mix of U.S. earnings, which is generally subject to higher tax rate.","As of November 30th, inventories were up 9%. Wholesale units grew just 1%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by higher average cost due primarily to product mix, as well as growth in support of our fast-growing DTC businesses.","Now, let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis to $3.7 billion with balanced growth across footwear and apparel. Growth was led by DTC, which grew 17% with 10% comp store growth. EBIT from North America increased 3% in the quarter as revenue growth, full price gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage, all contributed to increase profitability. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of off-price versus the same period in the prior year.","In the second half of fiscal year '17, you will see evidence of the progress that we have made returning North America to a full market. North America revenue growth will continue to outpace futures, and that will be coupled with the return to gross margin expansion. In Western Europe revenue increased 12% on a currency neutral basis, as we continue to see strong multi-dimensional growth across the business; from footwear to apparel, performance categories to sportswear, wholesale to DTC and across all territories. Standout categories for the quarter were sportswear, running and Jordan. On a reported basis, revenue increased 7%, while EBIT declined 23%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.","Our emerging market geography grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth across sportswear, running and Jordan and across the territories at SoCo, Korea and Mexico. On a reported basis, revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, reported revenue increased 6% while EBIT decreased 2%. Finally, Greater China continues to deliver exceptional results. Currency neutral revenue grew 17% in the quarter, reflecting strong growth across nearly all dimensions of our business. Most categories grew double-digits, and our DTC business delivered another quarter of tremendous growth, up 42%.","NIKE is the leading brand in China with the deepest most authentic connection to the Chinese consumer. We expect strong and steady growth going forward in China, as we serve consumers through China's fast growing digital ecosystem and our continued expansion of category oriented NIKE branded concepts at retail. On a reported basis, revenue grew 12% and EBIT expanded 15% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage.","Over the balance of the fiscal year, we will continue to manage for the long-term with our focus on ensuring sustainable, profitable, capital efficient growth. As for specific guidance, for the full-year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the high single-digit range. That said, FX headwinds from further strengthening of the U.S. dollar have put downward pressure on our second half revenue forecast. While our hedges will delay and partially mitigate the impact of FX on our profitability, we do not hedge the revenue line item per se. On a currency neutral basis, we continue to expect revenue growth for the full-year to be within the high single to low double-digit range.","For Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow squarely in the mid single-digit range. As we shared on our last earnings conference call, we are changing the sequencing of our communications regarding NIKE brand futures orders. Futures orders will now be posted on our Investor Relations Web site following this call in the same detail as previously reported in our earnings release. As you will see, currency neutral futures orders are growing 2%, driven by 1% increase in units with increases in average selling prices contributing the other 1 percentage point of growth. Futures orders are flat versus prior year on a reported basis.","As you know, futures orders growth and reported revenue growth have become increasingly less correlated. That lesser correlation is evidenced by the roughly 5 percentage point disparity between our guidance for Q3 reported revenue growth and our futures growth on a reported basis. The longer-term more systemic drivers of the disparity include, first, impacts related to our evolving DTC versus wholesale business mix. For example DTC futures are reported on a wholesale equivalent basis. However, reported revenue for DTC is recognized based upon the full retail price to consumers. Therefore, as the mix of futures shifts toward DTC, NIKE\u2019s overall reported revenue will inherently grow faster than futures.","Second, material dimensions of our revenue are not included within futures orders; such as, Converse, NIKE Factory Stores and our shorter lead-time or at-ones businesses. There can also be temporary anomalies between futures orders and reported revenue growth; one of the most notable is consumer sell-through. Take for example North America, where as you will see, futures orders are down 4% but we expect continued revenue growth and expanding margins over the second half of this fiscal year. In the second half of fiscal year \u201816, we had elevated inventory levels for the reasons we\u2019ve detailed.","In the second half of fiscal year \u201817, we now have tighter supply against continuing strong demand. And that will have a favorable impact on revenue growth as a result of lower year-over-year cancellations, returns and discounts. Other temporary anomalies can include the timing of our buys related to launches, key sports moments, and other events. In short, the key takeaway is that our revenue guidance reflects a much more comprehensive outlook for our business, as compared to using reported futures orders growth as a proxy.","Turning to gross margin, for the second half of the fiscal year, we expect less contraction than we experienced in the first half as we see stronger full price sell-through the consumers. For Q3, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 100 to 125 basis points, driven primarily by FX. The fundamental drivers of NIKE\u2019s long-term gross margin expansion remain intact, including higher average selling prices, product cost optimization through our manufacturing revolution efforts, and the positive mix-benefit associated with our fast growing DTC businesses.","For total SG&A, we now expect full-year growth in the low single to mid single-digit range as we edit the amplifier. We expect Q3 SG&A to grow in the mid single to high single-digits. We expect other income, net of interest expense, to be approximately $80 million for the full-year and approximately zero in Q3. We continue to expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full-year. For Q3, we expect the rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. As evidenced by our Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we continue to be on the offence, focused on driving sustainable and profitable capital efficient growth for over the long-term.","With that, we\u2019ll now open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","I guess the first question that I have is, on the commentary around basketball. How does that fit into the revenue outlook for the back half of the year? Is that more the basketball business turning in the fourth fiscal quarter? Where are you seeing the turn in basketball, Trevor? Can you talk a little bit more about that?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, absolutely. One other things that we get a chance to see is we get a chance to see basketball sort of in line. And what we are seeing is basketball is back, and the consumer response to the latest signature styles has been incredibly strong. And we're seeing some more energy moments to come. But what we've definitely seen in North America is we've seen healthy sell-throughs on the KYRIE 2s, the LeBron Soldier's, the KD 9s, the KOBE A.D. the Jordan XXXI. So, we're seeing a really comprehensive shift towards energy coming towards basketball, both in the numbers but also when you're on the street, on the ground, you're seeing it both on the court and off the court.","One of the things I would like do at basketball is maybe broadened the context, so that we\u2019re also thinking about our sportswear business, which is a part of basketball. And in sportswear, the Air Force 1 styles continues to actually perform very well, the Special Forces Air Force 1 was exceptionally strong, the Foamposite was also good, and Jordan, both on its performance Jordan 31 and the retro style did really well. So, all of those really put us in a position where we feel that we are poised to get ready for the NBA partnership as we go into the next year. So, all the energy signs are there for us, and so we see the back half continuing to accelerate in our basketball business.","Bob Drbul","And then I just have a follow-up question on -- so when you look at the inventory levels, I guess, specifically in North America and you look at the gross margin guidance. In retail today, there is a lot of the 25% off throughout many of the -- I think, the mid-tier players. So, can you just help us reconcile where you are with the clean inventory position that you talk about, North America being down 4%? And how -- what's happening at retail this month for instance is altering your outlook at all, if any?","Andy Campion","Yes, Bob, this is Andy, I'll start. Happy holidays, by the way. As you noted, our inventory in North America is down and as we talked about on the call, we feel like we've made a tremendous amount of progress in tightening supply and demand and persisting ourself for more sustainable profitable growth in the second half. Just to give you some dimension on that, we have had very strong sell-through and in in-line. We had a great holiday season. We continue to see tremendous growth in nike.com, for example. And I'll remind you that we also have our factory store business, and that has been a great channel or outlet for us to take the actions that were required to rebound supply and demand. And we've seen phenomenal traffic and conversion and comp store growth in that dimension of the business. So, feel great from that perspective.","And then, I'll hand it over to Trevor. But as Trevor noted, we are seeing tremendous opportunities for growth in some of the biggest and most important categories in North America; that being, sportswear, which continues to deliver strong growth, both footwear and apparel; we feel like we've really reignited through our momentum in basketball. And as Trevor said that -- we're fast approaching the launch of the NBA partnership. So, again, tighter inventories continued growth and a return to gross margin expansion in North America is what we see.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, I think just to touch on what Andy just hit on. I would say that there is a more promotional activity in the marketplace; having said that when we tighten supply and demand we\u2019re seeing increasingly stronger full-price sales so we feel good about that. In North America, again, we are seeing our sell-throughs perform at a much better level. The other thing that you will see coming into the spring season, you\u2019re going to see lot of excitement in some of the great products we have on tap. So, we are very excited and bullish about as we launch the Air VaporMax, not only for the VaporMax itself, but also because it will drive a greater Air business across our business.","So, we think as we bring more innovation in the marketplace that allows us obviously command stronger full-price in our products. And with that, I mean, we like said, we\u2019re definitely seeing all the signs that the actual decline in inventory is now proven the stronger sell-through, we\u2019re seeing stronger sell-through as a result.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel. You may speak now.","Jim Duffy","I have a couple of questions, the first around your efforts to drive speed and agility. Can you speak in more detail around the express plan agenda, and maybe use LunarCharge as an example.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, let me touch on that. We\u2019ve always had the ability to move quickly and respond. What we\u2019re doing now through express line, particularly as we scale this capability across the road, is to make this a sustained season-in season-out part of what we do and how we operate. The exciting thing about the express line is it literally puts us in a position to, as I have mentioned, deliver products from start to finish completely new product in weeks versus months. The LunarCharge is a great example on this last quarter of product that literally went through that complete start from scratch to completed products, went out to the market, and the sell-throughs on that have been incredibly positive.","So, we\u2019re now in the midst as we move into the second half of the year and then beyond, frankly, this is sort of new-norm is to make this a part of for the muscle that we have, I think, of this a more complete competitive advantage. We\u2019re focused right now in footwear, but we see this scantling also across apparel as well. I am personally, as a product nerd, incredibly excited, not just by the ability to do this but to take it to significantly higher scale.","Jim Duffy","My next question around greater China and your efforts in category oriented retail, could you talk a little bit about where you stand there and how much runway there is left to drive that agenda?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, obviously, I was just in China actually couple of weeks ago. And the thing that I continue to see is the NIKE brand is really performing incredibly well. And I love to give a context, which is both when you go in the stores and you walk the streets, you can certainly see the energy and vibrancy for the brand, and you can see that in also in the strong sell-through that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. Across Singles Day, Singles Day, we actually were three-times, it was 300% greater this year than last in terms of sales. And so, we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth in the dot-com business. The categories that are performing well are sportswear, running, Jordan brand, and NIKE basketball, all performing really well, which were the key ones we decided to focus in on in China.","We also continued to have really tremendous amount of doors in the marketplace over 6,000 doors. So we're really ever present in the market, which allows us to expand and tell the right stories and create the right impact. And one of the biggest tailwinds that we always have is sports participation. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, the Shanghai marathon is one example of watching this market become increasingly sophisticated around participation, around their connection to sports, and also their connection into sport culture. And so we\u2019re seeing it across multiple dimensions. So I continue to feel very bullish about China as we do as a total Group, and again 10 consecutive quarters of continuous growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. You may speak now.","Omar Saad","I wanted to actually ask my first question about maybe some of your insights to help us think about the, potentially evolving tax environment with the new administration. There's been a lot speculation, hypothesizing around potential import adjusted tax and taxes on imported goods, foreign sourced goods. How do we think about potential puts and takes longer term as we try to incorporate our longer term model, how these tax changes could affect NIKE\u2019s P&L?","Mark Parker","Well Omar, you're absolutely correct, there's lots of speculation here. I believe it\u2019s really too early to determine what specific changes may be proposed. But we are looking forward to working with the new administration, and Congress, regarding those potential reforms. I want to quickly add that NIKE continues to believe in free and fair trade. We are a global company, obviously, operating in over 190 countries, serving billions of consumers, with close to 70,000 employees.","So the reality for us is the closer we can be to the consumers that we serve in markets around the world more efficiently we can do so, and more efficiently we can do so, I think, the better for NIKE. So, as far as specifics around trade and tax policy, again, I think it's too early to speculate. But we look forward to engage and being a part of that process.","Omar Saad","And Mark, maybe as a follow-up along those lines, how do we think about manufacturing revolution? I mean, you've got a lot of things in the pipeline in terms of bringing some production back to North America. Does any change, at least hypothetically, in terms of the tax law, perhaps accelerate the opportunity to build-up more domestic manufacturing. Maybe, how should we think about the scale, and longer term timing around that process? Thanks.","Mark Parker","Just broadly, Andy touched on this in little more depth. But we're incredibly excited about the ManRev initiative that we have. It's a long term commitment. We've made a lot of progress having real impact for NIKE. Again, speculation on tax incentives is a bit early. I will say that we're highly motivated, as I said, to engage and look for opportunities to bring our product capabilities closer to markets. We\u2019ve talked about that publically and that continues to be the case. So, we\u2019re looking for expanding on those opportunities as much as we possibly can and working with the administration in that respect.","So, we\u2019re making the real headway on our ManRev initiatives. Certainly, reflects as we talked about Apollo, we\u2019ve got new methods of manufacturing that we\u2019re really focused on here through our advanced product creation center. Some of the most exciting innovation we have beyond product is in this space. And the good news is it not only enables us to get closer to the market with more customized or personalized products potentially, but it also helps to just create a better business overall. So the financial impact is definitely there. And it creates new opportunities from a design standpoint; so, incredibly bullish on manufacturing revolution, ManRev as we call it. And I hope and we\u2019ll engage proactively to make sure that to see what we can do anyway to make sure that that continues to be the case.","Trevor Edwards","Omar, I would just say really on two fronts. As Mark said, we are committed to and abdicate for pre and fair trade, and we\u2019ll continue abdicate for policies, both trade and tax that allow us to innovate, best serve consumers, expand our business, and drive growth. At the same time, as you know over the past several years, we very proactively and strategically have been evolving our operating model through investments and manufacturing revolution, and other supply chain initiatives, with the goal of not only being to yield benefits in terms of labor productivity and lower materials cost, but as we have said, the opportunity to be much closer to market and closer to the consumer.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jonathan Komp","First, could I just ask a follow-up on the futures growth, and this is globally but also more specifically for North America. Any comments or perspective on how much your actions to better control the inventory and the tail maybe weighing on the total futures growth?","Andy Campion","Yes, I think when you think about how we manage supply and demand, it's across several dimensions. One of those is managing sell-through in the market place on a weekly and monthly basis. We also, when we\u2019re in a situation like we were in North America, do look longer terms. So as futures is typically six months out, we do look at the forward looking futures window that we\u2019re in at any given time. And manage that order book in the context of what we see in the market as of that point and what we expect over the several months leading up to that point. So they are related, if they are not perfectly co-related or the only lever. But we absolutely are continually looking at the orders that we\u2019re taking for two seasons out in the context of the trends in the marketplace.","Jonathan Komp","And then maybe switching gears just a question on the SG&A line. You look very well managed in the quarter, better than maybe you had anticipated coming in, and the full-year was revised lower by a little bit. Any perspective on some of the efforts and maybe some the successes you\u2019ve had on editing down the SG&A spend, and maybe the suitability of some of what you\u2019ve seen?","Andy Campion","Absolutely, as you know, and as Mark noted and I noted, we've grown for seven consecutive years, 28 consecutive quarters of growth. And over that period and well before that, we've always focused, first, on investing strategically and with the view towards the long-term. What we see today is the ability to continue to do that but reflect on our core level of investment and spending and frankly operational infrastructure. And take advantage of productivity gains we see. That wasn\u2019t the quarterly phenomenon, as you know, and I'm sure you've been paying close attention over the last several quarters. It's something that we have seen as a sustained opportunity. I think it really ties back to a phrase that Mark, Trevor and I all love, editing to amplify. And that has now become more systemically how we think about our investments across SG&A. And what it also evidences is the strategic alignment across our management team. And I think its evidence of our management team\u2019s ability to prioritize what's most important to fuel growth, and get leverage in other areas where we think we've got ample resources.","Operator","The next question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Sam Poser","I guess, the one thing I wanted to understand it's been, could you give us some idea of what percentage the direct-to-consumer business was of your total revenue in the quarter, and how that compared to last year? And how you\u2019re thinking about that on a forward basis?","Andy Campion","Yes, Sam. This is Andy. We don\u2019t report percentage of business per se. And as you know, DTC is on a reported basis includes full retail sales and wholesale is at wholesale prices. So, to some extent, that was just on a revenue basis that would be comparing apples and oranges. But as you know again someone who has followed us for a long-time, the rate of growth in our DTC businesses has significantly outpaced the rate of growth, still growth in our wholesale business. And so that was also the case in the second quarter as you review our 10-Q filing, you will see some detail on that, the difference between our DTC business and our sales to third party wholesalers. At the same time, I think it's really important to note that what's most important to us is growing the overall market as we said. And that has less to do with owned versus partnered and more to do with the nature of the experiences that we\u2019re putting into the marketplace.","So that was a great example, it happens to be owned. But the focus is really much more personalized services to consumer, and creating what we're really calling the new square-foot, leveraging digital to more fully serve consumer and expand the productivity. And we're going to increasingly do that with our wholesale partners as well. We have several very strategic wholesale partners here in North America, Western Europe, and around the world. We have wholesale partners in China who operate NIKE branded stores for us. And we think that's a big opportunity, both owned and partnered going forward to extend the market.","Sam Poser","Just a quick follow-up. I asked the question as it related to the futures numbers, and how to think about what percentage of the business really isn\u2019t reflected in those futures numbers the way. So just the way people think of it, because clearly your decision to change the way you reported is also a change on how meaningfully it is to you, and that\u2019s really where I was going with that question.","Andy Campion","Yes, why don\u2019t I -- I\u2019ll give you better dimension on that Sam very briefly. Nike.com futures orders and our in line stores or full-price stores, futures orders are included in futures. Our NIKE factory store business, which is a very sizable business, in fact it\u2019s a bigger business than our in line brick-and-mortar business, that factory store business in not included in futures. Obviously, there\u2019re various rates of growth across those dimensions with the highest rate of growth being in nike.com. And I just note the last thing on nike.com, as we continue to see extraordinary growth in nike.com, we\u2019re also expanding internationally and that can create some anomalies year-over-year in terms of stocking up the inventory for expansion and what not.","Nitesh Sharan","Okay, happy holidays everyone.

You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago or at our Web site, investors.nike.com.","We will start with prepared remarks then we will take your question. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks Nitesh and good afternoon everyone. I'd first like to acknowledge the changes we made last week to further evolve our culture and restructure our leadership. We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment.","I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every Nike employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential. As you know, I publicly committed to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. beyond 2020. Trevor Edwards and I both agreed to a change in leadership structure in the Nike brand at this time. As we transition to our next phase of growth and continue to evolve our culture, Trevor will work with me as an advisor through this transition until he retires in August. And I'd like to thank him for his important and significant contributions in growing and strengthening the Nike brand around the world.","We have a deep leadership bench at Nike and I'm confident that our restructured leadership team will continue to strengthen our culture and drive the Consumer Direct Offense.","So with that this call will be led by our CFO Andy Campion and me. So let's turn to the results we delivered in Q3 and the strong momentum we're building as we look forward. Simply put the Consumer Direct Offense is working. Through 2x innovation, we're creating and scaling new product platforms while also becoming sharper editors. Through 2x direct, we're moving closer to the consumer through differentiated retail concepts leading with our mobile apps, dotcom and digital partners. And through 2x speed, we're serving consumers at their pace.","During our Investor Day, we discussed the significant potential we see in our international markets. And in this quarter, we delivered strong and sustainable growth across all of our international geographies. Take Greater China for example where positive macro trends are accelerating from consumer spending to sport participation. Looking ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand our full digital portfolio leading with key cities like Shanghai and Beijing. We saw this quarter with our Greater China business growing 24%.","The end of Q3 also marks a significant turn in North America where we expect a reversal of trend in Q4. We've secured some great early wins here through new Nike consumer experiences and differentiated retail across both our direct and partner channels. Overall, there is a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and we're amplifying and capturing that demand through our Consumer Direct offense and triple double strategy. The momentum we're building in all four geographies is a result of getting the right product in front of the consumer in the right moment and it's becoming increasingly clear that the closer we connect, our strong brand to consumers in the marketplace the greater the returns. So I'm excited to share some of the highlights of how we're executing the triple double and fueling our growth in our key categories.","At Nike growth always begins with innovation and great product and this quarter through 2x innovation, we intensified the pace and scale of which we're bringing fresh and unexpected products to consumers. And we've done that by focusing our resources to create new platforms not just new models by diversifying those platforms across multiple styles and categories through our complete offense and by editing our assortments to offer more compelling choice of our power franchises.","So let's start with the new platforms. What's most exciting about our momentum is that it's being driven through a performance lens delivering clear consumer benefits through platforms like the Air Vapormax and Nike React. The Air Vapormax for example is delivering lightweight comfort with a distinct style and it quickly became the number one performance shoe above the $100 price point and we're now scaling that platform into millions of pairs. We're doing that with new designs like the Vapormax 2.0, the Vapormax 97, and the Vapormax Utility.","Turning to Nike React, the consumer response has set new records for performance innovation launch. We initially offered the product to NikePlus members exclusively selling out within hours and when we broadened the launch we sold through several weeks of supply in just four days.","As we move into Q4, we'll leverage that demand by scaling the Epic React launching the Odyssey React, a new running shoe at $120 price point and leveraging our portfolio to expand React cushioning into sportswear, basketball and Jordan Icons.","With the Airmax 270, we launched Nike's bold lifestyle specific Air platform with consumers responding to its comfort and style. Both the Air Vapormax and the Airmax 270 are fueling energy across our Nike Air family of products. With more Air innovation in the pipeline, we now expect to grow the Nike Air business by several billion dollars over the next few years. The greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond.","With other innovation platforms, we're just getting started. For example, we invented a new process for Flyknit, which we unveiled with our Mercurial boots ahead of World Cup '18. Constructed in a 360 degree form that wraps the entire foot, it gives athletes better control over their movement. It's also incredibly efficient creating 60% less waste than traditional cut-and-sew methods. The Kobe 360 will be the next shoe to adopt this new process of digital knitting combined with the Nike React midsole to create an incredible court [ph] feel. And in just a few weeks, we'll unveil a new platform that I'm extremely excited about. It takes digital product creation to an entirely new place. And as we did with the ZoomX, 4% for Breaking2, we're working closely with Eliud Kipchoge on this one. I can't say much more today, but stay tuned to Q4.","We have some other truly disruptive platforms ahead from HyperAdapt at new price points in new categories to non-powered adaptive footwear systems that improve fit to other lifestyle cushioning systems. We're also innovating in apparel. We've begun to unveil our high performance World Cup Vapor Knit kits with engineered yarns and open textures for breathability.","In addition to designing the national team kits, we've created full lifestyle collections for fans. World Cup is such a powerful moment in sport and we look forward to amplifying its energy [Technical Difficulty] and sportswear businesses around the world.","As we laid out in October, 2x direct is delivering a vision for a more differentiated marketplace connecting the Nike brand in deeper ways with consumers. And we're leading with our digital business which was up 18% on a currency neutral basis in Q3. And we just launched the SNKRS apps in China in December and in the first month alone we had 2 million downloads.","And we're also scaling Nike+ membership with plans to launch in all 12 of our key cities within the next fiscal year. We're still in the early stages of Nike+ membership but we saw a strong consumer response in Q3 with new members rising more than 50% versus the same period last year. While we lead with digital we don't believe digital and physical retail operate in silos. In fact more and more they will intersect and amplify each other.","For example in Q4, we're going to debut a new concept that we call Nike app at retail at both The Grove in Los Angeles and here in Portland. When you enter the doors, it recognizes you and opens up exclusive products in your approximately. You can scan for product availability in all nearby Nike doors or checkout and pay through the app with no waiting line. And if you are not in the store you can reserve product through the app and will hold it in a personal locker so you can try it on before buying. There are a number of other features that will be phased in as we test, initiate before scaling to a wider fleet of stores.","What really powers all these immersive consumer experiences is great data and the ability to maximize. And while we're constantly building these skills in-house we're also acquiring capabilities to accelerate our strategy. Today, we're announcing that we've acquired an exceptional consumer data and analytics firm named Zodiac based in New York, this team of world class data scientists and their proprietary tools will help us deepen relationships with consumers all over the world with a primary focus on our Nike+ members.","Better analytics are also a critical factor in our 2x speed initiative, as we sharpen our consumer sensing we can meet demand faster and deliver more relevant personalized products. We've made good product progress with our Express Lane teams especially in EMEA where Express Lane product is accelerating growth in our power franchise. In North America we are increasing our speed of delivery particularly around key cities.","Our focus for fiscal '19 is to apply those learnings further and onto our biggest volume drivers around the world. The triple double comes to life through our categories. It's how we amplify sports biggest moments, connect to our brand emotionally with consumers and drive a complete offense to grow our business. So let's touch on a few of the category highlights from the quarter.","The Nike basketball category had a very strong quarter growing double digits with growth across footwear and apparel in every geography and key city. We saw success with the launches of the Kyrie 4 and the PG2 and through the LeBron watch consumers could buy LeBron 15 player edition shoes as soon as he debut them on court. We've exceeded expectation in our first season as an official NBA partner growing the NBA business significantly over the last year.","A major bright spot has been the iconic Showtime Hoodie. It's been a huge hit at retail and it's driven a whole new silhouette for Nike apparel. Perhaps the greatest source of brand energy for both Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand was the NBA All-Star weekend in Los Angeles. Over the three days, we became the first brand to sell directly through snapchat with the Tinker AJ III selling out in just 23 minutes.","We launched sneakers pass, our geo located digital wristband that unlocks access to IE product as we did with our Cortez collaboration with Kendrick Lamar. And we hosted thousands of consumers and our makers customization space.","In college basketball, we're in the midst of one of the most unpredictable NCA tournaments in history. And Nike and Jordan once again show the strength of our partnerships sponsoring 85 teams across the men's and women's field from March Madness. With the Jordan brand, we're making the right moves to keep this iconic brand special and create sustained growth.","This quarter, we deliberately tightened distribution in the North American marketplace while also driving extraordinary heat with the consumer. We launched Russell Westbrook, first signature performance shoe with the Why NotZer0.1. And we released limited edition Jordan III's on the SNKRS app immediately after Justin Timberlake wore them at the Super Bowl halftime show.","We've talked about adding new dimensions to Jordan and this quarter we accelerated that strategy. Going forward, we will carefully manage the distribution of iconic styles, we will more completely leverage the company's innovation platforms to supercharge Jordan's performance products, we will expand into new categories beyond basketball and sportswear and drive our biggest growth opportunities in international apparel and women's.","Moving onto our largest and most influential performance category running where we're driving more innovation than any other time in our history. In addition to all the platforms we discussed, we're focused on growing our core footwear business using our Express Lane to seize opportunities and we're adding new dimensions to our power franchises like the Zoom Pegasus.","For example, this summer the women's Zoom Pegasus 35 will have cushioning, it's better tuned to her. And the new Peg Turbo will include ZoomX foam making our breakthrough platform accessible to more runners.","We also had a very strong quarter in our sportswear category, which continue to grow double digits with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. Technically led the way in apparel, while in footwear we led with the Air Force 1, Cortez, Blazer, Tenjin and Airmax.","Our women's business overall continues to accelerate, we created our first women's collection with both Nike and the Jordan Brand. The one reimagined featured 14 Nike women's designers who reinterpreted two of our greatest icons in the Air Jordan 1 and the Air Force 1.","One of the best examples of our edit to amplify approach came from the women's team this quarter with a new retail concept we call unlaced. This new sneaker destination offers collections edited by leading stylists and will give access to a wider range of sizes for the first time with exclusive colors and elevated services.","Unlace will be both a physical and digital experience starting with nike.com in North America. It will debut at Nike Soho this summer and then roll out to over 200 Nike direct and wholesale partner doors by the end of the calendar year. As you can tell, we were extremely productive this quarter. We're looking at every opportunity to improve and we're investing in the opportunities with the greatest impact. We feel very good about the short-term momentum we're driving and the foundation we are setting for long-term accelerated growth.","With that, now here's Andy to provide more detail on the financial performance of our reported segment and our outlook.","Andy Campion","Thanks Mark and hello everyone on the call.","Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting Nike's next horizon of strong profitable growth. And there are several key themes within our performance that speak to the long-term sustainability of our momentum.","First, we exceeded the revenue and gross margin expectations that we set 90 days ago fueled by an unprecedented flow of new products and innovation platforms that will scale over time. As Mark detailed in the third quarter, we launched the Nike React and the Airmax 270 platforms to extraordinary consumer demand.","We also began to scale and diversify the Air Vapormax platform and the ZoomX platform and running continues to sell out as we launched new colorways. While we're clearly doubling the canes and impact of innovation our product momentum is even broader based. Our edit to amplify approach is bringing focus and accelerating growth within our power franchises like the Air Force 1 family of products and other key styles. We're running a much more complete offense, yet we still see tremendous opportunity to improve and edit how we serve our consumers.","Second, our results in Q3 confirm that the Nike brand more directly connects with consumers, we see the greatest growth. Our Nike digital ecosystem in particular is setting the pace for growth in all four of our geographies. On a currency neutral basis, nike.com grew 18% globally driven by the expansion of our digital apps in international markets as well as the launch of Nike+ membership in North America.","In each of our international geographies, nike.com's rate of growth outpaced the overall marketplace rate of growth by 2x or greater. And in North America nike.com not only grew but has been accelerating over the last two months. Nike consumer experiences at retail are also resonating. That includes owned and partnered digital and physical experiences.","In Q3 Nike consumer experiences comprised more than 50% of our total revenue and drove over 100% of our revenue growth. In other words, we're both growing and reshaping the marketplace toward the vision that we share with you at our Investor Day.","Third, as we exit Q3, we will put two significant headwinds largely behind us. At current rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on EBIT net of hedging to be roughly neutral in Q4 and begin shifting to a slight tailwind in fiscal year '19. At the same time as Mark said the close of Q3 marks a reversal of trend for North America. We have reset Nike's supply; we're fueling demand through the launch of innovative products. We have reignited brand heat. We're connecting more directly with consumers through our digital ecosystem and orders from our strategic partners are building. In short, Nike has returned to a pool market in North America.","Nike North America revenue is now projected to be roughly flat to prior year in Q4 and return to growth in the first half of fiscal year '19. But before I share more on our outlook lets first touch on our Q3 results. Q3 reported revenue grew 7% as continued strong double-digit international growth and Nike direct growth in all geographies was partially offset by an expected contraction in North America wholesale revenue driven by undifferentiated doors. Gross margin contracted 70 basis points in Q3 a stronger result than we expected 90 days ago as our launches and stronger sell through fuel expanding full price gross margin. However, that expansion was more than offset by approximately 90 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds.","Total SG&A was up 11% in Q3 operating overhead increased 9% driven by investments in our Nike direct businesses and demand creation increased 15% primarily driven by sports marketing and activations related to the NBA All-Star weekend as well as new product innovation launches. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was roughly 180% including the one-time impacts related to the U.S. tax cuts and Jobs Act.","Income tax expense included provisional charges of $2 billion primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The onetime charges include some non-cash impacts with the cash impacts to be paid over several years. The impact of U.S. tax reform is slightly favorable to Nike in terms of both our normalized steady state effective tax rate and more efficient access to capital. When I speak to our outlook, I'll provide more dimension on the go forward implications and tax reform.","As a result, Q3 diluted EPS was a loss of $0.57 that said the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform had a $1.25 impact on EPS in the quarter excluding that impact our profitability in Q3 exceeded our expectations. As of February 28, inventories were up 9% leading into Q4 as we scale our new innovations globally and capitalize on strong consumer demand. Q3 inventory growth was primarily driven by aligning in-season product to our stronger forecast demand while off price inventory declined year-over-year on a currency neutral basis.","This quarter we saw a return to modest growth in North America inventory as we anniversary our efforts to tighten supply in the prior year and shift to a full market. Internationally our inventory levels are also healthy and generally aligned with the strong demand we continue to forecast in those markets.","Now let's turn to the financial performance for our operating segments. In North America, nike.com differentiated Nike consumer experiences in retail, the impact of Nike innovation and brand heat are driving increasingly stronger demand. While North America declined 6% for the quarter, we expect that the momentum will now reverse the trend. While undifferentiated wholesale dimensions of the marketplace declined we are delivering and accelerating growth in Nike consumer experiences in aggregate across owned and partner with nike.com in particular accelerating to strong double-digit growth as we progress through the quarter. Our partners are also increasingly bringing Nike consumer experiences to life in the marketplace. As an example of Finish Line's Culver City store in L.A. was reset with Nike Epic React as the only product available in the store across all brands for three days. The execution brought together new innovative Nike product with great storytelling through our shoes-go campaign and expert service. The results were amazing and served as a proof point for the potential of Nike consumer experiences operated by a strategic partner in the U.S. marketplace.","As Mark noted, year-over-year comparisons in North America were also impacted by our quick and deliberate tightening of the distribution of select styles within the Jordan brand. That said as we enter Q4, we believe Jordan inventories are now clean and we also began reigniting Jordan brand heat in the marketplace through the launches and activations over the NBA All-Star weekend.","Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue adding dimension to the Jordan brand through both performance and lifestyle product.","For the quarter EBIT in North America was down 14% versus the prior year primarily driven by lower revenues and a higher selling and administrative expenses.","Moving on to EMEA, where we continue to see incredibly strong momentum, in a region that is at the leading edge of consumer preferences. EMEA revenue grew 9% on a currency neutral basis in Q3 two of the hottest styles in the marketplace are the Air Vapormax and Airmax 97 and we're also seeing industry leading growth in apparel driven by our tech fleece business.","Our growth in EMEA was also aided by our Express Lane, which is already quickly translating regional consumer preferences into color and material updates with respect to our power franchises. Overall growth in EMEA was led by very strong nike.com results as well as strong results with key strategic partners.","Key strategic partners who are also relentlessly consumer focused and digitally connected such as JD and Zalando. Categorically, we saw double-digit growth in sportswear, men's training and Nike basketball. We expect continued strong growth in EMEA and we're excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup.","On a reported basis EMEA revenue increased 19% and EBIT grew 16% as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin due to transactional effects [indiscernible].","Next let's turn to Greater China having just been in China two weeks ago, I can tell you the Greater China not only continues to lead Nike in terms of the pace of growth, but also in terms of executing the Consumer Direct Offense. In Q3, Greater China was up 19% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong double-digit growth across nearly all dimensions of the business but notably led by digital. Digital momentum in the quarter was fueled by the launch of the SNKRS app in China and the continued success of our partnership with TMall. And while our digital growth has been extraordinary we have not even yet launched Nike+ membership in China that is now slated for Q1 of fiscal year '19. Also worth calling out our women's business in greater China has incredible momentum with double-digit growth driven by our innovation and power franchises including styles designed specifically to connect with consumers around the Chinese New Year.","On a reported basis, Q3 revenue grew 24% and EBIT was up 30% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. In APLA revenue grew 11% on a currency neutral basis led by digital growth that significantly outpaced every other channel. To unlock digital growth even more broadly, we will be more aggressively rolling out our digital platforms into key markets across APLA. One real-time example is the SNKRS app which just launched in Japan yesterday. It immediately surged to become Japan's number one free downloaded app in the iOS store.","APLA was also fueled by the brand energy surrounding the Winter Olympics in Korea which helped drive strong and balanced double-digit growth across nearly every dimension. Women's, men's, footwear, apparel and across many categories.","On a reported basis, Q3 revenue in APLA was up 13% and EBIT grew 31% driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","And finally at Converse, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency neutral basis as we rebalanced marketplace supply in North America. On a reported basis revenue declined 3% and EBIT was down 37%.","Looking forward, we will continue to invest in reigniting strong sustainable profitable growth at Converse. More specifically we're dimensionalizing Converse's product portfolio through the One Star, Chuck 70 and other sports and sport inspired styles investing in more converse specific digital platforms and creating heat and energy for the brand through new collaboration.","So with that, I'll now move to our outlook for the balance of the year.","We remain confident we will deliver on the growth and profitability expectations that we have previously communicated for fiscal year 2018 excluding the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform. We will continue to invest in the key pillars of our strategy and drive accelerated growth in the dimensions of our portfolio that we highlighted in our Investor Day in October.","We remain focused on what matters most to consumers and in turn what will fuel strong sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. As for specific guidance, we expect Q4 reported revenue to grow in the high single digit range. This growth reflects continued strength in our international geographies and the reversal of trend we're building in North America.","We expect Q4 gross margin to be roughly flat to very slightly up versus the prior year demonstrating progressively stronger currency neutral gross margin expansion that will be almost fully offset by transactional FX headwinds albeit lesser transactional FX headwinds than in prior quarters.","For SG&A, we expect low teens growth in Q4. We will continue to invest in digital and membership including completing the acquisitions of some key digital capabilities within the quarter as well as brand marketing and supportive innovation and impactful consumer moments such as Airmax Day and the World Cup.","At current FX rates, we expect other income and expense net of interest expense to be approximately $30 million to $40 million of expense in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be in the 10% to 12% range.","It's important to note that our tax rate may be volatile as we expect to continue receiving more specific legislative and regulatory guidance as to the application of the U.S. Tax Act.","Now looking ahead to fiscal year '19, while our planning is not yet finalized we currently expect fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit range as international momentum continues and we return to growth in North America.","We also expect strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model. In fiscal year '19, we will also see the full impact of U.S. tax reform on our access to capital and investments as well as the tax rate U.S. tax reform will certainly afford Nike more efficient access to capital.","So as we finalize our investment plans for the next fiscal year, we are prioritizing accelerated investment in the select dimensions of our business that will fuel Nike's Consumer Direct Offense and drive long-term growth. At the top of our list is digital ranging from new Nike+ membership experiences to new capabilities including data and analytics to our core enterprise resource planning platform.","Our acquisition of Zodiac a leading consumer data and analytics team was a great example of us seizing an opportunity to accelerate Nike's capability development. We will also continue to prioritize investment in innovation, brand distinction, new Nike consumer experiences in the marketplace and a faster more responsive supply chain.","The incremental and more efficient access to capital will also enable us to amplify our returns to shareholders and complete our existing four year $12 billion share repurchase program within fiscal year '19 roughly one year earlier than originally planned.","We currently expect U.S. tax reform to have a neutral to slightly favorable impact on our steady-state effective tax rate, which we would characterize as being in the teens on a normalized basis. That said in any given fiscal year geographical earnings mix the impact of the new stock based compensation accounting rules and other discrete items will create volatility in our rate. In fiscal year '19 specifically, our rate may also be impacted by adjustments to the provisional charges that we're accruing this quarter.","Taking all of these factors into consideration, we will provide our updated outlook for fiscal year '19 on our Q4 earnings call.","As Mark said our Consumer Direct Offense is working. Nike innovation is fueling strong consumer demand. Nike digital is accelerating. Our brands have great energy and our organization is aligned and executing against what matters most to consumers. Nike's next horizon of strong sustainable profitable growth is underway.","With that, we will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good evening.","Mark Parker","Good morning, Omar.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask you guys -- great job on the quarter by the way, it's great to hear all the progress and a lot of information on the call as well. It\u2019s much appreciated.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Omar Saad","The reshaping of the marketplace, wholesale especially going from I think 30000 to 40,000 partners, can you talk about the progress along that transformation where we are, what the impact has been, and maybe also layer in and put that in the context of the growth in the consumer experiences. You spent so much time talking about that aspect where you're engaging with consumers. I thought you said it was over 100% of the growth in the quarter. Are you seeing a lot of that new channel development offset that reshaping on the wholesale side? Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks guys.","Mark Parker","Thanks Omar. Well, let's go back to the Investor meeting in October. We laid out how we want to shift the look of our overall marketplace. To be 80% differentiated is our target and that's over the next five years. And I'd say as we commented we're making some great progress on that front. You pointed out and that's what we said is Nike consumer experiences drove 100% of the growth in the quarter. That's double-digit increases in new NikePlus members which is a really key part of that strategy.","We've had great feedback in terms of the NBA All-star weekend and some of the sell through in basketball, we are seeing and that involves not only our direct doors but some of our key partners. NBA All-star weekend, we had Kits and Revolve as two examples. Foot Locker was participating in that as well. And then, we're bringing some of the new concepts to market here starting very quickly with Nike Unlaced with a digital launch and then physical coming up in summer, the Nike app at retail and HyperLive are some of the examples there.","As far as our -- this is impacting our overall marketplace, we're working with our key partners to help differentiate them in their respective positions. Those conversations are ongoing with most strategic partners. We've aligned on the role that they play in serving our consumers from Dick\u2019s to Foot Locker to Nordstrom, and this is not only physical retail but its how physical and digital interact.","And then, we have other digital partners which are obviously key to this transformation. Zalando and TMall, ASOS and even Instagram for example. So this is a multi-year journey for us, and I'd say we're making great progress in shaping that marketplace and I think we'll continue to elevate our own direct business, but we will also help to differentiate and elevate our key wholesale partners along the way.","Omar Saad","And Mark, one follow up. In terms of the new shoe launches, you\u2019ve talked about SNKRS and some of the other apps. Is this the new model for kind of those premium limited distribution shoe launches whether you're doing it internally or with a partner versus kind of the old world model? Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.","Mark Parker","I think digital and mobile apps for example are going to play a big and bigger role in how we launch some of these key innovations and platforms. It's definitely how consumers are shopping, and it's definitely where we're putting a lot of emphasis on how we orchestrate these launches, how we invest to serve the consumers through those apps. I think you'll see more storytelling coming to life from a digital standpoint including our mobile app based launches.","So yes, I think you'll see this become a bigger and bigger part of our strategy and a bigger part of the results that we're seeing.","Andy Campion","And then just to add to that Omar, as Mark touched on in his remarks, ideally we're also leveraging these digital applications in the physical retail environment, and we're going to be testing and iterating on the launch of the Nike app at Retail with our key flagship stores in our key cities, starting with North America.","Mark Parker","That's a key point is the integration of physical and digital, which obviously is something that everybody is talking about. But you'll see that happen more and more with how we roll out new experiences in our own physical retail doors is that connection to digital. So this connection is going to start to blur more and more and I think one will complement the other.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks Omar. Operator, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Hi. Thank you. It's Corinna Van der Ghinst for Kate. You guys discussed the success of the Vapormax, some of these Air platforms and the React which I finally just got my hands on. But, we were just wondering what gives you confidence in the inflection in North America when the Q3 top-line was actually weaker than Q2?","Mark Parker","Well, if you look at Q3, there is momentum that has been building through the quarter and that's where the confidence we have in terms of Q4 comes from. We're on the front end of obviously, the very front end of launching React and the response has been phenomenal. I think I said it's been a record-setting performance launch for Nike. I think that's also a case of a performance basis that has also translated well into a product that can be worn on the street. So there's performance actually driving sportswear and lifestyle in one product.","The other aspect of that is, we are very committed to developing our platforms, so React starts with the Epic React running shoe, but you'll see that play out in other categories and also in more models at different price points within running.","So I think that leverage is only going to build over time and that's something that isn't unique to react. It's also what we're seeing in Vapormax as well. And then, nike.com in the quarter has been a case of month-to-month acceleration and that's driven also in part by these launches and we think that that is going to continue at a strong pace and accelerate really through Q4 and beyond. So that's a big part of this as well.","Andy Campion","Yes. And I just add, our results in the third quarter in North America were largely in line with what we expected in the quarter. The contraction was primarily a result of declines in undifferentiated wholesale and a deliberate tightening in the distribution styles within the Jordan brand. So that did have an impact on year-over-year comparisons. But as we said, we're really excited about the heat we've reignited with that brand and the clean inventory levels that we have there too.","And then to your point on innovation platforms, one of the metrics that we look very closely at is the rate of sell through as we launch products at the initial levels of supply and the rate of sell through on the Nike React in particular the Airmax 270 and those other styles far exceeded our expectations. We talked about supply selling out in hours with members and in days as compared to what we expected would be weeks with more broader distribution. So that's a leading indicator of the magnitude of demand for those new innovation platforms.","Mark Parker","I think it's safe to say that these key styles and platforms are accelerating at a more rapid pace than we've seen historically and we're doing everything we can to accelerate and leverage those platforms within the Nike brand, but across categories but also across the brands in the portfolio.","Corinna Van der Ghinst","Thanks very helpful. Thank you.","Nitesh Sharan","Operator we will take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Hello everyone. Andy, I'll start with a question for you. Your initial comments around gross margin for fiscal '19 are encouraging. It's been a long time since that FX was in but a headwind there. Was FX now expected to make a positive contribution in fiscal '19? Are there other offsets that are holding back gross margin to keep it within your kind of long-term objective range?","Andy Campion","Well, there are obviously a number of factors within gross margin as I said we see strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model. We're still completing or finalizing or planning, so we're not providing more specific guidance than that at this point.","As for product cost, labor and some other input costs are increasing a little bit but we do still see strong gross pricing margin expansion in addition to FX becoming a slight tailwind. So all of those things are incorporated in our guidance. I think the headline is we see strong gross margin expansion. And to your point, we're looking forward to putting those FX headwinds behind us, but we'll update you with more specifics in terms of a range on our Q4 call.","Jim Duffy","Great. Thanks. Mark, question around Zodiac, do they have any particular strength or competency that you saw as strategic. I guess I'm curious are there particular algorithms or predictive analytics that distinguish them from your in-house capabilities or other outsourced alternatives?","And then, related analytics, do you see that as an in-house competency, is that your objective to really strengthen that muscle in-house or do you expect to work with partners on an outsource spaces?","Mark Parker","Yes. Well, first of all, the first part of your question Zodiac is a small tech company really comprised of world-class scientists and engineers who are based out of New York. They bring in-depth understanding of how to optimize consumer value and understand what's behind consumer growth or potential.","We've been working with Zodiac for the past several months using their proprietary algorithms and models and I'd say we're just extremely excited about how we can more fully leverage those capabilities to accelerate some of the key pillars of our strategy. And one of the areas that I think I'd particularly call out is how they can help us power up our Nike membership to better leverage the data there to capture demand signals in our key cities and help to inform our Express Lane. Yes.","Andy Campion","And I just add Jim, you asked is this acquisition versus in-house? The short answer is we're both building the capabilities in-house to drive our digital offense and selectively acquiring teams or technology to accelerate against that build. So we already have made significant investments in building our Nike membership team and data analytics capabilities and are fortunate to have some great talent that's joined our company over the past couple of years and bringing on teams like that at Zodiac and some other teams that we've been in discussion with are additive.","Mark Parker","Yes. Advancing this capability, I would just say is, absolutely fundamental to fueling the strategy that we have in front of us, which is to be more personal at scale. So this is directly in line with that that critical part of our strategy.","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you, Jim. Operator, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon guys. So recognizing exciting innovation. Any help thinking through your expectations for footwear versus apparel embedded within the North America guidance?","And then just any further color you can share on the Amazon test? Thanks.","Andy Campion","Okay. Well, we certainly see strong growth in both footwear and apparel. Looking backwards, we've had incredibly strong growth in apparel. I mentioned that apparel was -- our growth in apparel was industry leading in EMEA driven by our tech fleece business and some other innovative products like the Flyknit bra and other products within our portfolio.","We see these launches of innovation as well as our focus on the power franchises fueling accelerating growth in footwear. So that it's more balanced going into fiscal year '19.","Mark Parker","Yes. I'll just add that apparel sometimes falls in the shadow of footwear, but we are one of the largest apparel companies in the world. I think our strength comes from both our performance position and how we leverage that across sportswear. So actually we're very excited about some of the performance innovation coming in apparel. In fact our 2x innovation initiative commitment is equally being applied to apparel. And I think that will impact a product that you'll see at the World Cup, you'll see it at the NBA championships, you're seeing with our relationship with the NBA across all sport categories training. And then, it will wind up influencing more and more of the sportswear category as well where we are performing incredibly well.","I'm really excited about what's coming in innovation and apparel, and then, our ability to kind of push on both sides of the performance and sportswear side. So there's a lot coming in apparel and frankly there's a lot coming in footwear -- a lot more coming in footwear than we've talked about.","So I think our 2x innovation investments which really kicked into gear about two years ago are really starting to pay off. Anyway back to your second question, Amazon as you know we have -- I think you know we have been extended our pilot with Amazon and to-date it's a smaller U.S. based pilot, it's performed quite well. We've seen good sell through on a limited selection of products. We're expanding that selection of products over this next phase.","Our focus on this relationship really is, how we can best work together to elevate the consumer experience and that's really a key part of all of our digital partnerships. So we continue to engage with the U.S. Digital Marketplace to look at how we can serve digital demand from consumers and Amazon is definitely a part of that.","We get just a backup for a second and get the most out of the partnerships that advance our brand through better presentation through the sharing of data TMall in China, Zalando in Europe. These are great examples of those types of relationships. So we'll continue to work with Amazon to what we think will be a mutually beneficial partnership over the months ahead.","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you, Simeon. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Good afternoon. Nice quarter congrats. Thanks for getting me in here. I'd like to ask about the investments for next year. You gave some help on the on the top-line and how to think about some of the shape of the P&L. But the investments obviously seem to be working up and down the commentary you guys are happy about it. I mean can we think about whether you'd be interested in front loading some of those investments a little more now. And can you speak to maybe how much you think SG&A growth rate would be next year is it faster than this year slower than this year with a newfound success in the investments and just any directional puts and takes to help us think about how the fiscal year and your early planning looks next to the mid-teens, long-term EPS algorithm? ","Andy Campion","Yes. Well as you know Michael we didn't give specific SG&A guidance for fiscal year '19 and there are really two reasons for that. One, we've never operated because we're not. We've never operated as if we are and we aren't capital constrained. So our top priority as we look ahead to any given fiscal year is to ensure that we're prioritizing the investments that are going to fuel growth over the long-term as compared to adhering to rigidly to a specific metric in the short-term period.","The Tax Act does also afford us even more efficient access to the cash flow and the capital that we generate around the world. So yes, our planning process is taking both of those into account in the context of us having a new very focused strategy. So we're prioritizing investments specifically in innovation.","I've told you in the past that we've doubled the investment innovation. We continue to make incremental investments there and I want to pause there for a moment. It's really a competitive advantage for Nike. We currently invest probably more than any other brand in the marketplace, but we're going to continue to make incremental meaningful investments. But those investments are still relatively insignificant compared to the kind of growth and returns that they generate when we consider launches like React to Vapormax and the other platforms that Mark and I have shared.","So innovation is certainly a priority. We're going to continue to drive brand distinction. You probably saw our shoes go campaign over the last several months and the energy that that's creating as well as some of the energy recreated against the All-Star Weekend and other big moments in sport. And I would say even though I'm mentioning it third at the top of our list is digital capabilities both building them and like we said acquiring capabilities through teams like the team we acquired in Zodiac. And then, there are really two final areas that are on our short list of priorities making consumer experiences owned and partner that as Mark noted integrate or leverage digital in the physical environment. We are clearly doing that ourselves and we're increasingly doing that with our partners all at various stages of development. But, we are going to continue to test and iterate there. And then finally, we are prioritizing investment in Speed through two key initiatives, our Express Lane and Responsive Manufacturing.","So in short, we believe these are investments that are going to drive brand distinction for Nike and fuel our next horizon of long-term sustainable profitable growth and we are going to over index our investment in those dimensions.","Michael Binetti","Thanks for that. And can I ask a quick follow-up, obviously, you are squeezing a lot of -- more funding squeeze, you talked about, it's good to hear. But then, in your comment about nike.com North America accelerating to strong double digit growth. I know one dimension that channel has been the close out sales that you guys have been so focused on the back end -- past few quarters. And you called it out in the 10-K as the markdowns what will help the margin fact there?","Can you give us a sense of how much excess markdowns contribute to the gross margin in third quarter that we will see in the 10-Q and do you think that line in the gross margin atypically give us will be reversing significantly to line up with the comments that you made here today about the foam market?","Mark Parker","Yes. I will give you a few data points on that. Overall, ASPs for the entire enterprise were up and ASPs in North America were slightly up all in. On nike.com, we saw some of the margin upside that we delivered versus the expectations we set 90 days ago was actually based on stronger gross margin in our Nike direct businesses and in particular in North America. We are seeing stronger full price sell through and we are seeing better margin on the off-price dimension of that business.","Now the off-price dimension of digital is bigger today than it might have been a couple of years ago, so on a relative basis, you've got more off-price in digital and general in the marketplace but not in partner. But, I would say that has been the source of margin expansion for us.","And I just summarize it by saying, we are really confident in the go forward impact of both what we are doing from a product perspective and innovation and power franchises as well as the impact of the Nike direct and digital and Nike consumer experiences on our margin.","Michael Binetti","That's really, really helpful.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Michael.","Michael Binetti","Thanks.","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you. Okay. That's all we have time for today. Thank you everyone for joining. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, these feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thank you for your cooperation on this. Now I will turn the call over to NIKE Inc's President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Kelley and hello, everyone. Before I move into a discussion on our business, I want to take a moment to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion. As you know, Don Blair retired from the CFO role as of July 31. I'm happy to formally welcome Andy into his new role. Andy has been a key member of the NIKE leadership team for the past eight years and brings to his new role both a passion for the brand and a commitment to driving shareholder value. You'll hear from Andy at the end of the call to discuss our results in detail, but let me start with a few of my thoughts as we begin the new fiscal year.","Last year at this time, I talked about our focus on three key areas. The depth of our relationships with our athletes and consumers, our fast-paced culture of innovation and the power of our portfolio, we strengthened all of these areas throughout last year and we delivered tremendous results. In Q1, we carried that momentum forward with an outstanding start to FY \u201816.","Let's take a look at the highlights from the first quarter. NIKE Inc. revenues grew 5% to $8.4 billion, despite significant FX headwinds. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 14%. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5% and earnings per share increased 23% to $1.34.","Ultimately, NIKE continues to succeed because of the deep relationships we have with the athletes and the consumer. Relationships we know we must earn every day. And we have a thoughtful long-term growth plan which we continue to execute at the highest level. We invest in our biggest opportunities and we have built a diversified portfolio to give us the flexibility to pull the right levers at the right time to maximize growth. Our powerful portfolio of categories, geographies, brands and channels across men's, women's and young athletes, is one of our greatest competitive advantages.","And we continue to see new ways to unlock growth all over the world. While we\u2019re not immune to the macroeconomic challenges that all businesses are facing, we\u2019re best positioned and best resourced to navigate the short-term and thrive for the long-term.","NIKE is on a relentless pace and we have no intention of slowing down. Leveraging our portfolio is one way we sustained growth. The other, of course, is through innovation. We showed the power of our scale this quarter as we share our technologies from one category to another. And from one brand to another. This is how innovation can create separation and this is something only NIKE can do.","Just a couple of quick highlights, in footwear, we launched the Pegasus 32 in June 2015 which featured high-performance Zoom Air technology. It delivers highly responsive cushioning and lightweight support to help athletes achieve their fastest runs. In the Jordan brand, we introduced the SuperFly 4, with FlightSpeed technology, offering lightweight comfort and impact protection.","In performance apparel, we just announced two new technologies that solve for temperature regulation in completely new ways. Therma-Sphere Max, a composite material designed for lightweight warmth and mobility for outdoor training and then AeroReact, an adaptive material that reacts to the heat and moisture of the body.","The fibers of the fabric open up when they get wet and they close as the dry out again, offering both active cooling and warmth all in one layer. Going forward, you can expect to see further acceleration in our innovation agenda for performance apparel as we look ahead to the Summer Olympics in Rio and beyond. So stay tuned for more on that later in the year.","In sportswear apparel, we delivered our latest silhouettes of Tech Fleece for men and women. Over the past several seasons, NIKE Tech Pack is creating great demand for premium lifestyle apparel with technical performance innovation. A great example of leveraging innovation across multiple dimensions of our business is reflected in Hurley, Jordan and Converse utilizing NIKE technology to create exciting new concepts of their own.","Hurley once again applied a footwear innovation to their industry-leading Phantom Elite board short. This time using NIKE MAG wire, a dynamic stability support system for a lockdown fit in the waistband.","The Jordan brand continued to bring its unique perspective to training with the Flight Flex Trainer 2 and its NIKE Free inspired natural motion mid-sole. Looking ahead, we see tremendous opportunity for the Jordan brand to transcend its core basketball positioning into new areas of growth.","And finally, the legendary Chuck Taylor All Star received a performance innovation boost, adding a NIKE LunarLaunch sock liner, a padded collar and breathable liner to the Converse classic. The Chuck Taylor All Star 2 brought new comfort details, but stay true to the silhouette that Chuck fans know and love. The potential for Converse has never been greater, as we continue to expand globally and further diversify this great brand. These are just a few of the examples that show how we take our best ideas and accelerate them across our categories and brands to serve our consumers and drive growth.","As you have heard me say many times, innovation at NIKE goes beyond product. And digital is a great example. Digital is an accelerator throughout NIKE. It's a platform that enables new ways of working and new methods of manufacturing. It drives how we connect with consumers, how we serve them and how we engage with one another. It helps to fuel our growth by serving our consumers whenever they want NIKE products for any sport all over the world.","Our digital ecosystem delivers a connected growing community, personal real-time engagement and easier access to the product they love head to toe. We stand alone because we connect all three to give the most holistic premium experience to the consumer. And when we serve the consumer better through digital, we drive growth. Just to look at this quarter's revenue for e-commerce business.","It's up an incredible 46% on a constant currency basis, with robust growth across all of our geographies. We also saw a strong conversion and increased traffic particularly on mobile. Our Q1 results clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive sustainable profitable growth. And while we feel great about the last 90 days, we remain laser focused on continuing this momentum over the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. The rest of FY \u201816 is filled with important sports moments.","The Super Bowl, the NBA All-Star weekend, Euro Champs and of course the lead up to the Rio Olympics. Every one of them is an opportunity for NIKE. An opportunity to innovate for the athlete, to inspire the consumer and to grow the business. And just like the athletes we serve, these opportunities compel us to keep raising the bar. Because in the end, the power of NIKE not like not only in our ability to see the future, but to create it. And you can expect us to continue to do just that.","Thanks and now here's Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. It's a new fiscal year, but the strong results continue for the NIKE Brand. Q1 proved yet again the sustained power of the category offense. As we have said, the category offense drives deep and meaningful relationships with consumers. This provides us with great insights to create innovative products, rich services and inspiring experiences that our consumers love.","For the quarter, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 15%, with double-digit growth across nearly every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 21%, driven by new store expansion, continued strong growth in online sales, up 46% and comp store growth of 7%. We\u2019re very pleased with global futures up a strong 17%. Clearly, the category offense continues to drive growth around the world and it remains the foundation of our strategy as we look ahead.","As always, we use power of our vast portfolio to target the best growth opportunities for the brand. And what gives us that flexibility is the breadth and depth of our category expertise. To see these dynamics in action, let's first take a look at running. Our obsession with speed has driven us for years, so we never settle, always looking to shave off that extra second.","This relentless focus on innovation can be seen in the momentum of our Zoom Air technology. Propelling the runner forward with an ultra-responsive step, Zoom Air technology drives key product styles like our Pegasus 32, Vomero 10 and the Elite 8. In Q1, Zoom helped ignite our global community of runners through a special event we called the Fastest Day on Earth, in which we challenged runners to run their fastest mile ever. The event concluded with NIKE celebrating each runner's fastest mile with a personalized video that included the runners name, mile time and clips from their route using Google Street View. This storytelling saw excellent response, reaching millions of consumers across social media.","Looking at performance apparel, we continue to build on the growth momentum of NIKE Dri-FIT. We launched the Contour running top which features zoned breathability for increased comfort and mobility. And to further express the runners love of the sport, our running inspired sportswear styles also continued to resonate. Two decades after its introduction, we celebrated the Air Max 95 by releasing the original silhouette. And we have bought into the future with new technologies in the Air Max 95 Ultra.","Another strong growth driver in Q1 was our women's business with revenue growing double digits. We launched the highly anticipated training shoe, the MetCon 1 for women which offers just a hint of what's to come in training. We continued to lead with key apparel styles such as the Dri-FIT knit bras and NIKE pro tights, all of which are important drivers for this business. ","And sportswear delivered strong growth, with footwear styles like the Roshe and the entire Air Max platform which continues to the very popular with women. In addition to delivering innovative new product to the market, we also remained focused on creating compelling retail executions for her, both through our own DTC and with our wholesale partners.","The rollout of premium and elevated doors throughout the globe continues to drive this important business, as highlighted by the ongoing success of Foot Locker's 602 executions and the launch of the Chelsea Collective Doors with Dick's Sporting Goods. The success we're seeing in women's is truly comprehensive, as all facets of the business continued to excel. From products to services, from footwear to apparel and across sports and throughout the entire athlete's life, we\u2019re excited about the future of the women's business, with the global shift towards the health and fitness as part of her lifestyle, we see tremendous opportunity for years to come.","Now let's shift onto a few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter, with revenues up 9% and futures up 15%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across nearly all key categories time and time again. Even though this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent profitable growth.","The energy of our brand in North America is clear. With continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Dick's Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and The Finish Line. We continue to serve this consumer through our amplified strategy, delivering both performance and lifestyle products. At the same time, we continued to work to effectively manage the flow of inventory in North America, including the impacts of the West Coast port congestion from earlier this calendar year. While the flow of product from the port has now returned to normal, we\u2019re working to efficiently clear excess inventory to keep our in-line channel healthy.","In addition, we have recently expanded our North American distribution center and are working to bring this new capacity fully online. We expect both these efforts to be complete by the end of Q3 and inventory levels in North America to normalize at that time. Ultimately, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the roadmap to continue to unlock growth opportunities both this year and far into the future.","Now let's turn to Western Europe. Q1 revenue grew 14%, driven by growth in all territories and nearly all key categories. This growth continues to be fueled by the transformation of the marketplace along the category offense. This work includes elevated executions at Intersport, the new Oxford Street's location with JD Sports in London and the expansion of the House of Hoops at Foot Locker in Berlin.","And our own DTC continues to perform very well, delivering 31% growth in Q1. By being both deliberate and aggressive, we lead the market as Western Europe's most desired sports brand. We're excited about what the future holds, as we execute our complete offense in Western Europe.","Now onto the emerging markets which delivered strong Q1 results with revenue up 19%, driven by strong growth in Mexico and most key categories. The improvement we've seen in Mexico contributed significantly to the overall results in the geography. As we see the benefit of investing in and elevating our distribution. For example, we launched the House of Her in Mexico City, a product showcase supported by great service, experience and community.","Also, prominent marketplace executions with partners such as Liverpool which is Mexico's largest department store and Innovasport are also performing well. As these new doors prove by elevating the marketplace, we grow the market in key geographies and territories. Overall, we believe we\u2019re now well-positioned to drive profitable long-term growth in Mexico.","In Brazil, revenue was flat, an improvement in trend and market share. But still reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. That said, we continue to focus on our strategy of resetting the marketplace along the category offense. By focusing on differentiating our points of distribution and creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online, we drive increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. ","Overall, we continue to see tremendous growth potential for the emerging markets long-term and are confident that we\u2019re executing the right strategies to realize that potential in this important geography.","Finally, in greater China, revenue was up an amazing 30%, tremendous growth that again proves more than ever the success of our strategies. These gains were driven by strong performance across nearly all key categories, including sportswear, running and basketball. For our wholesale partners like [indiscernible], the doors that have been re-profiled continued to outperform the rest of the fleet, driving expanded productivity and profitability. We also saw strong growth from our DTC business, driven by comp store sales increases and an acceleration in our e-commerce business.","It was a very active quarter for China in sport, as Beijing hosted the Track and Field World Championships in which athletes wearing NIKE footwear dominated, taking home the majority of medals awarded. And throughout quarter 1, athletes like Lebron James, Kobe, Anthony Davis and Paul George all participated in NIKE basketball events throughout China, connecting with thousands of consumers through their shared passion of the sport.","And just two days ago, we announced that Michael Jordan will travel to Shanghai in mid-October to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Air Jordan franchise. All told, the incredible growth we saw in China this quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to align the marketplace to the category offense, a strategy that we expect will drive growth in this critical geography for many years to come.","In the end, the NIKE Brand started the new fiscal year with energy throughout the entire portfolio of geographies and categories and we expect to leverage this energy going forward. Because at NIKE, the opportunities offered by our complete offense are limitless across men's, women's and young athletes and across categories, geographies, product types and also marketplaces. FY \u201816 promises to be another year where the choices and investments we make propel us to serve the athlete with even more premium products, services and experiences. While we may be just out of the blocks in quarter 1, we\u2019re already in full sprint towards a year of continued growth for this brand and this Company.","Thanks. And now on his first earnings call, is NIKE's new CFO, here is Andy.","Andy Campion","Thank you, Mark and Trevor and hello to our stakeholders on the call. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the last several years and I very much look forward to deeper engagement over time. With this being my first earnings call, I would like to take a moment to reinforce a few of our long-standing guiding principles. And also briefly touch on how we will continue to evolve and innovate.","Our primary financial objective has been and will continue to be delivering extraordinary value to our shareholders. Delivering value to shareholders is first and foremost a function of creating value for consumers. As consumer expectations continue to accelerate, NIKE will evolve and innovate to exceed those expectations. At NIKE, innovation is in our DNA, that applies to all dimensions of our business, from the products and services that we deliver to consumers, to the operating and business models that we employ. That is what we call being on the offense always.","As we create value for consumers, we will continue to capture that value through disciplined and consistent financial management. NIKE knows how to grow. We\u2019re also deeply committed to ensuring that our growth is profitable, sustainable and capital efficient over the long term. We do that through robust gross margin management, continually enhancing the productivity of our resources and investing surgically and strategically in those opportunities with the highest potential for return.","Finally, as we create value for consumers and we capture that value financially, we will also deliver that value to shareholders through capital management, risk management and consistently increasing our cash returns through both share repurchases and dividends. Having worked very closely with Mark, Trevor and my predecessor Don since joining NIKE in 2007, I am deeply invested in the strategies that have fueled our strong performance to date.","And, I believe we have tremendous potential to grow and create value for both consumers and shareholders over the long-term. As we say at NIKE, there is no finish line. Our Q1 financial performance and outlook for the balance of the year reflect both the value we\u2019re creating for consumers and the principles that we apply to financial management. So I am very pleased to share our results in more detail.","Q1 reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 5% and grew 14% on a currency neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 15% on a currency neutral basis and Converse grew 3%. Growth in the NIKE Brand was broad-based and strong across all geographies and nearly all categories. Also on a currency neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 17%, driven by an 11% increase in units and a 6% increase in average selling prices.","Our futures growth reflects continued strong demand and healthy poll markets across the NIKE brand portfolio. All geographies grew double digits, except emerging markets which grew 6%. On a reported basis, futures grew 9%, reflecting a stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.","Q1 diluted EPS grew 23% to $1.34, despite significant FX headwinds. Our EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth and effective financial management across all levers of the business. Gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 47.5%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices and continued strong growth in our higher margin direct-to-consumer business, partially offset by higher product input costs and warehousing.","Q1 demand creation declined 7%, reflecting favorable comparisons against higher investment in the World Cup in the first quarter of FY \u201815. Operating overhead increased 10% for the quarter, driven by variable costs associated with continued strong growth in our DTC business and targeted investments in consumer-focused digital capabilities and operational infrastructure.","Our effective tax rate was 18.4% for Q1. Lower than prior year, primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside of the U.S. which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. As well as certain non-recurring items that were recognized in the first quarter.","As of August 31, inventories were up 10%, primarily to support strong demand across our business. Overall, inventories continue to be healthy around the globe. However, as Trevor discussed, we do expect inventories in North America to be somewhat elevated for the next two quarters. And we anticipate there will be an impact on gross margin in the near term as we work to clear excess inventory.","Now let's take a look at our performance by segment. North America delivered another strong quarter with 9% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis, driven by strength in nearly every key category, led by sportswear, basketball, men's training and running. And consumer demand for NIKE remains strong in North America with futures growth of 15% on a currency neutral basis. On a reported basis, North America revenue grew 8% and EBIT grew 7%, due to slightly lower gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.","Western Europe also had a great quarter with Q1 revenue up 14% on a currency neutral basis, driven by growth in every territory. These results and our continued momentum in Western Europe reflect our broader and deeper execution of the category offense. Nearly all key categories delivered strong growth, fueled by sportswear, basketball and running, while global football declined due to tough comparisons to higher World Cup revenues in the prior-year. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue declined 4% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 20%, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","In central and Eastern Europe, Q1 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in every territory except Greece and double-digit growth in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 2%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular the ruble and the Turkish lira; however, EBIT grew 42%, due primarily to strong gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","Now turning to China, where revenue grew an impressive 30% for the quarter, on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. While we\u2019re very mindful of the macroeconomic volatility in China, our brand has never been stronger and our marketplace has never been more healthy. We have momentum across nearly all key categories, as well as continued strength in our DTC business. EBIT for China grew 51% in Q1, due to very strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","In our emerging markets geography, Q1 revenue increased 19% on a constant-currency basis. As nearly all territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Mexico, [indiscernible] and Pacific. Nearly every key category grew for the quarter led by sportswear, action sports and basketball. As Trevor discussed in his remarks, Mexico returned to strong growth as a result of our efforts to optimize inventory and reset that market.","And while revenue was flat in Brazil, our brand is strong and we continue to gain share, while also investing to reset that marketplace along the lines of the category offense. On a reported basis, emerging-markets revenue increased 3% for the quarter and EBIT rose 65%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.","At Converse, Q1 revenue grew 3% on a constant-currency basis, driven primarily by double-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the UK. The Converse brand remained strong and was further enhanced by the launch of the Chuck 2 in the first quarter. However, quarterly year-over-year comparisons will be somewhat uneven as we transition to a more direct operating model outside of the U.S. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 3% primarily due to the weaker euro. And EBIT decreased 21% for the quarter, driven primarily by lower sales in the UK, as well as SG&A investments in infrastructure and Converse intellectual property enforcement efforts.","NIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance in the first quarter, despite significant FX headwinds. And we have healthy momentum across our global portfolio. Our outlook for the balance of the year reflects that momentum, as well as continued investment in our growth strategies and operational capabilities. Specifically, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth at a mid-single-digit rate, generally in line with the growth rate for Q1, reflecting low teens growth on a currency-neutral basis, largely offset by the impact of the stronger dollar.","Our expectations for Q2 revenue also reflect the fact that our futures growth is more heavily weighted towards the back half of the futures window. For the full year, our outlook has slightly improved. But we continue to expect that reported revenue growth will be squarely within the mid-single-digit range.","We expect gross margin for Q2 to expand about 25 basis points, reflecting our efforts to expeditiously clear excess inventory in North America and keep the in line channel fresh. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, including our stronger than expected actual performance in Q1, combined with our current expectations for Q2 and the balance of the year.","For total SG&A, we expect Q2 and the full year to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting continued investments in DTC, consumer facing digital capabilities and infrastructure, as well as key brand events as we lead up to the Euro Champs and the Summer Olympics in Rio. We continue to anticipate other income will have a more meaningful impact on our FY \u201816 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent significant changes in FX, we continue to expect other income will be about $50 million for each of the next three quarters.","We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 22% for the full year including the lower actual rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 24% for Q2 through Q4.","With that, we will now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul","If I'd like to focus on one area, Mark or Trevor, could you guys address -- in China, the results were outstanding. There has just been a lot of headline news around the Chinese consumer, China economy, the currency pieces. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit in terms of the puts and takes that you are seeing in the Business from a financial perspective and really how you are seeing such great demand with the futures and the current quarter revenues?","Trevor Edwards","The piece that we continue to look at is the brand in China is extremely strong. And that's a piece that we have known for a while. As we went through the reset strategy, we wanted to be really focused on how to make sure that we could drive the Business.","So, we're very mindful of the macroeconomic volatility in the marketplace. But we continue to really focus on the things that we can control which is how we continue to bring excitement to the marketplace and also continue to align the marketplace around our category offense and we're seeing success from that perspective.","So, we saw growth in really all key categories from sportswear, to running, to basketball; we saw it in our wholesale and also in DTC. In DTC, our business actually grew 46% in DTC. And in our wholesale partner\u2019s accounts, the stores that have been re-profiled, those doors actually continue to outperform the actual entire fleet, increasing both productivity and profitability. So, we feel very, very good about the business and we stay really focused on delivering, as I said, great product into the marketplace and really driving the category offense.","Bob Drbul","And just a follow-up question on that, In terms of gauging industry wholesale inventories, can you just comment on that a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in the marketplace from -- your own product seems really good at wholesale, but just competitively?","Trevor Edwards","I will speak to ours. We have a very healthy position in inventory, so we feel good about that. As I said, we continue to really monitor that and we put a lot of discipline in place as we went through the reset. And we continue to employ that discipline across the organization. So, we\u2019re in good shape.","Operator","The next question is from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","My first question is on North America inventories. I just wondered if you could give a little bit more detail on the composition of the inventory elevation by category and by channel? And how long do you expect this to put some pressure on gross profit margin?","Trevor Edwards","As I think we discussed in the prepared remarks, the brand again in North America is very strong. And demand for our products continues to be very strong in the marketplace. What we're working through is the impact of the west coast port congestion from earlier this year. And what we have done is we have seen the actual flow of product from the port normalize. At the same time, we're working to efficiently clear the excess inventory to keep the in-line channel healthy.","We also put on our own North American distribution center and we're working to actually put that capacity in place. That will be fully online. We expect both of those efforts to be complete by the end of Q3 and that is really where we\u2019re around it. So, again, we continue to feel very confident about the Business in North America and this is obviously a very well-developed market where we have the ability to efficiently clear the inventory.","Mark Parker","And all I would add, Kate, is that as we work to expeditiously clear that inventory, you do see that impacting our Q2 gross margin guidance. That is just a near-term impact.","Kate McShane","My second question is on the supply chain and also a gross margin question. With all the investment that you've made into the supply chain and the effort to make the process more automated with your factory partners, when do you expect to see cost become less of a meaningful offset to gross margin?","Mark Parker","Kate, from a supply chain perspective, obviously our manufacturing revolution initiatives we believe will create tremendous value for us over the long term. Those initiatives range from initiatives that are more evolutionary such as optimizing product costs, reducing waste, getting productivity enhancements through Lean and then as you touched on, automation to the more revolutionary initiatives like new methods of design and make and Flyknit is a great example of that. We're beginning to see some of the benefits of those initiatives in margin, but its early stages. We\u2019re still very optimistic about those benefits over the long term.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask a question on SG&A demand creation. I think it was down 6% or 7% this quarter and I think you were expecting it to be down. Wonder if there's any underlying change in trend or attitude towards demand creation? I know you've got some events coming up.","And then, broader picture on demand creation investment, SG&A investment, we take out the currency out of the equation and you look at just the total gross profit dollar growth is at such a high rate looking forward and in the Business right now. Are there ample investment opportunities to keep the SG&A investment level in line with that revenue and gross profit dollar growth that you're seeing? It just seems like a really big number to keep up with on the investment side. Thanks.","Andy Campion","Omar, I will hit that question. First, in terms of demand creation, Q1, the biggest driver of what you saw in Q1 was comparisons to World Cup investment in the prior year. As we have spoken about in the past, there are some dynamics in SG&A across demand creation and operating overhead that have changed. Those aren't drivers of some of the impact in Q1. That's more along the lines of how we engage with consumers. I think we've spoken to you about that over time that how we engage with consumers now expands into things that fall into that line item operating overhead.","In terms of SG&A, as you know, we look to deliver modest SG&A leverage over the long term. But in any given period, our actual investment may be higher or lower. Our guidance for this year reflects continuing to make investments in consumer engagement that we believe drive great returns from a revenue and margin perspective. One example of that would be in nike.com.","We're also continuing to make infrastructure investments that we believe are required to support the growth that we're delivering and we're delivering on a consistent basis. And at the same time, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. We\u2019re also increasing the productivity of our existing resources and infrastructure. So, we do see greater productivity going forward and currently from our existing resources. That does add, as you noted, potentially to profit expansion; it also gives us greater capacity to invest strategically.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial.","Chris Svezia","Andy, a question for you, when you mentioned with regard to the guidance on the year, about feeling better about the revenue growth rate, yet you're still looking for reported mid-single digits, just maybe you could walk through that. It's just based on a currency neutral basis, you feel better about the revenue growth or just maybe you can walk through that a little bit even though you're up 9% on the futures number on a reported basis.","Andy Campion","Yes, a couple things. The headline from a revenue perspective is we do see strong demand around the globe. You see that reflected in our futures. I did note in my remarks and I will reiterate it, that our futures are weighted more heavily toward the back half of the window. As for our full-year expectations, I think I also noted but just to reiterate it, our outlook is slightly improved. It's just that from a reported basis, our guidance is still squarely within that mid-single digit range.","Chris Svezia","And then I'm curious, Western Europe continues to put up really good performance and I just really want to go a little bit further into the margin performance which was really strong, even against a tough comparison from last year. Is it just a function of the execution on the category offense, the product, the pricing? Maybe just talk a little bit more about that and maybe the sustainability at that level if you could?","Kelley Hall","Chris, are you talking about operating like EBIT margin?","Chris Svezia","Revenue growth a bit, yes, a little bit of both. Revenue growth and I guess more specifically the operating margin being at that level which we have not seen in some time and the sustainability around that.","Trevor Edwards","Just jumping in there just to say, again, as you pointed out, we\u2019re seeing great results out of Western Europe. It really goes back to the work that we did to reset the marketplace along the line of the category offense. We're seeing great growth in the territories. So, whether it's AGS which is Austria, Germany and Switzerland, southern Europe, UK and Ireland, as well as France, all of those territories are performing well.","We're also seeing strong growth across the categories, from sportswear, basketball, to running. So, when you look at it from different dimensions, what we\u2019re seeing is just strong demand in the marketplace and then we also continue to work with our wholesale partners to deliver the category offense in the marketplace and that's working real well. So, all the dimensions that we're seeing continue to point to just really strong demand, really strong positioning with our consumers and we've been able to really translate that into the Business.","Mark Parker","I will just quickly add, we're seeing incredible brand strength, too, across the major cities across Europe. And I think that is helping as well. The product that we've been introducing to the market has resonated -- sell-throughs are strong. Western Europe is a great example of a complete offense, not just the category offense working, but the complete offense. So, we really feel good about executing across the categories up and down the price point spectrum and across the major channels as well. e-commerce","Operator","The next question is from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robbie Ohmes","Trevor, I was hoping you could talk about the Jordan brand, maybe remind us how big it is. And then, I think the commentary on the new areas for the Jordan brand is really interesting. Can you give us some insight on what these areas could be? How soon we could see things happening? How that's going to play out for you with partners at retail and in your own stores? Anything you can give us on that would be great.","Trevor Edwards","The Jordan brand continues to be a key part of our basketball strategy. And as you know, we don't actually report specifically the size of the Jordan business today. But what I can say is that we continue to see tremendous success in the marketplace. So, this summer, in Paris for example, the team was there really executing the anniversary of the Jordan business there. Michael actually went over there, as he's going to go over into Shanghai also.","So, it's a sense of a global phenomenon that we\u2019re seeing as really just driving great sell-through and just great demand for the products and the brand. At the same time, we see an opportunity around the training business which is where, as I think Mark spoke to which is we\u2019re expanding the Business beyond basketball into the training segment. And so, that's another area that we continue to see opportunity and potential growth around the world.","Mark Parker","I want to add, Jordan is a tremendous brand globally. It's not just a subset of NIKE basketball. It's a stand-alone brand with tremendous potential to resonate beyond basketball as a category. So, it's largely been basketball-based and that will always be the core of the Jordan brand. With that though, we see tremendous opportunity to expand that brand, not just here in North America, but around the world.","Robbie Ohmes","And just my second question, the North America apparel growth, what channels are leading your apparel growth in North America? Is D2C accelerating in NIKE apparel or is it department stores? I would just love to get a sense of how you guys are driving such great growth.","Trevor Edwards","Again, our apparel business continues to strengthen. And we're seeing growth really across different segments within the category offense. So, for instance, our running business continues to be a great growth driver. Our sportswear business with our Tech Pack products just continue to be really successful.","As you pointed out, we're also seeing great growth through our own DTC doors and also online which are really just key elements. And the other part that we do talk a lot about which is the women's business and so you are seeing great growth come from women's business. So, again, dimensionally, through the category offense, we\u2019re able to really grow our apparel business, really across a broad spectrum of the marketplace. But it's driven by our ability to drive a complete offense through the category offense.","Operator","Your next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","I was hoping, as we think about the Olympics ahead, if you guys could put into context how you think about the Olympics as a platform to introduce new products and maybe just give us an historic context for where you had particular success?","Mark Parker","Clearly, the Olympics are a great sport moment for the world, but certainly for NIKE. These global events at this scale, the Olympics and the World Cup really stand above and beyond all sports events. And for us, there's an opportunity to really bring our best product, the best innovation, our best storytelling out, serve the athletes at the highest level. The expectations I think on NIKE are extraordinarily high, as they should be. I think this year we will not disappoint.","I feel incredibly confident and excited, frankly, about the innovation pipeline, what's in the works, excited about sharing some of that later in the fiscal year with everyone, but I think this Olympics will be one of the best, if not really the best ever for NIKE. I've never seen an innovation pipeline so full and we will be ready. First and foremost, for the athletes but also the consumer and the shareholder, I think everybody is going to benefit from our performance at the Olympics.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Maybe just a follow-up on pricing, can you update us on how much pricing you were able to take this quarter and how we should be thinking about your approach to pricing over the next few quarters?","Andy Campion","Sure, I'll take that one, Lindsay. In the first quarter -- we do not report that number at this stage, but in the first quarter, our pricing increases were about what you have seen over the recent quarters. So, we continue to see average gross selling price growing in the low to mid-single digit range. You see that in our futures. So, that is also a proxy for that rate.","The way we think about pricing, I think we start first with the consumer. Our approach is to enhance the price value equation for consumers with innovation, design, inspiration and increasingly, service, that expands that average gross selling price.","We have not seen any resistance to that from consumers overall. Certainly within our broad portfolio there are greater opportunities than in other areas. But we've seen consumers demonstrate a willingness to trade up for the innovation, design, inspiration and service that we're bringing.","Operator","And the next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","I might have missed it. Did you give the comp-store sales in North America? And I apologize if I did miss that.","Andy Campion","I'm not sure that we did. But comp-store sales in North America were low-single digits in the quarter.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And I'm trying to correlate that I guess the EBIT margin in the U.S. was a little lower and you talked us through some of the inventory. I'm trying to think if that's related to some of the inventory clearing activities, the slight deceleration in the same-store sales number in North America. And I guess maybe if you think that the EBIT margins will still expand after you guys finish getting the DC up and running and get through some of this West Coast inventory.","Andy Campion","I think your inference is correct. The flow of inventory can impact revenue growth at the store level, certainly in the near term. Obviously, as we work to expeditiously clear some inventory that will also impact margin.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then just a question on -- as we think about your direct business and your e-commerce business, obviously it's been a great growth business for you. But maybe if you look at a single category, running or basketball just as an example, can you talk a little bit how you balance the strategy there as far as what product you want presented on your own e-commerce site versus what you choose to have presented on your wholesale partners' site? ","Even if you think about some of your pinnacle distribution which is I know a big focus for you on your own sites. How do you think about the difference and what product is best represented where? And how we should think about the overlap between the two?","Trevor Edwards","I think as we said a number of times, we really view ourselves as being a better retailer so we can be a better wholesale partner. So, what we do is we actually drive what we call our integrated marketplace strategy. And that is a sense of working to differentiate the points of distribution through some of our wholesale partners, through some of the concepts that we have, whether it's House of Hoops with Foot Locker or it's the Chelsea Collective we're doing with The Finish Line. All of those are opportunities for us to provide really great different experiences there.","When you go online, our Business continues to grow really at an accelerated rate. And certainly, we're seeing a dimension of the Business, particularly the women's business, is growing at a faster rate than our overall business and also our men's business. That's really where we really see just tremendous growth and that's how we differentiate. It's actually through the concepts that we actually do in the marketplace.","Operator","The last question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jim Duffy","Andy, question for you, the gross margin expansion in overseas regions is impressive given the FX headwinds. Can you talk to some of the factors supporting that? Is pricing a key variable there or are there other dynamics behind it?","Andy Campion","Yes, you're speaking specifically to gross margin or to operating margin?","Jim Duffy","Speaking to gross margin in overseas markets, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, expansion in Europe, in China and in emerging markets. Given the FX headwinds, I find that impressive.","Andy Campion","We\u2019re actually seeing very common trends. And by trends I don't mean fleeting, I mean long-term trends, across the globe. We\u2019re proud of the gross margin expansion that we have delivered consistently over the past several years and we believe we can sustain those longer term and that's not only with respect to select markets, that's really a reflection of our strategy.","Our strategy is to bring innovation to the product and to be premium overall and premium at every price point. So, no, there are not unique factors relative to any particular market. We're continuing to see great demand at these prices which we feel great about because it's reflective of what we're bringing to the product.","Jim Duffy","And to be clear, have you taken any adjustments to prices in overseas markets to try to manage the gross margin?","Andy Campion","In reaction to what's going on from a foreign exchange perspective, not directly. The way we think about it is, we\u2019re very well positioned to deliver growth and profitability, all in, under a wide range of circumstances, including FX volatility.","We have a very sophisticated foreign exchange risk management program and a trading company structure that afford us the time to plan fully and strategically execute the same way we would absent the volatility. It gives us time to do that and to stay on strategy. So, not directly related, of course, in certain inflationary markets, that can have an impact on price. But no, not directly correlated to foreign exchange.","Kelley Hall","Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you joining us on this call and we will talk to you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15721":["NIKE, Inc.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Last quarter, we began our conversation with three consumer insights that are driving today\u2019s marketplace shifts: the appetite for a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, the expectation of superior service and the demand for real-time delivery. To stay ahead of these needs, we\u2019ve done what successful companies do, evolve and lead through a time of change.","We\u2019ve aligned into a new formation that Consumer Direct Offense, just focused on reinventing our business and the industry. And while changing your approach is never easy, NIKE has proven before that when we do, it\u2019s always ignited the next phase of growth for our company. We\u2019ve had to make some tough choices with our teams. We\u2019ve tested and learned and we got better.","Looking back to the creation of the category offense in 2007, we went from being organized against footwear, apparel and equipment to realigning through the eyes of consumers by sport. With the new Consumer Direct Offense, we\u2019re taking that consumer connection one step further. We\u2019re going deeper. We\u2019re connecting more personally to help each individual make the right choice for them. That\u2019s incredibly powerful for a brand that motivates people to do more.","And to make that vision a reality at scale, we\u2019re taking some bold steps. We\u2019re breaking old models and we\u2019re fully realigning our teams to be more personal by adding resources to our fastest-growing cities, editing our lines to create more choice on top-selling products, investing in better data and analytics to sense market shifts faster, activating new product creation teams focused only on speed to market and we\u2019re leading with mobile.","In the last 90 days, we have moved through the final stages of this realignment. Before reviewing what we\u2019ve accomplished, let\u2019s look at the numbers. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were $9.1 billion, flat to prior year on both a reported and currency-neutral basis.","Gross margin was 43.7%, down 180 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share was $0.57, down 22% in the prior year, and we delivered ROIC of 32%. In Q1, we made meaningful progress against our triple-double strategy; 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed. Let\u2019s start, of course, with two times innovation.","The foundation for NIKE success will always be inspiring an innovative product. It\u2019s the source of creative storytelling, it\u2019s how we drive distinction in the marketplace and it\u2019s a competitive advantage under any market conditions. We\u2019ve talked a lot about accelerating both the cadence and impact of innovation.","And in the last few weeks alone, we\u2019ve introduced the lightest and most breathable high-performance NBA Jersey ever, one of the most anticipated sneaker releases of the year with a collection of reconstructed icons called The Ten and basketball innovation that delivers on the right balance of performance and style with a highly-tuned and detail-obsessed Jordan 32 and the LeBron 15 with the new high-strength Flyknit Battle construction and articulated Max Zoom cushioning system.","We know that creating innovation with impact requires more than the launch of a single style. Impact really comes from scale. Air Max is a great example of that this quarter, where energy and performance is being led by VaporMax and where we\u2019ve increased access to high-demand classics like Air Max 97. Stay tuned, we have exciting new Air Max platforms on the way soon.","Our latest cushioning platforms, ZoomX and NIKE React, have been getting strong reviews from the most demanding runners and basketball players. And this spring, we\u2019ll bring the sensation of NIKE React to even more sports and to the streets. A few weeks ago, we unveiled a fully sustainable leather called Flyleather, which is a real game changer. It\u2019s 40% lighter, five times more durable and has an 80% lower carbon footprint than traditional leather manufacturing. You can look for Flyleather versions of our most iconic footwear styles soon.","In apparel, we also have some exciting new developments with Flyknit technology. To push both performance and style, the new Flyknit bra is a great example and just a start. We always rally behind big sports moments. In this quarter, nothing was bigger than NIKE and the NBA. I mentioned the NBA Jersey. We not only unveiled new court \u2013 on-court innovation, we also introduced NIKE Connect, our first step into an era of digitally-connected products. We see great potential ahead to link future product with services and experiences in seamless ways.","There\u2019s also a massive commercial opportunity that comes from working directly with the NBA. With the three most authentic basketball brands, NIKE, Jordan and Converse, we will drive growth for performance products and connect the energy of the NBA to sneakers, style and the culture around the game. That\u2019s the kind of consistency across performance, style and sustainability that we can expect to deliver. And all told, the lineup for the rest of fiscal 2018 is even more impressive, so we can tell better stories, increase demand and accelerate full price sell-through.","One of the topics on everybody\u2019s mind is the overall marketplace, which is why 2X Direct is so important to our growth. One point I want to make clear is that, this approach is about serving all of our consumers globally. It\u2019s more than transforming a developed market like North America. It\u2019s also about accelerating developing markets as well.","Our international business is now over 55% of our revenue, and there\u2019s much more opportunity ahead in our developing markets. That\u2019s why we focus on a market like China, for example, where 2X Direct works so well. With an economy that\u2019s being driven by digital natives, they bypassed old models, naturally blending digital and physical retail and shopping within their social channels.","In contrast, a developed market like North America must embrace change to its legacy retail infrastructure. As the leader, we\u2019re fully committed to energizing and growing the marketplace through both our own NIKE Direct businesses and with strategic wholesale partners. Although it\u2019s a shifting landscape in North America, our industry has key advantages over other retail sectors.","In sport, storytelling expertise and service matter, people need and seek guidance, and for the sport and sneaker consumer, mobile is the first step in any search for the right product. The key is for our experiences to feel special, and that could mean a personal one-to-one interaction, reserving products based on a consumer\u2019s shopping history or as simple as delivering products within hours.","Our vision is for every consumer who engages with the NIKE Brand to enjoy an elevated consistent experience regardless of channel. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working so closely with a select group of our strategic partners to define the new consumer experience together. Our most progressive partners are already testing elevated and digitally integrated consumer concepts. Others are just beginning their acceleration. And with the new commerce partners, we\u2019re really pushing the boundaries of existing models.","Retailers who don\u2019t embrace distinction will be left behind. While the transformation maybe difficult for some, NIKE will lead the industry to come out much stronger. One pilot this quarter, as an example is that, which combines a consumer personalization 2X Direct and 2X Speed and that was our live design experience as a Nike By You Studio in New York.","This will reengage the consumer to generate custom graphics and colors, and we build the shoe onsite and have it ready to take home in an hour. There\u2019s a lot of great learning here that we\u2019re connecting back to our broader membership plans. 2X Speed is coming to life in other ways across the company. On the larger scale, we\u2019re capturing more real-time demand, while delivering end-to-end benefits to our entire product creation cycle.","A few specific examples this quarter from around the world include a quick return T-shirt process with Foot Locker in North America that resulted in higher sell-through and growth in our T-shirt business. In EMEA, an expansion of our replenishment programs with icons like Air Max 90 and Air Force 1 that drove a significant uplift in sales. And our new Asia Express Lane is already making an impact to our business in China, where it\u2019s accelerated our fleets business.","We plan to provide much more dimension of all our growth accelerators at our upcoming Investor Day next month. And we\u2019ll show you in detail how personal and mobile are fueling our transformation into the Consumer Direct Offense, and how we\u2019re creating sustained growth for our company, the industry and our shareholders for years to come.","Thanks. And now here is Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. Let\u2019s start with the financials. As always, my comments are on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, NIKE Brand revenue grew 2% and revenue in our NIKE Direct business was up a 11%, driven by online growth of 19%, new stores and comp store growth of 5%.","Mark mentioned how NIKE evolves and leads through times of change. By leveraging the power of sport, time and again, we authentically connect with consumers through premium innovative product and elevated services led by digital and mobile. Our Consumer Direct Offense accelerates that work through a more personal lens. And by infusing digital in how we bring our brand to life for consumers, we invent new ways to connect more closely with them. It all comes down to serving the consumer completely.","Our ability to connect breakthrough technologies to our brand-defining energy and emotion has us incredibly excited about the future. It\u2019s with this focus that we take the sports industry into the next era of digital.","Now, let\u2019s talk about how that work comes to life through our key categories. First, NIKE basketball. The NBA partnership is now in full force, and we are confident about what it means for us and our consumers. First of all, of course, we are elevating performance through innovation with the lightest and most breathable NBA Jersey ever.","At the same time, the NIKE NBA connected jersey is much more than a uniform. It\u2019s a digitally-enabled jersey that drives a new level of service for fans to tap into the game they love and get insider access to their favorite teams, players and special products. Above all, it\u2019s a premium and personal membership experience that fuels a direct emotional connection and allows us to serve them better.","The jersey experience will unlock a new \u2013 a brand-new world of connection for members. For example, NBA players can now connect directly to fans who own their jersey, sending them personalized exclusive messages instantly to their phones. That\u2019s the future we\u2019re really excited about, both as a brand and as a business.","In basketball footwear, the Kyrie 3 continues to be the number one selling performance basketball shoe. Also, in the quarter, the KD 10 showed incredibly strong sell-through. And of course, NIKE continues to lead in elevating the culture of the game, thanks to our full basketball offense stretching across the spectrum of performance and sportswear. Proving the power of that spectrum is the new Therma Flex Showtime Jacket, the first hoodie to be worn on the court during game time.","The Showtime Jacket celebrates a style of the game by refreshing a beloved apparel icon into a new performance product for athletes on and off the court. Our NBA partnership is inspiring new exciting footwear as well, with eight new NBA exclusive colorways of the Air Force 1 offering just a taste of what\u2019s to come.","Ultimately, we are confident that with this complete offense, we will fuel the game of basketball globally. Of course, the NBA partnership also elevates the Jordan Brand as the Jumpman logo will now be seen on NBA jerseys with a few more surprising spotlights for the Jordan Brand to come. And with the Jordan Brand\u2019s expansion into new countries and new dimensions beyond basketball like women\u2019s footwear, Jordan is setting the foundation for sustainable long-term growth.","Global appetite for the brand remains extremely strong. For example, in Greater China, new expressions of the Jordan Brand like the Jordan 1 Retro High Flyknit have been incredibly successful. That said, in North America, within the retro side of the business, we\u2019re managing the cadence of our launches, while bringing to market fresher stories and expressions that drive demand.","Over the balance of the year, we\u2019re focused on new ways of delivering on the exclusivity and the aspiration that is expected by fans of this iconic brand. In Running, we are leading the way with key products that translate our deep understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovation. The Zoom platform saw strong consumer response from the Pegasus 34 to the Zoom Fly to the Vaporfly 4%, which sold out completely in quarter one.","As we revitalized some of our core footwear running franchises, in just the last three months, Air VaporMax grabbed the number one market share in the United States at the $150 and up price point. The success we\u2019re seeing with the VaporMax is lifting our entire air platform. And it underscores that when we deliver performance innovation and distinction, there\u2019s always demand at a premium price.","Meanwhile, our sportswear category continues to impress. In Q1, NIKE Sportswear\u2019s momentum resulted in the largest revenue quarter ever. Thanks in part to the iconic styles, such as the Presto and the Air Force 1.","Our women sportswear product like the Cortez and the Air Max Jewell also seen strong response in the market. And we continue to fuel growth through digital, with sportswear growing high double digits on nike.com. The sportswear category is also a great way to bring to life our key city approach, where we create energy with consumers in the most influential hubs of sport and style.","Now, as Mark mentioned, this past quarter in New York, we launched OFF-CAMPUS, a collaboration with Virgil Abloh. There we introduced new energy for 10 of the most iconic shoes, while engaging with those who love the design and function of sneakers.","Overall, our categories highlight what our new formation under the Consumer Direct Offense can accomplish, creating a vision and a journey for consumer that serves them better and more personally. Most importantly, they provide a roadmap for the future. This is particularly true as we leverage this approach to reignite strong momentum in North America. And of course, as we surgically apply the blueprint in all markets, we look to accelerate our already strong international growth as well.","Let\u2019s take a look at these geographies now. In Q1, North America was down low single digits, as we continue to proactively manage the marketplace supply. However, the momentum in sportswear continued, along with new innovations like the VaporMax and the LeBron 15 driving performance distinction for the brand.","Women\u2019s had a powerful quarter with popular premium executions from the Chrome Blush, a new collection of stylish workout gear that led to a strong performance in the market to membership accelerators like the Air Society, a network that serves to connect and empower creative-minded women.","For North America, as we manage the marketplace, we are scaling our new innovations to reignite strong momentum with our strategic partners, such as Dixon Foot Locker, as well as accelerating growth in our own NIKE Direct business. At the same time, we still see a dynamic and promotional landscape, one that is having a pronounced impact on physical retail, especially in light of the continued consumer shifts towards digital. This is exactly why we are focused on elevating those differentiated and better service experience that consumers are voting for.","For example, in our own digital business, in North America, we have a greater opportunity to accelerate growth by editing our assortment and delivering greater depth of the best product that consumers covet. And while we expect to see continued shifts in the broader U.S. marketplace, the solutions are clear. It\u2019s about leveraging the power of our brand, continuing to tell powerful stories that lift up the NIKE Brand and then using that brand strength to drive deeper relationships with consumers as we connect more personally and more directly.","Fundamentally, we are bullish about the long-term opportunity in North America, as consumers continue to accelerate their pursuit for healthy and active lifestyles. We are confident in our ability to extend our leadership position over the long-term and reinvigorate growth in this region.","In our new EMEA geography, we saw results up single digits, driven by sportswear in global football and with strong cross-categorical growth in apparel. We also saw strong energy in JD Sports and Zalando, two strategic partners who are leading the marketplace transformation.","Digital, led by mobile remains a key driver for us in this region. For example, nike.com in London grew 60% over the prior year. Last quarter, we expanded our sneakers out to Europe adding 19 new markets and their performance is outpacing expectations. In EMEA, as in North America, we continue to grow the number of buying members in our ecosystem, fueled in part by a steady refresh of premium products like the Air VaporMax Colorways.","And perhaps most important to this region is our global football business. Along with our New Chelsea and Tottenham partnerships, the continued energy we see with top players like Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo and the upcoming World Cup in Russia, this region is primed for continued strength.","Finally, in Greater China, we continue to see incredible results with revenue growing double digits for the quarter. The breadth and depth of our relationship with the Chinese consumer doesn\u2019t just continue our success in this geography, it accelerates it.","In Q1, we drove incredible sports energy in the market, particularly with our athlete tours. This summer, we brought real heat to the market with visits from Cristiano Ronaldo, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and the NBA \u2013 MVP Russell Westbrook. These tours drove deeper relationship between athlete and their fans throughout the country.","This energy can be felt by the 500 million daily uses on Tmall, where NIKE is the number one sports brand. Just a few months ago, we opened a Jordan door on Tmall, which drove more than 2 million shoppers in the first 10 days, highlighting the tremendous growth we see in this vital retail platform.","To capitalize on this growing market, we\u2019re investing to serve consumers where they shop. For example, in Beijing, celebrating two decades for the Jordan Brand in Greater China, we opened the largest Jordan door in Asia with our partner Tao Shen. Featuring hyperlocal customization, trial-in and services, this retail experience celebrates the brand\u2019s legacy, the culture of the city and most importantly it inspires the future.","Our success in China also offers a reminder that no matter what may be happening in the United States retail, NIKE is positioned for continued sustainable growth. The power and consistency of our global portfolio gives us tremendous confidence for the NIKE Brand going forward.","In the end, at a time when consumers have elevated their expectations, we feel great about where we are. The worldwide strength of our brand, the power of our innovative products and the largest digital presence in our industry gives us the opportunity to serve at a scale and depth that is unmatched.","Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello, everyone, on the call. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we delivered revenue and profitability in line with the expectations that we set for ourselves 90 days ago, despite an increasingly dynamic environment in the U.S. However more important than our financial results in any individual quarter are the actions we\u2019re taking to accelerate our Consumer Direct Offense and how those actions are igniting NIKE\u2019s next horizon of long-term growth.","First, the Consumer Direct Offense is fueling strong momentum in our international geographies, which as Mark noted, now represent over 55% of our total revenue. In many of our developing markets, current marketplace structures are well suited to NIKE serving consumers more personally at scale through our new Offence, China is the best example.","Today, over 90% of our business in China is already transacted through a NIKE branded experiences, digital and physical, both owned and operated through partners. We\u2019re also leveraging close to market manufacturing to enable our Express Lane in China and in other markets across Asia. That is a tremendous platform upon which to accelerate, both our speed and our NIKE Direct initiatives.","In many of our international markets where we are executing this new offence with tailwinds from strong growth in consumer spending, an emerging middle class and increasing participation in sport. While the current platform in a market like China is a great foundation, we nonetheless see tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth by expanding the reach of NIKE branded experiences across key cities and increasingly leveraging digital to better serve consumers across all touch points.","As Trevor highlighted, in Q1, we launched new digital platforms across many of our international markets, including a curated Jordan flagship experience on Tmall, which is China\u2019s largest digital commerce platform and the launch of our sneakers app in 19 new countries across EMEA. Initiatives such as these power nike.com growth of over 40% across our international geographies in Q1.","Second, over the past 90 days, it has become increasingly evident to all that the North America marketplace is undergoing significant transformation. Several quarters ago, we said that the U.S. retail landscape was not in a steady state, but rather would continue to be disrupted by the accelerating consumer shift to digital and more personal brand experiences. We anticipated those shifts and that served as the foundation for our 2X Direct strategy.","That said, those shifts are now profoundly impacting the more undifferentiated dimensions of retail, resulting in store closures, bankruptcies and a promotional environment in the short-term. Amidst this unprecedented disruption in U.S. retail, we have maintained to slightly increase our market share in the U.S. in aggregate across our NIKE Direct and wholesale businesses.","Nonetheless, we are currently acting on category specific opportunities to even better serve consumers. For example, as Trevor noted, in Q1, we created strong consumer demand at a premium price point with the new Air VaporMax platform that crosses over from running to sportswear. We will continue attacking those opportunities with the launch and scaling of new innovative products over the balance of the year. And we are transforming the retail landscape to grow the market and create even further separation long-term.","In our NIKE Direct businesses, growth continues to far outpace the broader marketplace, as we leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience. We look forward to sharing greater insight into our vision for the future of the North America marketplace and how we are executing against that vision at our Investor Day in October.","Third, the Consumer Direct Offense is driving a more sharply focused investment agenda at NIKE. In Q1, we realigned our organization against this new offense and began accelerating the strategic investments required to deliver on our vision. We continue to increase investment in product innovation, and to enhance our speed, we\u2019re investing in the Express Lane and new demand and supply management capabilities.","Finally, as we target doubling our direct connection to consumers, we are ramping up investment in digital capabilities ranging from data science and analytics to machine learning to augmented reality to image recognition and personalization. We will continue to use our unrivalled resources to ensure that NIKE is built to win now and for the long-term.","Now let\u2019s discuss our first quarter results. NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue was flat on a reported and constant currency basis, as strong momentum in our international geographies and in our NIKE Direct businesses globally was offset by a decline in North America wholesale revenue.","First quarter diluted EPS decreased 22% to $0.57, driven by planned gross margin contraction and a higher effective tax rate, which were partially offset by a slight SG&A leverage and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 180 basis points in Q1, primarily driven by 130 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds and to a lesser extent a higher mix of off-price sales. Those factors were partially offset by lower product costs.","Total SG&A was down 1% in Q1, due primarily to an 18% decline in demand creation, driven by prior year investment around key global sporting events, as well as phasing of demand creation spend in fiscal year 2018. The decline in demand creation was mostly offset by an increase in operating overhead, due to costs associated with realigning our organization against the Consumer Direct Offense and continued strategic investments to fuel growth, including investment in mobile to expand our NIKE and sneakers apps globally.","The effective tax rate was a 11.4% in Q1, compared to 2.5% for the same period last year, reflecting the tax benefit of stock-based compensation in the current period under the new accounting standard, as well as a one-time benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter in the prior year.","As of August 31, inventories were up 6%, driven by a higher average cost per unit, primarily due to product mix and to a lesser extent changes in foreign currency exchange rates and growth in our NIKE Direct businesses.","Now, let\u2019s discuss the financial performance for a few of our operating segments. In the first quarter, North America revenue declined 3% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis in line with the expectations we shared last quarter. The decrease in revenue was a function of short-term promotional headwinds in the broader marketplace, which were partially offset by continued growth in our NIKE Direct businesses.","EBIT was flat to prior year as a short-term contraction in gross margin was offset by lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of prior year comparisons. And inventories for the quarter were down 2% compared to prior year, as we continue to manage supply and demand tightly.","In the short to medium-term, we will prudently manage risk as we focus on accelerating a shift in the composition of the market to experiences that consumers are increasingly telling us that they love. Those being digitally-enabled experiences that bring together the best of NIKE\u2019s brand, product and services.","For NIKE, that begins with nike.com, mobile experiences, such as our NIKE and sneakers apps and NIKE-owned stores. Our 2X Direct strategy will extend into the broader marketplace through new experiences that we are creating with strategic partners, such as Foot Locker and DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods that will bring the NIKE Brand closer to our consumer.","Turning to EMEA. Q1 revenue was up 5% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in footwear and apparel and all key categories. We saw high double-digit growth in the UK marketplace and our NIKE Direct businesses, including double-digit comp growth. Normalizing for the comparison against prior year events and the impact of a cyber attack on one of our European logistics providers, currency neutral revenue growth would have been more in line with recent quarterly trends.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 4% and EBIT declined 7%, primarily driven by the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin. In Greater China, we delivered 12% currency neutral revenue growth, with double-digit growth across both footwear and apparel and fueled by our NIKE Direct businesses. We also continue to see strong growth in our NIKE branded experiences with partners and in nearly all key categories. again, we see continued momentum in China over the balance of fiscal year 2018, as well as a tremendous opportunity to deliver long-term growth through our new offense.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 9% and EBIT expanded 6%, as strong revenue growth was slightly offset by lower gross margin, primarily due to significant transactional FX headwinds. Revenue in our APLA geography, which essentially combines our former emerging markets in Japan geographies grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. We recorded multidimensional growth across footwear and apparel, NIKE Direct and wholesale, all key categories and most territories.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 5% and EBIT increased 24%, driven by revenue growth and lower demand creation, following significant investments in the prior year against the Olympics in Brazil.","And finally, Converse revenue declined 16% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, as high double-digit growth in China was more than offset by a purposeful tightening of supply in North America. EBIT decreased 42%, driven by declining revenue, gross margin contraction from higher closeout in North America and SG&A leverage.","I\u2019ll now move on to our outlook. Looking ahead, our overall outlook is generally in line with the guidance that we provided 90 days ago. We see continued strong momentum in our international geographies and we now expect slightly lesser headwinds from foreign exchange net of hedging.","We believe there will be short-term headwinds within the U.S. retail landscape that will dampen growth. NIKE\u2019s primary measure of success in North America in the near-term will be driving growth in our NIKE Direct businesses and through new NIKE consumer experiences with our strategic partners.","As for specific guidance, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth in the low single-digit range, with contraction in our North America geography and Converse to be more than offset by strong international growth. For the full-year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the mid single-digit range. In Q2, we expect gross margin to contract at approximately the same rate we saw in Q1, with FX continuing to be the single largest driver.","For the full-year, we now believe the challenging dynamics in the U.S. retail landscape could result in our gross margin contracting between 50 and 100 basis points versus prior year. For total SG&A, we expect Q2 to grow low double digits. For the full-year, we continue to expect SG&A growth in the mid single-digit range.","We will continue to manage operating overhead prudently, while remaining on the offence investing to: one, drive brand heat and distinction; two amplify our launch of new innovative products; and three, build the capabilities required to enable speed and direct connections to consumers. We expect other income and expense net of interest expense to be approximately $30 million to $40 million in expense in Q2 and $80 million in expense for the full-year.","And finally, we now expect our effective tax rate will be between approximately 15% and 17% for the full-year. We have operated in dynamic circumstances before and in every instance being on the offence and consumer-focused has served us well. Our organization is now realigned against our new Consumer Direct Offence and we\u2019re all energized by the opportunity to ignite yet another horizon of strong sustainable growth in NIKE. We look forward to sharing deeper perspectives into our vision and long-term growth strategy at our Investor Day next month.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.","Robert Drbul","Hi, guys, good afternoon.","Mark Parker","Hey, Rob.","Robert Drbul","I guess, the question that I had just to start is, when you look at the \u2013 like just the revenue expectation for the remainder of the year, what\u2019s giving you guys the confidence in the acceleration throughout the next few quarters to get to that mid single-digit full-year reported revenue growth projection for this year?","Mark Parker","Well, I\u2019m going to jump in first here. First of all, I think it\u2019s the product that we\u2019ve got in the pipeline, what\u2019s coming. I mean, bottom line is consumer votes through the innovation and the product that we create. And I\u2019m very bullish, we\u2019re very bullish on what\u2019s coming down the pipeline.","So we think that will give us opportunity obviously for \u2013 to reenergize some of the growth here in the U.S. market, North America, as well as continue to drop some of the success and momentum that we\u2019re seeing internationally. I think, there\u2019s a lot of good brand energy moments also in the works. And when you boil it down, having energy around products and the brand is the foundation. The obsession we have with the consumer with this new offence that we have in play, I think, you\u2019ll see that come to light in some new and quite dramatic ways.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, and Bob I\u2019ll just add that, as I mentioned, we continue to expect mid single-digit reported revenue growth for the full-year. And the three primary drivers of that are continued very strong international momentum. Two, we see strong growth and some acceleration on our NIKE Direct businesses. And at the same time, we are seeing a bit of a favorable impact on our real dollar growth from the recent dollar weakening.","Robert Drbul","Got it. And then you talked about North American, your North American inventory is down 2%. On the Jordan business, can you break that out for us, and can you just talk about where you think inventories are at the retail partners that you have product at?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, I\u2019ll certainly about the Jordan brand and maybe just give some context there. One thing, I think, the Jordan brand has been incredibly strong over so many years. And it\u2019s certainly been the leading edge of performance, street style and culture. And it\u2019s really inspiring consumers all over the world to really have covet those premium products.","What we\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019re seeing this clear growth in China, which is exceeding 30%, as we connect to a new generation of consumers there. And at the same time in North America, we\u2019re certainly going to continue to manage the cadence of launches, while bringing some fresher stories into the marketplace. And this is where we\u2019re going to really manage in the balance between scarcity and scale at the same time.","So we\u2019re taking all the right steps to make sure that Jordan remains a special and coveted brand, and I\u2019m confident with the areas that we\u2019re \u2013 that what we\u2019re doing. What I\u2019m most excited about with the Jordan brand is, is how strong the brand is with consumers, and it continues to be a great driver of energy and we\u2019ve seen some great product lineups coming through. And with the Jordan 32, that\u2019s coming through, the Jordan 1 Flyknit and the upcoming footwear, we continue to be really excited.","So a lot more is coming there, and I hope that gives you a good context of where the Jordan is.","Andy Campion","And Bob, I\u2019ll just add on inventory. Globally, we\u2019re very pleased with our positioning. There are different dynamics across each region, of course. In the U.S., we have been vigilant and will remain vigilant managing supply and demand. And as you noted that led to a decline of 2% in inventories.","Frankly, that is in part driven by our anticipation of some of this disruption in the retail marketplace, which again we began to note several quarters ago and managed prudently as a result. But we again are very pleased with the inventory position that we have in North America.","Robert Drbul","Got it. If I could just ask one more quick one. With all the focus on the NBA, can you talk a little bit about if you\u2019re more excited to have Kyrie in Boston, or you have Carmelo in OKC with Russell and Paul George?","Andy Campion","Bob, I\u2019m from Cleveland, so I\u2019m going to miss Kyrie. All right. Thanks, Bob. We\u2019ll take our next question.","Robert Drbul","All right.","Operator","Your next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to ask my first question on North America. Andy, last quarter your guidance you talked about North America being down slight for the first-half of the year with an improving cadence to finish off the year up. Could you talk about how you\u2019re in light of the industry disruptions you talked about in your new perspective on the North American market? How we should be thinking about the cadence for North America in 2Q and exiting the year?","Andy Campion","Sure. We do anticipate continued marketplace disruption in North America. And so in the short-term, there are implications of that disruption that will likely be beyond our control, for instance, how certain retailers may be responding to some of these challenges, door closures and the precise timing of those potential discontinuities.","That said, over the course of this year, you\u2019re going to see us embracing as we have been and accelerating the shifts in the marketplace, because our focus has been and always will be on responding to what we\u2019re seeing from the consumer. We see the consumer shifting to digital and to deeper brand connections. And we believe that\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity over the medium to longer-term and actually will fuel some of our growth in the short-term.","So our measure of success in North America in fiscal year 2018 will primarily center around accelerating our direct-to-consumer businesses, and also accelerating the work that we\u2019re doing with our strategic partners to reshape the broader marketplace. But given all of these dynamics just one quarter into the year, it\u2019s unclear and I wouldn\u2019t say precisely where North America will end for the full fiscal year.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, and I\u2019d just probably add that, one area that we know that we\u2019re very confident about is that, it really all starts and ends with a great product. And we continue to feel great about the product launches that are coming up and the brand energy that we create around that. So we\u2019re really focused on scaling those innovations that we\u2019ve currently seeded, whether that\u2019s the Air VaporMax or the ZoomX and React, which clearly has other opportunities across other categories.","We\u2019re also going to continue to elevate the brand to bring the brand to a higher level, so the consumers will absolutely feel the impact of our brands for the remainder of the year. So you\u2019re going to see that kind of come through pretty strong. The other area, I would say is that, we are going to continue to sort of attack in season opportunities using our Express Lane, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been focused to create that capability, so that we can respond with great items like the Air Force 1 or the VaporMax and even on the apparel side.","So while it might not be as easy for you to see all of the momentum that\u2019s in the marketplace, I can certainly say, when you dive in deeper, we can see the momentum when you really \u2013 when we really focus on that direct connection that we have with consumers whether that\u2019s in our direct retail or when that you\u2019re coming to one of our partners. So that\u2019s how we, let\u2019s say, a better read on the underlying momentum that\u2019s actually going on in North America.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Got it. But to clarify, is there any, as we think about sort of 2Q for North America, are you looking for it to be consistent with what we saw in 1Q better or worse as far as revenue goes?","Andy Campion","Yes, we \u2013 as we said on the last call, Lindsay, we expect \u2013 we expected and we continue to expect a slight contraction in the first part of the year. As Trevor noted, we have some things in store from a product innovation and from a marketplace perspective with our direct-to-consumer businesses and with our partners who are increasingly coming to us to help them also reshape the consumer experience recognizing our deep connection as a brand and leadership position with consumers.","So we\u2019ll update you on the outlook over the balance of the year. But again, as I said, it\u2019s a little early in the year to be overly precise about where North America will land based on some of the dynamics.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay, got it. And then my second question is just on, you guys have talked about the significance of keeping the in line channel clean. And I think, Amazon Marketplace makes that challenging, because a lot of three key products from unlicensed dealers ends up there \u2013 can end up there are markdown. Do you expect your new partnership with Amazon will allow you to manage the visibility of unlicensed products on marketplace?","Mark Parker","Well, I\u2019m not going to go into that level of detail. I will say that pilot that we\u2019ve been running with Amazon is still in the early stages. And what we\u2019ve seen so far is progressing actually quite well, excited about the possibilities going forward.","We\u2019ve proven, I think, through our ability to create some real great success with other consumer-oriented digital partners like Tmall and Zalando that there isn\u2019t a real opportunity here, and we\u2019re excited about where that can go with Amazon. It\u2019s still early yet, not much more I can share with you today, but look forward to, as Andy said, on another topic to sharing more at the investor meeting and as the pilot progresses.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Lindsay. Now we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator?","Operator","Your next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Mark Parker","Yes, good afternoon, Omar.","Omar Saad","I wanted to \u2013 thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some of Mark\u2019s, I thought kind of interesting comments about around retail and the need to change and embrace change, and you alluded to some new commerce partners doing some innovation \u2013 innovative things there. And maybe you can expand on that and kind of some extent without pointing fingers talk about how you expect the landscape to change, and what NIKE\u2019s role will be in the coming years?","Mark Parker","Well, first of all, I think, it\u2019s important to distinguish between some of the near-term dynamics, as compared to the longer-term shifts and consumer preferences. The good news from a backdrop standpoint is that consumers I think are really increasingly passionate about leading an active healthy lifestyle, and that\u2019s obviously in North America, but around the world. And I think the rise of digital, mobile and social, that\u2019s amplifying the influence of sport on culture.","So that\u2019s all good news and that continues to be the case. There\u2019s always that shift that takes place back and forth naturally between sportswear and the performance side of the business. And we\u2019re seeing a real symbiotic relationship between those two sides and trying to take advantage of that as best we can. And then there\u2019s the shift with the market landscape and the digital influence is obviously having a profound effect on what that landscape looks like.","We are with the new offense are trying to accelerate that change, not to catch up, but to move ahead of the consumer. And we realize that a really important ingredient there is the partnerships that we create. We mentioned Tmall in China and Zalando in Europe and Amazon is a possibility here, but there\u2019s many others as well.","The wholesale partners we\u2019ve had are making the shift as well to the emphasis on digital as part of their retail profile. And NIKE Direct through our own efforts is becoming a bigger more important part of our overall profile, and I think that\u2019s going to continue. We are with this new offense experimenting with a lot of new ideas at a small scale and looking at taking those ideas to scale as part of this new offense, and that\u2019s creating a lot of energy and excitement within the company.","And honestly, I\u2019d say, that\u2019s newer for NIKE to be pushing as aggressively as we are with experimenting with those concepts ourselves and then with partners. We\u2019re definitely wired in the same way.","Andy Campion","And Omar, to add maybe a few examples, since we announced the strategy, a number of the examples of what Mark just spoke to are expanding our sneakers and Nike+ apps globally from North America to Europe and Asia, partnership with Nordstrom, dedicated NIKE in Nordstrom page for women on their app and in-store experience, the pilot with Amazon that Mark mentioned, new Sneaker Boutique in London.","And then looking ahead to our Investor Day without going into too much detail in this call, but we\u2019ll be sharing some new experiences relative to nike.com, as well as membership experiences that we believe are very much in line with where the consumer is headed and will accelerate growth in North America, but also beyond, as well as some physical experiences that we think could create compelling environments at retail, both owned and with our strategic partners. So stay tuned maybe for a little bit more tangible insight into these themes at Investor Day.","Omar Saad","Great. And then one quick follow-up. You made a comment around the lifestyle kind of footwear opportunity going deeper, with \u2013 deeper selection within the certain \u2013 within the key styles. Where are we on that curve? It feels like that\u2019s a big opportunity for the brand, given its heritage, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s expressing itself in the inventory that\u2019s at retail. How should we think about that side of the business? You just \u2013 you also just kind of mentioned that it\u2019s really getting more tied \u2013 closely tied to the performance side as well?","Mark Parker","Yes, there is a real, as I said, it\u2019s kind of a symbiotic relationship between performance and sportswear. We don\u2019t look at it quite as black and white as two separate categories. These are dimensions of the product that kind of intersect and overlap one influences the other. I think it\u2019s clear that the consumer voting today is looking for authentic performance styles, but in styles that are maybe less overtly athletic and more acceptable from a street standpoint.","And that doesn\u2019t mean that performance and innovation is any less important, in fact, it creates distinction for us in the sportswear space. And that\u2019s our unique strength of NIKE is that we have that authenticity and performance that we can then translate and express on the sportswear side of the business. And that\u2019s where consumers are focusing and that\u2019s a major shift for us as well and how we \u2013 even how we finish and how we detail our performance product.","Trevor Edwards","I\u2019d just add. Certainly, I think, a great example is the Air VaporMax. And I think what we have done with that is, we focused more on that particular style and we have constant variations of that product coming through. So that\u2019s what with them. When we speak about the EDIT to AMPLIFY, that\u2019s what we mean, which is to take a style, focus more, give the consumers more reasons to actually buy that product and certainly come in and give different consumers other dimensions, so they can connect.","So we\u2019re seeing that actually work really well. So we\u2019re seeing that. We know that on the sportswear side and we know it on the performance side. For us, as Mark said, it really plays on both styles. So it\u2019s really about creating an amazing product and then dimensionalize it, so that the consumer has more opportunity to connect with that. And when we do that and we storytell it, we see it drive incredible demand in the marketplace.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Omar.","Omar Saad","Thanks. That\u2019s it.","Nitesh Sharan","Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thanks. Hello, everyone.","Mark Parker","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy","My question around the transition to the more Consumer Direct Offense, even as you push towards implementation of the strategy, we\u2019ve seen direct-to-consumer and e-commerce growth rates flow some. Andy, I think, you mentioned expectations for accelerating growth in direct contemplated in the full-year expectations. Are there unique compares to call out in the first quarter? And then can you give us a preview of some of the key drivers to reaccelerate growth as the year unfolds?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, I\u2019ll hit that first, and I\u2019d say that, we continue to see strong growth in our digital business, and it was up 19% for the quarter. As we pointed out, the international piece of that was actually growing at a faster rate, and so that\u2019s what we are seeing. We think there\u2019ll be continued expansion within the international business, so we\u2019ll continue to see that level of growth, because we\u2019re expanded things like our sneaker apps to get to more consumers and more countries in the marketplace.","Domestically, one of the areas that we are focused on is allocating deeper assortments of our best products on our sites. So whether it\u2019s on nike.com, or it\u2019s on the X, we\u2019re going to drive a greater focus like we just spoke about on the key styles that we know that the consumers love. And so that\u2019s a clear focus. When we speak about Edit To Amplify, we\u2019re going to apply that very directly to our own nike.com and on the apps.","In addition, we are working to make sure that we can have great data where we\u2019re leveraging and reading the marketplace at speed at the consumer speed. So we can bring even some more great items through our Express Lane. And so as we look at it all in all, you\u2019re going to see much more about this at the Investor Day. But the point here is that, we continue to expect that digital will outpace the every other dimension of the marketplace. And we\u2019re certainly putting the right focus and energy to ensure that we deliver that to our consumers.","Andy Campion","And Jim, I\u2019d just add. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this very straightforward three-pronged strategy is really driving focus within our investment agenda and not just focus, but acceleration. We still have quite a number of untapped opportunities leveraging data science and analytics, personalization. You can imagine what we would do with image recognition, as a NIKE Brand and the icons that we have.","And we have been accelerating our investment in that regard. We\u2019ve both built capabilities and acquired and will continue to do so. And then again, just to reiterate what Trevor said, we will give you some perspective into how some of that comes to life and in terms of membership and our overall digital experience at our Investor Day.","Jim Duffy","Okay, very good. It seems a lot of good opportunity from segmentation as it relates to Direct specific to the North American marketplace and your transformation there, are you anticipating any proactive reduction in distribution in North America?","Trevor Edwards","I think, as we\u2019ve really spoken about, we\u2019ve continued to say that the consumer is clearly moving to the distribution that is differentiated, that is providing them a clear reason for why they have to go whether that\u2019s online or at a physical store. So the partners that don\u2019t shift in that landscape, that don\u2019t quite create a clear proposition for consumers to come with will clearly shift away from those as the consumer shifts away from those.","And so, our intent is to make sure that we are serving the consumers in the best way that they would expect in the marketplace. And so that\u2019s going to create some shifts and we\u2019re going to make some decisive decisions to make sure that we\u2019re meeting that demand where the consumer would expect it.","Andy Campion","Yes, I\u2019d just add that, while one of the primary shifts is the consumer shift to digital. The consumer is also telling us, as Trevor and both Trevor and Mark noted, that deeper connections with brands and translating that, that means a higher level of service expertise advice that only a brand like Nike could provide are what are really punching through. And we\u2019ve had a number of partners both North America and globally come to us to join forces and thinking about what a vision for those types of experiences that really bring the NIKE Brand closer to the consumer through that distribution might look like.","As for your question about dimensions of the market, that may contract or decline. We are very proactively thinking about those that translates into everything from how we manage risk from a credit perspective just also as well as in terms of how we manage growth with some of those more undifferentiated aspects of retail. We do anticipate a shift, again, we\u2019ll talk more about this at our Investor Day. But what we\u2019re really focused on is what the shift is toward more so than what the shift is away from.","Mark Parker","But let me add, as we shift towards we will definitely shift away, though it\u2019s not \u2013 everything is not equal here. I just want to close on that by saying that the obsession that we have in creating that distinction, that retail ourselves and with our partners is making us faster, it\u2019s making us more personal. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re obsessed with right now, that\u2019s our focus. So those are the partners that will definitely move forward with us as a company as a brand.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Jim.","Jim Duffy","Thank you.","Nitesh Sharan","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane","Hi, thank you for taking my question. There seems to be a good degree of discounting on the market both in apparel and footwear. And I think even one of the major retailers is talking or mentioning the words price war. So I wondered how that pricing is being managed during this period of disruption? And how do you retrain the customer to accept higher ASPs once inventory is worked through and the disruption is stabilized?","Trevor Edwards","Yes, obviously, for us investing in our brand and building relationship with athletes and consumers has always been our top priority. And it really goes without saying, we\u2019re very mindful to make sure that we are protecting our brands and importantly strengthening the brand over the long-term. And one clear lever is map and we\u2019re \u2013 and particularly in the backdrop that you have right now going on in the United States.","And we \u2013 so we recently spent a lot of time with our partners and we\u2019ve tightened up our map policy with our retailers and you\u2019ll see that go live very shortly. And we expect it will have a positive impact on the brand and the businesses over the balance of the year and beyond.","So that\u2019s clearly a very important piece for us. But at the same time, we will continue to make sure, we\u2019re investing energy in driving our brand at the highest levels and making sure that consumers can get access to the best products. So that\u2019s a really important piece, because we believe that there is a great demand out there for full price.","Kate McShane","Okay. Thank you. And if I could just follow-up with an unrelated question with regards to the supply chain. In terms of what progress you made during the quarter and finding more efficiencies and speeding up the supply chain? And it also sounds like maybe some of those investments now are benefiting the gross margin line?","Andy Campion","Yes, we will actually talk more about this at the Investor Day. But let me just say that the obsession or the fixation we\u2019ve had on the opportunities around man rev continue to be a central point for us, but we are seeing the effect on the bottom line as well, product cost reductions, more efficiencies in manufacturing we\u2019re taking that to scale, and then we\u2019re seeing some of those really showing up in our cost reduction or product cost reductions as well. And then a lot of this has to do with our Speed initiative, our 2X Speed.","So the investments we\u2019re making in manufacturing revolution are really helping to support our Express Lane efforts. So there\u2019s a cost benefit, but there\u2019s also a speed to market benefit. And we\u2019re looking at optimizing both directly and then obviously through our relationships with partners like Flex.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Kate.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Nitesh Sharan","Operator, we\u2019ll take our last questions please.","Operator","The last question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just given the comments on the retail disruption at the same time that you\u2019re referencing the North American inventory control, can you just any color on how you view that off-price sales penetration heading over the year and maybe the impact on the margins?","Andy Campion","Yes, similar to some of the remarks we made, I think that the most important thing to keep in mind is, as we look out over the next several years, we see a bigger and more stable premium marketplace in North America. The consumer trends are telling us that on many different dimensions folks leading a much more active lifestyle. The expansion in media, both social media and traditional media, coverage around sport and the energy around sport, and that\u2019s translating into a full price, healthy business, and sell-through in many dimensions of our business.","As Trevor noted, the Air VaporMax is a shoe well above $150, $160, up into the $180, $190 range. And as we continue to release that product in different colorways with different iterations, the sell-through is extraordinary. And so we really look at the promotional environment in the near-term as a discontinuity. And the result of the consumer-led disruption more so than a trend or something systemic relative to athletic footwear and apparel.","As I mentioned, we can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sure anybody could predict with complete precision what some of those discontinuities will be. But as Trevor noted, what we\u2019re really focused on is ensuring that we are not in that dynamic, the dynamic we\u2019re creating is tremendous brand impact and energy around sport. And again, as we\u2019ve all mentioned, you\u2019re going to see us bring some new innovation that again the Air VaporMax and other styles proof consumers love when you bring it even in an environment like this.","So I do believe that that promotional marketplace will put some pressure on pricing and off-price in the short-term. But we definitely believe that that is a short-term impact. And that as we work as our retailers and our industry work through that and we help them work through that with new experiences and energy will be back to a full price led marketplace in the medium and long-term.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, and just to maybe give a couple of finer points to there, Andy spoke about certainly the VaporMax and the Air platform how that continues to really hold its price. What we\u2019ve also understand is, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our NIKE React, which is clearly a new technology that has great opportunity across all the categories, so you\u2019ll see us do that, and ZoomX, another example of technology.","So what we\u2019re seeing is that, the consumer will pay for when they see sort of great value in the product and for us it\u2019s actually giving value through a great innovation. And so, we believe that is one of the, let\u2019s say, counterbalances to a marketplace that seems to head down to a more promotional aspect. So our task is to continue to give the consumer greater value.","Trevor Edwards","And to leverage the demand that we created at the premium price points through innovation by taking that down into broader platform opportunities at the same time, and that\u2019s a big opportunity for Nike.","Simeon Siegel","Can I just ask on that point, so given the savings this quarter about the demand creation, any thoughts on how that looks throughout the year?","Mark Parker","Well, we certainly expect to continue to invest in the brand. I think, one of the greatest advantages we have is our brand. And it\u2019s not on our balance sheet, it\u2019s not in our P&L. What you do see in our P&L is the spending associated with creating energy around key sport moments, innovation launches.","And I think, as Trevor noted, you will likely see a stark contrast from us, as compared to some of the dynamics in North America. And then internationally, again, where we have tremendous momentum, we\u2019ll continue to invest to fuel that growth and equity in our brand.","Trevor Edwards","Yes. And obviously, you\u2019ve got great sporting events coming out. You\u2019ve also got the World Cup coming up in the back-end of the year. So, you can expect that consumers will absolutely feel the impact of our brand, as the balance \u2013 as we go through the balance of the year and beyond.","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you, Simeon. I think, that\u2019s all the time we have today. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you again in another month at our Investor Day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

In the event you have additional questions not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your help with this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another outstanding quarter for Nike, and it demonstrates our ability to continue to drive strong, profitable, sustainable growth.","For the quarter, Nike Inc. revenues increased 15% to $7.4 billion. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points, diluted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.74, and we continue to deliver strong returns as our ROIC reached 27% and we increased our dividend for the 13th year in a row.","Delivering results like these requires a sharp focus on our growth opportunities, making disciplined choices to invest in those areas with the highest potential for return. The world of sport is constantly evolving as is the environment in which we operate. That opens up new opportunities for Nike every day.","But to identify and capitalize on those opportunities, we have to stay nimble. We need to balance making critical investments with managing risks, whether they be currency headwinds, commodity cost fluctuations, or an evolving political landscape.","The word \u201cbalance\u201d is key. To capture the tremendous growth potential we see for Nike, we must invest, and a targeted approach to making the right investments helps us drive growth and manage risk. It\u2019s a winning strategy that has allowed us to deliver profitable, sustainable growth quarter after quarter, year after year.","You know, I\u2019m often asked how we can continue to grow, how there could still be places where Nike isn\u2019t fully distributed. When I look at the potential in our business, I actually see the exact opposite. The more we focus on knowing, connecting, and serving the consumer, the more opportunity I see for growth and when we capture those opportunities by leveraging the power of the Nike Inc. portfolio. ","Let\u2019s take apparel as an example. Today, Nike is one of the largest apparel brands in the world. But as we look up and down our apparel business, we see tremendous opportunity, from premium performance apparel to signature sportswear styles, from running, to basketball, to global football, from North America, to Western Europe, to China, from the Nike brand to Brand Jordan, to Converse, across men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and young athletes.","And within each of those dimensions, we segment further and further to find even more opportunity to drive growth. Our diverse set of brands, categories, geographies, product types, and distribution channels provides a competitive advantage that is unmatched, and our relentless focus on serving the consumer allows us to see ever-expanding opportunities for growth within our existing portfolio.","Trevor will talk in more depth about our growth drivers in the Nike brand, but let me highlight two additional areas that we\u2019ve been investing in to accelerate growth in our business. First, our women\u2019s business. In October, I was honored to be a part of a powerful moment for Nike Women\u2019s. ","We introduced our spring\/summer 2015 collections in New York City with 27 of the world\u2019s top athletes. It was amazing to have Grand Slam winners, world record holders, and Olympic champions all in one place at the same time. ","We were also there to spotlight an important cultural shift that\u2019s happening, and sport is powering women\u2019s lives like never before. We see it every day in our digital community of 65 million women, and women are driving a larger global movement of health and fitness. They\u2019re running in record numbers, they\u2019re engaging in new kinds of workouts and athletic activities at a rapid pace, and that means they have new needs, which are creating new insights and inspiring new products and services.","And by staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we\u2019re driving growth in our women\u2019s business. There is tremendous energy in women\u2019s and a significant opportunity for us in this important business. ","Second is our digital strategy. We see digital as an integrated ecosystem of digital communication with consumers, digital products and services to inspire and motivate, and of course ecommerce. All three dimensions work together to deliver premium personalized experiences for our consumers and drive growth for Nike.","Consumers are engaging with technology in new ways. It\u2019s transforming the sport experience and the way in which we connect with them. Athletes are getting a better understanding of themselves and their potential than they\u2019ve ever had before, and we\u2019re able to connect personally with more consumers than ever.","Digital is where the consumer is today, and where they will be going forward, and we\u2019re excited about the potential of leveraging digital technology to further drive innovation and continue to deliver increasingly seamless digital experiences for our consumers. ","Going a little bit deeper on ecommerce, it continues to deliver, with growth of 65% for the quarter. Our investments in infrastructure are really paying off in this space. We\u2019re making it easier for consumers to buy our products and we\u2019re presenting the brand in the most premium way.","With opportunity for even more innovation and expansion into new markets, this really is just the beginning of what\u2019s possible for Nike.com. Ecommerce is, without a doubt, one of our biggest and most important growth opportunities, and it will be for years to come.","One of the reasons I\u2019m so confident in our growth potential for Nike.com, and really, across our entire portfolio, is because Nike is relentless. We are always striving to deliver something better for the athlete and the consumer. We are, in a word, obsessed, and that obsession fuels innovation. Since day one, we\u2019ve looked to athletes as a source of inspiration, and that hasn\u2019t changed.","What has changed is the pace at which athletes demand more of themselves. As they strive for new levels of performance, they demand products that help them get stronger, faster, and more agile, really better in every way. ","And that pushes us to deliver innovative products and services that go beyond what anyone thought was possible. And it requires us to accelerate the pace of our innovation, to improve not only what we make, but how we make it.","Today, we have tools and resources available to us that would have been unimaginable five years ago, from 3D printers, to high-performance knitting machines, to advanced textiles, just to name a few. ","And we\u2019re not only focused on the quantum leaps in product innovation. Equally exciting is our focus on continuously evolving our existing and proven performance technologies. Nike Air continues to be reinvented, as does Nike Free, Lunar, and Tech Fleece. We create products that are completely new and we make our existing products better.","We introduce game-changing innovation in every category in every global market, and at scale. No one else can deliver innovation like Nike can, and that is our greatest competitive advantage as a company.","Our ability to leverage and scale this innovation through compelling concepts and technologies across our portfolio of brands and categories, geographies and distribution channels, and on the world\u2019s best athletes and teams, is driving tremendous growth for Nike around the world.","And while I\u2019m proud of the results we\u2019re reporting today, I assure you that we are hungry, we\u2019re driven, and we are laser focused on the future. Our success lies in our ability to see what is possible and then relentlessly pursue it, to stay aggressive always, and remembering, as we say every day here at Nike, the consumer decides.","Our business has breadth and depth at a scale that is unmatched in our industry, and we have the leadership team and the strategy to drive sustainable growth. That is what you\u2019ve seen from Nike in the past and that is what you can continue to expect from us going forward. ","Thanks, and now here\u2019s Trevor. ","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the tremendous momentum of the Nike brand. Let\u2019s take a look at the numbers. ","On a constant currency basis, Nike brand revenue grew 17%. All geographies grew in the quarter, as did all categories except golf. The Nike brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by all concepts. Notably, our online business continues to be very strong, with 66% growth in the quarter, and global futures are up 11%, even as we anniversary the strong World Cup order in the prior year.","The reason we deliver strong growth across our geographies and categories time and time again is clear. We never lose focus on serving our consumers. As always, these strong relationships are fueled by the power of our brands and the category offence. As we\u2019ve discussed before, the category offense deepens our relationship with consumers by serving them through the lens of sport that matters most to them, as they compete, train, and express themselves. In other words, we live where they live.","What\u2019s more, only Nike has the broad portfolio and global reach to execute this strategy around the world. We know what works, and we know how to identify large, untapped opportunities, develop innovative products and marketing strategies on a global scale, and execute them effectively in each marketplace around the world. ","Now let\u2019s look at two examples of the category offense at work: basketball and our women\u2019s business. It\u2019s no secret why we succeed in basketball. Our relationship with the world\u2019s best athletes provide us great insight that produce incredible product innovation, and these products, in turn, excite and inspire consumers all over the world.","Q2 was the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our basketball category. Our position as the world\u2019s leader in basketball was supported by strong sell through of key Nike basketball footwear styles like the LeBron 12 and the KD7. And the Jordan brand remains a powerful growth driver, with performance products like the Air Jordan 29 as well as rereleases like the Retro Jordan 6.","You can see this energy come to life with growth throughout the marketplace, from performance to sportswear, and across footwear and apparel styles. Retail destinations like our own DTC stores or the House of Hoops, with Footlocker, remain go-to locations for those who love the sport.","And momentum in this category is not limited to North America. We\u2019re also seeing great consumer response to basketball retail destinations in Europe and China, which help us realize the significant potential of these growing markets.","Now let\u2019s take a look at the women\u2019s business. As Mark mentioned, the momentum we\u2019re seeing in this business is incredible. The energy was certainly visible at our recent women\u2019s event in New York. I will never forget the thrill of seeing some of the world\u2019s greatest athletes, including Li Na, Allyson Felix, and Skylar Diggins discussing their successes and the power of women in sports. It was truly inspiring.","Look forward, we remain on the path to meet our goal of a $7 million women\u2019s business by fiscal year 2017. We achieve this by making deep connections with consumers in the areas most important to them: running, training, and sportswear. ","Our strategy means connecting and serving millions of women through the digital platforms, elevating the online and in-store shopping experiences, offering premium product assortments that drive real growth and as always, leading with innovative products. ","These products offer consumer great fit and amazing style like never before, and they\u2019re presented at retail in a compelling and captivating way. Great product examples from the quarter include the Nike Pro Base Layer collection and the continued strength of the Nike Pro bra as well as performance inspired style of the Air Max collection.","What\u2019s more, we opened women\u2019s-only Nike stores in Newport Beach and Shanghai to strong consumer response. Ultimately, we see Q2 as just the beginning of great things to come in our women\u2019s business.","Now let\u2019s turn to a few of our key geographies. In North America, we delivered another great quarter with Q2 revenue growth of 16%. That growth proves yet again the success of our strategies. For us, North America offers a roadmap for other geographies as we continue to deliver strong growth in this critical marketplace.","By developing deep consumer relationships through the category offense, and delivering segmented and differentiated retail destination, we have driven sustained, profitable growth even in more developed markets where we already have significant market share.","Our brand continues to resonate with consumers in North America, which is driving growth in nearly every category. Basketball, sportswear, and men\u2019s training have continued to perform well, and we\u2019ve seen clear acceleration in our women\u2019s and young athletes businesses.","Working with our partners, we\u2019ve continued to see growth as we further transform the marketplace. In executions such as the Field House, with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, the Track Club, at the Finish Line, and the young athletes concept Fly Zone with Foot Locker.","Additionally, our DTC business has continued to expand, with an increase of 18% in Q2. By providing the products and the experiences our consumers demand, we expect to continue to drive growth in our largest geography.","In greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q2 revenue growth of 21% reflects our plan to deploy a more consumer centric distribution strategy, and this approach is definitely working. The Nike brand is exceptionally strong with consumers in China, and we hold the number one market share position in both athletic footwear and apparel.","Our leadership position as a premium performance brand allows us to present the innovative products in the most compelling retail destinations in the marketplace. As a result, our whole partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanding profitability in the doors that have been reprofiled. ","This success mirrors the exceptional numbers we\u2019ve seen in our own doors. We\u2019ve driven this return to growth by focusing on increased retail productivity, differentiating our point of distribution and creating more focused consumer experiences. This allows us to provide a narrow but deep product assortment in each door. This better serves the consumer and also allows us to maintain the healthy inventory levels we are currently seeing in the market.","We remain confident that we have the right strategy to drive a sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long term. Now let\u2019s turn to the emerging markets, which delivered 13% revenue growth in the quarter, every territory except Mexico and Korea, with five of them growing at a double digit rate. ","We also saw strong performance coming from sportswear and basketball categories in the quarter. As we\u2019ve discussed, inventory levels in Mexico remain high. This is primarily the result of an inconsistent flow of product to our wholesale partners following transition issues with our distribution center in the early fiscal year 2014.","We continue to work aggressively to clear excess inventory and expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year 2015. As with every territory in the world, our goal is to operate a healthy [pull] market, and we believe we are taking the necessary actions to achieve that goal in Mexico.","In Brazil, Q2 revenue growth slowed, as volatile macroeconomic conditions make for a more challenging environment. That said, we see this environment as an opportunity to do what we do best, accelerate our transformation of the marketplace, fueled by the category offense. The consumer\u2019s passion for sport and the Nike brand remain strong, and we are focused on creating elevated and differentiated retail experiences for our consumers in Brazil, as we have done in North America, Western Europe, and China.","Online executions through Nike.com will serve as the most premium expression of the brand, offering rich product assortments across a broad range of categories. We are also working with our wholesale partners to create compelling destinations at retail, with a focus on our biggest categories: running, football, and sportswear.","Near term, we are working to keep the market healthy in Brazil. We are proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, whilst also swiftly working to clear any excess inventory through the closeout channel. Long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the Nike brand. ","Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at Western Europe. With revenue up 24% in the quarter, we continue to see strong momentum for the Nike brand. The exceptional growth was driven by our relentless focus on the consumer and our work to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense.","We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions, both in our stores and with our wholesale partners, while continuing to flow amazing products into the marketplace. All this combined to expand the market and help us take market share. Wholesale partners like Foot Locker, JD Sports, and Intersport are creating compelling category destinations in cities across the geography that are fueling growth.","And just as we\u2019ve seen in North America, our DTC business in Western Europe also continues to perform very well, delivering 40% growth in the quarter. This resulted in a double digit revenue growth in every territory and strong growth across nearly every category, with sportswear, football, and running leading the way. Western Europe is a perfect example of the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead for the Nike brand to drive long term growth. ","As we finish the first half of the year, the Nike brand has never been stronger. By staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we have driven exceptional revenue and profit growth. While we feel great about the results we\u2019ve delivered to date, we\u2019re never satisfied. Like the athletes we serve, our focus is always on continuing to elevate our performance, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do in the second half of the year and beyond.","Thanks, now here\u2019s Don. ","Don Blair","Thanks, Trevor. You\u2019ve often heard us use the phrase, \u201cNike is a growth company.\u201d Over our history, we\u2019ve delivered sustained growth in revenues, profits, and cash returns to shareholders. The level we\u2019ve delivered in recent years is particularly distinctive in today\u2019s highly volatile and growth challenged environment, but the phrase is more than a description of the results we\u2019ve produced. It\u2019s a key element of our business philosophy.","Nike as a growth company is embodied in the Nike maxims, the principles we use to define our corporate culture. Nike is a growth company means that our potential is continuously expanding, and that the numbers, like the current size of a market or a previous peak profit margin, are only signposts, not limits.","It means we can create growth by investing to build deep personal connections with athletes and consumers, by investing to deliver exceptional product innovations and by investing to create premium integrated marketplaces. And Nike as a growth company means we can leverage our global portfolio and operating capabilities to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, manage risk, and create shareholder value. ","With that introduction, I\u2019ll now recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported revenue for Nike Inc. increased 15%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue increased 18%, as the Nike brand grew 17% and Converse increased 24%.","Also on a currency neutral basis, Nike brand futures ordered grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand for the Nike brand, even as we anniversary robust prior year orders for global football product in advance of the 2014 World Cup.","Excluding global football, total futures order growth this quarter was essentially in line with the numbers we reported last quarter. Specifically, this quarter\u2019s futures growth was led by double digit expansion in North America, Europe, and Greater China, with strong demand across multiple categories including sportswear, basketball, and running.","On a reported basis, futures grew 7%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, Argentine peso, ruble, and yen.","Second quarter diluted EPS increased 25% to $0.74, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a mix shift to higher margin products, continued growth in our higher margin DTC business, and a modest benefit from FX, partially offset by higher product input costs.","Second quarter demand creation spending increased 11%, driven by digital brand marketing, sports marketing, and consumer events around the globe. Q2 operating overhead increased 19%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin and higher cost DTC business, targeted investments in operational infrastructure, and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.","The Q2 effective tax rate was 25.4%, a 20 basis point increase, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions and the benefit realized in the prior period from the U.S. R&D Tax Credit.","These items were partially offset by an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate and the resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions.","Inventories at November 30 were up 11% and remain healthy overall, with the majority of the growth in North America, Europe, and Converse, and driven in part by the expansion of our DTC business.","We continue to focus on inventory management, with particular attention on Brazil and Mexico, where we\u2019re working to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth.","Now let\u2019s take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 16% on both a reported and currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in the basketball, sportswear, men\u2019s training, and women\u2019s training categories.","Direct to consumer revenues grew 18%, driven by 8% comp store sales growth, continued strong growth of Nike.com, and new stores.","On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North America grew 21%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 24% on a currency neutral basis. The growth was broad-based, as every territory increased at a double digit rate. Every key category also grew, led by double-digit growth for sportswear, football, and running. ","On a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 22%. Second quarter EBIT increased 112%, driven primarily by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage.","EBIT growth for Western Europe also benefited from two nonoperating items: a legal charge included in last year\u2019s Q2 results, and more favorable standardized exchange rates that we use for our geography segment reporting. The latter upside was largely offset within the corporate segment of our consolidated results.","Revenue in Central and Eastern Europe accelerated in the quarter, expanding 25% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding Israel, every territory reported double digit revenue growth, and every key category expanded, except action sports.","Despite strong FX headwinds, reported revenue for CEE grew 17%, and EBIT grew 19%, driven by strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. In Greater China, currency neutral and reported revenue grew 21%, led by double-digit growth in sportswear, running, and basketball.","As Trevor discussed, the Nike brand continues to lead the market, and we\u2019re pleased with the results of our work to reset the marketplace for sustainable, profitable growth.","On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT in greater China increased 31%, driven by strong revenue growth and significant gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus. Given the continuing benefits of our strategy to reset the market, we now expect full year FY15 revenue in China to grow at a mid-teens rate.","In the emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, as all territories except Mexico and Korea posted higher revenues. From a category perspective, the growth was led by sportswear, basketball, and running.","Reported Q2 results in the emerging markets geography reflected the translation and gross margin impact of strong FX headwinds, as reported revenue increased only 4% and EBIT decreased 3%.","The reduction in profitability was primarily due to lower gross margin and higher operating overhead for new retail stores. We continue to be confident in the long term growth potential for the territories that comprise our emerging markets geography, and as Trevor discussed earlier, we\u2019re executing plans in each of them to realize that potential.","For Converse, revenue grew 24% on a currency neutral basis, driven by continued strength in existing direct distribution markets such as the U.S., the growth of DTC, and market conversions in Europe and Asia. On a reported basis, revenue increased 21% but EBIT decreased 12%, driven by investments in infrastructure, demand creation, and DTC to enable long term growth.","Over the last 90 days, we\u2019ve seen our business performance accelerate and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of fiscal 2015. At the same time, the dollar has strengthened against most other currencies and the FX markets have been extremely volatile.","While our trading company structure and hedge programs do protect us from some of that volatility, we cannot entirely eliminate all FX risk. Based on what we know today, we expect the net impact of these two factors, the strengthening currency neutral business performance and the downside from the stronger dollar, will net together to deliver full year results largely in line with the expectations we shared 90 days ago.","Specifically, for Q3 we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth of about 3 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low double-digits, with reported revenue growth 2 to 3 points lower.","We expect gross margin for Q3 to expand by about 100 basis points. Growth in our higher margin businesses, including DTC, and strategies to increase average selling prices will continue into the second half of the year. These benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets, and increased FX pressure.","For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. We expect demand creation to grow at a high single to low double digit rate for Q3, and at a high single-digit rate for the full year.","Operating overhead is now expected to grow at a high teens rate for Q3 and the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation, new operating capabilities, and expanded capacity.","We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY15 will be approximately 24.5%.","As you\u2019ve heard from all three of us today, we\u2019re pleased with the results we\u2019ve delivered in the first half of FY15 and the momentum we see in our business. And notwithstanding the volatility we\u2019ve seen recently in the macro-environment, we\u2019re confident we\u2019re on track to deliver strong growth for this fiscal year.","We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] The first question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. ","Omar Saad","I just really wanted to ask a follow up question on the gross margin line, Don. It\u2019s still great expansion year over year. I think maybe you missed your projection for the second quarter a little bit. Kind of wondering, what are the swing factors quarter to quarter near term? Is it FX and input costs, and then if those are the two big factors, we can see FX, but how should we be thinking about oil and some of the other input costs that go in there?","Don Blair","Well, first of all, we gave a range on gross margin and our actual results were really essentially in line with that range. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in gross margin.","As we look forward with gross margin, FX is one of the things that\u2019s changing between the second quarter and where we expect the third quarter to be. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had a very small FX upside in Q2, basically because of our hedge positions. For FY15 Q3, so next quarter, we are expecting that to start turning into a headwind. ","So yes, FX is the major driver. When you look at the underlying fundamentals of gross selling price improvements versus input costs, we\u2019re continuing to make great progress from an operating standpoint on expanding margins. ","Operator","The next question is from Robbie Ohms with Bank of America.","Robert Ohmes","Don, you called out in gross margin one of the drivers as mix shift to higher margin products. Can we get some insight into are you speaking about higher margins on some of the new apparel you\u2019re doing? Or is it certain sneaker styles? What type of products are you mix shifting towards?","And the second question was, I might have missed it, but you guys called out a lot of great things with momentum, but I don\u2019t remember hearing Nike Free, or the word Fly Knit, or running in the U.S., but I just wanted to double check if I maybe missed something on one of those three things.","Don Blair ","So, on your first question, this is a trend that we\u2019ve seen for quite a while now, which is that with the strength of our brand and the flow of innovation we have into the marketplace, we have been essentially trading the consumer up to premium product. And that\u2019s both on the apparel and the footwear side. ","So it\u2019s things like Tech Fleece on the sportswear front in apparel or just generally the performance apparel we\u2019ve seen in running, as well as a number of other performance categories. And on the footwear side, it\u2019s marquee footwear styles, running, basketball, sportswear.","So what this is is that long term trend to building product that\u2019s premium for the consumer and can carry that price premium. And I\u2019m going to hand the second question off to Trevor.","Trevor Edwards ","Yeah, I\u2019ll jump in there. Obviously, as we go through the results, there\u2019s a number of categories and dimensions of the business, so we always try and give you maybe just some different flavors as to how the business is doing. ","So maybe speaking specifically about running, we feel good about the running category. It\u2019s our biggest category and it\u2019s what we always described as we really operate the complete offense. In terms of growth, for the quarter we actually saw mid to high single digit pace growth in the second quarter.","In terms of the growth, it was actually pretty widespread. We saw particular strength in Europe as well as in China. In Europe, both dimensions of Europe, so Central Eastern Europe as well as Western Europe. ","When you dive down specifically into North America, what we have been seeing, which is really across the board, our premium products are doing exceptionally well across the marketplace. And so all the premium products, whether it\u2019s the Structure, the Pegasus, the Lunar Glides, those are all doing really well. ","Where we have opportunity is really more in the lower price points and we are actively working to get onto that, and so we are bringing better products in the marketplace, and we will be doing that. But all in all, we feel very good about our running business across the board, but clearly there\u2019s some opportunity for us to continue to make sure we sharpen our focus along the lines of the complete offense. ","Mark Parker ","As far as the Free and Fly Knit innovation from Nike, as I said before, I continue to be very bullish on both those areas of our innovation agenda. I recently spent time in our advanced R&D looking at some of the new concepts coming down the pipe here, some sooner than later. Very exciting developments in the free category as well as Fly Knit. And we continue to be as bullish as we ever have been on the potential, as far as both those areas are concerned.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","The first one is, I think the China growth, I think you now are looking for midteens. I think that\u2019s an improvement from the prior outlook. And I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of what\u2019s developing there, how everything is going on the footwear side and the apparel side.","Trevor Edwards ","Yeah, great question, obviously. You know, as we\u2019ve always been talking about, we\u2019ve implemented a reset strategy in China, and we feel very confident that the reset strategy is working, as you could see certainly with the growth of 21%. We felt great about that result. We also see futures up 13% as a very good indication that all our strategies are in place and we\u2019re building them into the fundamentals of the business.","And so as you\u2019ll remember, the key to the strategy was making sure that we would drive more profitable and productive retail, and so we\u2019re seeing both of those dimensions really hit. Both were actually increasing the sell through of product, but it\u2019s also at a much more profitable rate. ","So we feel that we\u2019re actually doing all the things that we\u2019ve talked about. We feel very good about the continued trend on the China business. The metrics continue to show that when you look into working with our partners, their doors continue to profile really well. So again, we feel very good and the inventories in the marketplace are very clean. So all the dimensions of those businesses will suggest that we will continue to see continued strong growth in China.","Mark Parker ","I\u2019ll just add that the strength of the brand in China is tremendous. The response to the product that we\u2019ve introduced is also quite strong. We\u2019ve obviously made measures to increase our productivity at retail, and we\u2019re leveraging that across both our own doors and our partner doors in China. So we\u2019re very excited about all of that. And then as Trevor said, the inventory situation is actually quite good.","So we\u2019re bullish on the opportunity, and I\u2019ll mention too that we just launched dot com here less than about seven months ago in China, and the response there has exceeded our expectations. So that\u2019s another great opportunity for us. ","Bob Drbul ","And I just have a quick follow up question. Can you just elaborate on the plans, as you think about FY15 versus next year, how are you guys going to comp against the success that the Ducks have had, and the Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Oregon?","Mark Parker ","[laughter] That\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s a tough one to beat. We\u2019re very excited about the football championships, and we\u2019re very happy for whichever Nike team wins. ","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","It seems as if every other global consumer products company is complaining about a very challenging macro dynamic. Outside of the currency issues that you guys highlighted, are there any markets where you\u2019re starting to see the second derivative turn a little bit softer, where you feel a little bit more cautious about or some disconnect between sell in and sell through? Or is your performance really as good as it seems?","Don Blair ","When you say second derivatives, you mean just overall consumer trends?","Lindsay Drucker Mann ","Yeah.","Mark Parker ","Well, one of the things I\u2019d say, just as an opening, is generally what we\u2019ve found is our product and our brand are really the keys to how successful we are in a lot of these markets. And as long as we don\u2019t see huge moves in the macroeconomics, we believe that we can continue to generate growth in the business. ","And we\u2019ve generally seen that to be the case around the world. There are a few places where we\u2019ve seen some of the macros start to, at least in the near term, affect consumer confidence. Brazil\u2019s an example of that. Certainly we think over time we\u2019ve got to keep a close eye on Russia.","But generally, what we\u2019ve found is our product is one of those things that consumers find ways to continue to buy and as long as we keep the brand hot and the product right and the distribution premium, I think we\u2019ll do fine.","Trevor Edwards ","And maybe just to jump in there too, I would say that we also believe that with the category offense, it provides us an ability to continue to bring innovation on multiple dimensions all the time. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in many of the marketplaces. So we have been able to somewhat, so to speak, buck the trend. ","Having said that, Brazil is clearly one of the markets that we\u2019re continuing to work on, to make sure that we stay ahead of that curve, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re working to accelerate the marketplace and make sure that we continue to implement our category offense more aggressively in that market. ","Lindsay Drucker Mann ","And you\u2019ve talked about a strategy to take sort of ongoing inflationary price increases to offset what you had believed was sort of input cost inflation for an extended horizon. Has the move in commodity markets changed your view on pricing going forward? ","Don Blair ","Well, let me wind back to the first part of that question. We actually are not pricing literally with either inflation or input cost. One of the changes that we made over the last five years or so is really focusing on the consumer as we set price. And really, it\u2019s about the value equation that we\u2019re trying to create with the consumer. ","And so when we bring innovation and brand strength and premium presentation at retail to the consumer, then you can move the consumer to premium prices. So we will obviously keep a very close eye on the consumer value equation. We are managing our entire P&L, including margins and costs and revenue and so on, and so yes, it\u2019s part of the calculus, but the pricing is really focused on maintaining the right consumer value equation in the marketplace.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Trevor, a question for you. Visiting a number of the stores recently, the premiumization of the apparel is very evident. It also appears that the apparel collection is more tightly edited than in the past. Is that accurate? And can you also comment on the impact that you\u2019ve seen on apparel conversion in your direct to consumer, with the directional change?","Trevor Edwards ","Yeah, I think you\u2019re very astute, because absolutely that is what is taking place. I think on multiple dimensions. For instance, if you break into our apparel business and you break it out by segment, certainly you go by the women\u2019s business. Our apparel business is doing very, very well. We\u2019ve tightened the collections down. We\u2019ve made sure that they actually work across the line. So we\u2019ve seen really good strong conversions.","Our apparel business within our own doors does exceptionally well. Our sportswear business, or the example of the Tech Pack, which we think is a great item and collection, actually, that\u2019s working across the business. So we\u2019re seeing strong conversion across.","And one of the things that we\u2019re learning, which I think Mark has always talked about this, which is by being a better retailer, we actually are better with our wholesale partners. So we\u2019re taking that same knowledge of tightening the assortment and making sure that we apply that in the broader marketplace. And so we think that\u2019s actually what\u2019s driving the great growth that we\u2019re seeing. ","Mark Parker ","You know, I will say, we\u2019re known for our footwear innovation. We\u2019re actually accelerating our commitment to innovation in apparel, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to shine, I think, is to continue to really stand out from a performance premium apparel position, and then leverage that across what we talk about as our complete offense.","And we\u2019ve done that, and where we\u2019ve really gotten a lead on that, we\u2019ve seen the consumer response has been actually quite positive. So as an innovation geek, product geek, I\u2019m incredibly excited about applying that even more aggressively to the apparel side of our business.","Operator","The next question is from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. ","Jay Sole","There were some interesting comments in the beginning when you were talking about how you see a big apparel opportunity, how you\u2019re investing in the Nike women\u2019s business and you\u2019re seeing incredible momentum there. At the end of last year, the men\u2019s business was almost three times as big as the women\u2019s business. ","So if we think about it from a big picture perspective, what\u2019s the opportunity to close that gap over time, given the momentum you\u2019re seeing, given the investments you\u2019re making? And can you talk about maybe some structural reasons why the gap can\u2019t be the same eventually?","Mark Parker ","Well, the opportunity I spoke to a little bit in my remarks, we\u2019re seeing a big shift in women\u2019s, just in terms of their participation in sports and being more physical. We\u2019re seeing that online with the number of women we have participating in our Nike Plus and our training applications online. ","So the relationship we have with the women and the trend that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not really a trend, as I call it. It\u2019s more of a cultural shift. So the appetite is there for more active product, and we\u2019re seeing that in both footwear and apparel. So the opportunity to really start to close that gap is tremendous. ","And we think that over the years ahead, we\u2019ll start to reduce that differentiation between men\u2019s as a percentage of Nike\u2019s business versus women\u2019s. So very, very bullish on the women\u2019s opportunity and the response to the work that we\u2019ve already done in elevating that part of our product and our communication. ","Trevor Edwards ","Yeah, and I think as Mark just touched on, it really speaks to why we think the women\u2019s is such a big and huge opportunity for us, and why we\u2019re very focused on it. We believe we are absolutely on target to go after our $7 billion goal for fiscal year 2017, but we truly believe it\u2019s not about that, it\u2019s actually about beyond, continuing to really move the needle around our women\u2019s business.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti ","Just quickly on the China business, it\u2019s interesting because you guys used to give a fairly detailed report card, as you started to really go into the active mode of repairing that business. Maybe we can look at just where we are in that business now as far as you were controlling inventories for a long time, working with the retailers to improve the presentation at retail and put some capex into those stores. ","And I guess numerically, it\u2019s very interesting to see 20% revenue growth off of 6% futures, and now that you\u2019ve accelerated the futures to 13, how do we think about that spread going forward without getting to carried away with what we can look at? It certainly doesn\u2019t point me intuitively to a midteens revenue growth for the year. So just any help there would be great. ","Mark Parker ","I think first of all, you\u2019re right, in the previous quarters we were giving you a pretty detailed articulation, and one of the things we said that was because of the prior year comparisons, the futures growth rate and the revenue growth rates were not going to look all that obvious or all that intuitive, so that\u2019s why we gave much more specific guidance on that market than we normally do.","And once again, this quarter we gave revenue guidance of mid-teens growth for the year, because it is a little hard to read the futures and the revenue growth, just because of the prior year. Once we get past this fiscal year, we\u2019re going to start to be anniversarying numbers that are a little more consistent, and we can go back to fairly normal relationships between futures and revenue. ","But for right now, what we would ask that you do is pay attention to what it is we give you as future guidance. That is our best estimate of where we think the revenue numbers would be. You\u2019re still going to see some unusual relationships between futures and revenue for a few more quarters.","Michael Binetti ","And if I could just ask one more question on the gross margins, obviously the nuances of the gross margin we\u2019ve talked about a bit on this call, but as we\u2019ve visited over the last few years, the topic always comes up of when you guys can get back to the prior peak gross margins of just over 46%. ","And we\u2019ve heard you talk a lot about premiumization, and clearly you\u2019ve worked very hard on that line in the P&L. Do you think at this point that the work you guys have done on product and on manufacturing and on the focus on pricing, we\u2019ve reset the bar long term for the grosses to be able to go over that level longer term? ","Mark Parker ","We don\u2019t necessarily see there as being a ceiling on gross margin. As I said earlier in response to the pricing question, this is really about creating the equity in the brand and the product and how we distribute it that enables us to be premium and get paid for our work. And we believe that we have opportunities in terms of the revenue portion of the equation as we continue to drive that value equation behind the innovation and the brand. ","On the cost side, we\u2019ve talked about some of the things we\u2019re doing in the manufacturing space. We\u2019ve talked about just getting better and better at how we flow product, and we continue to see opportunities there. ","So we don\u2019t see that previous peak as somehow a magical ceiling. As I said in my earlier remarks, it\u2019s a signpost on the journey, but we believe that we can continue to create that value in the margin equation.","Operator","And the final question is from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric Tracy","I guess if I could touch on digital, and ecom, obviously a couple of quarters now of pretty significant acceleration. Maybe just touch on the consumer migration, the evolution of that channel overall. Obviously a massive opportunity, but how do you think about sort of expanding the market versus cannibalizing it and how you kind of maintain the relationships and balance with your wholesale partners?","Mark Parker ","Good question. First of all, I\u2019d say that our commitment to DTC, our direct to consumer business, is a huge and critical part of the commitment we have to create a more premium presentation for our brands and our products and ultimately, giving our customers, consumers, a better experience all around. ","So with that said, the world is changing. Consumer behavior and expectations are certainly changing. More people, it\u2019s no mystery to anybody here, are shopping online. They want products easy, they want it fast, they want to be able to customize and personalize, shop on their devices, and in an in-store setting.","So the relationship between those channels is really critical, whether it\u2019s Nike direct or with our retail partners. And that\u2019s really the focus of our marketplace development work is to really obsess how all the parts or channels actually work together, and work together in a way that really gives the consumer the best experience.","So we\u2019re focused on how do we address the needs and expectation of the consumer as we say they ultimately decide. So Nike, I think you\u2019ve seen, along with our retail partners, is expanding the market, and we\u2019re seeing more positive results all around. We think this is a win-win situation between Nike and our wholesale partners around the world, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing.","Trevor mentioned, and we\u2019ve said this quite regularly, being a better retailer is making us a better company and a better wholesale partner. Nike.com, as bullish as we are, and as positive as the results have been, which are pretty spectacular, is still in the early stages. ","We\u2019re investing heavily. This is one of the bigger growth opportunities for us long term, big improvements in just how the consumer interacts with Nike online. Seamless cart experiences, making the transactions a lot easier. Actually, blurring the lines between transactioning online and in store. Supply chain improvements, improvements in ID. I could go on. Increased focus on mobile, very, very important for us. ","So the investment and the focus on this area will continue. And not as a separate, isolated part of Nike, but as an integrated part of our business and our categories. So I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re obviously quite bullish on this, and this is where the consumer\u2019s going, and this is where we\u2019ll be. ","Kelley Hall","All right, well, with that, we want to thank everyone for joining us. Happy holidays, everybody, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter."],"15719":["Nike Inc.

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, delivering revenue growth of 5% for NIKE, Inc. to $8.4 billion. On a currency, neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 7%. Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 44.5%. Earnings per share increased 24% to $0.68, and we delivered ROIC of 33%. Q3 saw NIKE sustain our positive momentum.","Let\u2019s start with highlights from an amazing quarter for our athletes. Serena won her 23rd Grand Slam, Roger took the Australian open against Rafael to extend their great rivalry; and both NIKE and Jordan continued to dominate basketball\u2019s biggest movements. At the NBA, All-Star was 20 of the 25 players on the roster, and in March madness with 12 of the teams advancing to the Sweet 16.","This quarter, we also raised the voice of our athletes with the equality campaign, showing yet again that NIKE stands up for our believes, our message spreads far and can be a catalyst for true positive change. With wide spread energy behind the athletic industry right now, NIKE is aggressively competing in every market, and we are creating our own opportunities using our combined power and scale.","Last quarter, I talked about our relationships with consumers, and how we're getting sharper and moving faster to serve them. That sense of focus has only accelerated over the last 90 days. The consumer has decided digital isn\u2019t a just part of the shopping experience. Digital is the foundation of it. This and other factors have shifted consumer patterns, especially in North America, impacting traffic, the economics of brick-and-mortar retail and is driving a more promotional environment in the near term.","While we are mindful of these near-term dynamics, we remain focused on the long term. The current backdrop represents a tremendous opportunity for NIKE, because the brands that win are going to be the ones that have been out in front with digital and leading with service. While we don\u2019t expect this transition to be simple, we are clear about what it will take to get there.","We're aligning all of our firepower against the consumer experience. To see consumers rising expectations, we're driving fundamental change in three core areas of our business, through the innovation that inspires them, the supply chain that delivers it quickly and in the marketplace, where we connect personally, with consumers. And while we continue to see great success against all three areas, we committed to doubling our impact in each of them. We call it our triple double. So what do I mean by that? In products, we're doubling our cadence and scale of innovation through performance and sports style. Throughout our supply chain, we are doubling our speed, from product insight to delivery to the consumer, and in the marketplace, we're doubling our direct connections with consumers through digital membership and personalization. To win now and create the future, we're obsessing these three areas, 2X innovation, 2X speed and 2X direct. I'll give you some detail on each.","Let's start by going deeper on 2X innovation, where we're shifting to even faster innovation cycle and scaling more effectively. Our consumers will feel the impact of this immediately. For example, in just a few days we're launching our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max Cushioning System ever. We'll continue to push the edges of style with Air Wafer Max and quickly scale it into new models. And to kick off the sub-two-hour marathon break in two project, we've developed a disruptive design with the NIKE Zoom X Midsole. The Zoom X providers' runners with an incredibly comfortable ride and energy return like we've never seen before. With running footwear, we're always looking to improve efficiency. That's why we're so excited about the new NIKE Zoom Vapor Fly 4%. As a former marathoner, I know that even a 1% gain would be an impressive accomplishment. But over our previous best shoe, this delivers an astronomical 4% gain in efficiency. It's no surprise that feedback from our lead athletes has been off the charts. We can't wait for more runners to give it a try when we release the NIKE Zoom Vapor Fly 4% in early June.","Later this summer, we'll unveil a third Platform, a next generation cushioning system designed in radical new forms that help runners and baseball runners increase their performance and stay fresher longer. Using a new material, this will be the first widely available NIKE platform that merges our new algorithm based approach to designing with data. Combined, this new system with Vapor Max and Zoom X, and that's three new cushioning platforms coming to market in the months ahead. As our consumers, will soon see, this is truly a cushioning revolution from NIKE. ","In apparel, NIKE and the NBA will bring fans closer to court side next fall. We're delivering innovation that extends way beyond the court, covering every stage of the players' journey. That's a huge untapped commercial opportunity, and our strategy will be to blend sport with everyday lifestyles for both the athlete and the fan. All of this innovation, gives NIKE a critical edge in the near term, but we know a loaded innovation pipeline is what ignites our next phase of growth over the long-term and there's plenty ahead.","Looking toward the future, we're in the later stages of evolving and scaling personalized performance beyond the HyperAdapt 1.0, with more comprehensive fit systems, including continued advancements in our FlyEase technology, a new level and look of Flyknit that's so strong it can withstand the forces of the NBA's most powerful players, and merging performance and style in another new cushioning platform that actually conforms and shapes to the foot for ultimate comfort. With all of these products to hit the market over the coming months, it\u2019s clear NIKE is driving a faster innovation cycle and bringing it to more people than ever before. ","Our second area of focus is to create a more agile and opportunistic organization or 2X speed inside and out. We continue to stay one step ahead of the consumer. We will cut our average product creation cycle in half. One way we\u2019re doing that now is through our express lane, where our global product teams and our product engines make real time adjustments to DTC and wholesale product lines with local teams in North America, Western Europe and China. We\u2019re moving faster than ever before, getting products to market in weeks not months. Through the express lane, we're fueling consumer demand through new localized styles. We're supercharging our most successful franchisees.","For example, we build more flexibility and speed into the delivery of some of our top sellers like the Air Pegasus, the Air Force ,1 and we\u2019re looking ahead to include the Air VaporMax as examples. Another key to moving our teams closer to market is the work we\u2019re doing within our manufacturing revolution. With partners like Flex, we\u2019re expanding into more styles with advanced automation in the build and adhesion processes, localizing sourcing for quicker material lead time and reducing waste through advanced knitting and higher precision cutting technologies. We\u2019re seeing a positive impact to gross margins in the tens of millions and we expect that to continue to accelerate.","These are not separate initiatives. We're linings up the pipes of our manufacturing revolution, with real time consumer insights, seamless inventory and a hyper local marketplace approach, all of which is connecting the dots in the name of speed for the consumer. To make room for this speed, we\u2019re driving focus through our Edit-to-Amplify approach. This is an area where we have not been as sharp as we need to be. Currently 75% of our styles generate 99% of sales. By editing out 25% and amplifying the productivity of both new innovations and the products consumers already love, we\u2019re driving more growth and choice from fewer styles, and we\u2019re already seeing positive near-term returns from our work here. Edit-to-Amplify is a mindset that reaches well beyond product. It\u2019s about prioritizing every step along the way, from the category to GO's to cities, to accounts, all the way down to the door level.","Our final area of focus is 2X direct. This strategy doubles the business that is in direct service of the consumer, and we do this by leveraging this digital and membership to bring the NIKE brand closer to them, regardless of whether they are in our own DTC or with wholesale partners. We want to extend NIKE\u2019s homeport advantage across all channels. We are seeing the opportunity up close. Take NIKE Soho for example, which some of you have visited. When consumer walks through that door, they get one to one personal shopping service, invitations to our running and training clubs with other members, the opportunity to trial our latest innovations, and seamless access to product to get them what they want quickly. And what we found is that NIKE plus members who use our personnel shopping appointments generate more than three times the average transaction size. We see the consumer shift within digital commerce as well, with a larger share of our growth coming through our apps. Its further confirmation that the consumer responds to a simpler, faster and more personal connection. And right now that level of service, that deeper experience with the NIKE brand is driving growth in our own DTC.","Moving forward, we will expand that opportunity by rolling out these successes with our own wholesale partners around the world. The more directly NIKE engages with the consumer, the greater the return. We've seen it with our strategic partners in key accounts, such as footlocker, Dicks, JD, Intrasports and TMall, where we've grown our businesses together, despite the uneven environment. And for those partners who align with our more direct approach to the consumer, we have an opportunity to leverage the Express Lane even more. And we know there still more work to be done here. More personnel, more mobile, more distinctive, these are the dimensions that will drive growth. And I\u2019m convinced now is the time to rewrite the playbook of retail.","When I look out to the next year, we have a lot be excited about. Now it\u2019s more important than ever for NIKE to say true to our own values and leverage our competitive advantages. There will always be room to improve, but I\u2019m proud of the way we're managing our business today and I\u2019m bullish on our opportunity to extend our leadership position for tomorrow. Our triple double strategy is setting the stage for this next phase of growth at NIKE, to win now, and to create the future.","Thanks, and now here is Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. Hello, everyone. In Q3, the NIKE brand delivered another solid quarter of growth. As always, my remarks are on a constant currency basis. NIKE brand revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China, and our emerging markets' geographies.","NIKE brand DTC revenue increased 13%, driven by 18% growth in digital commerce, new store expansion and 6% comp store growth. Today NIKE is in a familiar place on the offence. Mark said, we are doubling our direct connections with consumers, an approach that will be seen at retail as we ramp up how we serve our consumers through digital commerce and membership. And as always, we work to create brand energy across performance and lifestyle, connecting consumers to the products they want and love, and we bring it all to life through our geographies, a global portfolio that provides NIKE unrivaled agility and scale.","Now, let\u2019s get into a bit more detail on these three areas. Our deep relationships with consumers drives us. We built the NIKE brand by serving consumers. It is our central promise. And as we grow in scale and reach, we continue to serve our athletes personally. Mark spoke about the power of personalized service and seamless commerce in North America, particularly in our Soho and Miami stores. Let me just add that we\u2019re seeing the same success around the world as well. In January, we opened a NIKE and Jordan store in Beijing, our largest basketball-focused store in China. There, a NIKE+ Basketball Trial experience and t-shirt customization offers seamless links between NIKE\u2019s physical and digital platforms. As we roll out more experiences like these, consumers see that retail is more than a series of transactions. We believe it should be personal and full of energy. For us, personal service is the new premium.","To that point, our NIKE+ and SNKRS apps are successfully serving consumers more individually. Despite still only being offered in North America, they are driving more growth, better consumer engagement and higher conversion rates. With our investments in cloud technology, we are accelerating the global expansion of our apps, to become even faster and more nimble in serving the consumer\u2019s changing needs. All of these experiences offer powerful examples of the services that will enable us to double our direct connection to consumers, both in our owned and partnered retail.","At the same time, we are relentless in our goal to design products that deliver both innovation and style. Running and Basketball, two of our most important categories, sit at this intersection. In Q3, Running saw continued success, especially in our international markets, as the Air Zoom Pegasus showed strong sell-through. Also, as we celebrate the month leading up to Air Max Day, we\u2019ve unveiled several styles that are drawing strong consumer demand, including the first Air Max 90 Flyknit, the Air Max 1 OG in its 30th-year anniversary, and the Air Max Jewell, a sophisticated new silhouette designed for women.","And of course, the launch of the Air VaporMax this weekend will be a significant moment for the NIKE Brand. We debuted a laceless version of this performance shoe in Paris and drove energy throughout the fashion world. After all, the quest for perfect performance influences style, and vice versa. And the shoe, simply constructed of two of our greatest inventions, Air and Flyknit, fulfills our dream of walking on nothing but Air. We will continue to build consumer excitement for the Air VaporMax, by bringing new creative versions and global scale to serve this incredible energy we are seeing. We have high expectations for the Air VaporMax, and I'm very excited about the launch.","In Basketball, we're seeing great energy, from the game, to our athletes, to our products. Let\u2019s start with this: the Kyrie 3 launched in December, is the top-selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace. The LeBron 14 is showing very strong early results, and at the same time the LeBron Soldier 10 remains one of the hottest styles in the category. Also in Q3, the launch of the Paul George 1 saw very strong consumer response. And we continue to drive the demand for basketball with iconic and popular products like the Air Force 1. Modern looks on this beloved silhouette also sold very well in Q3. That includes the Special Field Air Force 1 and the high-energy collaborations with creative brands like Vlone and Acronym, proving yet again Nike\u2019s ability to adapt our most popular styles to serve new audiences.","So, Nike Basketball, fueled by the KD9, the LeBron Soldier 10 and the Kyrie 3, is seeing double-digit market share gains in the $100 to $150 price zone. And with the energy around the PG1, we expect this will only accelerate. And the future remains bright, with a new era of retros kicking off with the first-ever re-release of the LeBron Air Zoom Generation. We believe LeBron, like Kobe and Michael before him, will translate his singular greatness to a long line of product, and with the successful launch of his first retro, consumers clearly agree.","Speaking of Michael, the Jordan Brand continues to lead in elevating performance and sports-style together. We see Jordan\u2019s energy on the court in MVP-type seasons from Russell Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard, and we\u2019re seeing it off the court with several strong sellers in Q3, including the Jordan OVO and our Black History Month collections.","The top performer, however, was the Space Jam 11s. And when I say top performer, I don\u2019t just mean in Q3. The Space Jam 11 was the largest and most successful shoe launch in the history of Nike. This speaks not only to the obvious demand for our products, but also our ability to connect greater numbers of consumers worldwide to the products they covet. At the same time, the Jordan Brand continues its expansion beyond basketball, this time with the University of North Carolina\u2019s football team, and increasingly into the Women\u2019s business with the NikeCourt Flare AJ1. ","While we're talking about product, I'd be remiss if I didn\u2019t highlight the success we're seeing in Apparel, whether that\u2019s our Zonal Strength Tights, our popular Plus Sizing line, or Tech Fleece, which continues to sell very well, particularly the Advance Fleece line. Throughout our categories, we are competing on all fronts, attacking opportunities with the cumulative advantages that NIKE has built.","Finally, our global diversification provides unrivaled agility and scale to sustain growth over the long-term. From North America to Western Europe to Greater China, we are running a powerful global offense, where we continue to develop deep relationships and bring excitement to consumers all over the world.","In North America, our brand continues to be incredibly strong. We see it when our most coveted products sell out rapidly on the SNKRS app, when members show up rain or shine at our NIKE Run Clubs, or when we see consumers enjoying premium executions in our stores, and in our partner doors like Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops, the Fly Zone and the Fieldhouse at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.","And we continue to tap into powerful sport and cultural moments. In Q3, just a few days apart, we delivered at New York Fashion Week and at the NBA All-Star Weekend. Nike and Jordan celebrated Fashion Week with special product drops and targeted retail executions, and then followed it up with special player editions for our deep roster of All-Stars. Our ability to leverage both these events speaks to the distinction of our brand.","Now, while we\u2019re seeing consumer traffic patterns shift by digital disruption, retail consolidation, and increasingly promotional environments, this geography continues to move in the right direction. In Q3, revenue was up 3%, gross margins expanded and inventory declined 8%. And we continue to see that the right product, the right experience and the right brand strategy generates tremendous consumer demand. That said, while we remain focused on strengthening our leadership position, we know we have more work to do to supercharge performance product in North America, particularly in Running. When we see a new market or competitive dynamics within a category, we move quickly to identify the consumer opportunities, and we focus our resources against them.","We\u2019ve proven that this is the right strategy time and again. For example, last year we were losing share in Basketball in North America, and now we\u2019re taking it back. We\u2019re on the offense and we anticipate accelerating growth in performance, in large part fueled by the Air VaporMax\u2019s energy and the upcoming Cushioning Revolution that Mark mentioned.","Around the rest of the world, our brand and business are seeing great momentum. In Western Europe and Greater China, a continued shift to more a active lifestyle is fueling growth. Specifically, in Q3 Western Europe had its 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and Greater China saw its 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth.","In Western Europe, we saw growth across nearly all categories, across all territories and across DTC and wholesale, led by Digital. We also reclaimed Western Europe\u2019s #1 position in football footwear, as Nike players dominate the top leagues, scoring more goals than any other brand this season. The market continues to grow at a healthy pace. In Footwear, we saw growth in Running and Sportswear, and in Apparel, we saw broad-based growth led by Sportswear and Global Football.","Now, in China, the opportunity is massive. Just over the past five years, the number of marathons there has grown 500%, and China\u2019s government predicts a sports economy valued at $850 billion by 2025, by far the world\u2019s biggest. Our leading brand position in China gives us confidence we will continue to see real growth from this expanded market. ","Indeed, Nike and China have a long history together, and we continue to connect with this growing sports culture. In January, in addition to the Beijing store, the Jordan Brand opened two new Jordan-only stores in Chengdu and Taipei, celebrating the Brand\u2019s 20th anniversary in China. And partners like Topsports and Pousheng are helping drive strong sales by scaling elevated experiences across key cities.","In Q3 we also partnered with tennis star Li Na to introduce a signature line with Women\u2019s Training and Sportswear styles, our first exclusive line for a female Chinese athlete. And additionally, we are looking forward to China hosting the FIBA World Cup of Basketball in 2019, and with our recently announced partnership with FIBA, we can\u2019t wait to work together to grow the sport of basketball internationally.","In the end, the Nike Brand is built to win. We connect consumers with the product and experiences they want, across performance and lifestyle; we strategically balance across a diverse global marketplace; and we lead the pack with groundbreaking retail executions, both in premium brick-and-mortar and pioneering digital commerce. As always, we are on the offence and it's these core strategies that will fuel and extend our leadership position over the long-term.","Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello to everyone on the call. We are pleased with the results that we delivered in Q3, and, at the same time, we are not satisfied. We are pleased, because we continue to strengthen the fundamental drivers of NIKE\u2019s long-term revenue growth and earnings potential. Our financial strategy has three pillars; delivering strong revenue growth; expanding profitability, and generating high returns on invested capital.","In Q3, we delivered revenue growth in line with the guidance that we communicated 90-days ago. We drove strong double-digit currency-neutral growth in aggregate across our international markets, which now represent more than half of our global portfolio, and we re-positioned NIKE for sustainable, profitable growth in North America long-term. We also expanded profitability, well in excess of our guidance, with EPS growing 24%.","Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of over 33%, and at the high end of our targeted range, by continuing to edit within our core spending, to amplify more focused strategic investment in areas such as product innovation, digital commerce and membership, while also more tightly managing inventory.","Over the past several years, NIKE has become even more fit for growth. On a currency neutral basis, we have built a more efficient and profitable business model. We have sustained momentum in the drivers of full-price gross margin expansion. We have systematically reduced SG&A as a percent of revenue. And we have significantly expanded our currency neutral EBIT return on sales.","But, we are not satisfied. We are clear-eyed with respect to the challenges we have faced and opportunities we have not fully capitalized upon in the short-term. We have and we will continue to attack those opportunities with urgency. We are also obsessing over the triple-double that Mark referenced: doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, doubling our speed to market, and doubling NIKE\u2019s direct connection to consumers in the marketplace. That is the formula we are employing to fuel NIKE\u2019s next horizon of accelerating growth.","As for innovation, we have more than doubled our investment in innovation of late, and you will now see us double the flow and impact of innovation we bring to market, immediately beginning in Q4. We also see tremendous growth potential in doubling our direct connection to consumers. NIKE\u2019s Direct to Consumer business continues to grow much faster than the broader market, and NIKE-branded concepts operated with our strategic partners continue to grow faster than undifferentiated multi-brand stores.","In short, NIKE always wins when we create a home field advantage, that brings together a curated assortment of our products, a NIKE-branded environment, and direct, personal service of the consumers. To be clear, this opportunity is not simply about branded space. It goes well beyond. We see the opportunity to leverage NIKE digital membership to elevate personal service broadly across the marketplace. And, today, NIKE digital members already spend nearly two times what other NIKE consumers spend per transaction.","Identifying, and then aggressively seizing upon these compelling growth opportunities is what we mean when we say NIKE is on the offense, always. But, before I speak to our go-forward outlook in more detail, let\u2019s take a few moments to reflect on the results that we delivered in Q3. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 5%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit growth in Greater China, Western Europe and the emerging markets.","Third quarter diluted EPS of $0.68 increased 24% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage, higher other income, a lower tax rate, and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 140 basis points in the quarter. Full-priced average selling prices continued to expand. However, margin contracted overall, due to higher product costs, FX headwinds, and off-price sales.","Demand creation decreased 7% to $750 million for the quarter, as our fiscal year spending was front-loaded, due to significant investment around the Olympics and European Football Championships. Operating overhead decreased 1%, as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains within our core operational spending.","The effective tax rate for Q3 was 13.8%, compared to 16.3% for the same period last year, primarily due to a reduction in tax reserves and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. As of February 28th, inventories were up 7%, driven by a higher average cost, due primarily to product mix and to support growth of our DTC businesses. Wholesale inventory units were down 3%.","Next, let\u2019s turn to a few of our key operating segments. North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, as we continued to see balanced growth across both footwear and apparel, highlighted by another quarter of strong growth in NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. EBIT growth of 9% outpaced revenue growth as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage delivered increased profitability.","As Trevor detailed, we continue to make great progress in North America, rebalancing supply and demand, reigniting momentum in our Basketball business, and sustaining momentum in Sportswear. That said, the North America retail landscape is not in a steady-state. Digital disruption and other dynamics are resulting in more aggressive promotional activity than we expected 90-days ago. So we are going to remain tight, with respect to the supply that we are putting into the North America market in the short-term, while aggressively driving the initiatives that will reshape and grow the market, and extend NIKE\u2019s leadership long-term.","Now, turning to our international markets, where we continue to have very strong momentum. First, in Western Europe, revenue increased 10% on a currency neutral basis, as we delivered another quarter of strong multi-dimensional growth led by our Sportswear, Running and Global Football categories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 4%, while EBIT declined 13%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds and higher product costs on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage.","In our emerging markets, revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, led by our Sportswear and Running categories. We also saw double-digit growth across most territories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 8%, while EBIT decreased 4% as results continue to be heavily impacted by FX. Last, but certainly not least, Greater China delivered another quarter of extraordinary results with currency neutral revenue growing 15%.","We continue to see strong momentum across the business, with double-digit growth in wholesale and DTC, footwear and apparel, and nearly all categories. China as a nation is accelerating towards sport, both in terms of participation and passion, and urbanization continues at full-speed. With over 350 million Chinese millennials, one of the largest and most important demographics in the world, we believe we\u2019ve just scratched the surface of our growth potential in this important market.","On a reported basis, revenue grew 9% and EBIT expanded 6% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. As evidenced in Q3, we extended our longstanding track record of managing all of the levers within our global portfolio to deliver strong results in the near-term, even amidst volatility. As we look ahead, we will also continue investing and innovating to exceed consumer expectations and fuel long-term sustainable, profitable, capital efficient growth.","As for our specific guidance, in Q4, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, slightly below our Q3 reported rate of growth. On a currency neutral basis, we expect growth in the high single-digit range. We continue to see very strong growth in our international geographies, ranging from Greater China to Europe to emerging markets.","In North America, we have made great progress over the course of this fiscal year, solidifying the fundamental drivers of growth. We are by far the leading and largest brand in North America with a $15 billion growing portfolio. Based upon the breadth and depth of our portfolio, we anticipate that the currently dynamic overall retail marketplace will create both puts and takes in the short-term. So we are being appropriately measured with respect to our Q4 financial targets for North America. We will keep supply tight, maintaining the strong foundation we\u2019ve created, while we bring new innovation to market and accelerate more direct consumer connections.","Shifting to gross margin, 90-days ago, we anticipated less Q4 gross margin contraction versus prior year than we have seen year-to-date. While we were anticipating greater FX headwinds in Q4, we were also expecting to partially offset that with significant expansion in our operational, or currency neutral gross margin versus prior year. Today, we expect the same FX impact that we anticipated 90-days ago. However, based upon the currently more promotional environment in the overall North America marketplace, we do not believe it is prudent to target as much short-term expansion in our operational gross margin. Instead, we are going to maintain the financial flexibility to ensure that we continue to optimize sell-through. Accordingly, we are now targeting 150 to 175 basis points of gross margin contraction in Q4 versus prior year, with the year-over-year variance largely driven by FX.","As for Q4 SG&A, we expect it to be roughly flat versus the prior year, as we continue to systematically drive productivity gains through our Edit-to-Amplify initiative. Other income, net of interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million in Q4; and, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.","Note that NIKE Brand futures orders are down 4% on a reported basis versus prior year, and down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. As previously discussed, futures are an important part of our operating model, but futures growth is no longer a reliable proxy for revenue growth based upon several factors we\u2019ve previously articulated. Illustrating this point, you will see that China futures are growing low single-digits based on changes we have made to our monthly shipment flow globally. However, we continue to project strong double-digit revenue growth in China.","We are in the early stages of our planning for fiscal year 2018, and will provide financial guidance on our next earnings call. Today, I'll share some preliminary thoughts. We are employing a balanced, three-pronged approach to our planning for fiscal year 2018. First, we will remain appropriately measured. Second, we will be sharply focused, attacking the most compelling growth opportunities in the marketplace with speed and agility. And, third, we will be on the offense, executing the triple-double that will fuel NIKE\u2019s next horizon of accelerating long-term growth.","Financially, we are targeting continued revenue growth across all geographies in fiscal year 2018, led by strong growth internationally. We also project significant operating leverage and expanding profitability, which on a currency neutral basis would result in earnings growth consistent with our long-term financial model. That said, at our investor day in October fiscal year 2016, we communicated that we expected FX to be a significant headwind through fiscal year 2018, as our long-dated hedge portfolio matures and rolls forward. And since that time, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened against most international currencies. At current rates, we project that we will have absorbed $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion of cumulative FX downside over fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, with the most significant annual impact being in fiscal year 2018. We look forward to putting these extreme FX headwinds behind us, as we exit fiscal year 2018. In the meantime, we will continue to deliver strong revenue growth, and make NIKE a much more efficient and profitable enterprise on a currency neutral basis.","In closing, we will continue to manage all of the operating levers within our portfolio to deliver strong performance in the short-term. At the same time, we will remain relentlessly on the offense, investing, innovating and, in some cases, revolutionizing the industry to exceed consumer expectations, fuel long-term growth and create value for shareholders.","With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. ","Bob Drbul","I guess, if you can spend a few minutes on basketball, in terms of what you delivered this quarter and the expectation going forward as a driver. And then just, if you could spend a little bit more time elaborating on China in terms of the futures versus the revenue outlook, and what exactly changed with some of the shipments timings that you\u2019ve talked about?","Mark Parker","Okay. Bob, I\u2019ll take the first one. So on basketball, we continue to see the basketball business strengthen. And there is no doubt that we\u2019re obviously the leader of basketball, and there is incredible energy with our athletes. We see a really strong pipeline of products and we have the ability to continue to grow the game around the world. When we think of basketball, we always think about it as a portfolio NIKE basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. What we've seen is great momentum really across all those dimensions. First on the sportswear side, just to give you a one dimension, the Air Force 1 franchise is doing exceptionally well in the marketplace, and we\u2019re seeing new stuff, like this special field Air Force 1 really become an icon and continue to grow.","The Air Jordan Space Jam 11 which I mentioned earlier broke launch records. Then you have the you have the Kyrie 3, which is now the top selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace. When you speak about performance, then you go specifically into the KD9, the LeBron Soldier to handed the Kyrie 3, are all driving double-digit market share gains in the $100 and $150 price zone. And then we\u2019ve added the Paul George and then the LeBron 14. So all-in-all, we have really brought, a really strong focus around basketball. We are clearly focused. We\u2019re on the offense, and we are incredibly excited about the products that we have come in in addition to the NBA partnership that we have on the horizon. So all-in-all, basketball really is just starting to go from strength-to-strength.","Andy Campion","And Bob, I\u2019ll take the China question. The short answer is, the China futures in a low-single-digit range reflects purely timing impacts. As we continue to optimize our management of supply and demand and inventory, one of the opportunities we\u2019ve identified is with the respect to the flow across the three months that comprise a season. And so we\u2019ve made some changes that help us better identify opportunities and capitalize on being in stock in the marketplace. It also has a benefit to us from an inventory management and capital management perspective. We see continued strong double-digit growth in China. In no way do the futures reflect any change in our very bullish view with respect to the tremendous performance that we\u2019ve had, and we continue to expect in China.","Nitesh Sharan","Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane","Thank you. My question \u2013 my first question was on the cushioning platforms. I know we typically see these innovations around the Olympics. I was curious about why they\u2019re coming out now instead, and how quickly do you expect to scale these?","Andy Campion","Yes, well, these cushioning systems, all three of them, and in fact there\u2019s four. If you listen carefully, there\u2019s a fourth comfort cushioning system in the works. These have been in development for the past two or three, in some cases, four or five years. This is part of our double the investment in R&D, and we\u2019re really seeing that investment paying off. One of the most important outputs of performance innovation for NIKE is in the area of cushioning. So we see \u2013 some of this work actually led up to Rio. The top three finishers in the marathon were all wearing the Zoom X technology, and also in the Olympic trials leading up to the Olympics.","So you\u2019ve seeing bits and pieces of some of this but not out in the market at scale. So we\u2019re basically ready to launch the product, excited about every one of the cushioning systems. They not only create a new level of performance and incredible breakthroughs in the case of the Zoom X, but they also create a whole new aesthetic, which is translatable not only into performance product, but also to the street. So the leveragability and the scalability of these technologies is tremendous. The challenge we have frankly is to make sure that we\u2019re \u2013 the focus is on these and we scale these in a way that we can really tell the stories independently. But together, they form what is truly \u2013 and I mentioned it, a cushioning revolution for NIKE and the industry. As a product geek, I am incredibly excited about what\u2019s coming in the next six months.","Kate McShane","Okay. Great. And then if I could follow up with your commentary on the North American dynamic, are we really talking about what\u2019s happening in the department store channel? I\u2019m just curious what negative trends continue to persist here when we\u2019re starting to approach the lapping of some of the bankruptcies, and just what\u2019s driving the level of promotion that you\u2019re seeing?","Mark Parker","Yes, well, let me just start at a little broader level. The retail landscape is particularly in the U.S. is not \u2013 is in a steady state. I think that\u2019s obvious, undergoing some significant shifts. And those shifts really create some big opportunities and some challenges at the same time. I think the important thing to point out is that these changes are really being driven by the consumer, and consumer demand at the same time remains quite strong. But we know that consumer expectations are quite high in terms of product, the type of product they want, the innovation, the style. They want the product fast, they want it easy, they want personal service. So these are all things that are driving some of these shifts in the marketplace. And that's why we're focused on doubling the output or the cadence of innovation or speed to market so we can be that much more responsive to consumer needs, deliver innovation more quickly, and then doubling our direct connection, to consumers in the marketplace, using or leveraging the power of digital. So again, it's a market that's undergoing a lot of shift and change, but again, I wouldn't trade you our position with anybody. I think we're in a strong position to leverage our strength as a brand, as a Company and we expect to do that.","Nitesh Sharan","Operator, we'll take the next question please?","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thank you, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first ask about the Triple Double initiative, especially the speed and pace to market innovation frequency. Maybe help us put this in context, and help us understand the impetus behind this. From an external perspective, it seems to a lot of people in the market that the kind of steeper market shifted in the last couple of years, maybe a little bit away from some of the performance, styles and looks and products that have been the market and maybe a little more towards that street and fashion element. Do these initiatives help you kind of directly address that, and what's the timeframe I think for getting the inventory balance right, along what the market is looking for as you implement some of those initiatives? Or is that not the right way to think about it?","Mark Parker","Well yes. The reason we're putting so much emphasis on this Triple Double strategy is it's going to get us closer to the consumer, and put us in a better position to serve the consumer with the innovation that we're creating, do a better job of editing that product selection and really calling out the key stories. The good news on a macro level is that the consumer appetite for active and sport based products is I think at an all-time high around the world. It's just sort of part of the fabric of everyday active lifestyle. And so the demand for the product is definitely there.","People want more, they want product that obviously performs at a high level, but also looks incredible. It's not an either\/or. It's an and proposition. And then want that product fast and they want it easy, at easy access to the product. So our whole initiative is about getting that direct connection strengthened to the consumer and making sure we're in the best position to keep that cadence of innovation moving out to the market as quickly as we can. It also puts us in a position to be more responsive. When we see product that's hot, we can turn that product around a lot quicker and get it to the retailers and to our own -- for our own DTC, to the consumer a lot quicker. ","So overall, it's just making us more competitive and more responsive to where the consumers are at. The Express Lane, let me just touch on that, because you asked about speed specifically. There's really three different components of the Express Lane. Fulfill is one, and that means getting product more quickly, restocking product more quickly based on what consumers want, and that's real-time, and that's through sell-through based insights.","Another dimension is what we called update, and that meaning editing materials or colors on popular or existing styles for models based on consumer feedback or insight that we gather. And then the third dimension of it is create, and this is basically creating new products from scratch and bringing them to market with much greater speed. Again, that\u2019s in half the time that we\u2019ve done it traditionally. So that whole end-to-end process is basically being cut in half today from six months down to roughly three months or less. And I think that\u2019s again, it\u2019s going to put us in a much more competitive position.","Andy Campion","Mark. I\u2019ll just add couple of other things. I would just say that what we see from the marketplace is consumers want both great performance, and they want style, and they want those two things together. And I think a great example of that is the product that we\u2019re actually just launching, which is the Air VaporMax, which you\u2019ll see that there are actually different variations to that product; one which is a very clear high performance product, the running shoe and we\u2019ve also got a laceless version, which actually appeals to more of a style perspective. But the shoe in and of itself is both great performance and it\u2019s also superiorly stylish. And so that is what we believe the consumer wants. So when we bring new platforms, you will see us bring more variations, that gives the consumers more choice on the thing that they actually love all the time. Go ahead.","Omar Saad","Sorry, I appreciate that. I appreciate those answers. I also wanted to ask a question about SG&A, if it\u2019s okay. It's been down kind of in dollar terms the last couple of quarters. You guys obviously have had a track record of really over investing to fuel long-term growth. Should we be thinking about the SG&A line differently? Is there something about this era that we're in, where maybe this requires the same spend levels or is that really just lapping kind of the year-over-year Olympics and other activities?","Andy Campion","It\u2019s a great question Omar. To be clear our top priority is investing to fuel long-term growth. So that\u2019s where the dialogue with respect to SG&A or capital expenditure starts at NIKE. But we\u2019ve identified is in over time, our growth has allowed us to invest appropriately, and in some cases in a very ample, maybe even a little more than we necessarily needed to. And I would think about this way. We have existing and new truly differentiating capabilities or competitive advantages in NIKE. Those include things like product innovation, design, digital, brand marketing, including sports marketing and our supply chain, especially the elements of the supply chain that Mark spoke too, the ones that we're looking to get greater speed out of, in service to the consumer. That\u2019s where our focus is on investment.","The other functions that we have within the Company are certainly important, but they\u2019re not differentiate capabilities for NIKE and we look at those other functions as functions where we can optimize our spending, not just for purposes of saving expense, but it actually makes us more streamlined and nimble as an organization. So in some cases, our editing is aligned with shifting business priorities, or with existing business priorities, and in other cases our editing is really a form of zero basing in areas where we believe, we have the opportunity. And that\u2019s what I would call from the financial perspective, my version of Mark's Edit-to-Amplify initiative from a product and business perspective. And we believe that we continue to have opportunity in this regard. Again, if you exclude FX, we've made ourselves much more efficient and profitable over the last couple of years. And we still see opportunity ahead in that regard.","Nitesh Sharan","Operator. We\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","I wanted to ask on North America, and maybe a follow-up to Shane\u2019s question. I think a couple of quarters ago, you had talked about the need to de-stock and cleanup the channel, and that as we sort move through that, you had expected revenue in U.S. to accelerate. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re \u2013 given the commentary on the U.S., specifically on your fourth quarter, how you\u2019re thinking about the timeline to U.S. sales acceleration?","Andy Campion","Hi, Lindsay. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll start on that one. The first part of your question was about what we\u2019ve been talking about over the last several quarters, and we have made great progress in that regard. You obviously saw revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter with inventories declining. That is pretty squarely in the zone of effective and efficient supply and demand management. So we have re-solidified our foundation in that regard.","As Trevor and I think Mark to some extent touched upon, we\u2019ve also solidified the fundamental drivers of growth in North America. Trevor talked about all of the work we\u2019ve done to reignite momentum in Basketball. We have continued momentum in Sportswear. So what we\u2019re referring to when we talk about being measured in the short term in Q4 is the recognition and reality that it\u2019s a promotional marketplace, particularly in North America is, in light of some of the digital disruption that\u2019s going on. I think Kate earlier referred to there, select channels that are more challenged than others.","What we\u2019re most excited about is there are dimensions of the market that are tremendous opportunities. And so as we move into fiscal year 2018, what we\u2019re really focused on is creating a springboard for accelerated growth in North America, again, through the triple double. And in the marketplace, obviously, one of those -- the three doubles is doubling our direct connection to consumers through DTC and our wholesale strategic partners.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Got it. So to the degree that the environment is disruptive, how do you think about your ability to achieve the long-term revenue growth algorithm in North America that you laid out in your Investor Day? Does the market dynamic make that harder to do?","Andy Campion","Frankly, we\u2019re probably more bullish than ever on the long-term growth projection in North America. And why I say that is it\u2019s becoming even more crystal clear to us that the strategies we\u2019ve been employing to elevate the experience, the personal service of consumers in the market, digital, we\u2019ve been leading the NIKE.com but also membership, we\u2019re seeing much stronger growth in the dimensions of the market where NIKE is connecting with consumers.","Of course, we connect with consumers in our Direct-to-Consumer business. We do it through concepts like House of Hoops, with Foot Locker. And as we said, in each of those dimensions, and when you get down to purely digital membership, we\u2019re just seeing the growth outpace or the sales per transaction outpace. And so we see our way to incredibly strong growth in North America long term. There will be puts and takes in the short term.","Clearly with innovation and disruption, comes both puts and takes. I think by analogy, you might look to greater China. Greater China is a market with extraordinary growth, by really focusing on aligning product, a NIKE-branded environment, both owned and through partners and digital to fuel sustainable sustained growth.","Trevor Edwards","And one other things too I\u2019d just say, that the brand is extremely strong in North America and consumer\u2019s appetite for our brand continues to really be almost unsatisfied. So what we continue to is make sure that we line up the right products in the right environment, and as Andy spoke about, especially when we can do that more direct, and we can connect with the consumers more personally, we find that that continues to really allow us to continue to expand the market and expand our position in the marketplace. So we do feel very confident about North America in the long-term, and we certainly feel that the brand is very strong. ","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you, Lindsay. Operator, we'll take our last question please. ","Operator","The last question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. ","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Andy follow up for you. Your FX kind a [indiscernible] around those hedge contracts have, but we said the most significant impact in fiscal 2018. Can you elaborate on that please? Maybe help us make sure how much of the $1.6 billion to $2 billion you've referenced will have been absorbed by year end fiscal '17?","Andy Campion","Sure. So as you probably know Jim, and for others, we can't eliminate the impact of foreign exchange. And as you know, over two years ago, we saw significant strengthening of the dollar pretty dramatically and quickly against a lot of international currencies, particularly the euro. And we've seen a lot of volatility over the last couple of years. But largely dollar strengthening. Our hedging strategy is largely using longer dated. So 12 to 24 months out forward hedging to mitigate and delay that impact. So when I spoke to the $1.6 billion to $2 billion of impact over two years, on a rate basis you see those moves happened in the foreign currency impacts immediately. Our hedging strategy essentially steps us down or frankly in the opposite would steps us out, but steps us down to that impact.","The largest single annual impact will be in fiscal year 2018. That said, it hasn't been insignificant in fiscal year 2016 or 2017, it is actually -- the FX impact has been a double-digit negative headwind on EPS growth. So while we continue to deliver strong EPS growth, what we're actually most proud of is that excluding foreign currency, that would be double-digit higher in terms of our growth. So that hopefully gives you a little bit more dimension, but we're not providing a specific forecast as to the impact of FX on fiscal year 2018 today. ","Jim Duffy","Fair enough. Considering the headwinds you are facing from FX, are there other areas in the P&L that you hope to use to mitigate that as you look out to fiscal '18?","Andy Campion","Absolutely. And we have certainly done that over fiscal year 2016 and 2017. First and foremost is growth. We are obviously a growth company and in fact with attacking compelling growth opportunities in the market. Long-term obviously is our focus but in the short term as well. I'd say from a margin perspective, the underlying drivers of gross margin expansion are very strong and we see those being very strong in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017, again on a currency neutral basis. I mentioned that we continue to see opportunity to become even more fit for growth from an SG&A perspective through Editing to Amplify. And what I would say is most importantly for us in the short term is how we're executing against our long-term strategy. And that's what we\u2019re going to be most focused on as we finalize our plans for 2018 and as we move through 2018, as executing against Triple Double that Mark referenced.","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you, Jim.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh and hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Serving athletes in today\u2019s quickly evolving marketplace demands a new approach. It means rethinking the fundamentals with an action plan that focuses on speed and deeper connections with consumers.","In fiscal 2017, we managed our business through this dynamic environment, while at the same time we initiated big changes to set the stage for our future. It was a year for making aggressive moves. All with a goal of igniting the next phase of accelerated growth for NIKE. So let\u2019s take a look at the numbers for the year.","NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $34.4 billion on a reported basis. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8%. Gross margin declined 160 basis points to 44.6%. Earnings per share rose 16% to $2.51 and we delivered ROIC of nearly 35%.","As I reflect on the year and what the consumer is telling us, three insights stand out. First, the consumer appetite for newness and choice has never been higher. Their connected world means unlimited access to new products. So when they see something they love, they want more versions of it from performance innovation to style. For example, this year the introduction of the Air VaporMax energized the whole Air platform. Five of our top 10 sportswear styles featured Air Max cushioning, adding fuel to a NIKE Air business that already represents several billion dollars.","Second, consumers are choosing brands who lead with elevated service and new experiences. They want brands that are engaged and make a personal connection. Our opportunity is to create more compelling experiences in NIKE environments and with our best partners.","Third, consumers want the latest products faster. This year we continue to build more agility and speed into our organization. We\u2019re becoming better editors through high impact initiatives like EDIT to AMPLIFY, and we\u2019re driving scale and efficiencies. Innovation is how NIKE sets trends and new capabilities like the Express Lane are how we adapt to them.","All told, these are the forces helping to shape our triple double strategy and our recently announced Consumer Direct Offense. We\u2019ve aligned product, design, categories in key cities all the way to the consumer. Supported by our strong brand, we are executing with precision and focus.","Under this new formation, we\u2019re in the best position to drive growth against the biggest opportunities. And we\u2019re clear about what those opportunities are, to double innovation, speed and direct connections with consumers.","So let\u2019s start with 2X innovation. It\u2019s about taking the consumer somewhere new and expanding our opportunities for growth. For example, we all know how critical cushioning is to an athlete\u2019s performance and that -- and the different athletes have different preferences. So this summer we\u2019re offering a range of experiences through a cushioning revolution. That\u2019s three new platforms that push the edges of performance.","The first is the Air VaporMax, a product that hits the sweet spot of performance and style. As I\u2019ve always said, NIKE\u2019s competitive advantage is that our innovation creates new expressions of style. Equally, the consumer expects lifestyle product to look good and feel good with no compromise.","VaporMax has been very successful out of the gate with strong sell through across multiple releases. And looking ahead, will add even more breadth to the VaporMax family of products, scaling into millions of pairs through fiscal \u201818 to meet the growing demand.","Another platform, ZoomX, played a key role in an own inspiring moment this past May. I was there at the finish line at Monza, Italy, when [ph] Iliade Cantogi (7:43) finished with an extraordinary 2 hour 25 second marathon time. It was a thrilling moment for sports and an incredible validator for one of the most amazing breakthroughs I\u2019ve seen in performance footwear.","During the NBA playoffs, another new platform, NIKE React made its debut in both the [ph] NIKE HyperDon (08:07) 2017 and the Jordan SuperFly 5. NIKE React is the first high performance pump system that offers a major leap forward in three key benefits, lightweight, ultra-responsiveness and durability in one single platform.","With all three platforms, we\u2019re just getting started. NIKE\u2019s strength is our ability to get more out of each of our innovations by scaling across brands and across sports and what you\u2019re seeing right now is just a snapshot. We have a relentless flow of exceptional products and platforms on the way.","We\u2019re preparing for major launches with the first Flyknit apparel starting with the Flyknit bra, a radically designed comfort cushioning platform and HyperAdapt 2.0 delivering new forms of adaptive technology at more accessible price points, plus we have never before seen technology in NBA Apparel along the way.","New sustainable innovation brought to scale through some of our most iconic footwear styles and new additions to the Air Max family that leverage our new capabilities in Air sole manufacturing. Up and down our categories, we think the consumer is going to be excited about what we have in store in fiscal \u201818 and of course, as always, we\u2019ll have few more surprises along the way.","Turning to 2X Speed, the Consumer Direct Offense will intensify our focus on 12 key cities in 10 countries. Currently, these markets represent over 80% to NIKE\u2019s projected growth through 2020. The cities and countries are now supported by a simplified structure of four geographies, North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Greater China, and Asia Pacific and Latin America.","The key city strategy will create two big changes, it will add greater digital expertise and control in the markets, where consumer connections happen and they will be the source for real-time sensing of the market to influence product creation, primarily through our Express Lane teams.","The Express Lane serves three functions, the first is to fulfill and that means more quickly restocking what consumers want based on real-time sell-through data. The second is update and that\u2019s editing and refreshing materials, colors, or prints on popular existing models based on consumers\u2019 insights. And the third is create and that\u2019s creating new products and moving from design to shelf in half the time.","The Express Lane is already up and running in North America and Western Europe, and this summer a new Express Lane will be activated in Asia. As part of our key city approach, we\u2019re cutting critical weeks out of the delivery time in the world\u2019s most promising markets for sport.","And through manufacturing partners like Flex, we\u2019re also moving at a faster pace than ever before. Flex has already produced approximately 1 million pairs of footwear across multiple styles and together in fiscal \u201818 we\u2019re piloting more responsive business models to deliver product to market faster. We\u2019re ramping up speed at scale.","One of the areas where I expect to see the most dramatic change quickly is in 2X Direct. We\u2019ve now aligned our teams in DTC and digital to bring the consumer closer to the products, services and experiences that only NIKE can provide and leading with mobile, we\u2019re unifying and simplifying access for the consumer.","Our digital products just passed an important milestone in fiscal \u201817. NIKE.com and our apps now total more than $2 billion in revenue and that\u2019s nearly double in just the last two years. In fiscal \u201818, both SNKRS and NIKE+ are expanding into Europe and Greater China.","With the opening of our new digital studios, we activated a new vision for the future of sneaker culture and commerce, tapping into uniquely creative outlet within our key cities. There\u2019s some very exciting work here, especially in app-base experiences and commerce. Trevor will highlight some of the examples of how these are coming to life.","In Retail, we know the opportunity for innovation isn\u2019t ours alone. Innovation in Retail is everybody\u2019s opportunity. With Nordstrom, a destination for women, we\u2019re combining digital and physical experiences with the dedicated NIKE and Nordstrom page on Nordstrom\u2019s app.","Over the past five years with Zalando in Europe, we\u2019ve had great success growing our business to an elevated presentation and service and in China, we have a premium experience on the world\u2019s largest platform, TMall, where NIKE is the biggest sports brand reaching an incredible 500 million users.","In the U.S., we\u2019re executing a new pilot with Amazon with a limited NIKE product assortment. As we do with all of our partners, we\u2019re looking for ways to improve the NIKE consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling. We\u2019re in the early stages but we really look forward to evaluating the results of the pilot.","Whether it\u2019s through our own channels, printing press concepts with long time partners or exploring new commerce partners, NIKE\u2019s defining what\u2019s possible at Retail to better serve consumers and unlock growth. We\u2019re making big shifts in the year ahead to our business and within our teams. We\u2019re taking the qualities that differentiate NIKE and making them even stronger.","We have a brand that inspires globally, a thriving culture of innovation, a deep lineup of amazing products, the world\u2019s greatest roster of athletes and a consumer obsessed model. These moves are about taking action to accelerate growth and we have a clear plan and a competitive talented leadership team to get us there.","Thanks and now here\u2019s Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. In Q4 and throughout fiscal year \u201817, the NIKE Brand delivered strong growth, demonstrating again the power of our uniquely diverse global portfolio. As always, my comments are on a constant currency basis.","NIKE Brand revenue grew 7% for the quarter and 8% for the year with double-digit growth internationally in all quarters this fiscal year. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 12% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 18% driven by online growth of 30%, new stores and comp store growth of 7%.","The NIKE brand is strong with an unmatched ability to inspire consumers across the globe. And while we are seeing healthy growth across many dimensions of our business, we know ample opportunity remains. With our new Consumer Direct Offense, we are more focused than ever on amplifying those areas where we have momentum and accelerating those where we have opportunity. We\u2019re doing this by bringing the NIKE Brand closer to consumers, moving faster and serving them more completely.","Mark discussed how our new offense is moving decision-making closer to our consumers, so that we may move at their pace, if not a step ahead. Let me briefly share the work we\u2019re doing in the marketplace and how we expect it to drive even greater growth.","We have a uniquely powerful connection with our consumers. They want to be a part of our brands. They want a relationship and that means we think of membership differently. It\u2019s providing distinctive access and improving the ways we serve them. With these deep connections, it\u2019s no surprise that time and again our consumers choose us.","The results prove this vision with members on our apps spending nearly triple what others spend on NIKE.com. Through Consumer Direct, we are elevating our concept of membership to take full advantage of this commercial opportunity. We connect consumers to the product they want through exclusive offerings and tailored recommendations. For us, membership is an accelerator, a catalyst that drives growth.","In Q4, nearly three quarters of our NIKE.com consumers were members, up 25% and growing, with plan to accelerate through stronger member benefits and international expansion. We know there are member benefits that only NIKE can provide. For example, we leverage the breadth and depth of our most coveted products to bring physical and digital retail together.","With our mobile apps, we\u2019re disrupting the sneaker shopping experience. This quarter with sneakers stash, we unlocked access to exclusive products using geolocation and with Shock Drop we offered unannounced releases that surprised the sneaker community.","The sneaker app was only available in North America and is now expand into Europe, Greater China and Japan. This work is strengthened by our key cities strategy as we move our digital teams into cities to offer distinct experiences and connections.","One exciting example is a new interactive experience through sneakers in New York that makes certain styles exclusively available to members who unlock them through the app\u2019s new augmented reality features.","We have also begun a new partnership with Instagram that will allow consumers to purchase NIKE product seamlessly in the Instagram app. Clearly, we are boosting our ability to create new ways to serve consumers, making the entire NIKE+ ecosystem available to consumers where they already live. This is why we are so excited about the Consumer Direct Offense. It will take these elements and all these great concepts and scale them to make the most of our connections with consumers everywhere.","These kinds of meaningful connections are always elevated during major sports moments. From Breaking2 to the NBA Final showdown between LeBron and KD, these incredible sports moments fueled momentum across running, basketball and other key categories in Q4.","Starting with NIKE Sportswear, which draws inspiration directly from performance categories like running and basketball, we had another strong quarter of strong double-digit growth with sportswear -- the sportswear -- NIKE Sportswear stands as nearly $8.6 billion business as we shape the look of sports for our industry.","In particular, we are seeing strong momentum in many iconic styles with the -- from the Cortez to the Presto, and the success of the Air VaporMax, a high-performance running shoe is energizing the entire NIKE Air platform. As always, we are very excited about the innovations in the pipeline that will continue to bring performance to sports style.","And with the reintroduction of the popular style guide on NIKE.com, we continue to elevate the experience for our consumers driving strong sell-through in products like our Beautiful Power collection in Women\u2019s. In fact, all told, our Women\u2019s business led by sportswear is showing tremendous growth having outpaced Men\u2019s over the full year.","In Running, fiscal year 2017 was headlined by the balanced success in performance and lifestyle that Mark mentioned. For the year, we saw 8% growth with very strong momentum across our international markets.","In Performance, we were proud to sweep the podium at the Boston Marathon with five of the six runners wearing our new ZoomX technology. We know people are drawn to extraordinary performances and we worked throughout Q4 to use our brand to bring this energy to scale.","This, of course, leads to the nascent success we had with Breaking2, where performance innovation ignited global excitement like only NIKE can, 20 million people watched the live stream on Twitter and Facebook as the world tuned in. Those are viewership numbers that rival the biggest events in sports. That attention created global awareness for the Zoom Vaporfly 4%, driving momentum across the entire Zoom platform, including the new Zoom Fly and the Pegasus 34.","In Basketball, the momentum we have been seeing accelerated as we returned to growth in Q4. Our return to growth in NIKE Basketball shows the energy we are driving is real and lasting. What\u2019s more, as we look at the industry as a whole, we know that as NIKE Basketball -- as goes NIKE Basketball, so goes the entire basketball market.","The signs of NIKE\u2019s basketball progress are clear. Our strength in footwear came in large part due to Kyrie 3 remaining the number-one performance basketball shoe and the Paul George 1 becoming the hottest shoe in the market with incredible sell-through.","Successes like these drove significant market share gains in the all-important $100 to $150 price point. Though the overall category declined for the year, NIKE Basketball saw strong double-digit growth in Greater China and Western Europe.","The innovations we launch create excitement and continue to drive energy for the culture of sport, which we bring to life through sportswear. This all adds up to incredible potential as we look to leverage our NBA partnership to drive our 2X Direct strategy.","Yet we aren\u2019t waiting. The NBA Finals provided an opportunity to deeply engage with our consumers. During game one, we gave members first access to buy the KD 10, still KD Callaway, as soon as he stepped on the court. This is the kind of on-demand interactive digital commerce experience that you will see more of as our NBA partnership takes off.","Jordan also continued its run of success with an outstanding year of 13% growth. Today the Jordan brand is a $3 billion business. This year outside of North America, Jordan grew in excess of 25%, showing incredible international potential for the brands signature style and sole.","Also, the new AIR JORDAN 31 Lows along with the several other popular styles drove energy and demand at premium price points. All told, in Q4, we saw growth across all three dimensions of our complete basketball offense from NIKE Basketball to Jordan to Sportswear.","Now turning to our geographies, the success we\u2019re internationally has us excited about with the Consumer Direct Offense will do. These are markets where we\u2019re leapfrogging over all the models of retail to drive accelerated growth and we are bringing these successes domestically as we recalibrate the landscape.","In North America, momentum is building. In Q4, we saw another quarter of revenue growth driven by sportswear and Jordan, gross margin expansion, and improving inventory levels. For North America, we\u2019ve made great progress in the supply chain managing inventory this year and today it\u2019s clear we are well on the right path. At the same time, we still see a dynamic and promotional landscape. This is why we are aggressively executing our Consumer Direct Offense is so important.","That said, we have tremendous anticipation for the products we will launch this year. Our partners that have seen the products are excited. Consumers are starting to talk. We have loaded the pipeline and we can\u2019t wait for everyone to see it. That pipeline and the excitement we know it will bring is why we feel so confident about our North America business.","In Western Europe, we saw 12% growth for the quarter and 11% for the year as our market position strengthened. Throughout Europe, we\u2019re seeing apparel outpace footwear as our work driving the look of sport continues to fuel growth.","Here\u2019s one example we are really proud of. NIKE Sportswear in May was the biggest month for any category in the history of our Western European business. In Q4, we saw significant strength in DTC and digital. Our largest accounts in Western Europe also showed strong growth highlighted by strong momentum with JD and Zalando. At the same time, we activated the Express Lane in Europe ensuring consumers are served with stronger, quicker response to the products they love.","In the emerging markets we saw strong double-digit growth across channels and in nearly all territories. Overall revenue grew 14% for the full year and 18% in Q4. In March, we saw an amazing execution of Air Max Day throughout the emerging markets. A series of city activations with more than 75,000 participants sparked extraordinary sales with 100% sell-through of the Air Max 1 and the Air VaporMax styles. This is yet another example of how our city teams localize global stories and bring them to life for their consumers.","Finally, in Greater China, the brand is stronger than ever. Mark mentioned we are the number one sports brand on TMall and with our digital commerce apps expanding here we are just beginning to tap into our full potential. For the full year, we saw 17% growth in -- with quarter four up 16% driven by double-digit growth across most dimensions of the business.","In Q4, we launched White Hot, a powerful white sneaker collection. Fueled by influencers and athletes, White Hot was an incredible success as NIKE continued to leverage trend-right concepts to go deep with the styles that consumers want.","Throughout NIKE.com, TMall and WeChat, we saw strong product sell-through and significant consumer engagement. Through work like this, we keep our momentum in Greater China moving full speed ahead and we plan further acceleration as we expand the Express Lane to this geography. In fiscal year 2017, we saw real successes in our greatest growth opportunities. We also know there are areas where we can get better and with the Consumer Direct Offense, I know we will.","Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello, everyone, on the call. Reflecting on our financial performance in fiscal year \u201817, I\u2019d like to focus on three key themes that serve as important context going forward.","First, the more closely we connect the NIKE brand to consumers in the marketplace, the stronger our growth. In fiscal year 2017, our DTC businesses grew 18% on a currency neutral basis, led by NIKE.com, and our NIKE branded experiences with partners also grew at a rate that\u2019s far outpaced less differentiated multi-brand wholesale distribution.","Second, we continue to deliver strong growth internationally and we have even greater potential for growth ahead. International markets currently represent roughly 55% of our portfolio and grew at a double-digit rate in aggregate in fiscal year 2017.","While NIKE is the leading brand in fast growing developing markets around the world including China, current per capita spend on NIKE in those markets is still less than one-tenth of the per capita spend on NIKE in more developed markets. Over time, macroeconomic drivers and consumers expanding passion for sport will create even greater capacity for the NIKE brand to grow in those markets.","Third, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage all of the operating levers within our portfolio to deliver sustainable, profitable growth under a wide range of circumstances. In fiscal year \u201817, we delivered 16% growth in earnings per share, despite significant geopolitical and FX headwinds, and a rapidly evolving competitive and promotional marketplace. These themes reinforce why we are so aggressively executing on and we are so excited about the potential long-term financial impacts of our new Consumer Direct Offense.","First, take 2X innovation. Innovation fuels growth. We have doubled our investment in innovation over the past three years and we\u2019re now beginning to see the outsized returns that can be generated through incremental investment in innovation. As Mark and Trevor detailed, we broke through the barriers of human potential with the Breaking2 initiative and the ZoomX platform. We also launched the Air VaporMax platform in Q4.","If there was a question as to consumers appetite for performance innovation or willingness to pay premium prices for products that exceed their expectations in terms of performance and style, our launches in Q4 answered those questions.","Demand for the products we launched well exceeded our initial supply and over the course of fiscal year \u201818, we will be scaling these new innovation platforms across our global portfolio of categories and geographies.","To be clear, from a financial perspective, incremental investment in innovation drives asymmetrical returns on the topline by favorably impacting both our pricing architecture and overall demand.","Second, the benefits associated with doubling our speed favorably impact one, revenue growth through greater demand capture; two, gross margin expansion through a higher mix of full price sales; and three, inventory efficiency as our supply is even more closely tied to real-time consumer demand signals.","While selling out of a style within hours is evidence that we have exceeded consumer expectations, selling out within hours also represents lost opportunity. By reducing our time-to-market, our Express Lane in North America, Western Europe and soon Asia are beginning to help us translate data driven demand signals into more timely, profitable and capital efficient revenue growth.","Third, doubling our direct connection to consumers will drive an amplification of our topline growth. Consumers are showing us through traffic and spending patterns that they want experiences that offer the NIKE products they love in a NIKE branded environment with the level of service and experience that only NIKE can provide.","Today the dimensions of our business that fall within our broad definition of Direct represent roughly 35% of our business on a wholesale equivalent basis, but drove 70% of our growth in fiscal year 2017. These dimensions are also more productive and profitable than other less differentiated consumer experiences.","For example, fulfilling demand through NIKE.com generates nearly twice the revenue and significantly higher margin on each transaction and over time, we see the growth of digital as accretive to NIKE\u2019s bottomline profitability. So we will continue to prioritize and drive a more immediate shift towards more direct service of the consumer.","We are confident that the continued execution of the Consumer Direct Offense will drive NIKE\u2019s next horizon of accelerated growth. Our confidence as evidenced by the recently announced changes within our leadership and organizational structure. Those changes were not about cost cutting, but rather part of our more deliberate shift in focus and investment towards fueling growth through this new offense.","Now let me turn to a brief review of our Q4 and fiscal year \u201817 results. In Q4, we delivered growth in line with and profitability that exceeded the guidance we provided 90 days ago. Specifically, NIKE in Q4 revenue increased 5%, up 7% on a currency neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 6%, up 8% on a currency neutral basis.","Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 22% to $0.60. Full year diluted EPS grew 16% to $2.51 driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower effective tax rate.","Gross margin contracted 180 basis points in Q4 and 160 basis points for the full year. For the quarter, margin contraction was primarily driven by foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 140 basis points, as well as higher product input costs offsetting sustained increases in average selling prices.","Fourth quarter demand creation decreased 10% as our fiscal year spending was front loaded due to significant investments around the Olympics and European Football Championship. For the full year, demand creation decreased 2%.","Operating overhead decreased 1% for the quarter was flat for the full year as we continue editing to amplify, fueling our strategic investments through productivity gains within our core operational spending.","The effective tax rate was 13.7% in Q4 and 13.2% for the full year. The full year rate was 550 basis points lower than last year\u2019s rate, primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the U.S.","As of May 31st, inventories were up just 4%, as growth in our DTC businesses and increases in average product cost per unit were partially offset by a 3% decline in NIKE Brand wholesale inventory units.","Now let\u2019s turn to financial performance for a few of our key operating segments. For the full year, North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and currency neutral basis led by strong growth in DTC.","EBIT also increased 3%. For the quarter, North America revenue was up 1% on a currency neutral basis and flat to prior year on a reported basis. EBIT grew 5% in the quarter, primarily fueled by gross margin expansion.","As we\u2019ve evidenced over the past several quarters, futures are no longer a reliable proxy for revenue growth and our strategic shifts are amplifying this. As such, we continue to see a high single-digit disparity between revenue growth and futures growth in North America.","While the North America retail landscape remains promotional, we are executing with greater precision. We continue to tightly manage supply and demand and in turn, we delivered margin expansion in the second half and closed the year with inventories down 6%.","In fiscal year 2018, we will more deliberately fuel growth in the direct dimensions of our business, while also more deliberately transforming or transitioning away from other less differentiated and less productive points of distribution. Accordingly, we are planning overall growth in North America for the full fiscal year, with slight contraction in the first part of the year as we aggressively drive the strategic shift.","Our key measures of success in fiscal year \u201818 will include stronger growth in the more direct dimensions of our business, both owned and partnered, healthy expanding margins for the geography overall and continued efficiency in the management of supply and demand.","Now turning to our international geographies. In Western Europe, fiscal year \u201817 currency neutral revenue was up 11% with strong multidimensional growth across DTC and wholesale, footwear and Apparel all territories and nearly every category.","In Q4, revenue increased 12% on a currency neutral basis, led by our Sportswear and Running categories, as well as our Young Athletes business. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue increased 6% and EBIT declined 16% reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin.","Our emerging markets geography also delivered broad-based revenue growth. On a currency neutral basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue grew 14%, led by our Sportswear and Running categories. We also saw double-digit revenue growth across DTC and wholesale, footwear in several territories.","For Q4, currency neutral revenue was up 18%, with double-digit growth in most categories in nearly all territories. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue increased 8% and EBIT increased 9%, as strong revenue growth was offset permanently by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin.","Last, but certainly not least, we continue to see extraordinary momentum in Greater China, as we delivered another record breaking year with over $4 billion in reported revenue and currency neutral revenue growth of 17%.","We saw a strong growth across DTC and wholesale, footwear and Apparel in nearly all categories. Greater China is currently the geography where the NIKE brand is most directly serving the consumer in the marketplace, leveraging NIKE brand at digital and bricks-and-mortar experiences, both owned and partnered to exceed consumer expectations and fuel growth.","For the quarter, currency neutral revenue grew 16%, with double-digit growth in both footwear and Apparel, DTC and wholesale in most categories. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue grew 12% and EBIT expanded 10% as strong revenue growth was slightly offset by lower gross margin, primarily due to transactional FX headwinds.","Now moving to our outlook for fiscal year \u201818 and beyond, given the dynamic operating environment, the strategic shifts we are driving through the Consumer Direct Offense and significant foreign exchange headwinds, we are providing more detail on this call with respect to our financial expectations.","I\u2019ll begin with our currency neutral expectations for fiscal year \u201818, which are an important lens into the underlying health and momentum in our business. For the full year, we expect to deliver currency-neutral revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range. This includes growth across all geographies, led by continued strong growth internationally.","We expect NIKE, Inc. gross margin, excluding the impact of foreign exchange to expand beyond the high-end of our stated long-term goal of 30 basis points to 50 basis points per year. For SG&A, we expect growth in the mid single-digit range. As a result, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit currency neutral EBIT expansion in fiscal year \u201818.","On a reported basis at current rates we anticipate FX will be an approximately $700 million headwind in fiscal year \u201918. As the favorable hedges that mitigated and deferred the impact of adverse currency movements in each of fiscal year \u201816 and \u201817 mature and roll forward. As such, we expect fiscal year \u201818 reported revenue to grow in the mid-single digits.","As for gross margin, we anticipate modest contraction by as much as 50 basis points, with FX having a more pronounced impact on the first half of the fiscal year. We expect SG&A to grow in the mid single-digit range, inclusive of costs related to our leadership and organizational realignment. We expect to incur the majority of those costs in the first half of the fiscal year, with savings being reinvested to fuel growth of our new offense.","Other income and expense, net of interest expense, is expected to be an approximately $30 million to $50 million expense in fiscal year \u201818 and we expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 18% for the full year. Note that the impact of stock option exercises under the newly-adopted ASU 2016-09 may result in increased volatility in our quarterly effective tax rate.","Shifting to the first quarter, it\u2019s important to note that year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by various factors, including the Olympics, European Football Championship, foreign exchange and our exit from the golf equipment business in the prior year.","As such, we expect reported revenue to be flat, which on a normalized basis would be in line with our growth over the past two quarters. We expect gross margin to contract between 150 basis points and 180 basis points driven by FX headwinds. We expect SG&A to grow in the mid single-digit range and for other income net of interest expense, we expect to -- we expect a $10 million to $20 million expense in the first quarter.","Looking out to fiscal year \u201819 and beyond, at current rates, we expect the negative impacts of foreign exchange to be behind us, positioning us to continue delivering strong growth and expanding profitability on a currency neutral operating basis, as well as on a reported basis.","With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Kate McShane from Citi.","Corrina Van Der Ghinst","Hi. Thank you. Corrina Van Der Ghinst on for Kate McShane. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe you could just start off with the -- more detail on the pilot that you guys are doing at Amazon. Do you guys have any color in terms of the timing of the launch, the segmentation focus that you guys are kind of aiming for in terms of price points, are they going to be more comparable to mid-tier premiums, are you guys going to do any -- are you planning on doing any exclusives and just in terms of the timing of why now?","Mark Parker","Okay. Sure. Let me give you some perspective on how we\u2019re looking at our Amazon partnership. First of all, I would start by saying that our overall goal is to elevate the consumer experience by better segmenting and differentiating all of our channels. Just as a backdrop, that\u2019s foundational for NIKE.","Every partner we have ultimately requires a specific approach and in other parts of the world, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re executing with e-commerce platforms like TMall and Zalando. We\u2019ve been doing that for over the past five years.","With Amazon in the U.S., we\u2019re running a pilot that begins with a small product assortment across footwear, Apparel and accessories and what\u2019s most important to us is that we have the opportunity to elevate how the NIKE Brand is presented on the Amazon platform, and that includes the quality of the product information, and of course, providing a simple experience for the consumer. So we\u2019re really looking forward to seeing how this pilot combines, ultimately the convenience that Amazon is well known for with NIKE\u2019s brand and product power.","Trevor Edwards","Yeah. And I\u2019ll just add a couple things around the merchandising strategy. I think one of the things that we have been able to do over many years is really just execute a merchandising strategy that really delivers against a wide range of consumers really across the marketplace. So we\u2019ve always been very thoughtful around how we segment and differentiate with our partners, ensuring that they have the right assortment that allows them to best serve the consumers with the right products and we will continue to do that certainly with this Amazon partnership. As Mark talked about, it is really a small pilot and it\u2019s just a start, and obviously, as we continue to work with them we will -- and we see success then we\u2019ll continue to think about how we scale it.","Corrina Van Der Ghinst","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just my second question, it looks like North American and European footwear both accelerated in the quarter, but Apparel decelerated on a sequential basis. Can you kind of walk us through what you\u2019re seeing in those categories and kind of your expectations for the next couple of quarters in terms of how those are progressing? And then if you could provide some commentary around the current U.S. wholesale environment by channel as you\u2019re seeing it?","Mark Parker","Okay. Yeah. Certainly. Yeah. I want to touch on the Apparel piece first. I think, one of the things that you\u2019re looking at when you look at the Apparel. If you compare it against the prior year, you\u2019re making comparisons when we certainly had the corporate America. So we are seeing, it\u2019s just a tough comparison in Q4, and in North America we\u2019re certainly seeing that because we were doing also there was the promotional activity in the marketplace.","Around Apparel, we continue to feel very bullish about our Apparel business. Obviously, as we go into the first quarter, we\u2019ve got the NBA partnership that we\u2019re launching and we\u2019re bringing some more innovative products. So we\u2019re trying to be excited and positive about our Apparel business. But not only in North America, but if you go around the world, we\u2019re seeing really, it go from strength to strength. So it really is just a great period.","Trevor Edwards","Yeah. If I can just add a little bit of broader context too, it\u2019s obviously no mystery that the U.S. marketplace is undergoing quite a transformation. The consumer is leading a lot of that change and we see that really as a great opportunity. For us, it always starts with product. That\u2019s how the consumer ultimately casts their vote.","And the good news, I think, from our perspective is that the product that we\u2019ve got in the pipeline as we mentioned is as strong as it\u2019s ever been across quite a spectrum. Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s, young, adult\u2019s, retro, modern, performance and Sportswear, so feeling good about our complete offense on the product side.","But the important point is that product isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s about better services and experiences and that\u2019s why we believe in this Consumer Direct Offense, I think, enabled by our Express Lane and then creating more disruption through digital. And then a lot of the great work we\u2019re doing to scale some of the app-based commerce that we\u2019re doing. So it\u2019s a very dynamic environment there, but we feel really good, we\u2019re doing what we need to operate a healthy business.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Corrina. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question, guys. I was hoping you could maybe help us understand, how you\u2019re going to execute some of these really exciting Consumer Direct Offense strategies. The Express Lane, everything you\u2019ve got going on the NIKE+ membership side and given that so much of your business is still in that kind of tradition channel points-of-sale and the distribution used there, how do you -- can you integrate some of these new strategies with that wholesale backdrop or is it really something that\u2019s more refined and left to sit more predominantly in your DTC business?","Mark Parker","Well, let me just start, Omar, with a little broader backdrop and these changes that we\u2019re making around our Consumer Direct Offense are really about accelerating our growth potential. We\u2019ve never really been about sustaining the status quo. It\u2019s not a winning proposition. This consumer led offense for us is about getting sharper. It\u2019s about getting more focused. And it\u2019s about, as we\u2019ve said, accelerating growth through the direct connections and then the elevated experiences in targeted channels and markets.","So -- and as I\u2019ve mentioned, it\u2019s about innovation and storytelling, editing and focusing and we have a lot of opportunity there. We have to be better editors. I\u2019m really confident that we are. We\u2019re targeting some of the better innovation stories and doing a better job, I think of leveraging and scaling those across multiple categories and then we\u2019ve got to move faster and that\u2019s part of what this offense is all about. So we\u2019re looking at going half -- taking half of the time out of design to shelf to the consumer and that\u2019s a big step forward and we\u2019re looking and continuing to scale that over time.","So there\u2019s growth if you look at it in all dimensions of our business and that includes channels as well. But as Andy mentioned, our focus is going to be pushing for the shift to direct where we have elevated experiences and that includes, as you mentioned, some of the app-based commerce that we\u2019re working on.","Some of the biggest growth that we\u2019re seeing is in dotcom and some of the biggest growth on dotcom is really through mobile and the biggest growth on mobile is on app-based commerce, so incredibly exciting things happening there. So, overall, we\u2019re incredibly energized, excited for ourselves, but also bringing our strategic partners and the rest of the industry along.","Trevor Edwards","Yeah. Mark, a couple of things I\u2019d just add to that, which is one of the things that we\u2019ve certainly seen in the landscape is the cities are really the center of the action where you\u2019re seeing really trends drive from the city. You\u2019re also seeing the acceleration of expectations in those cities. So one of the things that we did with our Consumer Direct Offense is we have a real complete offense in the key cities. What we mean by that specifically is before we had brand teams and maybe marketplace teams.","Now we have complete teams from product to digital to creative teams to membership teams all based in the city and this is a big shift. And this is where they are able to really use the knowledge that they get around the trends in the marketplace to drive that connection with the Express Lane to create specific products to ensure that we could drive the business not only in that city but really across the market.","So for us it\u2019s a very, very important piece. I think the other part that we did with the reorganization is we really put categories, design, products and merchandise all together as a full unit and their job is to ensure that we create the most innovative products and concepts that gets driven all the way through the market and then also we combined DTC with our digital organization.","So now they\u2019re one unit and so we have a really a one way that the consumer wants to come through the journey of a direct connection with the brand, we\u2019re able to now serve them both physically and digitally. So we\u2019re super excited about this and it really does create an incredible opportunity for us to drive growth.","Omar Saad","That\u2019s helpful. And then a quick follow up on the NIKE+ membership, sounds like that\u2019s really starting to accelerate. Can you give us some color what you\u2019re learning about how those NIKE+ members behave relative to just an ordinary customer and you also mention, I think, you\u2019re going to accelerate some of the features and benefits of that program?","Trevor Edwards","Yeah. Thanks for that. I mean, we\u2019ve really seen just great, really great progress with NIKE+, both the sneakers app. What we\u2019ve certainly seen is that they triple that they -- spend three times as much members on the apps versus those who just come through as sort of an everyday consumer. So membership really has tremendous benefits for us and from a business perspective and we are driving that commercially.","We will also be expanding that really across into Western Europe, as well as in China and Japan, because it has predominately been within North America and that\u2019s really just the start. I mean, we see a tremendous opportunity here and like I mentioned in the opening remarks, consumers expect more from us around membership and we have a lot more coming. So we couldn\u2019t be more excited as the months go ahead. So stay tuned. It\u2019s going to be fun.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Omar. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next\u2026","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good luck.","Mark Parker","Thanks. We will take the next question please, operator.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good evening.","Mark Parker","Hi, Bob.","Bob Drbul","I guess the first question that I have is around the three new platforms when you look at some of the bigger platforms and the more recent platforms prior to these, they ramped pretty quickly, I think, achieving a $1 billion faster and faster. Do you have any expectation on how quickly some of these can get to the scale you\u2019re talking about in the next few years?","Andy Campion","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question, Bob. This is Andy. In the past you\u2019ve seen platforms ranging from Free to Lunar to Flyknit. Start with a bit of a ceding based approach as we assessed consumer demand and we took the exact same approach with the Air VaporMax and the ZoomX platform, which was part of the Breaking2 initiative, which is start with a healthy amount of supply, but get a read for consumer demand and as we said, those products sold out within hours in multiple color ways.","And so we, much like some of the most compelling innovations we\u2019ve launched in the past, you\u2019ll see us ramping those up or scaling those pretty significantly and that\u2019s not just the same styles that we launch, but taking the actual innovation, the Air and the ZoomX cushioning system across price points and frankly across categories.","Trevor Edwards","Yeah. I have to say, I love how the CFO jumps in on the product questions. Let me just quickly add that the focus on scaling and leveraging platforms is a big focus for us, and one of the things it\u2019s going to drive growth, and one of the things that this new organization, I think, is going to enable editing and focusing on those biggest opportunities to scale in the innovation arena is absolutely critical.","Air VaporMax is an incredible opportunity, as we\u2019ve seen, not only in performance, but in style. It\u2019s bringing those two worlds together and obviously the consumers\u2019 responded very well there. A lot of excitement around ZoomX, as I talked about and where that can go. We\u2019re just seeing the very frontend.","I\u2019ve talked about React. We\u2019re just starting to come to market with some React products and that\u2019s got massive potential, and there\u2019s frankly a couple of others that have huge scale potential that I did not mention and I probably won\u2019t go any further right now. But that we\u2019re really excited about.","And then we have Flyknit, which getting outside of footwear for a minute and looking at Flyknit\u2019s potential to scale in Apparel is tremendous. Some real performance breakthroughs there that also combine innovation and style. I know I say this, but honestly, I\u2019ve never felt as energized by what we have from an innovation standpoint coming in the pipeline and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so confident.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And then could I just ask like a couple of quick questions on the Amazon announcement? Is -- when you think about opening Amazon Direct, does that change your view on the NIKE 2020 targets of your DTC and your NIKE.com to $16 billion and $7 billion and is it a global pilot and will Jordan product be included in there?","Trevor Edwards","It\u2019s -- like we said, right now, it\u2019s really a small pilot and we have a very tailored assortment for Amazon, so that we can actually learn as we go through this. In terms of looking forward, obviously, we have tremendous plans to continue to grow our NIKE.com business and what we talked is we\u2019re rolling out certainly the apps, not only around the world, but also accelerating the work that we\u2019re doing on that. So you can expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace.","So we\u2019re not giving any further guidance at this point in time, but we certainly feel confident about the growth that we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s really is part of our Triple Double Strategy. And so the Amazon piece is just one element of how we serve the broader market by making sure that we are serving consumers wherever they choose to shop and making sure that that\u2019s through our doors, through our wholesale partners, as well as through platforms. So we\u2019re really looking to make sure we serve the consumer in the appropriate way.","Mark Parker","And we expect the digital commerce platforms to be a bigger part of the picture going forward not just here in the U.S., but around the world. We\u2019ve mentioned Zalando and TMall, but that\u2019s going to be a bigger part of the picture for us.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Mark Parker","All right. Thanks, Bob. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Hello, everyone.","Mark Parker","Hi, Jim.","Jim Duffy","Mark, my question is for you around efforts to compress a product timeline and speed time to market to improve responsiveness. What are the steps in the product development cycle that offer the most opportunity for time savings, is it more on the design and pre-production side or is it more related to manufacturing logistics?","Mark Parker","Yeah. That\u2019s a good question. And really -- the answer really is there\u2019s opportunity in every segment of the product creation process through the supply chain, part of it is in better planning, part of it is in better editing of the product itself and also the product line in general. But everything from rapid prototyping on the very frontend, all the way through some of the modernization techniques in automation that we\u2019re pioneering with partners like Flex, HP, for example, are going to be critical factors there. But part of this is really staging, the innovation, tooling related, making sure that some of the more time intensive parts of the process or that\u2019s where we apply the innovation to cut those timelines down tremendously.","And we\u2019ve already talked about the three different dimensions of Express Lane. I touched on update, fulfill and then create. And across those three dimensions, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity. Update and fulfill is more straightforward because that\u2019s existing product that we can rally behind quickly, and then create is all about accelerating the whole process from end to end.","But again, I\u2019m really excited about some real step change innovation that the Express Lane work is going to enable and also our advance product creation center here in Beaverton with our key manufacturing innovation partners.","Jim Duffy","As a follow-up to that, can you maybe build on that with comments about opportunities to use data to better anticipate consumer demand and how that dovetails with the speed to market initiatives?","Mark Parker","Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. In that zone, one of the things, which is a huge, let\u2019s say, benefit of the consumer direct strategy is to have better knowledge of the consumers. It\u2019s one of the things that we continue to work on, which is to be able to have a better read on the demand from the consumers and then turn that demand directly into how we come back and give them the person they actually want.","The part about membership is that we also get to know who actually wants what and what they desire so that\u2019s part of the vision that we\u2019re working through, which is why data is fundamentally important to understanding the consumer, who\u2019s buying, why they\u2019re buying, what they want, what is trending and how we can then put all that information back into our product creation cycle quickly to then bring, so we can scale against those opportunities, so it\u2019s a key piece.","Trevor Edwards","That\u2019s -- actually this is a huge part of NIKE\u2019s future, and frankly, many, many other companies is capturing and interpreting that data, turning it into insights, personalizing services, experience, and of course, products. And that\u2019s going to happen at the local level and then we\u2019re going to aggregate that more effectively at the Inc. level.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Jim.","Jim Duffy","Thank you very much.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Jim. Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question.","Operator","The last question is from Matthew McClintock from Barclays.","Matthew McClintock","Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Mark Parker","Hi.","Matthew McClintock","On brand Jordan, I was actually wondering if we could talk about brand Jordan, continued strong growth there, $3 billion of revenue, as you look into fiscal \u201818, what makes you most excited about the opportunities for that brand specifically and then can you talk more about your efforts to transcend the brand beyond its basketball roots and into other product categories such as Apparel? Thanks.","Trevor Edwards","Yeah. Certainly. Obviously we continue to be truly excited about the opportunity of brand Jordan and how brand Jordan continues to perform. So it had a great year and we envision that it will have a great year next year again. One of the areas that we continue to work on is expanding the different consumer groups that we connect with.","One clear opportunity for us is certainly the women\u2019s business, which we see tremendous passion for the brand coming through there, so we will grow the business there in addition to continuing to drive its connection with Basketball, so the NBA partnership actually allows us to do some things with brand Jordan. So we\u2019re very, very excited there.","And we will continue to actually sign more athletes and teams against that business. So we recently did UNC Football, so all of those are really just examples of how we\u2019re expanding the actual positioning of that brand to tap into new consumer groups.","Andy Campion","$3 billion is an impressive milestone for Jordan, but the international potential for growth is, as we mentioned is really significant going forward. Apparel is still underpenetrated and then as Trevor mentioned, categories beyond Basketball and Sportswear are wide open. The Jordan brand has a huge base, a huge following not just here in the U.S. but around the world, so we\u2019re excited about capitalizing on that and taking the brand to more people around the world. So this is a huge growth opportunity for NIKE going forward.","Trevor Edwards","Yeah. I didn\u2019t mention Apparel and Apparel also continues to grow at a tremendous rate. So again, just great opportunity around that portfolio and we\u2019re absolutely committed to seeing it grow around the world.","Andy Campion","It\u2019s also a place where we can leverage NIKE technology and NIKE innovation in a new way. We can interpret that through the Jordan lens and that creates more opportunity for us as well.","Matthew McClintock","Thanks a lot.","Mark Parker","All right. Well, thank you, Matt. I think that\u2019s all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us and we\u2019ll speak with you next quarter. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thank you, Kelley and hello everyone and happy holidays. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We continue to show that we have the ability to drive both profitable growth and significant shareholder value over the long-term.","Let\u2019s take a look at the highlights from the second quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 4% to $7.7 billion, despite continued FX headwinds. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 12%. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points and earnings per share increased 22% to $0.90. The success you see today and the opportunities ahead are driven by the strength of our portfolio. NIKE has many dimensions to our business and together they are operating powerfully and efficiently.","We are connecting deeply with consumers through products and experiences and capturing value through our strategies and investments. Our complete offense, which includes our brands, geographies and categories, makes us flexible and keeps us close to the consumer so we can see AND act on new opportunities in real time. We see it in the markets we transform like China and Western Europe and in the businesses we accelerate like Women\u2019s and the Jordan brand. Our operational scale is second to none. We have the power to grow the entire marketplace and innovate through a global supply chain that shipped roughly 1.1 billion units last year.","And as we have shown consistently, everything we do is executed with a sharp focus and a financial discipline. We have a proven track record of delivering top line growth; expanding profitability; and maintaining a high return on invested capital. And because we drive consistent, profitable growth, we are able to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. For example, we recently announced a 4-year, $12 billion share repurchase program. We increased our annual cash dividend for the 14th year in a row and we announced a two-for-one stock split. It\u2019s clear we have the right plan in place against the backdrop of a global movement of fitness and sports. It\u2019s all adding up to incredible momentum for our business. But we are never fully satisfied. More than ever, we are focused on the areas where we can continue to get better and making the necessary changes to ensure we continue to drive strong, profitable growth for the long-term.","The force behind today\u2019s results and our future potential is of course innovation. Our obsession and relentless drive to be better is at the core of our culture and our strategy. And as you know, it starts with product. We invent breakthroughs then build the thriving business around them. We told you during our Investor Day how we have built Flyknit from a concept to a billion dollar platform in just 4 years. This is the kind of search for scalable innovation that\u2019s going on everyday at NIKE. And just as important is our focus on bringing innovations to market in a directive and productive way through merchandising and marketplace management, across all channels and multiple price points.","Innovation is also fueled by partnerships. When we partner, it can be like setting off a chain reaction leading us to new and better ideas more quickly. It\u2019s why we value our relationships with athletes, NIKE\u2019s original and most important collaborators. Our relationships with thousands of athletes, teams and federations do more than build our brand. They give us personal access to their insights and the science behind the problems they need to solve. That\u2019s why we work with the best athletes like LeBron and Serena, Cristiano along with everyday athletes frankly like the rest of us. Partnerships also play a critical role in creating and expanding the marketplace. With our longstanding wholesale partners, we give consumers broad access to NIKE and together, we segment and differentiate our assortments to drive mutually profitable retail.","At NIKE, collaboration is also a powerful strategy for activating new ways to work. As the clear leader in our industry, we align ourselves with leaders in other industries. To that end, we announced two new partnerships in October. The first is DreamWorks and their technology company called NOVA. With this partnership, we have combined the expertise of two design leaders, NIKE with the human body in motion and DreamWorks with the animated body in motion. I have been talking with our design teams and they see great potential in NOVA\u2019s platforms to advance our creation process in capability, precision and speed.","The second is FLEX. Many of you know about the impressive work that FLEX does. They are already accelerating our manufacturing revolution efforts. It\u2019s in the early stages yet, but in one specific process they have combined automated material management with automated laser cutting, which can reduce waste by up to 50%. This is just one example of many that are in development. And what we learn from FLEX, we expect to scale across our broad global source base. For the consumer, our partnership has the potential to expand their list of choices and accelerate delivery times from weeks to days. Both partnerships are at intersection of another vital innovation driver and that\u2019s digital. At NIKE, digital does more than just add capabilities for today. It defines how consumers will experience the NIKE Brand moving forward. It\u2019s an accelerator across our business in product through the supply chain, in analytics and all the way to retail.","A few weeks ago, we shared our long-term vision for e-commerce growth, $7 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year 20. In Q2, we continued our accelerated pace, growing the NIKE.com business nearly 50% on a constant currency basis. We added Canada, Switzerland and Norway to our expanding list of e-commerce markets. And next quarter, we are planning to do the same for the sport-obsessed cultures of Mexico, Turkey and Chile. When we expand our NIKE.com footprint, it gives new consumers access to the best of NIKE and it drives great energy for our business. We have focused our investments in digital and mobile over the last several years and they are paying off. Driving the connection of NIKE.com to our broader digital strategy continues to be, without a doubt, one of our greatest opportunities as a company.","Digital, of course, also allows us to deepen the relationships we already have with consumers by tailoring every interaction to their specific needs. Through NIKE+ we have created an ecosystem that gives athletes access to their fitness history, training programs, and their favorite gear every time they connect with NIKE. We started on this journey 10 years ago with NIKE+ and we have continued to evolve the digital experience for consumers through multiple sports in the world\u2019s most important markets in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s.","You will hear more from us about this space later in the fiscal year, but we are continuing our never ending quest to make the digital experience simple and personal. Simple, moving toward one access point for the best of NIKE and personal more and more tailored to the individual. We are now entering one of the most exciting periods of sport. The second half of fiscal \u201816 is filled with some of the world\u2019s greatest sports moments, Super Bowl 50, the NBA All Star Weekend, March Madness, COPA America, Euro 16 and of course, the run up to the Rio Olympics. In these moments, like the athletes we serve, NIKE is at the top of our game. And this year, you will see NIKE unlock innovation for athletes like never before. We have a full pipeline that will help Olympic athletes change the course of their sports and experiences that will change how all athletes train and run. I am proud of this quarter and our incredible team behind the results. They are the reason NIKE continues to drive growth and value for our shareholders. And like me, they are all focused on continuing our momentum and delivering inspiring innovation to athletes everywhere for years to come.","Thank you everyone. And now, here is Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays everyone. The NIKE Brand delivered another impressive quarter demonstrating the tremendous momentum of the NIKE Brand. Let\u2019s take a look at the numbers.","On a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue grew 13%, with double-digit growth across every geography and most key categories. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 26%, driven by 13% comp store growth, continued strong growth in online sales, up 49% and new store expansion. And we are very pleased with the continued strength in Global Futures, up 20%. As always, these results are due to NIKE\u2019s world class ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. Those connections let us see the biggest growth opportunities and then sharpen our focus to best attack them. It\u2019s these powerful relationships that drive our Category Offense providing us insights to create the innovative products, meaningful services and inspiring experiences that athletes all over the world love.","Let me highlight three categories that demonstrate this powerful consumer focus. Let\u2019s first take a look at running. Running is our largest performance category and continues to deliver strong results, with Q2 revenue growing at a double-digit rate. At NIKE, we know that running never stops. No matter the season, no matter the conditions, we provide solutions to help runners get out and pursue their goals. This quarter, with winter setting in, we released our Flash Pack collection, which offers a reflective print to keep runners visible and warm in low-light conditions. The Flash Pack includes apparel such as the Aeroloft Flash Vest and the Shield\u2019s Flash Running Jacket, as well as great footwear, including the popular Air Zoom Pegasus and the Air Zoom Structure 19. All told, this collection offers yet another great example of how NIKE innovates to expand the market.","Other running footwear successes in Q2 include the launch of the Air Zoom Odyssey, which offers three densities of foam for maximum stability and support and the Air Max 2016, with its complete cushioning and durable ride, thanks to a full length Max Air unit. At the same time, as part of our continued Amplify strategy, we expand off performance with pinnacle sportswear product, to enable our consumers to express their love of sport. Part of this strategy is a constant focus on sports style innovation. In our running-inspired sportswear, we are driving a steady stream of great products with strong sell-through. These include the Tech Pack and the Tech Fleece Aeroloft apparel styles as well as the continued success of the Roshe and the new Air Max ULTRA line.","Finally, our pinnacle products are always complemented by unique experiences as only NIKE can do. Every year, Q2 is the season for some of the most popular running events, including the Shanghai Marathon and the Women\u2019s Half Marathon in San Francisco. The enthusiasm we see at these races echoes throughout our entire running category year after year.","Next, basketball. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with basketball fans through two of the largest, most powerful brands in the world, NIKE and Jordan. Together, we have the deepest roster of athletes and the most global reach with federations and leagues around the world. As we said in October, we will start breaking out the Jordan Brand separately from NIKE Basketball. So, I will give you a few highlights from both.","In NIKE Basketball, we saw mid single-digit growth in Q2, fueled by key products such as the Kyrie 1. This product delivers responsive cushioning with Zoom Air and ultra-support with the Hyperfuse construction and it has seen tremendous sell-through since the launch a year ago. And just last week, the launch of the Kyrie 2 has already seen strong consumer response, with a first-of-its-kind curved midsole and outsole, designed to enhance the rapid cuts that players make on the court.","Another example of basketball innovation is the recently introduced Kobe 11, a high-performance low-top that utilizes the latest Flyknit technology for lightweight strength, a stronger iteration to achieve peak performance. Our athletes always serve as an amazing source of inspiration for us, from LeBron and KD to young players having incredible seasons, like Paul George and Anthony Davis. These athletes and more are featured in our latest basketball campaign, Bring Your Game. This campaign will launch in full on Christmas day to inspire and motivate young players to bring their best to the court every single day.","And speaking of great athletes featured in the campaign, Elena Delle Donne won the WNBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player, which was awarded just before the launch of our new Women\u2019s Basketball collection. The sell-through has been beyond strong, and with women making up roughly 40% of basketball players, we are just scratching the surface of how we can serve this growing community. As we continue to sharpen our focus on running a complete offense in NIKE Basketball, we are excited about the deep pipeline of products we will be bringing to the market in the coming seasons, all of which help us capture the significant potential that lies ahead.","Now, for the Jordan Brand, this is the start of an exciting new era for Jordan. Even as we expand this brand both globally and into other categories, Jordan\u2019s basketball products continue to be the most coveted and premium on the market. This brand proves, time and again, its ability to combine its iconic silhouettes with fresh styles. For Q2, Jordan delivered strong double-digit growth, with the new CP3.IX and the launch of the Air Jordan XX9 Low driving incredible consumer response. Like NIKE Basketball, Jordan has a deep roster of elite players, including Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook. What\u2019s more, in October, Michael Jordan himself visited basketball fans in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo to celebrate the brand\u2019s 30th anniversary, helping to ignite the culture of basketball around the world. His visit drove strong consumer engagement with the new Jordan House of Flight in Shanghai and the flight training camps for young players across the markets. These cultural moments prove what we already know that the power of this brand extends well beyond the game. All of this excitement can be seen at retail, highlighted by the Jordan executions with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and the energy-packed opening of our new Jordan store on State Street in Chicago, a great execution with Foot Action. This store will operate as a pinnacle retail experience celebrating the performance, style and soul of the brand. What\u2019s more, directly above the store, is a training lab serving elite high school athletes in the local area. Our consumers\u2019 passion for both the NIKE and Jordan brands is driving tremendous energy and driving tremendous energy and speaks to the significant opportunity that remains for our Basketball business around the world.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at a few of our key geographies. North America had another strong quarter, with revenues up 10% and futures up 14%. This geography continues to drive strong growth across most key categories. Whilst this is our most developed market, North America proves that the right strategies can drive consistent profitable growth. Our brand in North America has never been stronger with men, with women, with athletes in all sports. We are seeing continued strong demand across our executions with wholesale partners such as Foot Locker and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. Our own DTC business also had another strong quarter, up 17%, led by ongoing strength in NIKE.com and comp store growth.","As we have discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work effectively to manage the flow of product in North America and efficiently clear excess inventory. We are also continuing to work to bring our new North American distribution center fully online. Both of these efforts are making good progress. We expect inventory levels in North America to normalize over the balance of the fiscal year as we continue to take appropriate actions to maintain a healthy pull market for the NIKE Brand. Looking ahead, we see nothing, but long-term potential for our North American business.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Western Europe, where we see broad-based demand with strong revenue growth of 12% in the quarter and futures up 25%. We fueled growth in Q2 by continuing to transform the marketplace along the Category Offense with elevated executions at JD Sports, Foot Locker and Intersport. In addition, our own DTC business delivered 26% growth in the quarter. This growth from Western Europe is what we have come to expect with key categories of Sportswear and Global Football showing continued strength. This momentum has solidified NIKE as the region\u2019s most coveted sports brand with strong growth across all territories. This geography wide market growth, coupled with market share gains, proves the clear success of our efforts in Western Europe and the vast potential this geography offers for years to come.","In the emerging markets, we are seeing improved revenue growth, with Q2 revenues up 11% and futures growth of 14%. Growth in the quarter was driven by most territories, with particular strength in Mexico as we continued to benefit from our recent efforts over the last year. We also saw strong growth in the key categories of sportswear and running. Now, in Brazil, revenue was down 6%, reflective of the continued challenges in the macroeconomic landscape. Our brand remains strong in Brazil and we are gaining share as we remain focused on our strategy of resetting the market along the category offense. As we focus on differentiating our points of distribution and proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, retail inventory levels in Brazil remain healthy.","We continue to focus on creating more compelling consumer experiences at retail and online and driving increased productivity and profitability for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Overall, we continue to see tremendous long-term growth potential for the emerging markets, and we remain focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to capture that growth.","Lastly, Greater China had another amazing quarter, with revenue growth of 28%. The strength of the NIKE Brand is fueling strong consumer demand with futures up 34% in a marketplace that continues to be very healthy. We saw strong growth across nearly all categories in the quarter, led by Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball. We also saw a continued strong growth from our own DTC business, up 51% in the quarter, fueled in part by our most successful Singles Day event ever. And NIKE.com is showing extraordinary growth in China in one of the most mobile and connected countries on the planet. The success we\u2019re seeing today in China stems from decisions we made of just a few years ago to align our teams against the biggest opportunities to drive growth with our category offense. By staying focused and diligent, we continue to lead the market as the region\u2019s most coveted sports brand, and we see significantly more opportunity ahead.","2015 was the single greatest calendar year ever for the NIKE Brand. It proves yet again that we have the product, the services and the brand experiences that consumers want. And as we find new ways to surprise and delight athletes around the world, there\u2019s no telling what we can do. I can\u2019t wait for 2016 and the inspiration and innovation I know we are going to bring.","And now, here is Andy. Thank you.","Andy Campion","Thanks, Mark and Trevor and happy holidays to everyone on the call. Q2 was another strong quarter for NIKE. We delivered on our goals in terms of both top line growth and profitability. We also continued to have strong momentum across our uniquely diverse global portfolio of businesses. We are driving and delivering these strong financial results even amidst a volatile macroeconomic environment and we continue to do so by one, staying relentlessly focused on creating value for our consumers, leading with innovation; two, effectively managing all of the operating and financial levers within our business to capture value for NIKE; and three, deploying our capital strategically to fuel long-term growth while also consistently expanding total returns to shareholders.","I will briefly touch on how we delivered against each of those three dimensions within the quarter. First, by executing the Category Offense, we continue to more deeply serve and create value for our consumers around the world. In Q2, that translated into double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographies on a currency-neutral basis. As both Mark and Trevor highlighted, we served consumers through the launch of innovative new products in multiple categories and we also scaled recent product innovations such as Tech Pack, Aeroloft and Flyknit more broadly across our performance categories and Sportswear. At the same time, we continue to transform where and how we serve our consumers leading with the expansion of NIKE.com while also scaling premium category-oriented retail experiences with our partners around the world.","In Q2, we also effectively managed all of the operating and financial levers within our business to translate our strong top line growth into expanding profitability. That included gross margin expansion through sustained strategic pricing and product cost management as well as leveraging productivity gains to ensure we deliver appropriate near-term profitability while also continuing to make the investments required to fuel our long-term growth. Those investments included, for example, accelerating our investment in product innovation, building critical operating infrastructure within our supply chain and from a technology perspective and investing to maintain a healthy pull market in North America in service of the continued strong demand for our brand. What sets NIKE apart in terms of operating and financial management is our ability to strike the right balance between the short and the long-term. Our goal is to win now and create the future. And the breadth and depth of our global portfolio of businesses affords us the flexibility to strike that balance quarter after quarter, year after year.","Finally, as we created value for consumers and captured that value for NIKE, we also continued to deliver significant value to our shareholders. Our top priority in terms of the use of our cash will remain reinvesting in our business against opportunities to drive growth and strong returns. That\u2019s what we call the virtuous cycle that sustains NIKE\u2019s leadership position and expands the value of our enterprise. The strong cash flows that we generate also allow us to consistently increase our cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Mark touched on, in the second quarter, we announced a new $12 billion 4-year share repurchase program and a 14% increase in our cash dividend. Over the last 15 years, we have sustained strategic investment in the business while also returning nearly $25 billion to shareholders. That is a track record that we are proud of and one that we will continue to build upon.","Now, I will turn to a more detailed review of our Q2 financial results. Q2 reported revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 4% and grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis as growth was strong across all geographies and nearly all categories. Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis as growth in North America and Asia-Pacific was more than offset by declines in Europe, particularly the UK.","Also on a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand futures orders grew 20%, reflecting continued strong demand, driven by a 12% increase in units, with an increase in average selling prices contributing 8 percentage points. Our futures growth reflects the strength of our brand and business around the globe, with all geographies growing at a double-digit pace. On a reported basis, futures grew 15%, taking into account the stronger U.S. dollar against nearly all international currencies.","Q2 diluted EPS grew 22% to $0.90, despite significant FX headwinds. EPS growth was driven by strong top line growth, gross margin expansion and effective financial management across all of the levers through to the bottom line. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 45.6%, primarily driven by higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher product input costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. Q2 demand creation was flat, reflecting favorability from the quarterly timing of our investments in the current versus prior year. Operating overhead increased 7% for the quarter, driven by costs associated with strong growth in our DTC business and investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-facing digital capabilities.","Our effective tax rate was 19.1% for Q2, lower than prior year, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions in the prior year and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside the U.S. in the current year which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Those favorable factors were partially offset by benefits from the resolution of several tax audits recognized in the prior year.","As of November 30, our inventories were up 11%, primarily to support strong wholesale and owned retail demand as reflected in our futures orders. Overall, our inventories continue to be healthy around the world. As we noted last quarter, our inventory in North America will be somewhat elevated over the balance of the fiscal year as we proactively manage the marketplace. More expeditiously, clearing high-quality but excess inventory, while bringing a strong pipeline of new innovative products to the market over the same horizon. These efforts will unfavorably impact gross margin in the near term which is reflected in our guidance for the balance of this fiscal year.","Now, let\u2019s review our performance by segment. North America revenue grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit revenue growth across many of our largest categories including Jordan, Sportswear, Running and Men\u2019s Training. We continue to experience strong consumer demand for the NIKE Brand in North America as evidenced by futures growth of 14%. On a reported basis, North America grew 9% and EBIT grew 12% as revenue growth and SG&A leverage more than offset a slight decline in gross margin, resulting from the clearance of inventory.","Moving on to Western Europe, revenue increased 12% on a currency-neutral basis driven by double-digit growth in every territory. The implementation of our Category Offense across jurisdictional lines continues to drive strong and sustainable growth for NIKE in this geography. Most categories delivered strong growth, led by Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 1% due to weakness in the euro. However, EBIT increased 18%, primarily driven by gross margin expansion.","In Central and Eastern Europe, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in most territories, except Greece, which declined. Most categories also grew double digits, led by Sportswear, Running and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue declined 6%, reflecting significantly weaker currencies, in particular, the ruble and the Turkish lira. However, EBIT grew 33% due to strong gross margin expansion.","In Greater China, we continue to deliver extraordinary revenue growth, with Q2 revenue up 28% on a currency-neutral basis. The NIKE Brand continues to lead in China, transforming the marketplace to better serve consumers. As a result, our growth is strong across nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running, Nike Basketball and Jordan. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue increased 24% and EBIT grew 27% due to very strong revenue growth, coupled with gross margin expansion.","In our emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue increased 11% on a currency-neutral basis as most territories delivered strong growth in the quarter, driven by Soco, Mexico and Pacific while Brazil declined. Nearly every key category also grew in the quarter, led by Sportswear and Running. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue declined 8% for the quarter due to foreign currency headwinds while EBIT increased 2%, reflecting strong gross margin expansion. While we have momentum in most territories within the emerging markets, as Trevor discussed, we are continuing to reset Brazil. While we are taking share and inventory levels at retail are healthy, our focus is on fueling long-term growth through more elevated category experiences in that marketplace.","Shifting from the NIKE Brand to Converse, Converse revenue declined 5% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, with growth in North America and other developing markets offset by declines in certain European countries, primarily the UK. The Converse brand remains incredibly strong around the world. And to help realize the full potential of the brand going forward, we\u2019re more actively leveraging NIKE capabilities and innovation platforms to diversify the Converse product portfolio as well as elevate our operating capabilities in recently transitioned international markets. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 8%, primarily due to the weaker euro and EBIT decreased 3% for the quarter driven primarily by lower revenue and gross margin.","NIKE Inc. delivered strong financial performance over the first half of fiscal year \u201816 and we have significant momentum across our global portfolio. As a result, our outlook for the full year remains consistent. Specifically, for Q3, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate, reflecting mid-teens growth on a currency-neutral basis somewhat offset by the impact of the strong dollar. While our futures growth is higher than our Q3 revenue guidance, it is important to remember that revenue expectations in any given fiscal period can be impacted by several factors, including, for example, the weighting of futures by month, the flow of product into the market within a season, the timing of shipments to our wholesale customers as well as the timing of sell-through to our consumers in our DTC business. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth will be in the mid single-digit range.","We expect gross margin for Q3 to be down by about 50 basis points, reflecting our efforts to more expeditiously clear inventory in North America while bringing new innovative products to market. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margin to expand by about 50 basis points, reflecting our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, combined with our current expectations for Q3 and Q4.","For total SG&A, we expect Q3 to grow at a low to mid-teens rate, reflecting our continued investments in DTC, consumer-facing digital capabilities, infrastructure and key brand events such as Super Bowl 50, the NBA All-Star Weekend and the timing of brand campaigns in support of select strategic categories. For the full year, we continue to expect total SG&A will grow at a high single-digit rate. We continue to anticipate that other income will have a more meaningful impact on our fiscal year \u201816 results than we have seen historically, as a portion of our expected FX hedge gains are reported in this line item. Absent further changes in FX, we expect other income will be about $30 million for each of the next two quarters. We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% for the full year, reflecting the lower rate in the first half of the fiscal year and an average rate of about 22% for the second half of the fiscal year.","Q2 was another quarter of strong revenue growth and expanding profitability for NIKE. As we embark on the second half of our fiscal year, we have brand and business momentum. We are on the offense and we will remain disciplined financially, as always, to ensure that we deliver appropriate growth and profitability in the near-term while also investing strategically for the long-term. NIKE is on track to deliver another year of strong financial performance and returns to shareholders.","With that, we will now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good evening. Happy holidays.","Kelley Hall","Hey, Bob.","Mark Parker","Hi, Bob.","Bob Drbul","I guess just a couple of questions. The first one really is when you look at the \u2013 I think the futures orders going into the next six months and specifically, China and Japan, can you just elaborate a little bit more in terms of what\u2019s the acceleration that\u2019s going on there? And I guess how you plan to run the business, reinvest in the business or leverage some of that strong revenue growth?","Mark Parker","Sure, Bob. I was just continue to say that as it relates actually both to China and also Japan, I think first let\u2019s start with in both markets we have incredible brand strength in both of those markets. And in China specifically, as you recall, we spent time resetting the marketplace and we are now seeing the results of that reset really take place. They had an incredible quarter. I was actually just recently there. We are seeing just great growth across the Sportswear, the Running, the Basketball business, the dotcom business is doing exceptionally well. And so also working with our key partners, the transformation efforts that we put in place are actually now really, really working well. So, we see great sell-through in the market and we see really good health of the inventory. So, all the dimensions really would say that China is in a great place. We feel confident about the long-term potential of the market. Similarly in Japan, with the futures, what we are certainly seeing in Japan is that they went through similar efforts to really make sure we stayed focused on the brand. We have an incredible pipeline of products come in. The DTC, the dotcom business is doing exceptionally well there too, and we continue to work with our partners really well, so a similar story in those marketplaces. Obviously, I think it all stems from great brand strength that gives us real great confidence about the long-term potential of both of those markets.","Bob Drbul","Great. And I just had like one other additional question. So, when you look over sort of the medium to longer term, do you think you will get more value out of the LeBron lifetime contract or the $12 billion buyback program?","Kelley Hall","Both of those will add value, Bob.","Mark Parker","We are bullish on both products. No question. A fool\u2019s compromise.","Bob Drbul","Alright. Thanks very much. Good luck to you guys. Happy holidays.","Mark Parker","Cheers.","Operator","The next question is from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","Hi, thank you. Happy holidays.","Kelley Hall","Hi, Kate.","Mark Parker","Hi, Kate.","Kate McShane","Excuse me, my question was around inventories. I know this has been in North America, something you have highlighted at least in the last quarter. Can you give us any more indication of what these inventories are the composition of them? Is it in a particular category? Is it across the board? Any kind of additional insight and any more detail on how you will be working through that in the third quarter?","Mark Parker","Sure thing. Overall, the excess inventory in North America is really current fresh product and the largest portion of that really stems from the residual impact of the West Coast port congestion earlier this year. And it really consists of basically part of that was delayed. We proactively delayed some products in favor of priority products that we felt that would actually work well in the marketplace. A smaller portion of the product is the stuff that didn\u2019t sell through as we would have liked in the marketplace and we are clearing that as part of the normal course of business to really keep the inline channel healthy and at the same time allows us gives us the room to bring in more new fresh products. So, that\u2019s really what you see taking place. So, our efforts in the back half of the year as we continue is to expeditiously clear the excess inventory through our robust network of factory stores and we feel confident with the demand in the marketplace that we could efficiently move through the product.","Kate McShane","Okay, great. Thank you. And my second question is on Brazil, I think you used the word reset when you are talking about Brazil in your prepared comments. Is it similar to what you did in China or started in China a couple of years ago that you are starting to see positive results from or is there something else that you are doing in Brazil that is working towards driving that demand again?","Mark Parker","Yes, I will take that again. I mean, I would say that on Brazil essentially the brand is again very strong in the Brazilian marketplace. And obviously, with the macroeconomic conditions, it makes for a slightly different way of operating. But what we did say is that some of the fundamental things still remain the same, which is that what we continue to do is work to transform that market along the lines of the Category Offense to ensure that we can bring more compelling consumer experiences to retail and online that will drive both productivity and profitability in the marketplace. So again, similar story, but we are being very, very refined in Brazil. And we see this as a market for the long-term and it has tremendous potential, because it is a sports loving market, but we are certainly working through some of the opportunity that exist in that marketplace.","Andy Campion","Yes. And Kate, all I would add is to put it in financial terms, the macroeconomics obviously are impacting overall growth in the market. But specific to NIKE, we are taking share. Inventory levels in the market remain healthy actually and that is due to some proactive efforts in our regard in terms of managing supply and demand. And so to Trevor\u2019s point, when we say reset, we are really talking about positioning that market along the category lines from a distribution perspective in that regard in similar ways as we have done in North America, China and Europe.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on gross margin, the guidance, I know you are working through some inventory next quarter, down 50 bps. But if you kind of look at your full year guidance, it implies a really nice bounce back in the fourth quarter gross margin somewhere in the 100, plus 100, 150 bps range. A) I want to make sure I am kind of doing the calculation right and b) is that the right way to maybe think about the gross margin algorithm more along those lines once you work through the excess inventory in North America?","Andy Campion","Yes, Omar. You have got the different elements of the equation generally in line. As we mentioned, we have had gross margin expansion in the first half of the year fueled by what we do season in, season out, our expansion in average gross selling price, our management of product costs, etcetera. What you\u2019re seeing in Q3 is more of a near-term impact and that relates to us more expeditiously clearing that high-quality but excess inventory in North America so that we can bring new innovative products to market over the balance of the year.","Omar Saad","Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then can I ask a question on apparel and pricing there? If you look at your ASPs over the last several quarters, a couple of years in footwear, it\u2019s really been strong. Apparel has been positive too. It seems like there is more innovation and more newness and more new technology you are bringing to the market on the apparel side. Can we maybe start thinking about the apparel business going through some of those premiumization elements that have really pervaded the footwear business or is it premature to think along those lines? Is there something different about the apparel market, it\u2019s more competitive? I don\u2019t know. How do you think about that? Thanks.","Mark Parker","Well, the apparel market is definitely different than the footwear market. It\u2019s certainly competitive. We see the same opportunity to bring a premium performance position to apparel that we do in footwear however and that\u2019s our focus. We are actually accelerating our innovation efforts, advanced R&D program and some of our design for manufacturing efforts in apparel are really aimed at trying to elevate our performance position there. So, we see some opportunities and frankly that\u2019s our position of distinction in apparel is to really solidify the performance, the authentic performance position and take that distinction and then drive it across the rest of our business, across the categories and from the performance apparel standpoint and through sportswear. So, that\u2019s definitely our plan and we feel quite bullish about it.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, I will just add that what we also continued to do is we continue to attack segments within the apparel market by category that offer a more premium position. For example in the football market, the Global Football market, the opportunity to go after what we call football training is a great example of how we bring innovation to that segment. Similarly as we have done in Sportswear with the Tech Pack collection, which is a very premium offering, which is seeing tremendous success across the market all around the world. So, these are just examples of ways that we continue to, as you said, see the premium priced opportunity, but make sure we are giving the consumers great value in the apparel business by bringing innovation to the marketplace.","Mark Parker","And there is definitely a consumer appetite here.","Omar Saad","Appreciate it. Thanks so much. Happy holidays.","Mark Parker","Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I mean, good afternoon plus good evening. It\u2019s been a long day. I wanted to ask in North America, as you think about the way that you will be able to efficiently push the excess inventory out, how much of that inventory, Trevor, you talked about using your outlet stores? How much of the inventory you expect to go through outlets versus the markdown in your regular wholesale through your regular retail partners versus any of the close out channels? And my second question is in currency, Andy, would you be able to tell us how much you expect the earnings per share impact of FX to be in 3Q and 4Q? Thanks.","Trevor Edwards","Yes, I would just say, we expect that more of our inventory would be liquidated to our factory stores. Like we have said, we have got a robust network and we continue to feel very positive about the demand in the marketplace for the brand. And so for those consumers looking for a value occasion, we think we are providing great value at this \u2013 particularly with the recency of some of these products.","Andy Campion","Okay. And Lindsay, we don\u2019t provide forward-looking FX impact on earnings per share per se. But as we noted in the first half, FX did have a significant impact and we do expect that it will continue to have significant impact in the second half.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay. Thanks very much.","Andy Campion","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, good afternoon guys. Happy holidays and congrats on a great quarter. A question on China really quickly, if we look at some of the retailer \u2013 your biggest retailers over there that are public companies that give us updates, they have done a nice job alongside you restoring their same-store sales growth and that\u2019s obviously come after you guys have restricted inventories into that market to force the pull market, good habits on that market. If we look at some of those, the same-store sales rates have stabilized a bit or even decelerated from very high levels, maybe just a touch, but I am willing to bet that some of those retailers are holding less inventory on hand than they have in the past. And now they are heading into store growth and into an Olympic year. Is there a point where we could think about the growth rate for you in China looking more like the same-store sales rates that we hear out of that market? And put another way is there a point where you would say your growth rate there would stop benefiting from replenishing dated inventory on hand, for example, to your biggest retailers?","Mark Parker","Yes, Michael, I will start on that one. Just to add a little bit of dimension in terms of China, we have had strong growth across a number of the dimensions in that market. Our same-store sales growth is strong and remains strong. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it as decelerating significantly or call it decelerating significantly I think as you noted. In terms of the prospects going forward, one of the things we touched on at our Investor Day was how much of our retail footprint we have impacted with our new category-oriented strategies in the wholesale marketplace. And if you recall, the number we gave at the time was that we have touched about 20% of that market in terms of our re-profiled doors and our more consumer-focused, category-oriented experiences. Those experiences continue to have very healthy inventory, much faster turns than we experienced years ago, strong comps, margin expansion and again, that\u2019s 20% of the market. We still believe we have a significant opportunity in that market to continue to proliferate that across wholesale. And then again, one of the other things fueling our growth in China is our DTC business and notably, NIKE.com as Trevor referenced.","Michael Binetti","Got it. And then that\u2019s an interesting segue. When we think about the digital business going to $7 billion in revenues by 2020, would you mind talking to us about which categories or geographies the majority of that growth comes from? And how the mix of digital will look at that time compared to today which is very North America weighted for you? Thanks.","Trevor Edwards","Yes. I mean, the digital business obviously provides a tremendous opportunity for us. And I think as we often talk about, it really touches all dimensions of the company. As you look at the growth rate, the growth rates we\u2019re seeing really will come from all the different dimensions of the business. When you think about the undeserved categories as certainly, as we look at the Women\u2019s business, we look at the Young Athletes business, we look at the Jordan business all of those really provide great opportunity to growth from a category perspective, along with the big categories that are already growing. I would also say the same time that I think from a geographic perspective, while North America is currently one of the larger growing ones China has a tremendous, tremendous growth opportunity. We can see that as being one of the most connected markets out there. Europe has continued growth opportunity. So, we really do see as an expansive opportunity across the board. And obviously then there is Central and Eastern Europe which we have continued to see growth. So, it really is one of those cases where it\u2019s a global footprint and we just see more and more opportunity the deeper we dive.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot, guys.","Kelley Hall","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","The last question is from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial.","Chris Svezia","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Andy for you, I guess any color by any chance between on the futures number, front half, back half in terms of growth rates, any difference between the cadence?","Andy Campion","Yes. The futures are slightly more heavily weighted towards the back half. I would refer you back to some of my remarks in our guidance though. There are a number of factors that are worth taking into account in terms of futures and especially as they relate to revenue. That being the weighting of futures across the season as compared to just across this monthly reporting window as well as shipping timing and other factors. But in short, in terms of just the weighting kind of first half or second half of the year futures reporting window slightly more heavily weighted towards the second half.","Chris Svezia","Okay. And then I guess my second question as it pertains to the revenue outlook, correct me if I am wrong, but I think you said high single to low double-digit reported for Q3, but sustaining kind of a mid single-digit growth on the year which is similar revenue growth that you gave on the last quarter despite the acceleration of futures, so which would imply I guess a de-acceleration in revenue growth for Q4. Maybe walk us through so maybe why that will be the case or is it just being conservative given the macro volatility? I am just sort of curious for your thoughts about that.","Andy Campion","Yes. At first, what I would say is our full year guidance on revenue is consistent. So, very much consistent with our guidance 90 days ago or in other words, unchanged. As we look at it, the balance of the year and you are looking to futures as a proxy again number of factors and I touched on a few of those. There is also the timing of flowing product into the market around events and other factors, the timing of revenue recognition as you ship to wholesale customers as compared to shipping directly to consumers through our DTC business. So, I refer you back to our guidance, but the punch line on our guidance is that it remains consistent in terms of our full year revenue expectations.","Chris Svezia","Okay. Thank you very much and happy holidays. All the best.","Andy Campion","You too.","Kelley Hall","Thank you.","Kelley Hall","Alright. Well, thank you everyone. Have a great holiday season. Happy New Year and we will talk to you in Q3.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"15717":["NIKE, Inc.

Thanks for your cooperation on this.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark Parker","Thanks, Nitesh, and hello everyone. This summer proved just how powerful sport can be around the world. Some of the greatest performances of all time entertained us, and in the process inspired a new generation of athletes to get moving. At the same time, the look of sport continues to influence everyday style around the world. As a result, new brands are entering into the athletic landscape. The activewear market continues to outpace the overall apparel and footwear market, which itself continues to outpace global GDP growth. It\u2019s a great time to be in the business of sports and as the market leader, this is a great time to be NIKE.","We are on the frontend of all this growth, a driving force behind the expanding market. We not only see the upside across the landscape, we have both the scale and the skill to act on it. We believe in our strategy and in our complete offense. It\u2019s proven to be NIKE's greatest competitive edge. We win now by editing our opportunities aggressively, we sharpen our execution, and we focus on those with the greatest impact and highest return and we build for the future by intensifying our investments in our brand and innovation. NIKE is on the offense like never before, driving up a global athletic market that holds tremendous potential for growth. Q1 is the start of what\u2019s going to be a strong year for our company.","Let's review the financial highlights. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8% growing to $9.1 billion. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 200 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share increased 9% to $0.73. And we delivered ROIC of 30.5%. It was the summer of amazing sports moments and it all began with an historic NBA Finals win led by LeBron and Kyrie. It continued with Chile taking the COPA America title for the second time in a row. And weeks later at Wimbledon, Serena Williams celebrated her 22nd Grand Slam, tying her for the most singles titles in the Open Era.","And the next day, the euro champs featured the first-ever all-NIKE final with Portugal defeating France. And of course, we were all captivated by the Rio Olympics last month. Everywhere you looked in Rio, you could feel NIKE\u2019s support of the athlete. Over 1,500 Olympians from 60 countries won 189 metals wearing our latest innovations. If NIKE were a country, we would have stood atop the medal count leaderboard. We saw so many inspiring performances.","A few of the highlights for me were Neymar scoring the final penalty kick leading Brazil to their first ever Olympic gold in men's football. Mo Farah becoming the second man to win both the 5,000 and 10,000 meter races in consecutive Olympics. And with 21 of the 24 Team USA basketball players wearing NIKE or Jordan footwear, both the men's and women's teams winning goal. It's moments like these that validate our obsession with the athlete. They serve as the ultimate proving grounds.","I'm happy to say we not only own the fields of play with performance products like the KD9 but we also set the tone for sport style innovation through new apparel silhouettes, like the dynamic reveal jacket worn by all U.S. Olympic medal winners on the medal stand. What\u2019s amazing is that this success covers only three months. We absolutely dominated the sports calendar, and we used the power of sport to energize the marketplace and fuel growth. While I\u2019m pleased with our overall momentum, I\u2019m even more excited about what the future holds for our company.","When we last spoke in June, I outlined our key strategies for growth in fiscal year '17. We talked about driving a continuous cycle of innovation for athletes, about transforming the global marketplace, and then deepening our commitment to lead in this new era of personalized performance. And I\u2019m proud to say we kicked off the year with strong progress in each of those areas. Starting with innovation; running is a great example of our complete offense within a category, delivering both performance innovation and sports style innovation in both footwear and apparel.","Let\u2019s start with the LunarEpic Low which broke new ground this quarter delivering a completely new ride, it doesn't feel or look like any running shoe before. The LunarEpic Low is also translating extremely well to a style audience and it\u2019s selling through well beyond expectations. Innovation at NIKE can also mean reinterpreting our most successful franchises. For example, the Air Zoom Pegasus 33 has proven to be consistently popular. In fact, since its inception, NIKE has sold over 50 million pairs of the Pegasus.","We also brought new technology to sportswear in Q1, as seen with the Roshe Two Flyknit and the Air Max 1 Ultra Flyknit. These iconic running styles were paired with our groundbreaking digital knitting to maximize flexibility and comfort, like only NIKE can. And finally in apparel, among the most successful styles of the quarter are the new dynamic reveal jacket that I have mentioned and performance running tops, shorts and tights. Apparel\u2019s accelerated growth is bringing great balance to running. I should also call out the women's sportswear apparel category, which continues to be another standout growth category for NIKE.","Innovation of course extends far beyond product at NIKE, it\u2019s also about transforming the global marketplace by serving and inspiring consumers in ways that are most meaningful to them. It\u2019s about creating ways to keep them coming back. And we do that with our longstanding wholesale partners as well as with our own category focused doors. One of our greatest competitive advantages is our ability to connect physical and digital shopping experiences for our consumers. In more places than ever, NIKE consumers can now shop in-store and through mobile at the same time in a single transaction. And it\u2019s clear our investments are paying off.","On a constant currency basis, DTC revenue for Q1 was up 22% with the Nike.com business leading the way at 49% growth. Another critical part of the success of Nike.com continues to be our seamless integration with Nike+. It was a busy quarter for Nike+ as we delivered all access to the best of NIKE with one single sign-on to connect to our running, training and sneaker apps. All three apps continue to be refreshed with the new features that are more directly tailored to the user.","We also continue to expand our industry leadership in digital innovation through key partnerships. We got a taste of the combined power of NIKE and Apple again this month and there\u2019s much more to come as we focus on solving problems for athletes together, combining NIKE's deep knowledge of sport with Apple\u2019s expertise in digital technology. We\u2019re off to a solid start to the fiscal year and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll reach our near-term goals. At the same time, we\u2019re always looking ahead to shape the future of sport.","In Q1, we took major leaps toward those long-term goals, especially in the promise of personalized performance. Our connection to the consumer through Nike+ is core to that vision. But equally important is disrupting the business model that supports it or as we like to call it, our Manufacturing Revolution or Man Rev. Through our acceleration of Man Rev, we\u2019re currently seeing the benefit to product cost optimizations. At the same time, we\u2019re building capabilities for increased speed to market.","Beyond that, one of the most exciting opportunities for Man Rev is within design. We\u2019re continuing to scale our transition from cut and sow where precision is at the stitch level to digital design where precision is at the pixel level. We\u2019re leveraging the power of computational design that uses algorithms to create highly tunable innovations very quickly. This summer in Rio, athletes such as Allyson Felix, Elaine Thompson and Mo Farah claimed gold wearing our latest track spikes. Each were developed using computational design, 3-D printing and Selective Laser Sintering, which allowed us to create and refine prototypes in hours instead of months and aligned with the athlete\u2019s specific training programs and competitive needs.","Personalized products and services where and when you need them is the future NIKE is building for tomorrow and delivering today. You\u2019ve heard me talk before about how NIKE is built for growth. I\u2019m as confident as ever that we\u2019re built to win now to deliver accelerated growth in the near-term and equally we\u2019re built to win for the long term. As we continue to invest surgically and aggressively to create the future of sport and active life, we\u2019ll continue to deliver shareholder value for years to come.","With that, I'll turn it over to Trevor.","Trevor Edwards","Thanks, Mark. Q1 is always an exciting quarter for the NIKE brand but this past summer was something really special. It was full of global sports moments where our ability to deliver new and innovative products and create powerful consumer connections was on full display. And with that, we\u2019re off to a good start to the year.","On a constant currency basis, NIKE brand revenue grew 10% for the quarter led by double-digit growth in all international geographies. NIKE brand DTC revenue was up 22% driven by online growth of 49%, new store growth 10%. And finally global futures are up 7%.","At NIKE, we take pride in developing authentic relationships with consumers all over the world. And this summer of sport highlighted how we take full advantage of the world's best athletes to deepen those connections. Our Unlimited You campaign during the Olympics offered an excellent example of that power with this message of inviting old athletes to push their limits reaching more than 480 million views online and 1.1 billion TV impressions around the world.","For us, this energy is our engine as it continues to drive excitement and momentum for the NIKE brand. And ultimately this brand energy comes to life within our categories and through our geographies. Let's take a look starting with our categories.","First, running. Growing double digits, this was the highest revenue quarter ever for our performance running category with strong growth across footwear and apparel. Leading the way for footwear were key products that translate our rich understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovations, like the LunarEpic Low and the Air Zoom Pegasus 33.","What's more, the reinvention of our free technology reignited demand for one of the most iconic footwear franchises around the world. And with our deep passion for running we continue to connect products and services. Earlier this month in partnership with Apple, we announced the Apple Watch Nike+, your perfect running partner. Built seamlessly into the watch is the Nike+ run club with motivation through smart run reminders and training data, like pace and distance available at a glance.","I was excited to help introduce the watch at Apple\u2019s keynote and I can't wait for runners everywhere to start using it. With running, we never rest on our heels. With even more exciting products in the pipeline, our expansive running strategy will continue to drive tremendous energy for both this important category and across our entire portfolio.","Now let's take a look at NIKE basketball. Mark mentioned what the U.S. men's and women's teams accomplished in Rio. In particular, I want to highlight Kevin Durant\u2019s incredible performance leading the team throughout the tournament and putting up 30 points in the gold-medal game. And as KD9 hit the market this summer to a great response, there\u2019s one thing I want to call out. To give fans away to celebrate KD\u2019s move to Golden State, we offered a blue and yellow colorway on NIKEiD on the same day he joined the team. This was a great example of the kind of real-time personalized opportunities you'll see more of as we invest in capability to deliver products to market when and where fans want them most.","Kyrie had an amazing summer winning an Olympic gold and the NBA championship and his signature KYRIE 2 continues to be met with strong consumer response. We see a very bright future for this young star and we are excited for the years ahead together with him. And finally, the energy for LeBron continues to build after his incredible dominance in the Playoffs and his very successful visit to China. And the LeBron Soldier 10 is seeing very strong sell-through in the United States and China, our two largest basketball markets.","We continue to see great opportunities in the power of our relationships in basketball. We have both the deepest roster of great athletes from LeBron and KD to Russell Westbrook and Paul George to Ben Simmons and Elena Delle Donne and great universities and clubs around the world. Fueled by these relationships, NIKE basketball continues to energize passion for the game and inspire future generations worldwide. The products are strong, the pipeline is loaded and I can't wait for the NBA season to start so we can deliver these amazing innovations to our consumers.","In the Jordan brand, we continue to see huge opportunities as we expand beyond the sport of basketball. Jordan's entrance into the men's training category with the Jordan Trainer 1 has being greeted with strong excitement in the marketplace. To support the launch, we created a new training program, the Jordan Breakfast Club based on Michael's legendary work ethic.","And as the college football season began, the Jordan brand joined forces with the University of Michigan to a response of real energy. We launched the partnership between these two iconic brands with a midnight event attended by thousands of consumers who camped out for the new apparel. And of course, the Jordan brand can still lead the world of basketball as it did with the announcement of the Air Jordan XXXI with its first-of-its-kind Flyweave and leather upper and a full-length Zoom Air enhancing lateral support and court feel.","What's more, earlier this month we launched the Jordan 1 Retro High with the original banned red and black colorway and it sold out within an hour. It's clear with continued double-digit revenue growth the Jordan brand is more popular than ever. In both NIKE basketball and Jordan, we serve the full lifestyle of basketball like no other brand from performance to sport styling innovation to sharing our passion for sport with billions of consumers around the world.","And importantly, our sportswear category, which in Q1 saw its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, continues to amplify the power of our performance categories to serve consumers through sport style innovation. As always, NIKE sportswear challenges conventional notions of performance and style by remixing inspiration from our greatest athletes with modern approach to lifestyle design.","In Q1, consumers continued their love of footwear, like the Huarache, the Tianjin and the Air Force 1 along with running icons we've enhanced with Flyknit like the Roshe Two and the Air Max 1 to create a look and feel that only NIKE can offer. And our apparel success was highlighted by the ever popular and improved Tech Fleece and the new innovative NIKE dynamic reveal jacket, which created the look of victory this summer as athletes wore it proudly on the medal stands throughout the Olympics. With both footwear and apparel, our strong sportswear category continues our leadership in fueling passion for sport lifestyle to a global and diverse audience.","Now let\u2019s discuss a few of our key geographies; first, North America where the brand remains very strong. In Q1, we returned our largest geography back to growth with revenues up 6%. This growth was fueled in part by record awareness and engagement around the Olympics and our unlimited campaign. From a category perspective, we saw growth in sportswear, the Jordan brand and running. And driven by launches of new innovations, we returned signature basketball to a full market.","We also made great progress against clearing excess inventory within the quarter and we're seeing the benefit of bringing new product into the clean, full price in-line channels. Looking forward, we will continue to manage the flow of product into the market as we expand on an already healthy in-line marketplace.","As we\u2019ve always said, there is no finish line and that\u2019s as true today as it ever was. We continue to see tremendous opportunity offered by the still untapped potential of our complete offense in women's and in young athletes, across performance and sportswear and up and down the price points. As we look at this considerable upside, we are as excited as we've ever been about our growth opportunities ahead both in the near-term and into the future.","Now let's turn to Western Europe where we see broad-based demand with growth of 10% for the quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excitement in the marketplace was fueled by the European Championships and the kickoff to the football season with the launch of the new kits from Man City to FC Barcelona to Atletico Madrid to Paris Saint-Germain, all of which combined advanced performance technologies with beautiful design.","And the energy from this great summer sports could be seen across Western Europe's marketplace in Q1 from our elevated executions in Paris with Intersport to the House of Hoops on London's Oxford Street with Foot Locker, we are creating compelling retail experiences for our consumers. And these strong partnerships are paying off. At the same time, our own DTC business continues to perform well growing 30% in the quarter. We are rated by consumers as the favorite brand in all key cities in Western Europe and the momentum we have seen in Q1 reinforces our view that we have tremendous growth potential in this important geography.","And finally, in Greater China, we continue to see great results with revenue growing 21% for the quarter. We are leveraging consumer sports moments such as the Olympics and the athlete visits by LeBron, KD and Russell Westbrook this summer. This energy is reflected in our category results with tremendous momentum across running, sportswear, Jordan and NIKE basketball.","Just recently, the China retail market became the world's largest market eclipse than the United States. And with our impressive growth there, we continue to feel confident about the successful strategies we are executing. We are leading with digital where we're seeing incredible growth in our Nike.com business, as we continue to innovate with a focus on mobile. And we are leveraging the best practices from China across our global portfolio.","Consumers are also responding to our efforts to create more compelling and unique retail experiences, and the re-profile doors with our wholesale partners continue to be more productive. We will continue to raise the bar as we scale the number of re-profiled doors in the fleet. We feel great about the progress of our business in China and more importantly we are more confident than ever in our ability to drive sustained growth in this geography.","Q1 was the start of a new fiscal year for the NIKE brand but to us it\u2019s much more than that. It\u2019s the continuation of delivering innovative products to the marketplace, connecting our consumers with more fun and authentic experiences and elevating every aspect of our game to help athletes get better. Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy.","Andy Campion","Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the three pillars of NIKE's financial strategy and our consistent delivery of results across all three of those dimensions over the long term is what continues to set NIKE apart in terms of creating value for shareholders.","To be clear, first and foremost, NIKE is a growth company. We\u2019re obsessed with bringing inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And with more than 7 billion athletes on the planet, that\u2019s no small feat. We are relentlessly in pursuit of our mission and our pace and intensity always accelerates around the biggest moments in sport. So, it should come as no surprise that we\u2019re off to a great start against our growth agenda for fiscal year '17.","As Mark noted, the past 90 days have been a hit parade for the NIKE brand and the amazing athletes and teams that we serve. From LeBron and Kyrie winning the NBA Finals in dramatic fashion all the way through to the unprecedented medal-winning performances of hundreds of NIKE athletes at the Olympic Games in Rio, those are the moments that bring out the best in NIKE pushing our brand and our pipeline of innovative, beautifully designed products to new heights.","Powered by this inspiring summer of sport, our revenue grew to $9.1 billion in the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis. Expanding profitability is another key pillar of NIKE's financial strategy. While margins contracted in the quarter, driven by foreign exchange and several temporary or discrete items, we continue to benefit from our more systemic, long-term drivers of margin expansion, including higher in-line average selling prices and benefits associated with our footwear Manufacturing Revolution initiatives.","In fact, based upon the progress we're making in footwear manufacturing, we announced a new strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management in the quarter aimed at revolutionizing apparel manufacturing. SG&A productivity is also increasingly a driver of our expanding profitability. In Q1, operating overhead grew just 6% as continued strategic investment was offset by productivity gains.","Having grown rapidly from a $16 billion enterprise in fiscal year '07, turnover a $32 billion enterprise today, we\u2019re intensifying our reallocation of the unrivaled resources that we have in our arsenal, leveraging an approach that we call edit to amplify. We're amplifying what matters most in terms of creating value for consumers and driving growth. That includes the path we've been on to double our investment and innovation and revolutionize our supply chain. At the same time, we are editing and realigning resources in areas where the investment we have today is more than sufficient.","Growth and expanding profitability along with strategic capital deployment also continued to yield strong returns on invested capital. In the first quarter, our ROIC expanded 160 basis points compared to prior year and is now over 30% for the first time in our history. Strong growth, expanding profitability and high returns on invested capital are the three pillars of our financial strategy and we continue to build momentum toward delivering on our long-term goals across all three dimensions through nimble and strategic management.","So on that note, let's reflect on our financial results for Q1. In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 8%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue grew 10% with all international geographies growing double digits and North America returning to growth at 6%. NIKE brand futures orders are up 5% on a reported basis. Currency neutral futures orders are growing 7%, driven by a 2% increase in units with increases in average selling prices contributing 5 percentage points of growth.","First quarter diluted EPS of $0.73 increased 9% versus the prior year driven by strong revenue growth, operating overhead leverage, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 200 basis points in the quarter. Now let me take a moment to provide greater dimension on the drivers impacting gross margin in the short term and why we remain so confident in our ability to expand margins over the long term.","As I previously noted, the primary drivers of the contraction in Q1 were several temporary or discrete items including for example foreign exchange impacts, our exit from the golf equipment business, a higher mix of off-price sales as compared to Q1 fiscal year '16 and a shift of expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.","Note that cost of goods sold includes our investments in innovation, Manufacturing Revolution and other product creation-related resources which have expanded significantly to fuel long-term growth. At the same time, we continue to benefit from higher full price average selling prices, lower oil-based input costs and the favorable impacts on product cost driven by our Manufacturing Revolution initiatives.","Turning to SG&A, demand creation increased 25% in the first quarter primarily driven by investment around the Olympics and the European football championships. Operating overhead increased just 6%, as continued strategic investment in DTC, operational infrastructure and consumer facing digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity gains and the shift of certain expenses from operating overhead to cost of goods sold.","The effective tax rate for Q1 was 2.5%, significantly lower than prior year primarily due to a one-time benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter. As of August 31, inventories were up 11%. NIKE brand wholesale units were up just 3%. The remainder of the expansion in inventory was driven by growth to support our fast-growing DTC businesses and a higher average cost of inventory due to a higher mix of footwear this quarter versus prior year.","Now let's turn to the performance of a few key operating segments. In Q1, North America revenue grew 6% on both a currency neutral and reported basis. Growth was driven by sportswear and Jordan. As Trevor noted, we're also seeing strong consumer demand for the signature performance basketball styles that we\u2019ve just recently launched as we approach the tipoff of the NBA season later in Q2.","On reported basis, North America EBIT decreased 4% in the first quarter as revenue growth and full price gross margin expansion were offset by higher demand creation related to the Olympics and a higher mix of off-price liquidation in Q1 versus the same period in the prior year.","Overall, we feel great about the progress we are making to rebalance supply and demand in the North America marketplace and we will deliberately keep supply tight to maintain a pull market. Accordingly, we expect North America\u2019s reported revenue growth over the balance of the year to outpace the rate of futures growth driven by stronger sell-through to consumers.","Now turning to Western Europe where the NIKE brand continues to be the leading brand in all 10 key cities and consumer demand for our product remains extremely strong. In Q1, revenue grew to $1.8 billion, up 10% on a currency neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by sportswear, global football, running and Jordan. We also experienced strong growth across both our DTC businesses and with our wholesale partners.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 7% while EBIT declined 19% reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin, and demand creation investments around the European football championships and Olympics.","While NIKE brings the energy of the Olympics to consumers in key cities all around the world, the Olympic Games also offered us the opportunity to more deeply connect with consumers in our emerging markets geography and specifically ignite the passion for sport in Brazil. The stars could not have aligned better for the NIKE brand, culminating with Neymar\u2019s goal-medal winning goal in the historic Maracana stadium.","Fueled by inspiration from the games, our emerging markets geography grew 11% on a currency neutral basis. Growth was driven by incredibly strong momentum across sportswear, running and Jordan. And the territories with the highest rates of growth were SoCo and Pacific. We\u2019re also very effectively managing supply and demand in the emerging markets as reflected in lower inventory unit levels versus prior year.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue and EBIT continued to be heavily impacted by FX headwinds. As a result, Q1 reported revenue decreased 2% while EBIT decreased 34%. Q1 was another exceptional quarter for NIKE in Greater China with currency neutral revenue growth of 21%, growth within the double digits in both footwear and apparel in both DTC and at wholesale and across nearly every category.","Our brand leadership and connection with consumers in China is unrivaled and accelerating. Sell-through at retail remains robust and inventories are healthy. And as our focus remains on the long term, we continue to prioritize strategic investment in this important geography to fuel strong and sustainable growth.","That includes investments in deepening our connections with consumers, consumer-focused experiences in both owned and partnered retail, accelerating digital commerce and new supply chain capabilities that enable us to more personally serve consumers in the world\u2019s largest market.","Perhaps most importantly, we are also investing in our team and talent. The NIKE brand is winning in China and the investments we're making now will continue to drive growth and extend our leadership long term.","On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in China was up 15% while EBIT expanded 12%. Q1 was a solid start to the year. We have strong brand momentum and a pipeline of innovative performance and sportswear product that is resonating with consumers. Accordingly, our outlook for fiscal year '17 remains largely unchanged in terms of growth and the profitability of our business.","Specifically, for the full year, our revenue expectations remain in line with prior guidance, high single digit reported revenue growth and high single to low double-digit currency neutral revenue growth. For Q2, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range at or slightly below our rate of reported futures growth, reflecting FX headwinds.","Futures orders continue to be an important and valuable aspect of our operating model. That said, the relationship between reported futures and reported revenue in a given quarter has become less correlated based on our evolving business mix. Accordingly, over the past several quarters, we have been providing greater dimension on our outlook for the business.","Going forward, based upon our own evaluation and taking into account input that we have received from stakeholders, we will change the sequencing of our futures reporting. Futures will first be referenced in the context of the broader guidance that we provide on the earnings conference call rather than as a standalone forward-looking metric in our earnings release. We will also continue to report futures in detail in our quarterly filings with the SEC.","Turning to gross margin. We now expect the full year rate to contract. For Q2, we expect gross margin to contract by approximately 125 basis points with the rate in the second half of the fiscal year approaching flat versus the prior year. Our underlying fundamental drivers of gross margin expansion remains strong, including a higher full price average selling price and product cost optimization. However, those favorable drivers are being offset in the short term by the aforementioned temporary or discrete factors some of which have a continuing impact on the balance of the year.","For total SG&A, we now expect full year growth in the mid to high-single digits with Q2 growing in the low to mid-single-digit range, as our continued strategic investments are increasingly being funded or offset by SG&A productivity gains as we edit to amplify. In Q2, we expect other income or expense to be roughly zero. For the full year, our guidance remains unchanged from prior guidance.","We now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 17% for the full year taking into account the rate in Q1 and an average rate of about 22% for Q2 through Q4. We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year and as we look to the balance of year and beyond, our level of intensity is high and we are more obsessed than ever with creating extraordinary value for consumers and translating that into sustainable, profitable, capital efficient growth for NIKE and our shareholders.","With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane","Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. My first question was just on innovation. Trevor, you went through a lot of detail and Mark too about innovation and a lot of the enhancements you\u2019ve made over time. Just wondered if you could walk us through your view on introducing new platforms and how you reconcile that with just improving the innovation that you already have set forth?","Mark Parker","Yes, actually that\u2019s a good question. Let me take that. First of all, on a little more macro level, I think as I mentioned the current environment really plays right into NIKE\u2019s strengths. We know that the athletic footwear and apparel segments being so strong and outpacing the rest of the footwear and apparel industry. We\u2019re actually quite well represented in leading product on both the performance and the sportswear side of the business, as we talked about. There\u2019s many things that we\u2019re excited about including some of the product that\u2019s in the market right now that I think has a lot of upside opportunity to more completely leverage things in performance, products and performance. Signature we talked about, LeBron Solider, the KD9, new KYRIE, Paul George signature shoes, of course the Air Jordon XXXI. Those are great examples. Running, we talked about the LunarEpic Low, really incredible new cushioning system there for a great ride. Pegasus, the update on a real classic in apparel. The running performance category both tops and bottoms, women\u2019s sports bras. Those are some examples on the performance side. And then on the sportswear side, we\u2019ve got classics that we\u2019ve reissued as well as new updates, including innovation as part of those classics; Air Force 1, Air Max, Presto, Sock Dart, Roshe Two, Huarache just to name some of those. In terms of new upcoming innovation in Q2 we\u2019ve got more signature basketball coming. The LeBron 14 is in the on-deck circle. That\u2019s another great signature product for LeBron. The Air VaporMax, which we talked about in March, which is a phenomenal new modern interpretation of NIKE air cushioning, it\u2019s incredible both in how it performs but how it looks. We have no iterations of free product. In apparel, we\u2019ve got new base layer technology, tech running, new Hyperwarm apparel collection which we\u2019re excited about. Jordan is expanding beyond the basketball category, the training and running including sportswear. As Trevor mentioned, the new Apple Watch Nike+ version, which is the start of I think intensifying that relationship between NIKE and Apple. And then we\u2019ve got some \u2013 on the sportswear side some new innovative interpretations of again some of our sportswear classics. Big anniversary is coming with the Air Max 1, the Air Max 97; the Air Force 1 35th anniversary Cortez. Modern comfort collection in the Jordan category as well as NIKE, so we\u2019ll bring some real innovation to both the sportswear category with the classics as well as some new products. So there\u2019s an array \u2013 and I didn\u2019t mention the HyperAdapt by the way. That probably should be toward the top of the list. It\u2019s gotten a lot of attention as it should because it really ushers in a whole new wave of adaptive technology. So we\u2019re bringing innovation obviously to performance but also to sports style innovation. And I think it\u2019s interesting that the consumer doesn\u2019t necessary distinguish between the two. Many of our performance products are worn in terms of the street and they\u2019re quite fashionable. That isn\u2019t necessarily our intent out of the box but we\u2019re definitely seeing that be the case as well. So very excited about the innovation that\u2019s coming, obviously in product and our innovation goes well beyond product. We talked about Man Rev, we talked about digital, we talked about personalized performance, Nike+, Nike.com, innovations to retail. So this has really always been and always will be the engine for growth for the company and I\u2019ll just say that we\u2019re as aggressive as ever in investing in those biggest opportunities. And I\u2019m not including the things I can\u2019t talk about. Obviously very excited about as well.","Kate McShane","Thank you so much. And just a follow-up question. I know you\u2019ve been very focused at cleaning up the inventory in the premium channels. Wondered if you could update us on how inventory looks at the non-premium channels currently? And any other regional commentary you can give on how inventories look around the world? Thank you.","Andy Campion","Yes. Hi, Kate. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll start on that one. Overall, we feel great about the progress that we\u2019re making from an inventory or maybe more broadly a supply and demand management perspective. As I noted, our overall enterprise inventory growth was driven by only a 3 percentage point increase in units. And actually we saw a decline in North America in particular in inventory both in the value of that inventory as well as the units actually declining even greater. So, while I noted that in margin, off-price sales had a negative mix impact, that was versus the prior year in the first quarter. We\u2019re actually continuing to see those off-price sales tighten up as we make the progress we told you we would in terms of returning to a healthy pull market in North America.","Trevor Edwards","And maybe just to give a broader context around the inventory of the marketplace, I would say really around the world our in-line channels are very healthy really across the board. So we feel that we\u2019ve made great progress in North America to make sure that we have obviously cleared the excess inventory and we\u2019re bringing in new products into the marketplace and we\u2019re seeing the result of that. Going forward, we will continue to manage the supply into the marketplace proactively to make sure that we maintain a pull market. If you look across to Western Europe, the inventory is actually in line with revenue growth. Maybe the only difference would be on the value side. You\u2019re certainly seeing foreign exchange have some impact. Then in China we\u2019re seeing inventories very healthy there and you\u2019ve seen some inventory build. As we prepare for singles day, which is obviously a big impact and so we\u2019re excited about that. So across the board, we feel very confident about the marketplace and the inventory position that we\u2019re in today and we\u2019re just excited about the pipeline and products that are coming through.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Kate. We\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Good afternoon. Andy, can you share more detail on the magnitude of the discrete factors influencing the gross margin, specifically maybe itemize the impact of revenue in the golf business, the impact of the margin from additional off-price sales?","Andy Campion","Yes, I would say the two biggest drivers of the margin contraction versus prior year were the bucket of discrete or temporary items that we referenced in foreign exchange. So those items most notably included the shift of operating overhead expenses into cost of goods sold. So that is a movement within our P&L versus a change in trajectory. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s not always that evident to those on the call or otherwise that included in gross margin or in cost of goods sold is not just the product cost but also the investments in the team and resources that we deploy against innovation in Manufacturing Revolution and otherwise. Golf, as you highlighted, was another factor within gross margin both some charges that we took as well as the impact of exiting the golf equipment business. Frankly, it\u2019s a great example of the edit to amplify approach that we\u2019ve talked about in the past and we\u2019ve talked about on this call increasingly being applied to operating overhead. That is having an impact on our margin in the short term and will over the balance of the year. It\u2019s not reported as a discontinued operation. It\u2019s in our numbers. But we are making those decisions because we believe our long-term focus, in other words what we will amplify as our focus on footwear and apparel and drive greater growth and profitability there, and we think we\u2019ll see the benefits in margin and return on invested capital from the decision we made to edit.","Jim Duffy","Okay. Thanks. My next question is just on general trends. At the moment, lifestyle fashion trends appear to be gaining in popularity while on a relative basis performance appeal seemingly is softer. Can we speak to any historical precedents for this and how those trends played out in past cycles?","Mark Parker","There\u2019s always been a shift back and forth from a consumer standpoint. I\u2019ll just back up and say though that sport in general and innovation have always been and I think always will be two of the most powerful drivers of culture and style. NIKE always \u2013 we\u2019ve always started with the athlete. That\u2019s how we create the insight to drive innovative product and then we amplify that across the portfolio, and sportswear is really important means of doing that. We see tremendous growth in all areas, specifically in both dimensions of performance and sportswear. We just had our most successful quarter ever for performance running and our sportswear business at the same time continues to be a massive growth driver for the company. So it\u2019s really for us is the balance between the two and the relationship between the two. That intersection between performance and style I think is stronger than ever. And by the way, innovation is a huge part of creating a new esthetic and lifestyle product does prioritize I think at this stage with the consumer comfort and lightweight and breathability. So performance is really an element of sportswear for NIKE and that\u2019s what helps to separate and distinguish NIKE in the marketplace.","Trevor Edwards","I\u2019ll maybe just add and say been there, done that certainly around as you approach the idea around sportswear and certainly the lifecycle that we go through. We continue to believe that our performance business is actually what is at the root of what drives continued innovation in the marketplace. We then leverage that point of view to create sport style innovation. And I think we\u2019re in the best position where we can actually do both. We can serve the consumer who want a performance product to wear as a lifestyle product but also something that he can wear to compete \u2013 he or she to wear to compete in. And again, this current environment is great for us. This is when we are at our best and that\u2019s why I said been there, done that and we\u2019ll do it again. Just only it\u2019s bigger and certainly it\u2019s a great opportunity for us.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Jim. We\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann, your line is open.","Nitesh Sharan","We\u2019ll go to the next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Thanks for the all the information, guys. Two quick questions. The first one, you really talked a lot about the Manufacturing Revolution. It seems like we maybe at an inflection here. The announcement with Apollo and opening plants in the U.S. Can you tell me \u2013 you first started talking about this a few years ago, what\u2019s happening now that you\u2019re seeing this inflection? What\u2019s the change in that part of the supply chain that really gives you the confidence to accelerate \u2013 push on the accelerator there?","Mark Parker","Well, we\u2019re actually starting to take some of this innovation to scale. I think that\u2019s the short answer. For us, this is about getting product to the consumer faster, it\u2019s about lowering our product cost as we talked about, really trying to drive greater labor productivity, less waste in the system, new design capabilities. These are all parts of Man Rev. I think though the difference, the inflection point that you mentioned, is really more about taking it to scale. With partners like Flex but then across our whole manufacturing partner base, so we\u2019re really modernizing not just with any one partner but using that innovation to drive it across the whole base. So we talked about Flex and footwear, Apollo is a more recent focus for us on the apparel side. Our investment in the advanced product creation center here on the NIKE campus, some amazing innovations in looking at disruptive methods of make. Obviously, we\u2019re aware of Flyknit. 3-D printing I think has got a lot of potential for scale. So we\u2019re starting to see the impact at a greater level as we get quarter-to-quarter and I think that\u2019s going to continue to grow.","Andy Campion","Omar, I\u2019d just add. Today, we\u2019re seeing gains in the tens of millions of dollars per quarter and we certainly expect to see that expand over the long term. The tangible results that we\u2019re seeing today are primarily driven by automation and being closer to market. In terms of automation specifically, we\u2019re seeing greater yield in terms of our use of materials. So less waste means lower cost and we\u2019re also improving the throughput in our manufacturing lines; in other words, improving labor productivity. I guess in short I\u2019d say we\u2019re increasingly confident the Manufacturing Revolution now across both footwear and apparel will have a significant impact on both revenue and margin long term. And as you know, as you start to see returns on your investment that starts to build momentum. So we remain bullish on that opportunity.","Omar Saad","Thanks. And quickly I wanted to ask about the HyperAdapt platform that\u2019s gotten a lot of buzz the last week or so. Help us kind of imagine where this platform can go? Is it really limited to shoes that can self-lace and tie themselves or is this the first foray and basically kind of a shoe with a power source that\u2019s living and breathing, can adapt, sense and record data and is that the direction this might go in the future?","Mark Parker","B. Absolutely, it\u2019s sort of a gateway as to a whole new era of what we call personalized performance and that\u2019s not just in terms of fit, it\u2019s in terms of cushioning, support real time. That\u2019s what is exciting about it. There\u2019s a lot I\u2019d love to talk about which I sometimes say, but I really can\u2019t. But I\u2019ll \u2013 suffice it to say at least at this stage that the HyperAdapt or the adaptive performance technology is not just centered on fit. We\u2019ve got so many other opportunities from a complete performance standpoint. And what you\u2019ll see coming out very soon in Q2 will be the tip of an iceberg that I think is actually quite compelling.","Omar Saad","Thank you.","Nitesh Sharan","Thanks, Omar. Operator, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","The last question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Sorry for that and thanks for letting me queue back in. Andy, I wanted to ask you about your comment on U.S. futures relative to sales. You said that sales should be outpacing futures. Can you give us any guidelines on how we should be thinking about the rate of sales or future growth for the U.S. division into the back half?","Andy Campion","Sure, Lindsay. I think the key driver to keep in mind is sell-through to consumers. We\u2019re seeing much tighter supply and demand and stronger sell-through to consumers. So in the same vein as some of the comments that I made around futures, futures are not really a proxy for revenue. In fact, you don\u2019t need a proxy for revenue guidance because we provide that guidance. Really futures are one of the drivers. There are other dimensions of the business, be that what we call at-once or prop business, obviously, our factory stores. There are a number of other dimensions but one of the primary drivers of that greater growth on the revenue line as compared to futures in any given period is that strong sell-through. And as Trevor I think spoke about in a fair amount of detail, we\u2019re seeing a return to a strong healthy pull market. And again that\u2019s also evidenced or corroborated by the declining inventory in North America.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","So maybe to ask another way, how should we thinking about the revenue growth outlook for the U.S. market into the back half of the year and how should we be thinking about the timeline to returning the U.S. business towards your long-term algorithm of revenue growth and some margin expansion?","Andy Campion","As you know, Lindsay, we don\u2019t give geography-by-geography quarterly revenue guidance. What I would tell you is precisely what we told you on the call, which is we do see revenue outpacing futures. And I\u2019d reiterate our view on North America is the geography that we shared at our Investor Day in October. We see North America as a high-single-digit growth geography out to 2020. We don\u2019t manage in a strict way to those measures in any given quarter but we\u2019re as confident as ever in that trajectory driven by our brand and our product.","Mark Parker","I\u2019ll just say the brand in North America remains incredibly strong and we\u2019re seeing really just great momentum across the business. As we obviously launched a lot of the new products into the marketplace, certainly the Solider 10, the KD9, XXXI, the Epic Low, I can continue naming a few but the point there would be that the marketplace just continues to see very great response to those items. So we feel very good about North America and its continued growth and the brand is as strong as ever. And we\u2019re just seeing momentum in the marketplace and we\u2019re excited about the pipeline of great products that we have coming. So, again, we just look forward to it. So it\u2019s all good.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay, great. Thanks.","Nitesh Sharan","Thank you, Lindsay. That\u2019s all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.","Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations and discounts, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's first quarter fiscal 2013 results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Charlie Denson, President of the NIKE Brand. And finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.","Mark G. Parker","Thanks, Kelley, and hello, everyone. I believe our Q1 results illustrate something core about NIKE, Inc. and the business we're in: sports. The best athletes and great companies have strong fundamentals, and they constantly pursue their potential. That's what I see for NIKE, Inc. in Q1 and beyond.","So let's take a look at the financial results for Q1. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 10% with constant currency growth across nearly all geographies, categories and brands. Excluding currency changes, our revenues were up 15%, fueled by double-digit growth in the NIKE Brand and Converse. That's incredible growth in any environment and even more remarkable given the volatile global economy. We expected earnings per share to be lower than last year and they were, down 10% to $1.23. Gross margins fell about 80 basis points, but that's slightly better than we expected and sequentially better than Q4. And in line with our plan, SG&A expenses were higher, up 18%, as we invested in a remarkable array of product innovations and inspiring moments over the Summer of Sports, a solid start to the year and a huge quarter for NIKE innovation. And that's important because in a challenging global economy and marketplace, innovation is one way companies sustain growth and build real separation.","In 2008, we came off the Beijing Olympics with a pipeline of innovation that had potential to define performance and style for years to come. We talked about technologies like Lunar, Flywire, Free and ultra-light high-performance apparel. And we said they could deliver growth by expanding across categories and brands, and we've seen that happen.","Now in 2012, I'm telling you again. We come off our summer of sport with a pipeline of innovation that has the potential to define performance and style for years to come.","First came the European Football Championships. It's the biggest event in global football outside of the World Cup, and NIKE had 5 teams wearing kits that delivered the absolute standard in performance and sustainability. We created 4 unique boots, each one matched to a specific style of play, and their unique color block design made them instantly recognizable by record crowds in the stadiums and around the world. Our message was \"Be fast. Be Seen.\" And we were. That energy translated directly to consumers. Replica sales are strong, and cleated footware alone is up double digits in Western Europe. And that's what happens when products, brand and distribution all line up. It was a great start to the Summer of Sport.","Half a world away, we kicked off the NIKE U.S. Open of Surfing, small in comparison but huge in its market. Close to 1 million people squeezed into 14 acres of sand along Huntington Beach. It's really an exhibition of how we leverage the Nike, Hurley and Converse brand to connect with people and create energy in Action Sports, something we'll continue to do as we develop new products and experiences to support this key category in the future.","And then came the Olympics in London. I've been to just about every major sporting events, and there's really nothing that compares to the Olympics. Everything gets amplified. Athletes are more focused, fans are more excited, nations a little prouder and expectations are sky high. Yet somehow, the athletes and drama exceeded what anyone thought possible. That's the infinite possibility of sports. I was there, and I saw a lot of amazing individual and team performances, and I was very, very proud of NIKE's presence at the games, on the athletes, in the stores and online. We worked with more than 100 sport federations from around the world. 3,000 Olympic athletes wore the swoosh in competition, on the medal stand and around the Olympic Village, and they won more than 160 medals, 59 of them gold. More than 400 track and field athletes competed in those brightly colored Nike Vault flats and spikes. And at retail, the products worn by our athletes became the must-have for consumers.","It's also important to note the increasing participation by women in the Olympics. Every national team included at least one female athlete, a first for the Olympics. Overall, 44% of the athletes in London were women, and that's good for sports and it's good for NIKE. We had a phenomenal summer. It proves something fundamental about NIKE and that innovation is our obsession. We'll always differentiate NIKE, and we will never take it for granted.","Innovation is what fuels the power of our portfolio. Our brands and our categories, along with our operations and partnerships and talent, give us the leadership position we need to compete globally and that diversity helps us win in the most important world markets. It allows NIKE to leverage the strength in one area of the business while making investments in the other areas to drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. These investments include supporting key product innovations, consumer experiences and retail executions, and of course, our efforts to transform the marketplace for the NIKE Brand around the world.","One of the critical markets we're investing in for growth is China and I'd like to spend a minute on that. By any objective measure, we're the undeniable leader for our industry in China. Our brand is the most connected, and we deliver the innovative products consumers want. We don't take our leadership position for granted, and we know we have to earn it every day. And we do. I feel very good about our competitive position in China, and I'm confident in the enormous potential for our business in this market.  At the same time, China is moving toward a more consumer-focused economy. And over the long term, we think this trend is good for NIKE. As more Chinese consumers have significant disposable income and demand for more premium products and presentation, global brands like NIKE, who are delivering on those demands, are winning. That's why we're taking decisive action to assure the relevance of our products, the power of our brands and the health and potential of the marketplace to deliver significant growth that is sustainable and profitable over the long term.","30 years ago we started doing business in China. Today like then, China defies predictions or timetables. But what is certain is that China offers more opportunities for NIKE today than it ever has, and I'm completely committed to extending our leadership position there.","So Q1 was a very good quarter. But like all of you, I'm focused on the future on reaching our full potential. And we have the imagination, the resources and the people to make that happen. And that's why I feel so confident about where we're going.","So thank you everybody, and here's Charlie.","Charles D. Denson","Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everybody. Q1 delivered strong growth for the NIKE Brand, and we're off to a great start for our fiscal year '13. We refer to Q1 as the Summer of Sports, and it's highlighted 3 important competitive advantages for NIKE: innovative product, strong brand connections with consumers and transformative distribution. This is the complete offense we always talk about. It's a foundation of our growth strategy, and it performed very well in Q1.","On a constant-currency basis, global revenue was up 16%. We saw growth across all key categories and geographies except for in Japan. NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer revenue increased 24%, driven by 15% comp store growth and a strong increase in online sales. And global futures expanded 8%.","Clearly, our growth strategy is working around the world, and one of the most powerful parts of that strategy is flexibility. We used the power of our portfolio to target resources and create multiple opportunities both in the moment and in the future.","Most of the -- one of the most powerful elements in our portfolio is our breadth and depth of category expertise, so let's start there. Revenue increased in all of our key categories, with strong double-digit growth in Running, Basketball, Men's Training and Global Football. We did it by creating innovation and performance on the field and connecting with consumers all over the world.","In Running, we started Q1 with the U.S.A. track and field trials in Eugene, and things only got bigger and better as we went to London. The athletes and the Nike products they competed in created one of the most compelling Olympic Games in recent memory. Those amazing performances translated directly to the Running consumer, and that drives growth. Q1 is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our Running category, and our Running business is now 50% bigger than it was just 2 years ago.","We also saw our women's running business outpace our men's business this quarter, a great indication that we're continuing to realize our huge opportunity across the broader women's business. And we're not letting up. Nike+ continues to gather momentum, with over 8 million registered users. It was a strong quarter and more to come from our Running team.","Now to Men's Training. It's firing on all cylinders. Like everyone else in North America, we're excited about the new NFL season, and we're encouraged by the early reaction to our NFL product from the athletes, our retailers and the consumer. Futures orders have exceeded plan, and sell-through has been very strong. We're also looking forward to the MLB playoffs, as our baseball [ph] business continues to grow with our leadership position in both football and baseball.","And in Global Football, Mark talked about the Euro Champs. It's about performance on the pitch, as NIKE footwear dominated the tournament with most goals scored. We also launched an epic football story called My Time Is Now. It averaged 2 million views a day in its first week alone and now tops 30 million, a huge hit in the world of football and another example of how we can connect with the football-obsessed team [ph] digitally. It created a ton of excitement on field, in-store and online and that drove a double-digit increase led by our replica apparel and our performance footwear. Again, innovative product, strong brand connections with consumers and transformative distributions are at the heart of our success with the category offense.","So let's change the lense now and look at the quarter through some of our geographies. North America. This is where our category offense was first deployed and where it's most fully developed, and we continue to see phenomenal results. Every category was up. Footwear was up 20%. Apparel is up 26%. Overall, a very impressive performance, with revenue growing 23% for the quarter. I just want to take the opportunity to say that again, 23%. Will it grow 23% every quarter? Maybe, we'll see. I know there's a lot more opportunity in the market for us.","North America shows how we bring excitement to the marketplace and it happens at our DTC business, where we create tremendous energy with our multi-category brand experience stores and our new smaller category stores. And it happens with our retail partners: House of Hoops with Foot Locker, the Nike Track Club with the Finish Line, the Field House at Dick's Sporting Goods are all experiencing great success. These are among the top performing executions in our industry. And we just opened our first Nike Yardline space with Champs in the U.S. It's the first-ever mall-based specialty American football destination. Football never stops, and we're there for the year-round athlete and the fan.","When we talk about transforming the marketplace, this is what we're referring to: zeroing in on a specific consumer community, really going deep to create products and services that serve the full life experience of the athlete, the very best in world-class performance all the way through to world-class sportswear. We have a name for that, and that strategy, we call it Amplify Sport. Nobody can do it at the level we do it. I really believe it's one of our biggest competitive advantages, and it's key to connecting with consumers, building capacity and demand for our brands throughout the marketplace. What we're doing in North America with innovative product, brand connectivity, improving and distribution, it forms the strategies we use to grow around the world.","Let's go to the Emerging Markets. Growth here is extraordinary, and it has been for some time. Part of that is due to a growing middle class and its insatiable appetite for sport. But a bigger growth driver is how NIKE capitalizes on that opportunity by really understanding the consumer through the category approach. In Q1, we saw growth in every category again, led by our efforts in Running, Football and Sportswear.","Okay. Let's move to Western Europe. Last quarter, we talked a bit about our realignment here, and we're beginning to see some measurable progress. Our EBIT margin was up. And even after some significant investments in both the Euro Champs and the Olympics, our futures are up. And there's more opportunity for us to align more closely with our retail partners across the region to improve merchandise assortment and in-store presentation. That said, there are still a lot of questions on currency and debt, and we continue to monitor our business and the broader economic landscape to appropriately manage our risk. But I'm very pleased with the progress we're making and the financial results that we're delivering.","Okay. Finally, China. Lots of forces at work here and as you've heard us say before, the consumer is becoming more discerning and sophisticated. They want clearer choices. They want more innovation and better services that are tailored to them. At the same time, the economy appears to be slowing, creating short-term impacts for any company doing business there. Certainly, retailers are seeing profit challenges as the industry works to absorb excess inventory. Some choppy waters here for sure. This is a natural evolution that we've seen in many markets, so it's not a surprise. What is a surprise, like everything in China, is how fast it got here. But we're not waiting to see how things play out in the larger economy. We're taking action now to adjust our strategy and expand our leadership position for the long term. We do that by strengthening our fundamentals, and those fundamentals are the same in every market: brand, product and distribution. First, we continue to leverage our brand strength by connecting with consumers through amazing experiences. A great example here is the Festival of Sport. It was 60-day celebration of sports and athletes in multiple cities, and the response was beyond anything we've ever seen in China.","Next comes great product. Apparel has been the biggest challenge, but it remains our biggest opportunity. And we continue to improve the performance, fit and style of our product for the Chinese consumer. We're also bringing a more balanced assortment of performance and sportswear offerings to the market. More than ever, they expect the same level of high-performance products that consumers around the world demand. I feel good about our progress here, and we're sharpening our product focus at every level.","And finally, the retail landscape is changing, and we're helping lead that. We're entering a new phase of distribution in China with an emphasis focused on improving productivity in the Nike mono-brand stores, which is the dominant format that we use in China. We have a head start in this by applying the lessons we've learned in our own DTC business. This is helping elevate how our brands and products are presented and helping our retail partners improve their logistics and their operations.","For consumers, we're delivering stronger assortments, better merchandising and seasonal storytelling. It will have a strong category focus and will leverage our Amplify Sport Strategy that has been so effective in other markets around the world.","These are the keys to expanding capacity and improving productivity for our retail partners in our own stores and online. So everybody wants to know how long will it take? I can't answer that with a specific date. What I can tell you is that I'm confident we're taking the right actions here, as we work with our retail partners to reset the marketplace. The successes we're seeing in North America and our progress in Western Europe reflect our ability to understand the consumer through the category offense and the strategic investments we've made against the biggest growth opportunities. So we're not waiting to evolve our strategy and make the necessary investments in China. We're taking action now to help create a cleaner, healthier and more robust marketplace for the long term. I'm enormously proud of what we've achieved in China, and yet with all that success, China remains one of the largest growth opportunities for the NIKE Brand. We feel very confident that we have the capabilities and commitment to realize that potential.","Q1 shows that NIKE is more than just a brand. It's a portfolio of growth opportunities. It's multiple categories, geographies, product types, price points and marketplaces. We're growing today because of choices and investments we've made in the long-term potential of our business, and those choices are based on serving the athlete, never sacrificing our premium positioning or the performance of our product.","So we've come out of the blocks fast in Q1. We delivered an amazing number of innovations. We created and shared a lot of magical sport moments on the world stage, and we delivered some pretty good results. Earlier I said, football never ends, but it's much bigger than that. Sports never ends and neither does our commitment to innovate and grow this brand or this company.","Thanks, and now here's Don.","Donald W. Blair","Okay. Thanks, Charlie. Like the global economy, growth across the individual components of NIKE, Inc. will not always be uniform. As both Mark and Charlie discussed, the strength of our portfolio allows us to invest in opportunities for growth while delivering consistent profitability. Let me highlight 3 points to put this into context: first, that our portfolio lets us leverage our innovation and brand strength to attack commercial opportunities across multiple dimensions. You saw that reflected in our Q1 results as our brand strength and past innovations drove powerful revenue growth across categories, geographies and product types. And you'll see it in our future results as we fully commercialize this year's brand stories and innovations such as Flyknit and Digital Sport.","Second, that the diversity of our portfolio and the strength of our balance sheet allow us to more effectively manage risk. As we face pressures in one part of our business, we're well positioned to manage the impact of those pressures over time, while leveraging the stronger parts of our portfolio to drive solid near-term profitability.","And third, that our portfolio and business model allow us to invest for long-term growth while delivering increased profits and cash returns in the near term. In Q1, those investments and product innovation and brand development delivered consumer engagement and revenue growth our competitors can't match. Going forward, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach to making those investments that have the greatest potential for strong returns.","There were many great performances in Q1, both on the field of play and on the P&L. I'll be speaking about many of the latter as I recap our Q1 results. But before I do, I'd like to address 2 areas of the business that are currently a significant focus for our management team, and that's China and gross margin. Let me take China first.","We're the clear industry leader in China, and we intend to expand that lead. There is tremendous potential for profitable growth in this market, and we're taking the appropriate steps now to capture that potential. Even so, the marketplace in China is changing in predictable ways but at an unprecedented pace. Charlie described how we'll continue to leverage our brand strength, deliver product assortments more sharply focused for Chinese consumers and transform our distribution network. As we reset the market, we will tighten our futures orders to ensure a quality order book and work with our retail partners to clear the marketplace of excess inventory.","Combined with the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the shakeout in the broader industry, these actions will create some near-term volatility in our financial results. As these changes take hold, we expect to see improved retailer inventory turns and store productivity creating the foundation for sustainable profitable growth for NIKE and our retail partners.","The second area of focus for us right now is gross margin. Q1 gross margin was 80 basis points below the prior year, slightly better than the guidance we gave last quarter and continuing the quarter-by-quarter trend of improvement. As we've said before, our gross margin has a large number of moving parts. When we dig into the details, we're encouraged by the trends. We continue to see benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives. And the pricing actions we've taken over the last 4 seasons largely offset the impact of higher input costs, which are starting to ease. We're also delivering gross margin expansion from our fast-growing Direct to Consumer business. That said, we've seen shifts in the mix of our business that are accelerating growth in revenue and profits but putting pressure on consolidated gross margin.","The revenue growth delivered by our North American business in Q1 was exceptional, reflecting a great start with the NFL and ongoing strength in our overall business. Both the North America geography and the NFL licensed product generate lower-than-average gross margins. We're delivering a significant amount of innovative product into marketplace. Gross margins are typically lower for these products when they're first introduced.","For the Converse brand, we've converted China from a license market to direct distribution. That drives higher growth and profitability but lower gross margin. And looking ahead, we will begin to see increasing gross margin pressure from weaker foreign currencies starting in Q2.","As we've said before, we don't manage any line item of our P&L in isolation. It's our job to manage the company holistically to make the right investments and deliver growth in profits and cash flow. We're confident in our ability to drive margin expansion over the long term and continue to expect margin expansion in the second half of FY '13, with the full year essentially flat.","Now let me provide a recap of our Q1 results. First quarter reported revenue for NIKE, Inc. grew 10%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 15%, as the NIKE Brand grew 16% and our Other Businesses grew 9%. NIKE Brand futures orders increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by a 5-point increase in units and a 3-point increase in average price per unit. Every key category increased, led by Running, Basketball and Men's Training, which each grew double digits. Futures were higher for every geography except China, which declined 6%. On a reported basis, futures grew 6%, reflecting weaker international currencies.","As expected, our first quarter diluted EPS were below the prior year, down 10% to $1.23. Although our underlying revenue growth was very strong, unfavorable currency translation, lower gross margin and planned demand creation investments reduced our bottom line. Excluding Cole Haan and Umbro, businesses we expect to divest this year, EPS for Q1 would have been about $1.27, 9% below last year.","Demand creation grew 29% for the quarter, driven by investments in the Olympics and Euro Champs as well as product launches for the NFL and Digital Sport. Operating overhead grew 12% for the quarter, reflecting mid-teens growth in Direct to Consumer costs and low-double-digit growth for wholesale and corporate overhead. The translation of foreign currency-denominated profits, net of year-over-year currency gains and losses that are reported in Other Income, reduced reported EBIT by about $28 million in Q1. This downside was driven primarily by weakness in the euro and emerging market currencies.","The effective tax rate for Q1 was 27.5% compared to 24.3% for first quarter of fiscal 2012. The increase was largely due to a shift in the earnings mix to higher tax countries, most significantly the U.S., as well as the higher tax rate for our international operations.","Q1 inventory grew 10% versus last year, in line with revenue growth. NIKE Brand unit inventories grew 3%, slower than the 5% unit growth in futures. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made. Inventories in North America are tight, and Western Europe has come out of the Olympics and Euro Champs in good shape. As a percentage of our worldwide inventories, closeouts are in line with the prior year. Our main area of focus now is China, where we continue to manage down inventories on our books and in the market. As I said earlier, we'll continue to buy product against the quarterly order book -- a quality order book, and we'll aggressively move closeout product to position ourselves for growth.","Our balance sheet remains strong as we held $3.3 billion of cash at quarter end with less than $400 million of debt. Our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 21.3%, down 130 basis points from the prior year, largely reflecting the timing of earnings growth across quarters.","As we've said on many occasions, we're committed to consistently increasing cash returns to shareholders. Last week, we completed our most recent share repurchase program, $5 billion, 1 year earlier than planned. For the program, we repurchased almost 60 million shares at an average price just over $84. Last week, our board approved the new $8 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to execute over the next 4 years.","Now let's take a look at our performance by segment, starting with North America. Our momentum in North America accelerated in Q1 as revenues increased a phenomenal $500 million, up 23% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. Every key category grew, with Running, Basketball and Men's Training reporting growth of over 20%. Footwear revenue increased 20% and apparel revenue grew 26% due in part to the addition of the NFL. Direct to Consumer revenues grew 23%. Q1 EBIT for North America grew 17% as revenue growth, operating overhead leverage and improved gross margin were partially offset by an increase in demand creation.","In Western Europe, Q1 revenues increased 6% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in all territories except Italy and Iberia. 6 of 7 key categories grew, led by double-digit increases in Running, Football and Basketball. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues for Western Europe declined 5% and EBIT declined 4% as higher gross margin was partially offset by demand creation investments in the Euro Champs and Olympics.","In Central and Eastern Europe, Q1 revenues increased 16% on a currency-neutral basis led by double-digit growth in Russia and Turkey. Revenues for all categories increased, with Running, Football and Sportswear the biggest growth drivers. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues for CEE increased 2% and EBIT declined 13%. The EBIT decline was driven by weaker currencies, as well as higher demand creation investments.","In China, currency-neutral revenue grew 7% in Q1, reflecting double-digit growth in Running, Basketball, Action Sports and Global Football. For the quarter, Footwear revenue advanced 12%, while apparel was down 1%. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for China grew 8% and EBIT decreased 4% as higher revenues were offset by increased operating overhead and investments in demand creation.","In Japan, currency-neutral revenues decreased 7% in Q1, driven by weakness in Sportswear, as well as Men's and Women's Training. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for Japan declined 6% and EBIT declined by 29%, driven by lower revenues and gross margin, as well as SG&A deleverage.","Our Emerging Markets geography continues to drive outstanding growth as Q1 revenues grew 22%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Revenue growth was broad-based as every territory and 6 of 7 key categories posted double-digit growth. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 8% and EBIT grew 17%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion.","First quarter revenues for our Other Businesses increased 9% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, driven by low-double-digit growth at Converse and mid-single-digit growth at NIKE Golf and Hurley. EBIT for these Other Businesses increased 16%, driven by higher profits in every business.","Beginning with Q1, we're reporting the results of Cole Haan and Umbro, as well as the costs associated with divesting of them as Businesses to be Divested. For the quarter, revenue for the Businesses to be Divested grew 4% and EBIT was flat as EBIT growth at Cole Haan was offset by a decline at Umbro.","Let me now turn to our outlook for the remainder of FY '13. As we did last quarter, we'll provide separate guidance for our ongoing operations and our Businesses to be Divested. Let me start with the Businesses to be Divested. We're continuing the process of identifying buyers for Cole Haan and Umbro and preparing those businesses for sale. Both sale processes are on track with multiple prospective buyers. At this stage, we cannot predict the ultimate financial impact of these businesses on FY '13 results. However, the following reflects our current estimates. The financial impact will be comprised of 4 parts: Part 1, the operating results for Cole Haan and Umbro. As you know, these results are subject to a number of variables, most notably the timing of the divestitures and the commercial performance of the businesses. Taking into account actual results for Q1 and assuming both businesses were owned for the duration of FY '13, we continue to expect they would report a consolidated pretax loss of $50 million to $75 million.","Part 2, the costs for executing the transactions and other costs related to the divestitures. Although the total cost for these items is not known at this time, we don't expect these costs will be material until we execute the transactions.","Part 3, noncash charges related to the divestiture of Umbro. Upon the sale of the business or when the ultimate selling price becomes estimable, we expect to incur noncash charges to liquidate certain balance sheet accounts, most significantly the cumulative translation adjustment and deferred tax assets related to Umbro. Based on the August 31, balance sheet, we anticipate a pretax charge of $155 million -- or $100 million after tax for the CTA and an after-tax charge of $32 million for the deferred tax assets.","And Part 4, gains or losses on the sale of the businesses, we cannot -- which cannot be estimated at this time. For Q2 of FY '13, assuming neither Cole Haan nor Umbro is divested during the quarter, we estimate a consolidated pretax loss from these businesses of approximately $25 million.","Our guidance for ongoing operations excludes FY '12 and FY '13 results for Cole Haan and Umbro, as well as the FY '13 impact of divesting them. This guidance includes our preliminary estimates for China as we begin to implement the marketplace strategies we outlined earlier. We expect Q2 and FY '13 constant-currency revenue growth at a high-single to low-double-digit rate. However, on a reported basis, we continue to expect mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth, reflecting weaker foreign currencies, particularly the euro.","For gross margin, we expect the year-over-year decline in Q2 to be generally in line with Q1 actual results as improving input costs and the benefits of higher prices are more than offset by weaker foreign exchange rates. For the second half of FY '13, we continue to expect sequential gross margin improvement quarter-on-quarter, with margins essentially flat for the full year.","We expect Q2 and full year SG&A to grow at or slightly higher than the rate of revenue growth at a high-single- to low-double-digit rate as we continue to invest in our brands, DTC and innovation while driving leverage in our core operating overhead. We continue to expect the FY '13 effective tax rate will be about 26.5%, with the second half of the year roughly 1 point lower than the first half.","For me, there were 3 key takeaways from our Q1 results: One, we have tremendous brand strength and a deep pipeline of innovation that will continue to fuel our revenue growth in FY '13 and beyond. Two, the pace of growth across individual dimensions of our business may vary, but the breadth of our portfolio and our financial strength will enable us to manage risk in an uncertain environment. And three, we have the flexibility and financial discipline to invest for long-term growth while delivering near-term profit and cash flow.","We're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citigroup.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering with regards to your guidance that you just gave, how you should be thinking about price increases going forward? I know you're going to be lapping some pretty big price increases that you took across your portfolio at the beginning of the calendar year. So I wondered if you could maybe give a little bit more detail on that.","Donald W. Blair","Well, Kate, what we expect to be doing as we go forward -- and this is not just an FY '13 approach, but we are doing season in and season out work to make sure that we've got the price-value equation in the right place across our line. So we think what you'll see for fall of -- what you saw for fall of 2012 and into holiday of 2012 and then onto the spring and summer is not as much of an across-the-board type of price movement as you saw in the last couple of seasons, but a lot more style-by-style, product-by-product price increase. So we do expect, over time, we're going to see more pricing certainly in the next few years than what we saw over the last 10. But you're not going to see the same kind of across-the-board price that we saw in the last couple of seasons.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then for my second question, I know there's a lot of moving parts when it comes to China with all the different things you're doing to better position the brand and hold the category offense. But near term, once you do get through the Sportswear inventory, what is your expectation for that Sportswear category? What is going to drive that Sportswear category to be more of a driver of growth [indiscernible]?","Charles D. Denson","Kate, it's Charlie. Well, I think, certainly, our ability to flow and merchandise the products into the retail marketplace is something we're really focused on. Retail productivity and profitability is a major focus going forward. I think it's paramount in the execution of the Sportswear strategy. With that said, continuing to balance the offering between performance and Sportswear is really where we're ultimately headed. I think something else that we've realized is continuing to really tailor a specific fit for the Chinese consumer is important, especially in the apparel side of the business and we're working on that. So we're still very bullish, long-term, on the opportunity, whether it's from the Sportswear side or the performance side. I think as we've said many times on the way, this -- the Amplify Sport approach, where we really build the brand off of our core [ph] performance positioning and leverage that into the Sportswear arena is the way that we will attack the Chinese market just like we do the rest of the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. I guess the first question is, it was obviously noticeable how strong the total revenue growth was versus the futures number, constant currency, put up last quarter. Any thoughts on that 15% global comp gain, sort of what drove it this quarter and why or why wouldn't that continue going forward? That was one question. And just a follow-up on China, can you give us a little more color on what the futures -- that minus 6 China futures? Is it Sportswear futures are down big in China but technical footwear is up or in technical apparel is up or flat? Or just sort of some color on if there's a pretty dramatic difference between sort of your Sportswear business in China in the outlook and whether you're actually growing the higher price point technical product.","Charles D. Denson","Okay. Robbie, it's Charlie. Let me take the comp store number first. I think what you saw was an incredibly strong brand and some incredibly strong product coming out of the DTC numbers. A lot of that number was being driven out of the North American marketplace, the -- it's weighted where we saw a huge success in the North American marketplace and something that I think is indicative of our ability to continue to drive our -- both our brand and the business forward as we think about that. And with regard to the 6% number in China, it's really relatively balanced across both Footwear and apparel and Sportswear and performance. I would say that Sportswear numbers are a little bit -- I mean, the -- excuse me, the performance numbers are a little bit stronger. And I would also add that it's our goal right now to manage the supply into that marketplace. I mean, one of the things that we've always talked about is the strength of the brand in the marketplace and creating a pull market and making sure that our supply and demand ratios are intact. Right now, we have an overabundance of supply and we need to manage that as we continue to drive demand.","Donald W. Blair","Yes, I wanted to -- Robbie, I just want to add one more thing. The other thing that's really powering our DTC business is really stronger operations. Those store operations are getting better and better. And Charlie referenced this earlier in terms of our learning that we can deploy back into the wholesale business as well. But our DTC operations are becoming more and more productive on a door basis, and that's also helping fuel the comps.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just one last follow-up. Charlie, on the China futures number, it's down 6%, not -- obviously not a number that we all like seeing. But the local Chinese brands are putting up much worse numbers than that and look to be under much greater pressure in the Chinese market than your brand is. Can you give us a sense on what the kind of market share opportunity is for you? Some -- a lot of the partners you work with also work with these Chinese brands that are really getting killed over there. Can you just give us a sense on how you think that could play to your advantage?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, well, I think, I mean, you're right, Robbie. I mean, you bring that up. I think the competitive landscape right now for us on the long term -- actually, we're pretty -- we feel good about because to your point, a lot of the local brands have really struggled and have continued to show an inability to figure out how to go forward. I think that offers up longer term some great market share opportunity for us. In the near term though, it really -- with the discounted products from all the brands in the marketplace, it tends to throw some of the market share numbers off a little bit depending on who's discounting the heaviest and who's moving, trying to move the most inventory. But that being said, I do see a consolidation in that marketplace. We've seen it time and time again around the world as markets develop, and I think you're going to see some of that in China as well. But we still believe that, that market has a ton of growth left in it. And I don't want to let that get away from any of these conversations, that it's still a very, very big growth opportunity for the NIKE Brand.","Mark G. Parker","This is Mark. I'm going to jump in here. The strength of the category offense that you're seeing more in full bloom here in North America, it really represents the huge opportunity in China over the long term. So we have the strongest offering of product across the categories, across product types than we've ever had as a company in large part due to the focus we've had by category. And as we leverage that position more effectively in China, I think you're going to see that competitive advantage of NIKE actually extend itself.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Poser with Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. What happened -- what do you think you might have misread in China as to sort of the speed of change? And how do you view the customer there or the consumer there differently then in their development cycle than you saw maybe in Western Europe or other markets that you've developed and over time?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, I think, I mean -- I think the biggest thing that we've alluded to is just the pace at which the change occurred. It's like I said. I think we've said it in the prepared remarks as well in a sense that we have been talking about this for probably the last 6 months, 6 to 12 months. I think the pace from which it has accelerated, I would say, maybe caught us a little off guard. That being said, I really feel good about the direction that we're headed. I think back to what Mark just talked about, our ability to differentiate our distribution network and create differentiation in the marketplace, which ultimately creates capacity. I think 2 -- or 1 of the other things that we certainly didn't see coming was the slowdown economically and what the impact that might be having. We don't look at that as an excuse. And we, in a lot of ways, look at that as an opportunity because I think it does shake out the marketplace. And I think you're going to see some consolidation. And I think that benefits us.","Sam Poser - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then secondly, just a follow-up on that. I believe much of the question was answered before. Do you see -- how much of a divergence do you see between the -- like the acceptance of NIKE Footwear in China versus apparel? I mean, my impression in talking to a lot of people is that it's almost like almost 2 separate brands right now in that the Footwear has been extremely well accepted. It stands more apart from maybe more the other at least. The consumer doesn't maybe understand it apart from the other rather than the apparel. I wonder if you could just...","Charles D. Denson","Yes. I think, I mean -- I think certainly, your points are probably fair. I mean, obviously, the brand, the Footwear product has the capacity to really be more. I mean, as much as we feel great about the innovations we've introduced on the performance side of Footwear, a lot of it are just pretty cool looking. And in China, it's certainly resonating with the consumer. And I think that's why we continue to have some pretty good success on the Footwear side. And I think the apparel side is a little bit different in a sense that, that consumer is not as developed or sophisticated as a consumer in the western marketplaces, like Western Europe or U.S. That being said, they're getting there very quickly, which again plays into why we feel so confident long term that we've got the right offense and that we're posed to continue to grow in the long term. I think once we get through a little bit of this inventory issue on the apparel side and continue to work through the retail productivity opportunities, we're going to be in good shape.","Mark G. Parker","I wouldn't over rev on the apparel piece too much here. A lot of the advancement we're going to be making in apparel, I believe, is executing the fundamentals better. Charlie mentioned getting the fit more tailored to the Chinese consumer. We're doing that. And some of the early sell-throughs we're seeing there are actually quite impressive, and then actually just making a more directed assortment for our retail partners as well. So we see an opportunity there, just basically executing the fundamentals of the apparel business even better and then helping our retailers become more productive in that segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the pricing question. The price increases that you've been putting through so far, have you been seeing any resistance at the consumer level, at the retail level? And if so, is that why, Don, you talked about being a little bit more differentiated in price increases, longer term, and certain styles and SKUs will see price increases and others won't?","Charles D. Denson","Yes, I would say we have seen very little. There has been maybe a couple of styles. But overall, we're very happy with -- I mean, as you can see, the revenue numbers continue to go well. The unit numbers continue to climb. And so we're seeing some very strong brand strength and performance in sell-through at retail. And I think -- obviously, I think most everybody is doing their store checks and checking our sell-through rate. Certainly, here in the U.S., we have seen very little resistance to the price. So we are still very confident. And then I'll just go back to what Don talked a little bit earlier. It's just continuing to look at this opportunity case by case, from geography to geography, from category to category and really continuing to sharpen our ability to take price where we feel we have the opportunity and not to where we're taking advantage or we're going to get hurt on the revenue line.","Mark G. Parker","And that's exactly what I would emphasize. This is about maximizing the profitability and the value creation, Omar. It's not about believing that we don't have the strength in the brand and the product to take the price.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And if you guys see we're in -- feel we're in maybe a long-term structurally, more inflationary environment, rising wages? Do you see an opportunity to maybe take -- continue to take price over time, maybe even take price in excess of the inflationary increases given the innovation that you're putting out there?","Mark G. Parker","Yes. We're certainly looking at those opportunities, and I think you hit it. The innovation that we have coming in the pipeline, I think, is going to demand some premium pricing. We're very happy, as Charlie said, with the leverage that we've created, with the price increases that we've had. And I'm bullish knowing what's coming in the pipeline to see that we have more of those opportunities in front of us.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And any quick update on Flyknit and its first kind of initial rollout, how you feel about how that's going, especially in light of -- I think you've taken some legal action recently to keep proprietary and protect some of the proprietary properties [ph] around that?","Mark G. Parker","Yes. Well, first of all, I'm very bullish on Flyknit, as I've been publicly stating since the very beginning there. From a performance standpoint, obviously, from a sustainability standpoint, incredible innovation that has the potential to really significantly, over time, decrease our product cost while we increase the performance. And we can do some things from a performance standpoint that are extraordinary. I mean, what we're seeing in the first stages of Flyknit is just sort of the tip of the iceberg. Some of the successive generations that we're already working on are incredibly impressive. And I say that not only as the CEO but as a shoe dog. Yes, I'm not surprised that we've got some imitation going on in the marketplace or attempted innovation. We expect to see that, but we'll defend our position certainly. It's very important to us.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I think, Don, in the past, you've shared with us some visibility on the front-half and back-half of the futures window. Would you be -- could you help us out with understanding what the front-half and back-half looks like in the China futures window?","Donald W. Blair","I can't do it on a geography basis. I don't have that to hand, but what I will tell you on an aggregate basis, the constant-dollar futures are balanced. But from a currency standpoint, the currency comparisons are tougher in the first half of the window. So it's slightly backloaded on a reported basis but balanced on a constant-dollar basis.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Then maybe you could tell us how the global futures number then splits up between ASP and units?","Donald W. Blair","Yes, that was in the prepared remarks. It's 5 on units and 3 on ASP.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then can you -- I know in the 10-Q, you guys released your inventories by region. Would you be willing to share your China inventories at quarter end and then perhaps -- a big gray area in the past has been visibility into inventories out in the channel in China. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about how good you feel like your visibility is there today and how you're gauging the health of the inventory out there right now, maybe what inning we're in of clearing those inventories that aren't exactly on your -- on the corporate P&L.","Donald W. Blair","Well, first of all, the inventory information will be in the SEC filings. So I'd rather leave it to that in terms of providing that information. I think, as Charlie said, one of the things that is creating the speed with which the situation is developing is that we are managing it assertively. We do have good visibility into the channel. It's not perfect. But in China, we have pretty good visibility into the channel and when we see it building up, we're going to take action on that. And that's one of the reasons why were going to be managing our futures. So I'd say we're -- it's going to take us some time to work our way through this, but we have reasonable visibility and we're going to take the actions we need to, to clear out the market -- clear out the channel.","Kelley Hall","All right. Well, thank you, everybody, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect."]}}
