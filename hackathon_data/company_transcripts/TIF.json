(NYSE:TIF) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call May 21, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Ralph Nicoletti - EVP and CFO","Mark Aaron - Investor Relations","Analysts","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Company First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Mr. Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Thank you and hello everyone. Earlier today we issued Tiffany\u2019s first quarter financial results and I hope I know you\u2019ve had a chance to read the news release. I\u2019m pleased to have Tiffany's new Chief Financial Officer, Ralph Nicoletti here with me to review highlights of those results and to comment on the outlook for the rest of the year.","As always we first ask you to note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now we can proceed. We think you will agree that Tiffany has enjoyed a strong start to 2014 with solid sales and earnings growth in the first quarter. Worldwide net sales increased by 13% or 15% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with strong growth in most regions, including unusually strong growth in Japan which I will address shortly.","We had a net of three stores, sales growth occurred across all of jewelry categories, which we are pleased to say included a healthy increase in the fashion jewelry category. Operating margin rose due to a higher gross margin and an improved expense ratio and net earnings rose 50% on a GAAP basis and 41% when excluding one-time charges in last year\u2019s first quarter.","Looking first at sales performance in the quarter, all regions achieved total sales growth in dollars and on a constant-exchange-rate basis. ","In the Americas region, total sales rose 8% due to an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. However, while overall jewelry unit volume was almost equal to last year, we were pleased with healthy unit growth in the fine solitaire and statement jewelry and engagement jewelry categories as well as with an improving trend in fashion jewelry.","We believe these improved results in the Americas reflect to some degree enhance selling initiatives being taken by regional management that are focused on better engaging customers through our sales professional and enhanced visual merchandising in our stores. Another factor contributing to the growth were sales from our successful annual Blue Book event in April, in New York.","On a constant-exchange-rate basis, comparable store sales increased 8%, which is on top of a 3% comp increase from last year\u2019s first quarter. Geographically we saw solid comp growth in many of our markets and in our New York flagship store. In addition, net sales growth in both the New York flagship store and the overall region was driven by a combination of domestic customer demand and sales to foreign tourists.","In fact, we even saw slight sales increase in the tourist markets of Hawaii and Guam, which had been challenging for a while. Lastly, I\u2019m sure some of you\u2019re wondering about our Valentine\u2019s Day, so I\u2019m pleased to report that despite snowstorms that affected a number of our stores in the eastern U.S., we enjoyed very good Valentine\u2019s Day results.","In other parts of the Americas region, a lack of sales growth in Canada surely reflected a difficult comparison to several large statement jewelry transactions last year. On the other hand, our stores in Latin America posted solid constant currency sales growth.","During the first quarter we opened a store in Cancun, marking our 11th store in Mexico. We also saw solid growth in the Asia Pacific region with total sales of 17% in the quarter, primarily due to strong unit volume growth across all jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales rose 19% in the quarter with comp store sales growth of 10% that was generated by strong sales growth across Greater China as well as in Australia.","This was on top of a 9% comp increase in last year\u2019s first quarter. We didn\u2019t open any stores in Asia Pacific in the quarter, however, to reiterate what\u2019s been said in the past, expanding brand awareness of Tiffany & Co. in China through our store base and marketing activities is important to generate local sales growth, but also the influence Chinese tourists when they travel to our other markets.","As you saw in our news release, Tiffany had a very strong quarter in Japan however you measure it. In dollars, total sales rose 20% due to growth both in the average price per jewelry unit sold and in jewelry unit volume. But the yen was on average about 9% weaker than the U.S. dollar year-over-year. So when excluding that negative translation effect, total sales in the yen increased 29% in the first quarter and comp store sales rose 30%.","We think you will agree that this substantial increase was even more impressive when we consider that comps in last year\u2019s first quarter had increased 21%. Of course it was widely reported in the media that overall consumer spending in Japan surged in March prior to an April 1st increase in their consumption tax. And Tiffany sales surged to due to the pull forward of buying.","As expected, since then, we\u2019ve been experiencing sales declines which have been recently moderating. As a result, we\u2019re not changing our previous expectation for healthy sales growth in the full-year. During the quarter, we opened the store in the Sogo department store, in Kobe.","Looking at Europe, total sales rose 9% in the first quarter. However, a large portion of that sales increase reflected translation benefits from the strengthening of both the pound and euro versus the dollar. Therefore on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 2% on higher jewelry unit volume, while comp store sales declined 3% as compared to a 6% comp increase in the first quarter of 2013.","Geographically constant currency comps in the U.K. and overall Continental Europe were similarly soft, although individual performances by country within Continental Europe were mixed. We believe Tiffany is being affected by economic challenges in some European countries, but another factor to consider is tourism.","We have estimated that foreign tourist spending represents more than a quarter of our sales in Europe and those sales in the first quarter were flat with last year, which might reflect the impact from strengthening European currencies.","But looking at the bigger picture, Tiffany continues to expand its brand awareness in Europe and beyond and we\u2019re confident that there are significant long-term store and market share growth opportunities.","We also expanded Tiffany\u2019s presence in Paris last month when we opened a major store on the magnificent Champs Elysees; although the store\u2019s grand opening celebration will be in a few weeks. Not surprisingly the store is already serving many foreign visitors; in fact you might be interested to know that 15 languages are spoken by our staff in the Champs Elysees stores.","Rounding out the regional sales review, Tiffany\u2019s other sales increased 39% in the first quarter. A portion of that increase was due to 18% comparable store sales growth in the five stores we operate in the United Arab Emirates. In addition, we were delighted to open our first company operated Tiffany & Co. store in Moscow in the famous GUM department store during the quarter and initial results were encouraging. The balance of the increase in other sales was due to wholesale sales of diamonds that we acquired through our rough sourcing program and subsequently sell because they don\u2019t need our requirements.","Our worldwide expansion plans continue to call for opening 13 stores in 2014, a few of which have a more noteworthy market presence and closing four smaller ones, which in total represents a net 3% increase in company operated locations and a net 4% increase in gross square footage.","We will also be renovating a number of older stores to enhance their market presence, visual merchandising and the in-store customer experience. Beyond our store base worldwide e-commerce sales increased 6% in the first quarter. In addition to contributing to overall sales growth, our Web site served as an important marketing communications vehicle that helped to drive store traffic.","So that covers the regional sales review. In terms of merchandising highlights for the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we were pleased with varying degrees of sales growth in all product categories. We continue to see healthy growth in statement, fine, and solitaire jewelry, meaning pieces with diamonds and other gemstones at mid to higher price points.","As we\u2019ve noted on previous calls, we\u2019ve been seeing increasing interest in colored diamonds and other gemstones and some examples would include the Yellow Diamond, Enchant, and Victoria collections among many others. And in statement jewelry, I already alluded to the success of our Blue Book event in April, in New York. That event showcase truly extraordinary and one of a kind pieces for select customers who visited us from around the world. The response was excellent and sales far surpassed the successful Blue Book event we held last year.","The engagement jewelry category was another strong performer in the quarter, reflecting substantial demand for diamond solitaire rings and wedding bands as well. The relatively new Harmony collection continued to perform very well, complimenting of course our iconic six-prong Tiffany setting and other settings too.","And we\u2019re definitely encouraged with solid improvement in our fashion jewelry category in silver, but even more so in gold pieces, probably the biggest story in that category is the success of our distinctive Atlas collection introduced last fall and being expanded now with additional designs.","A few other product highlights worth mentioning in the fine and fashion categories in the first quarter, included strong growth in Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard, a truly timeless collection originally introduced 40 years ago. The continued resurgence of the Keys collection, especially in styles with diamonds, and Paloma Picasso\u2019s Olive Leaf collection that debuted last year.","For later in the year, we\u2019re looking forward to the global introduction in September of a major new fashion jewelry collection with some pieces extending into fine jewelry in a range of precious metals both with and without diamonds. Please stay tuned for that exciting launch. So you can see that this strong sales growth in the first quarter clearly reflected solid results across most regions and product categories.","I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph to review the rest of the earnings statement and the balance sheet, and to update you on our full-year expectations. Ralph?","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark. I\u2019m delighted to be at Tiffany. Already in my brief time here, I can clearly see the strength, expansion potential, and earnings power of this great brand. Before going into the specifics, the key points to take away which drove our first quarter results are solid broad based sales growth across product categories and most geographies, accelerated purchasing patterns in Japan prior to the April 1st consumption tax increase, margin improvement on both gross and operating level, primarily driven by product cost, pricing and leveraging fixed cost, all of which leads to raising our full-year outlook to $4.15 to $4.25 per share.","As Mark provided the sales review, I\u2019ll now comment on the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 58.2% was 2 full points higher than last year with the improvement resulting from favorable product costs, price increases taken across all product categories and regions, and meaningful sales leverage on fixed cost, and of course, the strong sales increase in Japan had some positive effect on overall gross margin.","In addition, because of the improvement in fashion jewelry sales, we\u2019re pleased to be seeing a narrowing gap in the rate of sales growth for this category relative to other jewelry categories, which in the first quarter led to a minimal negative effect from sales mix on the gross margin. Overall, we continue to expect an increase in gross margin for the full-year, but not at the first quarter\u2019s magnitude.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% in the first quarter, largely reflecting higher store related expenses and labor costs, of which a portion is variable. I should add that marketing expenses in the first quarter were lower than last year, but we expect those expenses as initially planned to be considerably higher year-over-year for the remaining quarters of 2014.","As we noted in our release, last year\u2019s first quarter included $9 million of cost for staff and occupancy reductions. Excluding those expenses SG&A would have increased 8% in the quarter. Our outlook for the full-year continues to call for SG&A expense growth below the rate of sales growth.","Operating earnings grew 49%, but 39% when excluding last year\u2019s charges, driven by sizable increases in sales and gross profits and leveraging SG&A expenses which was partly driven by the timing of marketing spending. Therefore the operating margin of 21% in the first quarter represented a solid increase over last year.","Interest and other expenses net were $16 million in the quarter. And Tiffany\u2019s effective income tax rate of 35.1% in the quarter was virtually in line with last year. Putting it all together, net earnings in the quarter rose 50% to $126 million or $0.97 per diluted share. The increase was 41% when excluding the cost for staff and occupancy reductions in last year\u2019s first quarter.","These operating results and efficient balance sheet are contributing to improvements in our returns on asset and equity. As most of you know, our long-term objectives continue to call for achieving at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE.","Regarding the balance sheet, I believe we\u2019ve a solid financial base to support the growth of our business. Total debt as a percent of stockholders equity declined to 35% at April 30th from 37% a year-ago. Our single largest asset on the balance sheet was inventories, which totaled $2.4 billion at April 30th. That represented a 6% increase over April of 2013 to support anticipated sales growth, but also is indicative of our objective to keep inventory growth less than the rate of sales growth. Of course that objective includes maintaining high levels of inventory availability for our stores while managing them as productively as possible.","Our accounts receivable was 7% above last year due to worldwide sales growth and receivable turnover is a healthy 21 times per year. Capital expenditures were $35 million in the first quarter unchanged from last year\u2019s first quarter.","As we previously disclosed, we\u2019re increasing full-year capital expenditures as a result of making greater information technology investments this year and next as we upgrade and introduce new systems for global customer relationship management and for more advanced order and inventory management capabilities.","As announced in March, Tiffany Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock over a three-year period. We resumed repurchases in April and spent approximately $7 million to repurchase 82,000 shares at an average cost of approximately $87 per share. We believe this is a good way to return some excess capital to stockholders and mitigate dilution on earnings per share from stock-based compensation.","Now I want to take a moment to comment on our full-year earnings outlook. We began the year projecting net earnings in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 per share or 9% to 11% higher than the $3.73 per share that was earned in 2013.","Clearly we\u2019ve had a strong start to the year, but it\u2019s only challenging to determine how much of those gains can be extrapolated for the rest of the year, especially considering that the first quarter is historically the smallest one of the year. In terms of the components of our forecast, we\u2019re continuing to project high single-digit percentage sales increase with all regions expected to achieve total sales growth in U.S. dollars and varying degrees of comparable store sales growth on a constant-exchange-rate basis.","And I already mentioned that we\u2019re expecting improvements in gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio for the year. As a result, we\u2019re increasing our full-year EPS forecast by $0.10 per share to $4.15 to $4.25 per share, representing 11% to 14% growth from last year\u2019s $3.73 per share. This reflects our strong start.","However, it is early in the year; there is uncertainty about when sales growth will resume in Japan and\/or economic headwinds in Europe. In fact, those two factors that especially in Japan as well as higher marketing spending as we mentioned will likely result in the second quarter\u2019s net earnings to be about equal to the prior-year.","In summary, we hope you\u2019re all in agreement that these results in most respects were a very nice start to the year. We believe we\u2019re well positioned for the rest of 2014 and beyond. And beyond the key benefits derived from heritage and brand strength, Tiffany has an experienced management team a solid base of store distribution with growth potential and extraordinary product assortment and a highly developed infrastructure and product supply chain. I\u2019m delighted to be part of Tiffany\u2019s management team and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and months.","I'll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Ralph.

(NYSE:TIF) Q3 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call November 24, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Ralph Nicoletti - EVP and Chief Financial Officer","Mark Aaron - VP, Investor Relations","Analysts","Operator","Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Tiffany & Company\u2019s Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Hello everyone. By now, I hope you\u2019d seen the news release we issued earlier today announcing our third quarter results. On today\u2019s call, Ralph and I will review the quarterly results and how they are tied to our growth strategies, and then we\u2019ll address the outlook for the rest of the year.","Please note before continuing the statements made on this call that are not historical facts or forward-looking statements actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Okay, in general the third quarter results were mixed. Sales and margins continued to be negatively affected by the strong U.S. dollar and net earnings came in several cents lower than we expected. However, worldwide net sales increased 4% on a constant exchange rate basis despite greater than expected softness in the Americas, reflecting strong growth in Japan and modest growth in Europe and the Asia Pacific regions.","Worldwide net sales declined 2% when reported in dollars on a GAAP basis. In addition to the strong dollars effect on translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars, we continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S. that was only partly offset by higher foreign tourist spending in other regions.","In addition, we took a price increase in the quarter which moved us closer to restoring our global pricing structure to normal levels given the dollar\u2019s continued strength. Gross margin rose in the quarter and SG&A expense growth was modest. Adding it all up EPS of $0.70 was down 8% from non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 last year which had excluded a charge for debt extinguishment.","In other highlights we introduced new designs in several existing jewelry collections in a range of materials and price points. We also made good progress with our long term strategy to optimize our store base with openings, renovations, relocations and closings and in light of recent stock price weakness purchases under our stock repurchase plan were increased allowing us to use our strong cash position to return value to shareholders.","So let\u2019s now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 5% and comparable store sales were down 6% on top of 11% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. In the quarter we once again saw a substantial decline in sales to foreign tourists in varying degrees by nationality with pronounced weakness in New York area as well as in other tourist related markets on the East and West coast of the U.S. and in Hawaii.","Sales to domestic customers were roughly flat from last year, which we can partly attribute to difficult year-over-year comparisons, but also perhaps to continued softness in broader consumer spending trends. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that we are in the process of some major U.S. store renovations having just completed a magnificent upgrade of our important store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and now focused on major renovations of our stores on Union Square and San Francisco and on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.","In contrast to the disappointing sales results in the U.S. we continued to generate solid comp store sales growth in Canada and Latin America in the quarter. We entered the new market of Chile when we opened the store in Santiago in September, and just earlier this month we relocated our Mexico City store within the El Palacio de Hierro Polanco, which is the largest luxury department store in Latin America.","In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 7%. Despite strong sales of statement jewelry there were varying degrees of softness across most other jewelry categories in stark contrast to last year\u2019s strong third quarter.","Let\u2019s now turn to results of the Asia Pacific region where on a constant exchange rates basis sales increased 6% in total, and comp store sales rose 2% in contrast to a 3% comp decline in last year\u2019s third quarter. Overall, results in the third quarter reflected healthy sales growth in China and Australia, mixed results in other countries and continued pronounced weakness in Macau and Hong Kong.","During the quarter, we expanded our store base in Asia Pacific by opening our fourth store in Macau in the Studio City Hotel and Resort. Earlier this month, we opened two stores, one in China in Beijing SKP which was formerly known as the Shin Kong place which is a major shopping center in China and the other in Korea in the newly built Pangyo Hyundai Department Store.","With China in the news so much regarding their economy stock market and currency, we are pleased and encouraged that our total sales in China increased by a healthy amount in the third quarter despite volatility and sensitivity to headline macro events. It\u2019s also important to note that we continued to benefit from spending by Chinese tourists as they travel to other regions. So to reiterate what we had consistently said, Tiffany remains focused on the long term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers, both locally and globally and we have not in any way altered our strategies.","When measured in U.S. dollars, total Asia Pacific sales declined 2% in the quarter primarily reflecting the negative effect of currency translation. ","Japan in the third quarter once again posted strong sales growth in yen. Total sales rose 34% in yen driven by unit growth and increases in average price across all jewelry categories. A 24% comp increase in yen was on top of the 6% comp declines in last year\u2019s third quarter.","The vast majority of purchases in Japan are made by local customers and overall growth in the quarter was partly driven by higher local customer spending. Also contributing to the sales growth were higher sales to foreign tourists\u2019 particularly Chinese visitors as I alluded to a moment ago, which maybe related to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen as well as the Chinese shifting some of their travel this year away from Hong Kong and Macau atleast for the moment.","And I should add that a portion of Japan\u2019s non-comp sales growth in the quarter was due to the timing of some wholesale sales. The yen remains substantially weaker than the dollar but that 34% total sales growth in the quarter in local currency was still a solid 17% when translated into U.S. dollars. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company operated locations but we are enhancing our store base by relocating two department store base locations this year.","Europe also continued to perform well in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis due to a combination of higher sales to foreign tourists and to local customers that was geographically broad based across Continental Europe and in the U.K.","On a constant exchange rate basis total sales increased 9% and comparable store sales rose 6% on top of the 2% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter, but most other categories were up as well in local currencies.","And during the quarter as part of our focus on optimizing the existing store base, we relocated and transitioned our one store within Harrods in London to become two separate boutiques, one within their fine jewelry hall and the other within their luxury jewelry hall.","Earlier this year we had also relocated our store within Selfridges to gain a stronger and expanded presence. And just earlier this month we were pleased to open our 40th store in Europe representing our third store in Spain and second in Madrid in the El Corte Ingl\u00e9s department store.","As we\u2019ve said throughout this year, both the euro and pounds weakness against the dollar have stimulated foreign tourist spending in Europe while perhaps also encouraging some Europeans to shop locally rather than abroad. However, when translated into U.S. dollars, total third quarter sales in Europe decreased 2% due to small variations among jewelry categories in unit volume and average price.","Lastly, other sales rose 8% in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales down 3%. This smallest of our segments includes comparable store sales in our one store in Russia which has been a strong performer since opening last year and our five stores in the United Arab Emirates. It also includes wholesale diamond sales which rose in the quarter as well as some third-party licensing revenue.","One element of our long-term strategy is to proactively engage customers in our stores through more consultative selling. As I'd mentioned, paralleling that is our strategy to optimize our store base through a combination of store openings, renovations, relocations and closings.","We are on-track to increase our company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year representing a 4% net increase in both our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage.","The longer-term expectation is to increase worldwide square footage closer to 2% a year. And of course, we compliment our store presence with regular enhancements to our website in order to reinforce brand and product awareness.","We're also pleased to see an increase in worldwide e-commerce sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the quarter. All of these initiatives in stores and online support our global strategy to further enhance customers relationship and experiences with Tiffany.","In terms of a few merchandizing highlights as measured in dollars, category trends were pretty similar to recent quarters. While there was some continued softness in the fine jewelry part of our statement, fine and solitaire category we again experienced considerable growth in high-end statement jewelry through our VIP customer events. The engagement jewelry category performed well in Japan and Europe, but continued to post soft results on a worldwide basis. The fashion jewelry category continued to have strong growth in gold jewelry reflecting the success of the Tiffany T collection, although it\u2019s worth noting that the year-over-year comparison was negatively effected by strong launch sales in last year's third quarter.","While our strategy for product innovation include the periodic introduction of entirely new design collection such as Tiffany T we are equally focused on expanding refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections in the interim years.","For example, in order to improve our performance in silver jewelry sales at price points below $500, we recently introduced new designs in our popular Return to Tiffany collection with more to come next year.","We've seen good initial results, but think we'll be better able to evaluate our success in the silver jewelry category after the holiday season. In other initiatives Tiffany's Infinity jewelry collection which incorporates the design, symbolic of continuous connection, energy and vitality has been expanded in both silver and gold.","At higher price points we've expanded the beautiful Victoria collection with new designs in platinum and diamonds and the elegant Tiffany Bow collection with designs in gold and diamonds.","All these collections are being supported with broad print and digital advertising and we've been pleased with initial customer reaction. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with initial sales of our new CT60 and East West collection of watches that were launched earlier this year. And we've just added some stunning new jewelry watches to the assortment.","As we previously said, we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen awareness of not only the product, but also our brand credibility and heritage. So that's covers a sales highlight showing the wide range of performance and progress by region and product category.","I'm now please to turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark, for that overview. Before I review the rest of the results, I'd like to summarize some of the highlights regarding the third quarter. Once again the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively effect the translation of our results transacted outside the U.S. with a 6% negative effect on worldwide sales and it adversely affected tourist spending in the U.S.","The operating margin, while benefiting from a high gross margin continues to experience a lack of SG&A expense leverage. Earnings per share were down 8% from last year's adjusted EPS and were below our expectation that called for no earnings growth in the quarter.","We lowered our full year expectation for net earnings, although we significantly increased our free cash flow projection based on effective inventory management. Lastly, in light of recent stock price weakness purchases made under our stock repurchase program were increased using our strong cash position to return value to shareholders.","Now let's look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 60.2% in the third quarter was 70 basis points higher than last year, partly reflecting the favorable effect of product input costs, but also some negative effect from shifts in product mix especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high price point statement jewelry sales, which were strong with relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak.","An increase in the wholesale sales of diamonds also had some negative effect on gross margins. In addition, we took some price increases of varying degrees in all regions during the third quarter, partly necessitated by the strong U.S. dollar moving us closer but not completely to restoring our worldwide pricing structure to normal levels.","For the full year we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margins. And as we mentioned three months ago on our last call, gross margins should also benefit further from this year's declining precious metal and diamond cost, but that benefit will take some time to be reflected in gross margins based on the rate of inventory turnover.","Selling, general and administrative expenses rose only 1% in the quarter, benefiting from the translation effect of a strong dollar and lower variable labor cost that largely offset investments in stores and higher pension costs. SG&A expense growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar.","In addition as previously communicated, we had expected that year-over-year growth in marketing would moderate due to heavy spending in last year's second half and that's what happened.","Interest and other expenses net in the quarter came in about equal to last year. Interest expense itself continued to be lower than the prior year due to our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in October of 2014.","However, we also recorded some foreign currency transaction losses in third quarter. We continue to project interest in other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. The third quarter's effective tax rate of 35.5% was in line with last year's third quarter and we continue to forecast the full year effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%.","In terms of our balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $725 million, while short-term and long-term debt of just over $1 billion represented 38% of stockholder's equity.","An important part of our financial strategy is to maintain adequate liquidity to invest in growing our business regardless of short term economic cyclicality. At the same time, we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return cash to shareholders in dividend growth and share repurchases.","During the second quarter, we had increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, which represented the 14th dividend increased in the past 13 years. During the quarter in light of share price weakness purchases under our stock repurchase program accelerated as we spend approximately $60 million to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $80 per share.","We expect $116 million for share repurchases in this year to-date. And at October 31st we had approximately $157 million available for repurchases under our current authorization that run through March of 2017.","Another one of our financial goals is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores, as well as in our overall supply chain, while also maintaining deep assortments and high availability in our stores.","I'm pleased that our October 31, net inventories were 8% below last year, excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, inventory still decline by 4% compared with the 4% year to-date increased in worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis.","Rounding out our cash flow, capital expenditures were $159 million in the year to-date versus $153 million a year ago. We continue to forecast about $260 million for the full year with the focus on stores and new IT systems being implemented over several years including for global customer relationship management and inventory management.","In terms of our financial forecast we believe this third quarter results combined with volatile external conditions and negative effects from strong U.S. dollar justify a downward adjustment to our earnings expectation.","Our Company is well-positioned for the holiday season with a strong product offering and the holiday advertising campaign that touches on many categories. However, the macro environment in the near term remains uncertain in the Americas and elsewhere.","Therefore, we now believe its prudent to forecast full year EPS, 5% to 10% lower than the $4.20 per share last year excluding charges for debt extinguishment last year and loan impairment in the second quarter of this year.","However, from a cash flow perspective we are pleased with our progress and managing inventories more efficiently and we are significantly increasing our free cash flow objective by $100 million to now forecast in excess of $500 million for the full year.","In summary, despite a number of challenges that have effected our financial results this year, we are progressing in a number of areas that are all intended to strengthen Tiffany's positioning among the world's most important luxury brand, while also enhancing profitability and productivity.","I'll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Ralph. We hope our review of third quarter results has been helpful, and of course please call me with any questions.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call August 27, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark Aaron - VP of IR","Ralph Nicoletti - EVP and CFO","Analysts","","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to the Tiffany & Company Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you and hello everyone. We reported earlier today that Tiffany achieved better than expected financial results in the second quarter and I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to read the news release. On today\u2019s call, Ralph and I will review highlights of those results and comment on the full year outlook.","As always, please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now let\u2019s look at results. As an overview, Tiffany performed well in the second quarter with sales in most regions generally either met or exceeded our expectations. Three months ago, we had forecasted second quarter net earnings could be approximately equal to the prior year, reflecting a substantial softening in demand in Japan sale which for the second quarter occurred as expected. As well as continued softness in Europe, which, in fact, softened more than we expected in the quarter.","But as a result of solid growth in the America and Asia Pacific regions, worldwide net sales rose 7%. Embedded in the overall results was broad-based growth in most product categories and especially at mid-to-higher price points. Beyond the sales strength and important contributor to net earnings growth was an increase in gross margin which Ralph will address shortly.","SG&A expenses paced a bit favorably to our expectation while interest and other expenses net and the effective tax rate were essentially on track. Adding it all up, Tiffany second quarter net earnings rose 16%. Tiffany\u2019s balance sheet remains strong and it made the Board of Directors increase the quarterly dividend rate by 12%.","Let\u2019s now look at some details of regional sales performance in the quarter. In the Americas, total sales were up 9% primarily due to an overall increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. We were pleased to experience healthy unit growth in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category as well as in our engagement jewelry and wedding band category. And we\u2019re pleased that fashion jewelry unit sales are benefiting from strength in gold jewelry.","However, continued softness in silver jewelry unit sale in particular entry level sales under $500 was the reason why we had no growth in total jewelry units in the Americas. We\u2019ve now seen three consecutive quarters of sales improvement in the Americas which we believe reflect both internal and external factors. Here\u2019s the excitement of new products and compelling marketing, but we believe we are also benefiting in the Americas from new in-store selling initiatives focused on better engaging and consulting with our customers as well as enhancements in the visual merchandizing formats in our stores with those programs being extended throughout the store network.","In addition, we benefited from foreign tourist spending that is likely tied to growing brand awareness globally and perhaps some currency fluctuation too. And of course, conditions in the U.S. are favorable for many of our customers. On a constant and exchange rate basis comparable store sales rose 8% in the quarter which followed an 8% comp increase in the first quarter and compared with the flat comp in last year\u2019s second quarter. Geographically, most markets in the U.S. posted healthy sales growth. A solid increase in New York flagship store sales was due to a combination of higher domestic customer demand as well as higher sales to foreign tourist especially from China and Europe. And sales have rebounded nicely in the tourist markets of Hawaii and Guam. ","During the quarter we opened a 4800 square foot store in the Aventura Mall near Miami, marking our 94th store in the U.S. Our expansion plans for later in the year include opening stores in the Miami design district and on Boston\u2019s elegant Newbury Street. Outside the U.S., we experienced high single-digit to low double-digit local currency total sales growth with our growing presence in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The Asia Pacific region achieved a 14% total sales increase in the quarter due to growth in the average price per jewelry unit sold and in jewelry unit volume.","On a constant-exchange-rate basis increases of 13% in total sales and 7% in comp store sales reflected strength primarily in greater China and in Australia. You should note that the 7% comp increase followed a 10% increase in the first quarter and was on top of a 13% increase in last year\u2019s second quarter. We didn\u2019t open any stores in this region during the quarter but are on track to open two stores later in the year; one in Adelaide, Australia and one in China as well as relocating our store within the Hong Kong airport. Two additional stores in China and one in Thailand that were initially scheduled to open near the end of this year are now slated to open in the first half of 2015 due to timing delays.","Now let\u2019s turn to Japan where sales have been volatile to say the least in the first half of this year. As I alluded to in the overview after experiencing a surge in spending in the first quarter as Japanese consumers purchased in advance of a consumption tax increase on April 1. We anticipated a significant demand to offset in the second quarter, which occurred as we expected. The good news is that following a substantial sales decline in April, we saw a decelerating rate of sales decline in each months of the second quarter. However, the return to monthly sales growth is taking longer than we expected. Department stores in Japan have reported that they have also been experiencing sequentially smaller rates of sales declines in jewelry sales in the past several months.","Reflecting the volatility in Japan, total sales declined 13% in the second quarter due to lower unit volume in all jewelry categories. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 10% and comp store sales declined 13%. However, keep in mind that the 13% comp decline followed a 30% increase in the first quarter and was on top of an 8% comp increase in last year\u2019s second quarter. We do expect to return to single digit sales growth in Japan but have not yet done so in the first few weeks of August. We did not add any new locations in Japan during the quarter but we do plan to open a freestanding store in Shinjuku later this year.","Total sales in Europe increased 8% in the second quarter but the sales growth largely reflected the translation benefits from the stronger pound and euro versus the dollar. Looking at results on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were up just 1% with higher jewelry unit volume offsetting lower average price and comp store sales declined 8%. This was a further slowdown from the 3% comp decline we had in the first quarter but was on top of the 7% comp increase in last year\u2019s second quarter.","In terms of market performance across Europe, most countries posted weak sales results. Although the UK\u2019s decline was greater than that of Continental Europe reflecting to some degree a decline in tourists spending in London. We think the weakness in the UK and to some degree on the Continent too might be resulting from the strength of the pound and euro which perhaps could also be enticing Europeans to shop in the U.S. and elsewhere. As most of you know a few months ago we expanded Tiffany\u2019s presence in Paris to a fourth location when we opened the major store on the Champs Elysees, which is serving fine visitors and local shoppers as well.","In fact and not too surprisingly that store is quickly becoming one of our highest sales volume stores in Europe. All in all we believe Tiffany is still feeling the effects of both economic and currency related challenges in Europe although we are partially benefiting in the U.S. from European tourist spending. But longer term we are as excited as ever about Tiffany\u2019s expansion plans and growth potential in Europe.","Wrapping up the regional sales review as our other segment where the bulk of the 28% sales increase in the second quarter was from retail sales largely from the opening of our store in Moscow in February as well as from 2% comp store sales growth in our five stores in the UAE. In addition, there was an increase in wholesale sales of diamond acquired through our rough sourcing program and subsequently sold because they don\u2019t meet our requirements. Although, we had thought wholesale sales would have been higher in the quarter and therefore would have more negatively affected gross margin. Our websites around the world effectively complement our worldwide store base and e-commerce sales have been growing roughly in line with our overall worldwide sales. Of course beyond generating online sales, our website service powerful marketing vehicle to build brand and product awareness and drive store traffic.","To summarize various worldwide store expansion plans I mentioned in each region we are now expecting to open 10 stores in 2014 instead of the initial plan that called for 13 stores with the reduction due to the delays in opening two stores planned in China a store planned in Bangkok. Also we now plan to close three stores this year instead of our initial intention to close four because the store in Japan will be relocated within its host department store instead of being closed. In total, this represents a net 2% increase in company operated locations and a net 3% increase in gross square footage.","In addition to our strategy to gradually expand our company operated store base we are of course also renovating older stores with the objective to enhance visual merchandizing and the in store customer experience and to achieve the most effective space utilization.","So that wraps up the regional sales review. There are number of noteworthy highlights among our product categories with the key takeaway has been continued strength at mid-to-higher price points and healthy growth in both perennial classics and newer designs. Specifically, in the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, we enjoyed strong statement jewelry sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions resulting in part from customers who may have attended our successful Blue Book event in New York in April.","There was also healthy increase in fine jewelry sales in all regions, excluding Japan which of course had an exceptional first quarter increase. Fine jewelry highlights include the ongoing success of our Yellow Diamond collection, Elsa Peretti Diamonds by the Yard collection and our important Victoria collection. We\u2019ve spoken for some time now about the increasing popularity of colored diamonds and other gemstones and our design initiatives in recent years have addressed that growing interest.","In our fashion jewelry category, which primarily includes jewelry without gemstones, we\u2019re seeing particular strength in gold jewelry in a number of collections. Total silver jewelry sales were unchanged from the year ago as growth in higher-end silver pieces offset softness at entry level price point. The biggest story, as we noted since last fall, is the tremendous success of our Atlas jewelry collection introduce the best time and expanded with additional pieces in the spring.","And another popular collection demonstrating timelessness of design after many years in our assortment is our Return to Tiffany collection. Two very popular collections that span the fashion in fine jewelry categories at Tiffany Keys, which has been expanded with diamond accents and our Enchant collection which has been expanded into designs incorporating the RUBEDO metal. ","Lastly, the engagement jewelry and wedding band category was strong especially in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, led of course by our extraordinary Tiffany solitaire diamond ring and we\u2019re delighted with the growing popularity of our relatively new harmony engagement collection.","Looking forward, we are excited about the launch of our new Tiffany T jewelry collection. Tiffany T is being offered in a range of materials with the majority of styles in yellow, white or rose gold with and without diamonds as well as some pieces in sterling silver making the collection available in a wide range of prices from a few hundred dollars up to about $20,000. This collection have more than 50 styles was introduced last week in our U.S. Canadian and Latin American stores and will be available globally in September.","You may have seen new advertising, now appearing in magazines and on tiffany.com. That\u2019s just the start of the campaign and we intend to substantially step up ad spending in the third quarter to promote awareness of this dramatic new collection. ","Lastly, outside of jewelry, we\u2019re excited to be launching in the coming weeks a beautiful and elegant new collection of hand bags and small leather goods. The tightly focused assortment reflects a new modern aesthetic intended to attract and appeal the fashion-focused existing and new customers.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ralph to review the rest of the earnings statement, the balance sheet and our full year expectations. Ralph.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark. Clearly, we had a strong quarter reflecting solid execution of our strategies in a volatile global environment. The key takeaways driving results were broad base sales growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific more than offsetting the expected decline in Japan and softness in Europe.","Sales strength across all key product categories and price strata and highlighted by improving fashion jewelry sales, a meaningful increase in gross margin and strong operating earnings growth while increasing our marketing investment. Factoring in the results from the second quarter, tempered with a bit of caution because of Europe and Japan and a generally uncertain global environment, we are raising our full year earnings forecast by $0.05 per share, representing a portion of the second quarters better than expected net earnings.","Now I\u2019ll comment on the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin rose 2.4 points to 59.9% in the second quarter, largely due to favorable product costs and price increases taken across all product categories and regions. And to a lesser extent some sales leverage on fixed costs. Additionally, we are pleased to see fashion jewelry sales grow in line with total company sales which contributed to the margin exceeding our expectations. Gross margin also benefited versus our forecast from a lower than expected level of wholesale sales of diamonds.","We saw a 9% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter primarily reflecting higher fixed and variable labor and store-related cost. In addition, marketing spending rose in the quarter and we expect the year-over-year growth to accelerate further in the second half of the year, but especially in the third quarter tied to the launch of the Tiffany T collection. In fact, while marketing spending in the first half of the year was about unchanged from the prior year, we are planning for to increase year-over-year by a double digit percentage in the second half. ","While SG&A expenses rose a bit more than sales growth in the second quarter, we continue to expect that that rate of SG&A expense growth will be less than sales growth for the full year.","As a result of the increases in sales and gross margin operating earnings increased 18% in the quarter while the operating margin rose to 21% from 19% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Interest and other expenses net of $16 million in the quarter were about a $1 million above last year and the effective income tax rate of 35.5% in the quarter was 1.3 points above last year but that was largely due to a one-time effect of a change in certain state tax legislation.","Adding it all up, net earnings in the second quarter increased 16% to $124 million or $0.96 per share. Tiffany\u2019s strong balance sheet gives us a solid foundation to support our current business and planned growth. At the end of the second quarter we had $398 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $490 million a year ago and our debt leverage remains essentially unchanged. Inventories of $2.5 billion at July 31 were up 9% from a year ago, partly to support overall anticipated sales growth but with disproportionate increases in raw materials and work in process inventories partly to support the launch of the Tiffany T collection. ","Our full year and longer term objective continues to call for maintaining inventory growth less than the rate of sales growth. ","Capital expenditures of $91 million in the first half were up just slightly from last year\u2019s first half. For the full year, we continue to forecast CapEx at $270 million versus the $220 million last year reflecting incremental investments in information technology including the global customer relationship management system and more advanced order and inventory management capabilities.","In terms of share repurchases during the quarter, we spent approximately $9 million to repurchase 102,000 shares at an average cost of approximately $91 a share. There was $284 million available for future repurchases under a $300 million three-year program that was authorized by Tiffany\u2019s Board of Directors in March. ","As Mark mentioned, Tiffany\u2019s Board increased the quarterly dividend rate by 12% in the second quarter reflecting our longer term objective to grow dividends roughly in line with earnings growth and thus maintaining the current payout ratio.","Let\u2019s now look at our outlook for the full year. We began 2014 projecting net earnings in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 per share or 9% to 11% higher than the adjusted $3.73 per share that was earned in 2013. When we reported strong first quarter results, we increased the forecasted range by $0.10 per share. ","Now, based on performance in the second quarter but tempered by macro uncertainties and specifically the continued softness in Europe and the lingering sales declines in Japan, we are raising our forecasted range by $0.05 to $4.20 to $4.30 per share which will represent full year EPS growth of 13% to 15%.","That full year forecast continues to call for a high single digit percentage increase in worldwide net sales in dollars and we expect a healthy increase in the operating margin for the full year coming from a higher gross margin but factoring in gross margin in the second half being up less than in the first half. And we expect some improvement in the SG&A expense ratio for the year despite the considerably higher marketing spending.","Summing up, Tiffany\u2019s performance in the first half of the year was quite good in most respects although a bit more volatile than we expected. With our growing store base, compelling product designs and new advertising, we believe we are nicely positioned for a successful second half of the year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks Ralph.

Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations","Patrick F. McGuiness - Chief Financial officer and Senior Vice President","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","Participating on today's call are Mr. Pat McGuiness, Tiffany's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark L. Aaron","Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's conference call. Pat and I will review first quarter results and also update you on our full year plans and outlook.","Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provisions that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now we can proceed with the review of Tiffany's performance. It's safe to say that we are pleased to begin the year with better-than-expected sales and earnings. Sales growth of 9% in dollars or 13% on a constant-exchange-rate basis was driven by solid performance in Japan, Asia-Pacific and Europe, but sales in the Americas were somewhat softer than we expected. Gross margin, although below last year due to product sales mix, continued to benefit from diminishing product cost pressures, as well as price increases that we implemented during the quarter across all regions and product categories.","SG&A expense growth was well contained in the quarter, and net earnings were up 3% on a GAAP basis. However, if you exclude expenses in the quarter tied to cost-reduction initiatives, a 10% increase in net earnings was quite a bit better than our initial expectations for decline of 15% to 20%. Please refer to our non-GAAP measures schedule in today's news release.","We're encouraged with the start of the year, but caution you to not draw overly optimistic conclusions from the first quarter, which generates a relatively small percentage of sales and earnings in comparison with annual results.","I'll now review sales by region. In our largest region, the Americas, total sales rose 6% in the quarter to $408 million, which was below our expectation. In fact, the 6% sales growth was entirely due to an increase in average price, while unit growth in the higher-priced statement and fine jewelry was offset by unit declines at more moderate price point categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales also rose 6% and comparable store sales rose 3%.","Sales growth in the New York flagship store was higher than the region's increase as it particularly benefited from large purchases tied to our Blue Book event in April, as well as from foreign tourism, which represents almost half of that store's sales. We are no longer quantifying specific sales performance for the New York store to be consistent with the way we report performance in our other regions and as it now represents only 8% of worldwide sales.","Elsewhere, there was mixed performance around the Americas region but pronounced softness in the Hawaii and Guam stores that reflected less Japanese tourist spending. But I'll address our business in Japan in a moment. Our sales in Canada rose in the quarter partly due to higher statement jewelry sales and partly due to the conversion of 4 locations in the second half of last year from independently operated to company-operated stores.","Latin American sales were roughly equal to the prior year, and we did not open any new stores in the first quarter and finished the quarter with 115 stores in the Americas. In addition, changes in e-commerce and catalog sales were not significant in the quarter, and as we have said repeatedly, those media are as much about the benefits derived from marketing as they are about generating sales.","Turning to the Asia-Pacific region. Total sales increased by better-than-expected 15% to $223 million due to increases in average price, as well as unit growth across all jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 14% and comp store sales rose 9%. We saw healthy sales growth across the region, but led by particular strength in Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore.","We opened a store in Xi'an, China in the quarter and closed 1 in Taichung, Taiwan, finishing the quarter operating 66 stores in that region. As we continue to expand Tiffany's store presence, especially in China, we're seeing the dual benefit of local sales demand as well as increased brand awareness, which generates spending by Chinese customers when they travel to other regions.","Without a doubt, Japan sales growth in the quarter exceeded expectations more than any other region. In local currency, total sales and comp store sales rose 20% and 21%, respectively, with considerable strength in engagement jewelry and other higher-price-point categories. This was better than we expected and reflected considerably stronger growth in the latter half of the quarter.","However, the yen was 18% weaker than the dollar in the quarter, therefore, in dollars, sales rose 2% to $145 million due to an increase in average price, while unit performance was varied, with solid increases in higher-priced jewelry categories. The yen is quoted this morning at JPY 102 to the $1. We initially planned it at JPY 93 to $1 for the year, but in light of the yen's recent movement, we have now factored in a weaker yen for the rest of the year into our earnings forecast.","It's worth noting that we took a price increase in Japan on April 10, which, beyond addressing product cost pressures, also included an adjustment for the yen's weakness. Based on the customary pre-announcement of a price increase in Japan, it spurred purchasing in advance of the increase. However, we did not experience the typical unexpected slowdown after that. So while we believe a portion of the first quarter sales growth certainly reflects the strength of our brand, we also attribute the unusual strength to recent reports of a surge in household spending in Japan, likely tied to the Japanese government's efforts to stimulate their economy. The store count remained at 55 in Japan at the end of the quarter.","Our stores in Europe also delivered solid results in the quarter, with total sales growing 6% to $93 million due to higher average price and unit growth across most jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 8% and comparable store sales rose 6%. We were pleased with sales growth across continental Europe, which more than offset some lingering softness in the U.K. Varying degrees of year-over-year performance in local demand is likely tied to economic conditions, but tourist sales have become an important factor, too, which we estimate account for more than 1\/4 of our European sales. We currently operate 34 stores in Europe.","Lastly, Tiffany's other sales tripled in the first quarter from a year ago. The magnitude of the increase largely reflects the change we made last July when we converted 5 existing Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi, from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations and began to record the retail sales of those stores. For the U.A.E. stores overall, we've increased inventory levels, improved assortments and expanded marketing activities, and we've renovated our major store in The Dubai Mall. We're pleased with initial results and believe there is substantial long-term growth potential for Tiffany in that important region.","We finished the quarter with 275 company-operated stores. Our plan is to open 16 stores this year and close 1 store each in Japan and Taiwan, resulting in a net addition of 14 locations. And we are renovating a number of existing locations as well. In the Americas, the 6 stores planned range from 3 in the U.S., including New Jersey's Garden State Plaza and Cleveland's Eaton Center, to a store in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada; our 10th store in Mexico in Villahermosa; and our fifth store in Brazil in Curitiba. And we are excited to be relocating our Bloor Street store in Toronto to a nearby location this fall.","Seven stores are currently planned to open in the Asia-Pacific region, including 4 in China, one of which opened in Xi'an in the first quarter and there were 3 additional ones, which will take us to 26 stores in China by year-end. We're also working toward finalizing leases for 3 additional stores in the region. Rounding out expansion this year are 3 stores that are planned in Europe, which will bring us to 37 European stores by year-end.","Looking at merchandising highlights in the quarter. We continue to see diverging demand among product categories by price point, with diamond jewelry clearly outperforming silver jewelry. As I alluded to earlier, we had strong growth in statement jewelry sales in the quarter, which was partly tied to the Blue Book event and our customers' response to a collection of extraordinary new jewelry pieces. At the other extreme, we continue to experience softness in silver jewelry sales, but new introductions and some greater marketing emphasis are intended to reinvigorate that category.","In other categories, we had a healthy increase in engagement jewelry sales and are very pleased with our new Harmony collection. Fine and fashion jewelry collections were led by the continued strength of our beautiful yellow diamond jewelry; the success of our relatively new Enchant diamond jewelry; Victoria; the perennial favorite, Tiffany Keys in diamonds and in gold; and Tiffany's Metro designs. We're also excited about the response to our growing assortment of colored diamonds. These trends will illustrate our brand strategy to move toward higher-price-point categories.","In terms of new products, we're enthusiastic about our prospects for the recently introduced Great Gatsby, Ziegfeld and Jazz collections that span a range of materials and prices. And we're looking forward to introducing our reinterpretation of our iconic Atlas collection later this year.","That concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call over to Pat.","Patrick F. McGuiness","Thanks, Mark. I will also begin my remarks by saying we were pleased with these first quarter results given the overall sales strength and the improving gross margin trends. That said, we are reluctant to extrapolate a continuation of such sales trends into the second quarter and the full year, especially in light of the underlying softness in the Americas. In addition, we have factored the impact of the further weakening of the yen into our earnings guidance.","Let's now look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 56.2% in the quarter was below last year's 57.3%, but better than we expected as higher-than-expected sales growth gave us added leverage on fixed costs. We have been experiencing a shift in sales mix toward higher-price-point products, consistent with our long-term brand strategy to achieve a lower gross margin, and we expect that to continue. However, as we anticipated, this year-over-year decline was narrower than we've seen in a while due to diminishing product cost pressure. And as Mark mentioned, we took a round of price increases during the first quarter after exhibiting pricing restraint in 2012, when we did not take any meaningful increases.","We are introducing new jewelry designs in sterling silver this year, with more next year, with the intent to stimulate that category. But we continue to anticipate that silver jewelry sales growth in 2013 will lag growth in higher-priced categories. As a result, gross margin in the full year will be slightly lower than last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% in the quarter. This included charges tied to cost-reduction efforts of $9 million or $0.05 per diluted share for recent staffing reductions and subleasing of certain office space. Excluding those costs, SG&A expenses increased 6% due to new-store-related costs and substantial marketing costs for our Blue Book event in New York.","Those of you in New York in mid-April may have seen the world's largest Tiffany Blue Box constructed over the skating rink in Rockefeller Center where we hosted a party for a select group of Tiffany's customers, media and celebrities. You can see some photos by visiting the press section of tiffany.com. We were very pleased with the number of significant sales generated from the event, but equally pleased with the overall customer enthusiasm and media attention.","In addition, reported SG&A expense growth would have been 2 percentage points higher if not for the favorable translation effect primarily from a weaker yen. Our full year plan continues to call for SG&A expense growth slightly less than the forecasted sales growth. Earnings from operations rose by 1%, but were up 12% when excluding the expenses tied to cost-reduction efforts.","Looking out to the full year, we continue to expect that operating earnings growth will be roughly in line with sales growth. Beyond 2013, there remains ample opportunity to improve the operating margin by leveraging stronger sales growth against a relatively fixed expense base. Other expenses net rose to $13 million in the quarter from $11 million last year, largely reflecting increased interest expense tied to incremental long-term debt that we took on last July. We expect other expenses to be about $58 million for the year.","Tiffany's effective tax rate of 34.9% in the quarter met our expectation and compared with 34.5% last year. We continue to estimate a 35% effective tax rate for the year. Adding it all up, net earnings rose 3%, but were 10% above last year when excluding the $9 million of expenses tied to cost-reduction efforts. We had expected a 15% to 20% earnings decline due to product cost pressure on gross margin and the substantial marketing cost of our Blue Book event. However, the higher-than-expected sales growth, that occurred actually in the latter part of the quarter after we provided our guidance on March 22, gave us greater sales leverage on fixed cost and accounted for the delta between our expected earnings decline and the earnings growth that we ultimately achieved.","We believe it is prudent at this time of the year to slightly reduce our sales expectations for the second, third and fourth quarters in light of our assumption for the softer sales growth in the Americas and our forecasting an even weaker yen than we had initially planned for Japan sales. Therefore, despite the better-than-expected first quarter results, we continue to expect a mid-single digit worldwide sales increase for the year, with earnings still in the range of $3.43 to $3.53 per diluted share versus last year's $3.25 per diluted share.","This forecast excludes the $0.05 per diluted share of expenses tied to the cost-reduction efforts that we recorded in the first quarter. And I should add that we expect net earnings in the second quarter to be about equal to the prior year based on an expected mid-single digit sales increase, with stronger earnings growth coming in the second half of the year.","Our return an average assets was 9% on a trailing basis and return on average stockholders' equity was 17%. Our longer-term financial objectives continue to call for achieving at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE.","Let's list some balance sheet highlights. Net inventories of $2.3 billion at April 30 were only 4% above last year. Finished goods inventory was up 12% due to new stores and new products, including the expansion of our statement jewelry assortments. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories declined 5%. We continue to project about a 5% increase in net inventories for the year. Accounts receivable at April 30 were equal to last year. Higher receivables tied to the sales growth was offset by a translation effect from the weaker Japanese yen. Receivables are turning at a rate of 21x per year.","Capital expenditures were $35 million in the first quarter versus $44 million last year, and we are continuing to project about $230 million of CapEx for the year versus $220 million last year. We are planning for positive free cash flow of approximately $300 million in 2013 versus $109 million in 2012. At April 30, we had $465 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $322 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $974 million on April 30, up from $834 million a year ago, largely due to adding $250 million of long-term debt in last year's second quarter. Total debt was 37% of stockholders' equity versus 35% a year ago.","We remain committed to returning excess cash to stockholders. In fact, 2 weeks ago, our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in the quarterly cash dividend rate going from $0.32 per share to a new rate of $0.34 per share and representing the 12th increase in the past 11 years. The new annualized rate of $1.36 would equate to a payout ratio on our current earnings forecast in the high-30s, and we will likely maintain a ratio in the 30s going forward. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. We have $164 million available for future purchases under the currently authorized program, which expires in January 2014.","To summarize, we are generally pleased with the start of 2013. We are introducing many exciting new product designs. We have a good lineup of new stores. Our marketing programs, including a newly designed website later in the year, are well suited to enhance customer awareness. Our infrastructure is effective in supporting our product supply needs, and we have the balance sheet to support our expansion. And most important, we are focused on maintaining and enhancing the renowned Tiffany & Co. brand around the world. I'll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark L. Aaron","Thanks, Pat.

Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Mr. Mark Erceg, Tiffany's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Good day, everyone. On today's call, Mark Erceg and I will comment on the second quarter financial results, growth strategies and the full year outlook.","Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances except as required by applicable law or regulation.","I believe we can now proceed. In broad terms, we achieved modest top line growth in the second quarter due to higher wholesale sales in the Asia Pacific region, increased wholesale sales of diamonds and solid growth in e-commerce sales. However, with the exception of Japan, our region did not achieve comp store sales growth and we will obviously not be satisfied until they are meaningfully in positive territory.","Having said that, the 3% worldwide net sales growth in the quarter, combined with a slightly higher operating margin, a reduction in other expenses and a lower tax rate, contributed to 9% net earnings growth that achieved our expectation.","In addition, we added net of two stores during the quarter, opening three and closing one. We moved forward with some exciting product initiatives, and of course, we announced the appointment of a new CEO.","In terms of regional performance, let's start with the Americas where total sales rose slightly in the quarter and comparable store sales declined slightly. We were pleased with the strong increase in e-commerce sales, which are not included in comps, and we were also pleased to see an increase in total jewelry unit volume propelled by increases in the fashion and designer jewelry categories even though there was a decline in average price tied to a shift in sales mix toward those categories.","Sales performance across the region was varied with no significant geographical deviations, but we've attributed the overall comp store sales weakness this year to lower foreign tourist spending. I should add that our New York flagship store has returned to a relatively normal flow of customer traffic following the disruption immediately after the 2016 election and was not a drag on overall sales in the quarter.","Rounding out the region, our sales in Canada were down just slightly while we experienced reasonably good growth in Latin America. During the quarter, we completed the renovation of our important store on Burrard Street in Vancouver, and we were pleased to relocate our store in the International Plaza in Tampa, Florida. ","And the fourth floor of our New York flagship store is currently closed and being renovated to house our exciting new luxury accessories collection in an enticing environment when it debuts this fall.","In the Asia Pacific region, a modest increase in total sales largely reflected higher wholesale sales and new store openings over the past year as well as higher jewelry units sold, primarily in the fashion and designer categories, though this increase in units was mostly offset by lower average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined in the quarter as strong sales growth in Mainland China was more than offset by softness in most other countries, which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending. ","We attribute the growth in Mainland China to local customer spending where we continue to build brand awareness. During the quarter, we opened two stores in the region, one in Korea in the Shinsegae Department Store, and one in Australia in Sydney's Westfield center, and we closed a store in Taiwan. ","In Japan, total sales and comps rose modestly on a GAAP basis and rose at a higher rate on a constant exchange rate basis. Total sales growth in the quarter was more than entirely due to the increase in comp store sales while wholesale sales declined in the quarter. There was an increase in jewelry units sold. We also attribute the sales growth to increased spending by local customers who represent the vast majority of our sales in Japan while spending attributed to foreign tourists was roughly unchanged. ","The bridal category represents almost 40% of our sales in Japan, and as we noted on last quarter's call, we expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to bridal sales, and customers' reactions to the heightened experience have been very favorable. We were pleased with improving sales results in Europe in the quarter, driven by wholesale sales and new stores. There was growth in jewelry units sold across all categories. Comps were positive in several Continental European countries.","However, total European comps were down slightly including modestly lower sales in the UK, which we attribute at least partly to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Keep in mind the spending that we attribute to foreign tourists in London had begun to accelerate near the end of the second quarter last year following the Brexit vote and the drop in the value of the pound. ","During the quarter, we were delighted to open another store in Italy, our third store in Milan and located at the Duomo. Rounding out the segments, the other segment posted a large increase in the quarter, but it entirely resulted from an increase in our wholesale sale of diamonds. Comp store sales declined for our stores in United Arab Emirates.","We remain determined to improve top line growth by pursuing several important strategies. One relates to an accelerated pace of product introductions in the future across all categories. Another is pursuing clienteling to more effectively engage with customers and deliver an enhanced Tiffany experience. We also believe that further optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and some select closings is important. ","And lastly, we are focused on enhancing brand awareness through impactful marketing communications. The ultimate objective is to accelerate sales growth through the frequency of customer visits and improvement in the conversion rate. Lastly, I mentioned higher e-commerce sales from the Americas and we're pleased that it occurred globally as well. We are continually making enhancements to our website that add additional interesting content, are visually appealing and that improve functionality. We continue to believe that our website serves a dual function by generating online sales and also effectively delivering our messaging. ","In terms of merchandising highlights, the second quarter reflected a continuation of the trends experienced in the first quarter. In essence, solid sales growth in both the fashion jewelry and designer jewelry categories contrasted with lower sales in both the engagement jewelry and the high fine and solitaire categories. ","Fashion jewelry primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry and there was growth across the category. From a collection perspective, we especially call out the initial success of the new Tiffany HardWear collection that we launched in April as well as relatively strong performance in our Tiffany T and 1837 collections.","We also saw broad-based growth in designer jewelry sales for both Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso. Elsa's legendary designs include our Open Heart and Diamonds by the Yard collections. Paloma's designs are also long-standing favorites and customers have recently been especially excited about Paloma's Melody, which is her new chic and modern collection in gold and silver.","As I mentioned, the high fine and solitaire jewelry category was again soft in the quarter with mixed results by collection. And the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category also underperformed again in the quarter. We're still in the early stages of growing our watch business and are progressing as we expand brand and product awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs. In fact, we plan to introduce a new women's watch collection later this year. ","So those are a few highlights of jewelry and watch performance in the quarter. In the coming months, we have many new jewelry designs and styles across all categories scheduled for introduction. We have also just recently begun the rollout of our new signature fragrance collection, and we look forward to the upcoming launch of our luxury accessories collection, which we believe will entice customers with both functional and whimsical designs. ","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg who is joining us from overseas. Mark, before commenting on the financials, are there any observations from your travels that you'd like to share?","Mark Erceg","Good morning, everyone, and yes. Thank you, Mark. I would like to say a few words, which are unrelated to our quarterly results, which I think might be instructive. Over these past months it has been my honor and privilege to spend time with many of Tiffany's passionate and dedicated employees as I seek to learn as much as possible about the business. ","Right now, I'm touring several of our major Asian markets and I must say I've been very impressed by our stores, our product offerings and the professionalism of our sales associates, there is energy which speaks to the tremendous growth opportunities Tiffany has in this vibrant and exciting part of the world.","In addition to visiting many of our retail locations, I spent considerable time in our diamond cutting and polishing facilities, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage, our jewelry manufacturing plants, and very recently, I have the good fortune to attend and participate in our two day retail diamond authority training program for sales professionals. ","These experiences have given me a deeper appreciation for the level of craftsmanship and care that goes into making a Tiffany quality diamond from our exceedingly stringent standards for color and clarity and our selection of rough stones to the cutting, polishing and setting of diamonds in our own facilities with our own highly skilled and caring craftspeople to the presentation of each diamond to our valued customers by our highly trained sales professionals in an iconic Tiffany Blue Box.","And now having seen and experienced all this firsthand, I have a great deal of pride as well as a deeply held belief in Tiffany's ability to delight customers all around the world for at least another 180 years.","So with that let\u2019s review our second quarter financial results. As Mark mentioned, worldwide net sales increased 3%, but comparable store sales declined slightly both on an as-reported and in constant currency. So clearly, we have more work to do in that regard. However, despite disappointing comp store sales numbers, diluted earnings per share growth was strong at 10%. ","We were pleased to see gross margin expand by 40 basis points in the quarter particularly in light of the increase we had in wholesale diamond sales, which, as we'd indicated in the past, is gross margin dilutive. Lower product input costs, primarily from lower diamond acquisition costs; modest first quarter price adjustments, which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis; and favorable product mix all contributed to the improvement in gross margins.","In addition, we continued to reengineer our global information system architecture and redesign our internal work processes in order to free up investment dollars. For example, we just implemented an automated transportation management system in the United States, which is reducing store-to-store freight transfer costs. So taking all these factors into account, we continue to believe there will be a modest year-over-year increase in gross margin for the full year. ","Importantly, while we're very committed to effective cost control, our top priority remains achieving a higher rate of sustainable sales growth. Consistent with this, we will continue to redeploy a significant portion of any savings generated back into the business. We were also pleased with SG&A expenses during the quarter, which as a percentage of sales were essentially flat versus year ago, coming in at 43.4% in the second quarter versus 43.2% a year ago. ","As previously discussed, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently by reducing costs where feasible while also reinvesting in the growth of our business. Thus, for the full year, we continue to assume SG&A expenses will increase at a slightly faster rate than sales growth as we invest behind our new signature women's fragrance, the launch of our new luxury accessories offerings and additional jewelry SKUs. Taken together, gross margin and SG&A expense allowed operating margin to expand 10 basis points in the second quarter. ","Net interest and other expenses were both lower in the second quarter as with our effective tax rate. That said, our second quarter effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter due to a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation, which we adopted in the first quarter. While this new accounting standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of the excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price, our outlook currently assumes a full year effective tax rate of approximately 33%.","In addition to posting strong growth in diluted earnings per share, we generated a significant amount of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our first half total to roughly $200 million. Inventory performance contributed to our robust cash flow with net inventory at July 31 coming in 4% below a year ago as we continue to optimize finished goods levels. However, due to the second half product introductions referenced earlier, we continue to plan for full year inventory to be flat versus prior year-end.","Accounts receivable were up just 3% from a year ago, in line with our reported sales growth. Capital expenditures in the first half have been modestly lower than last year due to timing differences, so we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. We invested $21 million to repurchase 230,000 shares of our common stock in the quarter, which was slightly higher than the previous quarter. ","As of July 31, 2017, we had $278 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. Adding it all up, our balance sheet is in very good regard, with over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments at July 31 and a reasonable ratio of total debt to stockholders' equity, which provides us with an opportunity to invest behind our strategic growth initiatives in order to achieve better top line growth while continuing to return excess cash to our shareholders. ","Since we already commented on share repurchase, let us quickly remind everyone that we recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11%, which was our 16th increase in the past 15 years. ","Finally, in terms of our outlook, results in the first and second quarter have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. We have a number of strategic initiatives in place related to new products, marketing campaigns and enhancing the in-store experience for customers, all of which we believe can contribute towards modest and gradual top line improvement as the year progresses. So while we have confidence in our growth plans, we remain mindful of an uncertain external environment.","So as a result, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by a high single-digit percentage over the prior year. On the bottom line, we continue to expect net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last years $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last years adjusted EPS of $3.75 per share. ","For the second half of the year, we expect an increase in net earnings per diluted share versus a year ago with all of the increase coming in fourth quarter. Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year. ","So in closing, we continue to believe strongly that executing our top line growth strategies in a disciplined way while simultaneously reengineering our global information system architecture and redesigning our internal work processes to free up investment dollars is the right path forward in order to delight our customers and create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead.","And we'll be looking forward to updating you on our progress during I'll now turn the call back over to Mark. ","Mark Aaron","Thanks Mark. That concludes this conference call. I look forward to speaking with many of you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; Mr. Mark Erceg, Tiffany\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. Earlier today, we issued Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results with the news release and the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K. I hope you've had a chance to review at least some of the results. ","Following some comments from Alessandro and Mark, we will be pleased take your questions. Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.","Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially as well as the required reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures referenced in this presentation to their comparable GAAP measures is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K filed earlier today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. Those filings can be found on Tiffany's website, https:\/\/investor.tiffany.com by selecting Financial Information.","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Alessandro.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thanks, Mark, and hello everyone. Mark Erceg and I will address these results in a broad sense and -- as they pertain to our key strategic priorities. And then we will allow plenty of time for your questions. The specific details of our financial results can be found in today's news release, and 10-K filing.","Broadly speaking, I'm pleased with Tiffany's annual results in 2018 and with what our global team accomplished. For the full year sales rose in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe, and increased in most product categories. And we were encouraged to experience higher sales attributed to local customers in the full year, even though sales attributed to foreign tourists were volatile. ","As you know our sales growth decelerated in the second half. We can talk about external factors that benefited us in the first half and then went against us in the second half. But I believe it is more productive to focus on the journey that we started exactly one year ago when we presented to you our six strategic priorities as well as our decision to increase investment spending in several areas to support sustainable long-term growth. And we made substantial progress in the past year and a lot is going to happen in 2019. ","Our strategy to amplify and evolve the brand message was highlighted with bold brand messaging in the Believe In Love, Believe In Dreams and holiday campaigns. These campaigns came as a pleasant surprise to our audience and signaled that something new and exciting was starting to happen at Tiffany. ","I believe that as a result, sales growth in 2018 came from our existing customer base, as well as from new customers and former customers who have not shopped at Tiffany in a number of years.","Then since January 2019, we have strengthened our message on diamonds, #tiffanydiamond that they campaign on social media. Our leading innovation of providing to customers the country or region of origin of our individually registered diamonds and the enormous visibility of the legendary 128 carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond with Lady Gaga at the Oscars are a synchronized assertion of the beauty, traceability and glamour of our superlative Tiffany diamonds. ","Another strategy is to renew our product offerings at a faster pace and in 2018 we unveiled the Paper Flowers jewelry line, introduced numerous extensions of existing collections, made a significant investment in high jewelry inventory to build a more powerful assortment in some of our key locations around the world, and we began to offer expensive jewelry customization through the Make It My Tiffany program. ","For holiday 2018, we launched in the U.S., a limited assortment of the Tiffany True collection. We are now excited to roll out the launch of the Tiffany True solitaire and boldly designed jewelry in all the regions and with increasing new styles throughout 2019. ","For our priority to deliver an exciting customer experience, in 2018, we expanded Tiffany store presence with the opening of 10 stores in high potential markets around the world, while relocating a number of existing stores and closing four stores, for a net increase of six stores. And of course we announced the bold initiative to transform our New York flagship store into an exciting 21st century retail experience by the end of 2021. ","In 2019, we will add some important openings in key cities. We just completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, a significant market for Tiffany. It's a beautiful store in Sydney at the corner of Pitt and King Street that has surprised customers, press and the entire industry for its stylish aesthetics, imposing size and refined experience.","In the next week, we will celebrate the grand opening of our newest location in the US. The first -- our first store in Washington DC, in CityCenterDC, a new luxury destination for local customers and tourists. We plan to announce other important new stores in key markets, such as in Greater China during the course of the year. ","In addition to opening new stores, we are also evolving our presentation within existing stores through our fresh and innovative global display announcement initiatives in North America, which we are now pleased to expand in 2019 to the rest of the world.","In terms of delivering a more exciting omni-channel experience, we are now upgrading our website globally, which provides a number of benefits to both the consumer experience and Tiffany's ability to innovate. We are offering a rich blended experience of content and commerce, elevating the brand, while reducing the friction in the user's journey as much as possible. The enhancements give Tiffany more agility in testing, personalizing and content optimization. ","For example, on our US website, we have just begun offering for sale, select, love and engagement diamond rings online. US client can now filter available inventory for purchase on tiffany.com in addition to consulting a diamond expert to find the perfect ring. ","In recent period, Tiffany has been accepting phone orders for diamond rings from customers solely beyond our store distribution. So we believe this is a natural and complementary expansion of our in-store experience for the love and engagement category.","And we look forward to a process of continuous improvement in our digital capabilities going forward. Including plans to introduce a company operated e-commerce enabled website in China later this year.","In summary, we are still in the early stages of the long and exciting journey that I referred to one year ago. The Tiffany brand is increasingly recognized in the size. Our talented organization is aligned with our strategic priorities, and is getting more proactive and agile every day. I believe that the long-term outlook is very promising. ","I will now turn the call over to Mark Erceg. ","Mark Erceg ","Thanks, Alex. From a financial perspective, fiscal 2018 results are consistent with what we hoped to achieve when just a little over one year ago we shared our six strategic priorities and declared that in order to properly fund those priorities fiscal 2018 would be an investment year. Since Alex has already commented on our sales performance, let me say just a few words about earnings from operations, diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. You will recall us stating that fiscal 2018 operating earnings were expected to be flat to slightly down in order to fund meaningful investments across a number of areas we felt were essential to support sustainable long-term mid-single-digit sales growth.","Consistent with that, earnings from operations came in at $790 million versus $809 million during fiscal 2017 a decline of approximately 2%. We also passed along significant benefits associated with US tax reform. Specifically, we started the year expecting an overall 2018 effective tax rate somewhere in the high 20s. And as more information became available and we completed our analysis, we ultimately ended the year just a fraction over 21%.","While our 2018 effective tax rate did include some one-time benefits, not directly associated with the lower US statutory tax rate, a lower effective tax rate was the primary driver that allowed us to finish the year with diluted net EPS at $4.75 per share which was towards the higher end of the last guidance range we provided of $4.65 to $4.80 per share and well above our initial fiscal 2018 guidance of being somewhere between $4.25 to $4.45 per share.","Finally, we started the year projecting approximately $380 million of free cash flow. And after revising our projections to account for higher inventory levels, including for high jewelry and increased cash payments for income taxes related to US tax reform, we ended the year at $250 million of free cash flow.","So in total and across our key financial performance indicators of sales growth, operating earnings, net earnings and free cash flow, I think it is fair to say we delivered what we set out to achieve.","From a balance sheet perspective, we finished the year with $855 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments versus roughly $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This means that after spending more than $400 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and after increasing our quarterly dividend rate by 10% which was the 17th increase in the past 16 years, our balance sheet remains a major source of strength and flexibility.","In terms of our outlook for 2019, we are maintaining the preliminary guidance we provided on January 18th when we reported holiday sales results, low-single-digit sales growth for the full year as reported and slightly higher on a constant exchange rate basis and a mid-single-digit increase in diluted EPS. ","It's worth noting that our forecast for mid-single-digit EPS growth and our expectation of modest operating margin expansion includes a number of unique factors. ","First, incremental SG&A expense related to the New York flagship store project, which was $0.07 per share in 2018 is expected to be $0.10 to $0.15 per share in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Second, our 2019 forecast accounts for the fact that we will no longer be able to recognize an $8 million a year deferred gain on previous sale leasebacks due to a new accounting standard. Finally, we expect an all-in effective income tax rate of approximately 23% in 2019, which is roughly 200 basis points higher than fiscal 2018. ","From a timing standpoint and consistent with January results, while we expect full year reported sales to grow by a low-single-digit percentage, we expect sales in the first half to be adversely affected by several factors, a meaningful FX headwind, lower foreign tourist spending and a difficult comparison to strong base period comps. In addition to these items, first half earnings will also be negatively affected by incremental strategic investment spending that began in the second quarter of 2018 and has not yet fully annualized. ","We anticipate that these pressures will lessen throughout the year. And as additional new products are introduced, our marketing message continues to resonate and our in-store experience becomes even stronger, we expect reported sales growth to strengthen and earnings growth to resume in the second half of the year. ","That wraps up my brief remarks. So I'll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Alessandro and Mark. Operator, we\u2019re ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Mark, could you speak to some of the puts and takes on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. I guess I'm looking at it on a multi-year basis just trying to see if I understand why the leverage slowed a bit and the comps got easier there. I mean help us with some of the puts and takes? And then I also was curious why the SG&A -- maybe a little help on why the SG&A growth rate slowed fairly significantly. I think when we talked previously you kind of said the big break point in that growth rate would be middle of this year to your comments about anniversarying some of the step up for the investments?","Mark Erceg","Yes, sure. I think on the gross margin point, I think the bigger story in 2018 is the fact that our gross margin was up 70 basis points for the full year. As far as what happens in any given quarter on gross margin, I don't think that's overly helpful to unpack. There's always mix effect, there's any number of things that can fall within that. And of course, our sales growth in the fourth quarter was lower than balance of the year. And so there's less fixed costs leverage even through the COGS line.","As far as SG&A is concerned, I think one of the things that we\u2019ve talked about a lot in the past is the need to ensure that our cost takeout programs are robust and strong. And that takes a little bit of time to gear up. So to the extent that SG&A growth in the fourth quarter was lower than you might have seen throughout the year, I think that's a positive indicator. And as we think about the guidance we provided for 2019, we're basically saying that we're going to get operating margin expansion on low-single-digit sales growth. So I think, again, our cost takeout programs continue to ramp up and I think you're seeing some of that in the fourth quarter at this point. ","Operator","And next we will hear from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","I am curious what you might be able to point to that makes feel confident that the amplification of the brand message is working and then you just hit a macro speed bump? Anything you could share with us that you're looking at, any data that you can provide? I am also curious, if you think about, what was the biggest disappointment to you this quarter relative to what you were thinking before it started, also curious if there are any positive surprises? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you Paul for your questions. Well about the messaging, it was a big change in 2018. And we are pleased to see that sales both to existing customers as well as new customers are increasing. And so, we are happy with it. And we have seen also in the last quarter even if it was softer. And I think results in terms of sales to existing customers, which is reassuring that the new message is not putting away customers from our brand, but on the contrary bringing them back. ","Now in terms of disappointment, well of course the last quarter, I think it was a mix of external factors, we have seen it also in general in the industry, especially in luxury, that the last quarter has not been as fantastic as the first part of the year, so Tiffany was affected by this. But on the other side, that were surely internal factors, because we are really at the first year of our transformative journey and we are working very hard on it but we are far from adding all the pieces of the puzzle put together. ","So, we are working on it going ahead, but we were not perfect. We have done a lot -- a lot of new things. Also things where we had made some mistakes and we are learning and we are addressing it. So I\u2019d say it's a mix of external but also reasonably expected internal factors.","Paul Lejuez","Alex anything you can share on those internal factors, what you would have done better?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, for example, I would have started holiday campaign three weeks earlier, to give an example. I mean many other detailed things that, it's -- the life -- the operational life of the company. And I think that this is all good experience because it was a year of innovation. And so, we are -- the most important thing for us is that we have a very good analysis of the set results of our fourth quarter and we have adjusted plans in order to keep on surprising customers when it comes to communication. So for example the communication that we have seen 2018, I think it was appropriate because it was communicating that something big and new was happening at Tiffany. Now don't expect the same communication in 2019 because we want to keep on surprising our customers. And this is one example among many others.","Operator","And now we will hear from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi, good morning. Alessandro, would love your thoughts on balancing innovation at lower price points versus higher price points and how that intersects with what you're thinking for the collections? And also the in-store experience, what are your hypotheses about what needs to happen just in order to make sure that you appeal the new generations or experiential and really leverage your human and digital talent? And Mark a modeling question, as we think about e-commerce over time, how did those margins compare and what are the key priorities in terms of blending the channels and managing inventory between e-com and thinking about a digital plus physical? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Oliver. Well, for your first question, this is a puzzle with many, many different things, because there is new communication, there is introduction of new products, there is all these efforts that we are making on the e-commerce to upgrade, elevate and innovate, et cetera, et cetera. So now all these things to be put together, will take time and we said that one year ago. But we decided not to close for three years to work on everything and then to have a big unveiling. We decided every day to do that and in different areas. For example, I would have loved to have the new website that we unveiled literally yesterday. I would have loved to have it in October or November in preparation of the holiday season. But it is time to do things. So it's really a matter of: one, that we are adding in the entire company in order to improve, innovate, be faster, be more distinctive, be more innovative. And both these things, we will see the benefits, the more we go along the way, when all this on this part come together.","Mark Erceg","Relative to the balance of your questions, I think we could offer that -- our e-com business this past year grew at roughly twice the rate of our overall business. And we would expect that trend to continue at least for the next several years. As far as the profitability, as you could imagine, the cost of running an e-com portal is less than that of running a brick and mortar operation. And if you look at the products that we tend to sell on e-com, they tend to be lower priced items, more silver items that have higher margins associated with them, you're not going to sell a whole lot of high jewelry pieces off your website. ","So I think it's fair to say that e-com is more profitable than brick and mortar. But again, we don't necessarily look at it that way. We're running a business, we want to serve our customers, however they choose to shop, which kind of gets to your question on inventory as well. What we're driving towards is a seamless inventory model whereby we can get the product to our customers in any market at any time, any way that they would choose to receive it. And we just talked about the new digital platform that we\u2019ve put up across our e-com site. But Alex also alluded to the fact that we're going to extending up our China e-com website later this year, which we're excited about and we've talked in the past about the need to put in the right structure, inventory management systems, order management systems, distribution systems, in order to enable that. And clearly that's what we've been doing.","Oliver Chen","Okay, Mark and just a last question on inventory. As we model that ahead, how would you expect that to trend relative to sales? And Mark on the information system side, customer relationship management was a theme and opportunity. If you could just highlight, what's ahead in your roadmap with the information system innovation? That'd be great. Thank you.","Mark Erceg","I think as it relates to inventory, I guess all I would say at this point is we said it very clearly that our goal is to grow inventory at a rate below that of sales. In this past year, we made a deliberate choice to invest more in our high jewelry offering, which we've seen work and work well for us. And then beyond that, the systems as I discussed will be allowing us to manage the entirety of our network better and more efficiently. ","Mark Aaron","If I could just ask, going forward, please indulge us and try to limit yourself to a single part question. We have a lot of people in the queue that we'd like to get to. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","And next week we'll hear from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","With regard to question -- I\u2019ll -- to even Mark\u2019s request, I will shift two questions in one. But first off, just to go back on someone earlier asked about gross margin and Mark, I understand, there's a lot of moving pieces in your gross margin. But the trajectory and year-on-year change has moderated meaningfully since over this year. So as we look -- if you could help us understand better, maybe the puts and takes that did happen in Q4. And how should we be thinking about gross margins as we move into 2019? And then the second question I have is on the sales side, now understanding January is not necessarily representative month, but some of the macro pressures have likely impacted Tiffany, around the holidays, did begin to or should have abated through the month of January. So the question is, did we see any type of underlying strengthen in the business that may not have been reflective in the final Q4 results that you reported today?","Mark Erceg","Got it. Well, with respect to gross margin, I think we talked about it a number of times. Over the last five, six years, there's been a very, very favorable commodity cycle that has allowed us to rapidly expand gross margins. We've talked about the fact that those commodity inputs had been flattening out, and that we expect those frankly going forward to continue to moderate and therefore we're going to have to drive gross margin through a combination of our cost takeout to our jewelry design and innovation workshop, our rapid costing tools. Obviously, when we introduce new products, we typically try and engineer and price those in a way that there are accretive to margin as well. We talked about in the past us having pricing power. We continue to believe we have pricing power, and we plan to be taking modest pricing in the current fiscal year. So we have laid out a long-term algorithm that we believe will allow us to grow our sales mid-single-digit and our EPS high-single-digits, and some form of gross margin expansion is obviously part of that algorithm going forward.","Brian Nagel","Thank you. And then with regard to the sales?","Alessandro Bogliolo","You mean sales -- what about it? ","Brian Nagel","Sorry. So in January, I guess I'm making an assumption, some of the macro pressures that the broader prices that impacted Tiffany through the holiday might have abated. I mean did you see that, I mean specifically the market -- the financial markets are less volatile, the government shutdown\u2026?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well actually the time we saw in the sales in January is by enlarge similar to the one that we saw in during the holiday and the two months that we reported. Of course there was a little bit of an uptick in China because of the Chinese New Year but this is the normal course of business. So I would say nothing different than what we have reported for holiday.","Operator","And next we will hear from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. Maybe just to elaborate on your view that the turnaround is in early stages today and as we dig into the six strategic priorities, help us to think about the timeline and P&L performance that we should expect to see from each of the strategies?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, it's -- our strategic priorities basically encompass the entire -- our entire business. So, communication has been the first one. We have been active there last year and we will continue with different approach this year. What you will see more busier, more intense is the launch of the new products with the beginning now of Tiffany True engagement ring and jewelry, but then other innovations, new launches during the year. And so towards the end of the year, we are working in order to add critical months for the holiday. ","You\u2019ll start seeing the work on the network, like I referred this year we have several important stores that are opening, that of course are the result of the last one and half year of negotiation, innovations et cetera. And this is why I mentioned in my remarks, Sydney, Washington DC, and there is important more to come. And I think it's important also to remark the work that we have started doing since the beginning on efficiency that it didn't show for several quarters, because as you know, efficiencies take a lot to be achieved, that you\u2019ve started seeing a sign of that in the fourth quarter. And this is something we committed to.","So a lot of things going on. Honestly, how much have we achieved? Well, I think we are probably at -- we are for sure at the beginning of our plan. We are probably in the first term of our plan and there is a critical mass that will be reached going forward. So we are very excited for all the things we are doing. We are confident and we are fighting for it.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Q - Kimberly Greenberger","I just wanted to follow-up on Matt's question about the sequencing of the impact of your strategic priorities. And Alessandro, I'm wondering, if there is, this sort of ideal time in the future, when you think that product innovation, your message evolution, your cost efficiency program, basically the aggregate of your six strategic priorities, is there a year where you believe that the sort of vast majority of these strategies will be fully implemented in impacting your financial results that we could say \u201cAll right, this is a journey. It's a three-year journey, it's a five-year journey, it's a two-year journey.\u201d How do you think about the ultimate end goal? And of course, I'm sure there will be evolutions of the strategies over time. But just help us understand how long does it take for all of the strategies to culminate and really work their way fully through your business?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, for the security of my job, and one of my colleagues, I hope that this journey will never finish, because we will keep on innovating for the next 182 years. But to answer to your question about this specific strategic plan we have put in place, I mean it's hard to say, which is exactly the date when everything will be done and completed and especially productive. But I mean, it's quite typical that I mean a project like this has a three year horizon. So we started it exactly one year ago. And I would say 2021 is when we should really get the most of it. But for me I mean it\u2019s not a matter of -- and I have been very clear about this, and this is why we started I mean increase investment spending last year, it\u2019s not that we do all this work and then we have a big unveiling. We will do this for flagship store but not for our day-today business, where every day we want to improve and even if the benefit of it is not fully ripe. So short answer to your question, I would say 2021. ","Operator","And next we will here from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. As you think about foreign tourism, how are you planning that going forward, how are you planning at this year? And then if you think about jewelry collections, engagement and designer jewelry, pace of newness for 2019, any new collections that we should be looking forward to? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Dana. Well tourism has been the more volatile and the more difficult part of our business, we have been affected by negative trend in tourism sales, notably to Chinese tourists, but in general, for example, very stronger US dollar towards the end of the year didn't help not only with Chinese but also with the South American tourists and others. That is definitely an area of concern that affects our results. But what we are doing is to keep on working and investing on domestic customers. And we have seen sales to domestic customers across geographies growing nicely, very strongly in China, let so in the US but still positive and growing and we believe that\u2019s the best way to build our tourist business strong with domestic customers when they are at home.","And your second question? ","Dana Telsey","Jewelry collections engagement and designer jewelry \u2026? ","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. We will have important newness, that doesn't mean entirely totally different design, but definitely very distinctive newness in love and engagement. And it's already started with the launch of Tiffany T True and that is both -- is very innovative, because it\u2019s an engagement ring with a new setting with T. But it's also a set of very boldly designed jewelry that now we launched already wedding event that goes with it, but there is much more coming in the rest of the year. So this is for the engagement area. I will say the answer is Tiffany T True. Then several important innovations and collections, by collections we mean existing collections in gold and platinum with and without diamond. ","As for designers, by definition for the nature of the designer business there is less innovation there because it's more product that has been originally designed in the past and so it\u2019s the area of innovation.","Operator","And next we will hear from Erwan Rambourg with HSBC.","Erwan Rambourg","Yes. Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on Chinese consumption. Recently, you've had a strengthening of the renminbi. And at the same time, I think the Chinese administration is looking to repatriate growth within Mainland China. So I'm just wondering, if you could comment on what you're seeing in terms of Chinese tourists in the Asian region relative to growth within Mainland China. Have you seen any inflection recently that would be linked to the renminbi strength? And then linked to Chinese consumption, I was just wondering if you could give us more detail about the e-commerce footprint. So you -- I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are looking to launch a commercial website in China. I'm wondering what your footprint is with potential existing platforms or partners to sell online in China today? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Erwan. Well, as for sales of Chinese customers abroad, so tourists, we have not seen in the recent -- in the quarter also in January a different pattern than before. For sure, we have seen keeping a very positive trend in China during holidays that continued also into January. As for the website for us is an important fact that, finally, also in China, we will have a Tiffany owned dedicated website. And so we plan to do it ourselves independently as we have in the most important market in the world. ","So, it will be a company operated e-commerce website. Then of course, as you know, very well that are many social media in China, where we can -- that we can use and in order to push traffic on the chart et cetera into our website as we do in the rest of the world. So, we are very excited about it. I would say hopefully for sales, but especially for giving visibility of the brand to Chinese customers that can learn more about the brand having a full-fledged website with products that can be purchased, so they can explore the assortment, learn more and then hopefully to buy maybe online and for sure in the stores. ","Erwan Rambourg","And just to clarify, so you will skew the traffic to your own selling website. But will you offer some products to partner websites through third-party platforms?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. As we have done already in the past, we'll keep doing activities like at our stores and these kind of activities also with third-party, now the business we will have overall. ","Operator","And now we will hear from Francesca Di Pasquantonio with Deutsche Bank.","Francesca Di Pasquantonio ","Can I please ask two questions, one is a follow-up? The first one is on domestic US consumers. There is a clear divide in the year between first half and second half and Paper Flowers was launched in mid-2018. And US being through a lot of marketing branding, in-store experience, remodeling. So I was wondering what your incremental let's say comments could be in terms of how to drive growth irrespective of favorable top down trends, given that so much has been done with impact in the second half, rather than the first half? ","And the second question is a follow-up on SG&A. The fact that leverage seems to be so much better and the combination of efficiencies and gross margin seems to be affecting some of what we saw were going to be higher investment needs. Is this leaving you in a comfortable position when the luxury framework is becoming very competitive in using the pockets to fuel the visibility of the competing brands? And within the SG&A if the expected increase coming from the New York store remodeling is also including some assumptions on potential sales disruptions that you may be facing? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","So Francesca, thank you for your question. Well about Paper Flowers, the collection met our expectations. In the US it's true; we had declaration of demand by also domestic customers. That was very strong in the first part of the year and it was softer especially in the last quarter, in the fourth quarter. ","Now I don't also say this to any specific product, because we saw it affecting all different product categories and price points. So that I really see more linked to something bigger and more to do with customer confidence of the US in third quarter. Don\u2019t forget that the stock price -- the stock market did poorly exactly in November and December. And there were several factors that for sure affected our kind of consumers that of course are related also with the macroeconomic environment.","Mark Erceg","So the balance of your question, you asked about SG&A efficiency. And again, that's something that we have been clearly focused on. That's one of the six key priorities that we've laid out. We try not to distinguish again a whole lot between gross margin expansion, SG&A margin expansion. At the end of the day, it's all about operating margin expansion. In this past year, we clearly stated that we expected operating margin to be down and it was for the year that we just provided guidance where we expected to be up modestly and then our long-term algorithm still would suggest that we would expect to see about a 50 basis point improvement in margin thereafter. And that still what we're working against.","As far as your question on the flagship store, this past year, we had about $0.07 of dilution related to that, we said for next year it would be somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15. It's not driven by an expectation of sales disruption. It really comes down to a number of things that the incremental rent for the temporary space. The accelerated depreciation associated with the project itself because now that we're transforming elements of the existing store. We need to depreciate -- an accelerated depreciation over now and when the project will go live. And then there are certain expense dollars related to some consultants and others that really can't be capitalized. Those are the three elements principally that come into play as it relates to that but we don't expect a sales disruption in that math.","Alessandro Bogliolo","And just to be clear during 2019 while we will be working -- and we are already working now as a temporary store in 57th Street, in the meantime for the full year, the flagship store will keep operating as it is, so it will not be impacted by the works.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul","I was just wondering, Mark, can you talk about the biggest technology and systems investments and projects you're working on this year and what milestones we should really keep an eye on for? Thank you.","Mark Erceg","Yes, absolutely. We've talked in the past about three different large buckets. One is what we call the foundational systems. That's where we're standing as a common order management system, a common financial queue, it's letting us bring on Coupa which is an indirect procurement module. It also is going to give us one common inventory management system. We stood that up this past year in China and in other Asia Pacific countries. As I intimated earlier, that's one of the reasons that we can now support a Chinese Tiffany enabled website, because we now have the ability to provide that product to the customers through those new portals.","We're going to continue to stand up additional geographies as we go forward. As it relates to that endeavor. It will continue to take a number of years, though, between now and we get the entire world stood up on that system. Second thing we always talked about was our digital replatforming. And if you get a chance to go take a look at our new website, we just stood up this week, I think you'll see a dramatic step forward in the capabilities of the site. We've obviously done very well in the past with our e-commerce portals. We won a lot of awards. But a lot of that, frankly, was through sheer just force of will and just the dedication of the teams here, but they didn't have the proper tools to really allow them to do a lot of the things that will now be able to do from a clientele and outreach standpoint, from a testing standpoint. ","And so we're now well on our way on our digital replatforming and once we get the China e-comp site up later this year, that'll be another big step forward. And then we're looking at a lot of the work that we need to do in order to put together the data hub, so we can do a lot of predictive work and get a lot of analytical packages in place. We've also been working on advanced planning systems for our production teams. And obviously we've been also working on a lot of the CAD\/CAM elements related to the JDIW which is our jewelry design innovation workshop. So there's a lot of big elements associated with our transformation of our IT systems that we will continue.","Operator","And next we will here from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson","I wanted to follow-up on the decline in engagement jewelry in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering, were trends better in the US and do you think the global launch of Tiffany True could turn that business into positive territory in 2019?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. Well, first of all the deceleration we have seen in sales has been across all product categories. And actually if you look at the deceleration between the fourth quarter compared to the rest of the year, it\u2019s really spread across the different categories. So I don't see anything specific about engagement rings. Now of course out of Tiffany True, we expect I mean an improvement in overall sales in engagement rings. But consider that what we did in the US has been prelaunch, very limited. I\u2019ll just give you an example. In terms of carat stone it was limited to the 1 carat, 1.5 carat stone that is a pretty expensive part of the assortment and also the jewelry that goes with it and it\u2019s really part of the concept, will be just launched from now going over in the year. So I think it's still early to process also because especially for diamond rings and engagement rings, the decision process of the customer is very long. Typically takes several months and several interactions with the brand on the website in the stores et cetera before making a decision. So it\u2019s not really an impulse kind of purchase, but we are very confident there.","Operator","And next we will here from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie. ","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Regarding investments, I wanted to follow-up on the employee count detail in this morning\u2019s 10-K, you've grown your employee count by approximately 20% over the last two years compared to a 3% increase in your store account. Were these investments in talents, were they around supply chain, digital or any other functions? And then should we expect the pace of employee growth to continue for 2019?","Mark Erceg","Yes. Principally what you're seeing there is either in the retail space, where we're continuing that a little bit of square footage, but principally it's on the manufacturing side. As we know, and we believe it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us to basically cut and polish our own stones, because we do through our exacting standards.","And that is a very large operation with several thousands of individuals. And we have continued to add additional capacity in that regard. So that's really what you're seeing. And of course, we do that at a competitive cost, we benchmark all of our internal production versus external purchases. And we're confident that we're actually margin accretive through bringing that effectively in house and we end up with a better product as well.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Mark, I just wanted to kind of maybe dig into the guidance a little bit more. So an EPS decline in the first half, I think we all appreciate that. But is it possible to break apart 1Q verses 2Q a little bit in greater detail only because to your point earlier in the call a lot of your investments spend really started in Q2. So it seems like there's a bigger headwind in Q1. And not to mention, it seems like tourism and currencies are also likely larger headwinds. So anyway, you could comment on the magnitude of the decline in Q1 versus Q2?","Mark Erceg","The only thing I would want to say is we don\u2019t want to start getting into the game of providing quarterly guidance. We do think that the first half will be below the rates that you'll see in the second half of the year. Two things I think are fair for me to point out specifically though, one relates to FX. So if you sit here today and you take spot, what you would see is that we're going to have a 3 point headwind in the first quarter versus the prior period. By the second quarter that becomes roughly 1 point headwind based on spot right now by the third quarter is a push and by the time you get to the fourth quarter, so you\u2019ve 50 basis point help. So that's one element. The other thing I would say you addressed it yourself, we said we won't be annualizing the full rate of our spend until we get the second quarter. So those two factors are indicative of what I probably could share.","Operator","Next we will here from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs.","Jocelyn Welsh","Hi this is Jocelyn Welsh here on for Alex. We want to dig a little bit more into some of the store and experience improvements you've been making this year. What's working there the most, is it displays or changing -- changes in staff training or what's working there?","Alessandro Bogliolo","It's a mix of things. As for -- and actually to really have the full benefit of it, we will have to add all these things together. Because for example, the new displays have been implemented in North America, not yet in the rest of the world, we are rolling it out now literally in the rest of the world. As for the training, there has been a renewed training in diamond in order to elevate the education of our sales professional, to the Tiffany diamond and expertise we have, the fact that we -- by the -- mainly for solitaire the diamond in rough. All the provenance initiative that I am sure you're aware that we made public early in January where we share with customers now uniquely among these luxury brands the origin or country of origin of our diamond, all this has been part of training. Now all these factors are very important, are very time consuming, because it\u2019s [indiscernible] people to train. And -- but surely we are seeing the benefits of it. Difficult now to say for each single activity how much percentage of increased sales, is driving, but it's definitely the right thing to do.","Operator","We will have here from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro","I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Chinese consumer. They seem to be buying closer to home, which I believe is a good thing for you guys. But how is their buying different when they buy at home versus when they travel? Because I\u2019ve read over the years, many reports about when people travel on vacation, they tend to spend a little bit more loosely. Could you just kind of contrast your local Chinese consumers spend versus your broader tourists spend from that same consumer?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Sure. Well, Chinese consumers, they are different -- but I think in general a higher average spend compared to consumers in the rest of the world, they are big lovers of gold and platinum especially with diamonds, engagement rings is very strong with them. For example, the sterling silver is not strong category with Chinese customers, because there is not a big tradition, small and Anglo-Saxon tradition. So all this brings the average purchase of the Chinese customer higher -- much higher than equivalent American or European one. ","Now about the difference between the purchase of Chinese -- in Mainland China versus when they are traveling around the world is not really material. It depends more on the destination. In the sense that there are destinations that are more for customers that come from second tier cities with a smaller budget, there are destinations that are more -- for more affluent customers. So as more to do with that then really the nature of the customer because at the end of the day the customer is the same when he is at home or abroad. ","Marni Shapiro","So second tier city customer shopping in Shanghai or Japan might spend less than a customer who shop into Paris or New York, is what you're saying there?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes, I mean, generally speaking you have cases like this. ","Operator","And next we will here from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks, good morning guys. Recognizing the increase in marketing rate this year, any -- where you see marketing as a percent of sales in '19 and many be the right level longer term? And then just you've been calling out the reduced sale of wholesale diamonds, how large is that at this point? Maybe how much more room do you see to reduce those levels and any margin impact from that? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well as far as marketing investment expense is concerned, we evolved from a 6%, 7% of our tougher sales that was in the past years our rates of expanding in marketing to the 8% to 9%. I think that this current rate is the right one for a brand like Tiffany. And so this is what we look at going forward. ","Mark Erceg","Yes. And as far as the wholesale sale of diamonds is concerned I mean obviously by its very nature it's something that is a little bit volatile this past year, it was roughly $35 million into that effect and for modeling purposes at this point, I would be expecting something similar in 2019.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mark Aaron for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Before concluding we want to express our appreciation to all of you for participating on today's call. As always, please feel free to contact me with any additional questions or comments. Please note on your calendars that we expect to report first quarter results on June 4th before the market opens and host a conference call. Operator, I think we can now wrap up the call.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"20512":["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF) Q4 2013 Earnings Call March 22, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark L. Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations","Patrick F. McGuiness - Chief Financial officer and Senior Vice President","Michael J. Kowalski - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Member of Management Board, Member of Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and Member of Dividend Committee","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Co. Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Participating on today's call are Mr. Mike Kowalski, Tiffany's Chairman and CEO; Mr. Pack -- Pat McGuiness, Tiffany's Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Tiffany's Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark L. Aaron","Thank you, and welcome to this conference call.","We issued our financial results earlier today and hope that, by now, you've had an opportunity to review the news release. On today's call, Mike, Pat and I will provide our insights into the fourth quarter and full year results and comment on Tiffany's plans and outlook for the coming year.","Before continuing, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now we can proceed with a multifaceted review of Tiffany's performance. Taking a big picture view, Tiffany's financial results in 2012 did not achieve the expectations we'd established at the start of the year. Net sales rose 4% due to single-digit percentage growth in all regions, although below initial expectations in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and gross margin continued to be pressured by product input costs and unfavorable sales mix. SG&A expense growth was contained, but in total, net earnings per diluted share of $3.25 was 4% below 2011 on a GAAP basis and declined 10% when excluding nonrecurring items in 2011. The conclusion to the year, with 4% sales growth and only a slight earnings increase in the fourth quarter, was also certainly not up to our normal performance standards. Let's first look at sales by region.","In the Americas, sales in the fourth quarter rose 2%, which was consistent with the increase we had reported for the November, December holiday season and reflected jewelry units equal to the prior year and a slight increase in the average price per unit sold. For the full year, total Americas sales also rose 2%, on top of a 15% increase in 2011 as an increase in the average price per units sold was partly offset by decline in jewelry units sold, primarily in silver jewelry. The Americas region accounted for 48% of worldwide sales in 2012 versus 50% in 2011.","On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 2% in both the quarter and year, while comparable store sales declined 2% in both the quarter and year.","Geographically, sales from the New York flagship store declined 3% in the fourth quarter, while a 3% decline in the year went up against a 20% increase in 2011. The New York flagship store accounted for 8% of worldwide sales in 2012.","For the quarter and year, there were minimal changes in sales to U.S. customers and foreign tourists. Foreign tourist spending represented about 45% of the New York store sales in 2012, and the largest spending came from Asia Pacific-based visitors, followed by customers from Europe. While we can no longer report foreign tourists sales data for the U.S. in its entirety due to legal restrictions on the collection of customer data in several states, we believe that sales to foreign tourists, which in 2011 was estimated at almost 1\/4 of U.S. sales, will continue to be of growing importance in certain U.S. and Canadian stores as we expand customer awareness of the Tiffany brand globally.","Americas brand store comps declined 2% in the fourth quarter, and a 2% decline in the full year was up against an 11% comp increase in 2011. There were no significant deviations from the norm in terms of geographical performance within the U.S. in the quarter or full year.","Outside the U.S., total sales rose in Canada, but that reflected new stores, while we saw a double-digit sales growth in Mexico, and our business in Brazil continues to develop nicely. In addition to our New York flagship store, our next 3 largest stores by sales volume in the region in 2012 were in California in San Francisco and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa and on Michigan Avenue in Chicago.","We expanded our Americas store base by adding 13 locations in 2012. In the U.S., we opened 4 stores, including 1 in Salt Lake City, 2 in California in the San Francisco Centre and in La Jolla, and our third store in Manhattan in SoHo. In Canada, we added 6 locations, including 1 in Montr\u00e9al's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, a third store in Toronto in their Sherway Gardens Mall and the conversion of 4 department store boutiques in the Holt Renfrew department stores in Calgary, Montr\u00e9al, Ottawa and Vancouver into company-operated locations. We also opened 2 stores in Mexico in Mexico City in Altavista and a store in Rio de Janeiro's Village Mall, marking our fourth location in Brazil. And we finished 2012 with 115 stores in the Americas.","Beyond stores, we grew our Americas e-commerce and catalog sales in 2012 with a 6% combined sales increase in the fourth quarter and 4% growth in the year, driven by an increased average order size. We introduced a newly designed and more elegant catalog in the fourth quarter, which in conjunction with our brand strategy, offers a somewhat higher average price point, as compared to the traditional selections catalog that it replaced.","Let's now turn to the Asia-Pacific region, which represented 21.4% of worldwide sales in 2012, up from 20.5% in 2011. Sales rose 13% in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with holiday period growth, and rose 8% for the full year. The quarterly increase was fueled by growth in jewelry units sold and in the average price per units sold, while the annual increase was almost entirely driven by higher jewelry unit volume. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 10% in the quarter and increased 8% in the full year. Comps rose 6% in the quarter, while a 2% comp increase for the year was on top of an enormous 27% comp increase in full year 2011.","In the quarter, we experienced broad-based growth throughout Greater China and other markets, and that was true to a lesser extent in the year. The largest portion of the Asia-Pacific region is Greater China, which represented a little more than 1\/2 of the region's sales in 2012. Our highest volume store, by far, in the Asia-Pacific region in 2012 was the one on Canton Road in Hong Kong.","We broadened Tiffany's presence in the region by adding 8 stores in 2012 and finished the year with 66 stores. This included opening 6 stores in China, in Harbin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin and Wuhan. We also opened our second store in Sydney, in Bondi Junction, which represents our sixth store in Australia, and a second store in Singapore's Changi Airport, which helps us accommodate an increasingly mobile customer base. As we've said before, expanding Tiffany's store presence, especially in China, serves the dual purpose of generating local sales demand but also stimulating spending when Chinese customers travel to other regions.","Japan accounted for 17% of worldwide sales in 2012 and 2011. Total sales declined 6% in the fourth quarter due to a decline in jewelry units, mostly in entry-level price points, and increased 4% in the year due to an increase in the average price per jewelry units sold. However, it's important to note the effect on translation from a recently weaker yen. In the fourth quarter, the yen was 8% weaker than the dollar even though it was only 2% weaker for the full year.","Looking at results on a constant-exchange-rate basis. Both total sales and comp store sales in the fourth quarter rose 2%, while for the full year, total sales rose 6% and comps rose 7% on top of a 4% comp increase in 2011. As Pat will discuss in his comments, we have factored a negative translation effect into our plans for 2013. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 55 locations in 2012, with our flagship store in the Ginza generating 12% of total sales in Japan. During the year, we relocated 3 locations to other department stores in Tokyo; Chiba; and Umeda, Osaka.","Now moving on to Europe. That region accounted for 11.4% of worldwide sales in 2012 compared with 11.6% in 2011. Total sales rose 3% in the fourth quarter, slightly better than our holiday results, and rose 3% in the full year primarily due to increases in both periods in the average price per jewelry units sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, in the fourth quarter, total sales rose 3% and comparable store sales were equal to the prior year, while for the year, total sales increased 7% and comparable store sales rose 2%.","Sales in the United Kingdom accounted for 45% of total European sales in 2012, and our highest volume store in Europe is on Old Bond Street in London. In both the quarter and year, sales in overall Continental Europe, led by growth in Germany, modestly outpaced sales performance in the U.K. Our sales in Europe are benefiting from foreign tourist spending in some markets, especially in France and Spain. That foreign tourist spending, which we estimate accounts for about 1\/4 of European sales, is more than offsetting softness in local demand in some markets that is likely tied to soft economic conditions there.","We added 2 European stores in 2012: 1 in Nice, representing our fourth store in France; and 1 in Prague, marking our entry into the Czech Republic, and we're very pleased with initial results. We now operate 34 stores in Europe, with a long runway for further store expansion. And I'd like to specifically remind everyone that we will open a significant store on Paris' renowned Champs Elys\u00e9es in 2014.","Tiffany's other sales nearly doubled in the fourth quarter and rose 41% in the full year. As most of you know, through a venture with Damas jewelers, we converted 5 Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi, from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations in the second quarter and began recording retail sales of those stores. We have fully renovated our major store in The Dubai Mall to the latest Tiffany standards and design and have increased inventory assortments and marketing activities. We're encouraged with initial results and excited about the prospects for substantial long-term growth in that important region.","Let's wrap up the regional sales review with sales productivity in company-operated stores. With 4% worldwide sales growth and 6% square footage growth, there were pretty insignificant changes in overall and regional productivity. On a worldwide basis, sales per gross square foot remained at approximately $3,000 in 2012. By region, productivity was highest in the Asia-Pacific region at $4,500, but down from $4,700 in 2011; followed by Japan at $4,200, which was up from $4,100 in 2011; to Europe at $3,200, which was down from $3,400 in 2011; and then the Americas region, which was unchanged at $2,300.","Beyond stores, Tiffany now offers products on its websites in 13 countries. Those combined sales represented 6% of total worldwide sales or 8% of sales in the countries in which they are operated, which was consistent with the prior year. We also have non-commerce informational sites in 5 additional countries. And as we've said repeatedly, our websites play an important role in our marketing communication to enhance brand and product awareness and drive store traffic.","Turning to a few merchandising highlights for 2012. We saw our sales mix continue to evolve toward mid- to higher-priced products, reflecting our strategic initiative for a number of years to elevate the Tiffany & Co. brand. Most product categories performed relatively close to our 4% worldwide sales growth, but for a variety of reasons, the relatively weaker category was in silver jewelry especially at price points below $500.","Looking at some specific examples. Engagement jewelry sales were generally in line with overall company sales growth in 2012. We were encouraged with the successful, albeit limited, introduction of the Harmony engagement collection in Japan, which is now being rolled out worldwide. We were also pleased with the continued success of our yellow diamond collection, the new Enchant diamond jewelry collection and our reintroduced 1837 collection with the new RUBEDO metal.","But as I just mentioned, the sterling silver jewelry category at entry-level price points under $500 has lagged overall company sales growth. That is partly due to an ongoing brand strategy that has primarily focused our product development and marketing on mid- to higher-priced categories and likely also reflects pressure on the more economically-sensitive silver jewelry purchaser. Mike will talk a bit more about plans for that category in his remarks.","Designer jewelry sales rose in the year, reflecting the extraordinary designs of Elsa Peretti, such as her beautifully classic Diamonds by the Yard collection; and Paloma Picasso, with her new Villa Paloma and Venezia collections.","For a quantitative look at product categories sales mix by geography for 2012, please refer to the updated chart in our report on Form 10-K that will be available soon.","That concludes my comments, so I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat McGuiness.","Patrick F. McGuiness","Thanks, Mark, for that comprehensive sales overview. Before I review the rest of the earnings statement and balance sheet, let's look at 2013's expectations, starting with sales.","In our holiday sales announcement, we've indicated that we would plan sales growth conservatively for 2013, and we think we have done just that. In addition, while year-over-year comparisons will be far less daunting compared to last year, there is still plenty of global economic uncertainty that leads us to maintain a cautious outlook at this time. We are planning worldwide sales to increase by 6% to 8% in dollars.","On a constant-exchange-rate basis, this will be a high-single-digit percentage increase with total sales growth in all regions. Sales growth ranges from a mid-teens percentage sales increase in Asia-Pacific to a low-single-digit percentage increase in Japan. The only meaningful effect on sales that we expect from foreign currency translation in 2013 will be in Japan. We are projecting the yen to average JPY 93 to $1 for 2013 versus an average of JPY 81 in 2012, leading to a 15% negative effect from translation.","While we hedge our transaction exposure to a weakening yen, as it relates to a portion of inventory purchases made by Japan, we do not hedge any translation exposure. This will have a negative effect on sales and earnings and has been appropriately factored into our guidance. Therefore, the low-single-digit planned sales growth in yen will equate to a low-teens decline when translated and reported in U.S. dollars.","Tiffany's gross margin underperformed our initial expectations in 2012, although we were encouraged that the margin in the fourth quarter began to show some improvement. In the fourth quarter, gross margin of 59.1% was 1.3 points lower than last year's 60.4%. The decline resulted from several factors, including the continuation of product sales mix skewed towards higher-price-point products, which achieved lower gross margin, unfavorable but diminishing higher product input costs and reduced leverage on the fixed expenses. For the same reasons with varying degrees, the full year gross margin of 57% was below last year's 59%.","The product input costs to which I'm referring reflect the slow inventory flow-through of higher commodity costs incurred over the past 1 to 2 years which have since moderated and stabilized. At the same time, we exhibited pricing restraint by not taking any meaningful increases in 2012 and, as such, did not fully mitigate commodity cost pressures. We have recently been taking price increases around the world to alleviate pressure on gross margin in 2013. We expect gross margin in 2013 to be modestly below 2012 as we expect to continue to experience a shift in product sales mix toward higher-priced, lower-margin categories.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were well controlled throughout 2012. The majority of SG&A expenses continue to be fixed in nature. SG&A expense rose 2% in the full year but increased 5% when excluding $43 million of nonrecurring costs in 2011 related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. The 5% increase was due to store occupancy costs related to new and existing stores, increased marketing spending and higher labor costs that was partially offset by substantially lower incentive compensation.","In the fourth quarter, SG&A expenses rose only 2%, resulting in 0.7-point improvement in the expense ratio. We are planning mid-single-digit SG&A expense growth in 2013. This largely reflects costs related to the 15 new stores we plan to open this year and annualizing costs of the 28 locations added in 2012.","Primarily due to the gross margin pressure experienced in 2012, Tiffany's operating margin declined to 18.4% for the full year compared with last year's 19.4% on a GAAP basis and 20.6%, which excluded nonrecurring costs in 2011. The operating margin of 23.5% in the fourth quarter was down from last year's 24.1% margin.","For 2013, we expect the modest decline in gross margin to be offset by an improvement in the expense ratio, resulting in Tiffany's operating earnings growing in line with sales. We still believe that there is considerable opportunity to improve the operating margin over the longer term, returning to previous peak levels and beyond by leveraging stronger sales growth against a largely fixed expense base.","Other expenses, net, increased to $14 million in the fourth quarter and $54 million in the full year from $13 million and $43 million in last year's fourth quarter and full year. This largely reflected increased interest expense tied to higher average long-term debt borrowings. During the year, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $250 million of 30-year long-term debt, with principal payments beginning in 10 years at an interest rate of 4.4%. We applied $60 million of the proceeds towards 6.56% maturing long-term debt, and the remainder is for working capital and general corporate purposes. We are estimating other expenses at approximately $58 million in 2013.","Tiffany's effective tax rates were 35% in the fourth quarter versus 34.5% last year and 35.3% in the full year compared to 34% in the full year of 2011. We are estimating an effective tax rate of approximately 35% in 2013.","Looking at the bottom line. When we reported holiday sales results in January, we projected that EPS would likely be at the low end of our previous guidance of $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share. Consistent with that guidance, net earnings in the full year were $3.25 per diluted share. This compared with $3.40 per diluted share in 2011 and $3.60 when excluding nonrecurring costs related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff in June 2011. In that holiday sales announcement, we also indicated that we were targeting earnings growth of 6% to 9% in 2013. Based on the 2013 assumptions that I mentioned, our finalized plan meets that target with EPS at $3.43 to $3.53 per diluted share from operations.","I want to point out that we expect net earnings to decline approximately 15% to 20% in the first quarter due to some continued but diminishing gross margin pressure and higher marketing-related costs from a major event. However, absent those pressures in subsequent quarters, we expect net earnings growth in the second, third and fourth quarters. In addition, this forecast excludes $0.05 per diluted share of expected first quarter charges for staffing and occupancy adjustments.","Despite the overall sales shortfall in 2012, we achieved most of our balance sheet objectives for the year and are planning for solid free cash flow generation in 2013.","We initially planned for a 15% increase in net inventories in 2012. As the year progressed, we moderated our inventory plans due to a lower-than-expected sales growth and projected a 10% inventory increase. I'm pleased to say that net inventories of $2.2 billion at yearend were up 8% for the full year. Finished goods inventory rose 13% in the year, primarily due to the addition of stores and new products which included a meaningful expansion of our statement jewelry assortment. Combined raw material and work-in-process inventories rose only 2% in the year. We are projecting net inventories to increase approximately 5% in 2013 due to similar rates of growth in all stages of inventories.","Accounts receivables declined 5% in the year despite the 4% sales increase, primarily due to the translation effects from the weakening Japanese yen in the latter part of 2012. Capital expenditures of $220 million in 2012 represented 6% of sales, which is indicative of our long-term CapEx run rate. This was a modest decrease from the $239 million we spent in 2011. Despite higher spending in 2012 for increased store expansion and renovations, the year-over-year decline reflected costs for relocating our New York headquarters staff in 2011. We are projecting approximately $230 million of CapEx in 2013.","Putting it all together, free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities minus CapEx, was an inflow of $109 million in 2012 compared with an outflow of $29 million in 2011. The improved cash flow was due to a lower rate of inventory growth. We are planning for positive free cash flow of approximately $300 million in 2013.","At yearend, we had $505 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $434 million at the previous yearend. Combined short-term and long-term debt of $959 million at January 31, 2013 was up from $712 million at the previous yearend. As I mentioned earlier, we added $250 million of long-term debt during the year and paid off $60 million of maturing long-term debt.","Stockholders' equity rose to $2.6 billion from $2.3 billion a year ago. As a result, total debt was 37% of stockholders' equity versus 30% a year ago. We also returned cash to stockholders in 2012 in 2 ways. Our board approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, representing the 11th increase in the past 10 years. The annualized dividend rate of $1.28 per share would represent a 39% payout ratio on 2012's net earnings. We also spent $54 million to repurchase 813,000 shares of common stock in the first half of the year before temporarily suspending purchases to more effectively allocate resources consistent with our growth strategies. The board recently extended the expiration date to January 2014 for the currently authorized program, which has $164 million available for future purchases.","Lastly, 2 additional measurements that are important to us and stockholders are return on average assets, which was 9% in 2012; and return on average stockholders' equity, which was 17% in 2012. Our long-term financial objective is continue to call for achieving at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE.","We believe that the sales and earnings growth plans that we have constructed for 2013 are achievable and the beginning of a turnaround from our disappointing 2012 results. However, we are not yet back to achieving our long -- longer-term objectives that continue to call for annual 10% to 12% sales growth and at least 15% earnings growth.","I am now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski.","Michael J. Kowalski","Thanks, Pat and Mark, for your comments. And good morning to everyone.","Clearly, we were not pleased with Tiffany's financial results in 2012, which are not representative of how our company should perform in a more normalized operating environment. We faced more difficult-than-expected comparisons to some very strong sales results in 2012. We dealt with economic conditions in 2012 that were more challenging in some regions. We saw a pronounced softness in sales of entry-level-priced silver jewelry. And overall sales weakness led to a timing lag in realizing the benefit from a moderation in commodity costs.","At the same time, we remain as diligent and focused as ever on maintaining and enhancing the renown of the Tiffany & Co. brand through the strategic management of our product category mix, widening market communications and an expanded global presence through new stores, as well as renovations of select existing stores. And we are confident that investments in recent years in our product supply chain and infrastructure will ensure that we have the capacity to support our longer-term growth.","Strategic management of our product mix has served and will continue to serve to elevate our brand toward mid to higher price points. As we began the celebration of Tiffany's 175th anniversary, our product developments in 2012 continued to focus on higher-price-point opportunities both in gemstone jewelry and our -- in our gold and silver jewelry collections. And of course, we innovated with the beautiful new RUBEDO metal, which is a luminescent alloy composed of copper, gold and silver.","But maintaining the right strategic balance remains critical, and you will see a range of exciting new designs in 2013, including silver -- sterling silver with entry-level price points below $500. New designs in silver and gold are included in our dramatic reinterpretation of Tiffany's iconic Atlas collection debuting later in the year. And as we prepare to celebrate Jazz Age glamour on the occasion of the springtime premier of the movie The Great Gatsby, you'll see new designs in silver, freshwater pearls and onyx in our Ziegfeld jewelry collection, as well as higher-price-point fine jewelry in diamonds and platinum in The Great Gatsby collection. And finally, we'll also expand Tiffany's already-successful Jazz collection.","We are very excited about the worldwide rollout of Tiffany's Harmony engagement ring collection, which enjoyed a very successful exclusive launch in Japan last year. We will, of course, build on the success of our Enchant collection, introduced last year; and our yellow diamonds that have enjoyed great success since being launched 3 years ago. We have just introduced Paloma Picasso's new Olive Leaf jewelry collection inspired by the olive tree as a symbol of peace and prosperity. The collection is being offered in yellow and white gold as well as in silver, with diamonds and a wide variety of colored gemstones. And we were delighted to have reached an agreement with Elsa Peretti last December to ensure that her extraordinary jewelry and tabletop designs will continue to be available exclusively at Tiffany for at least the next 2 decades.","We've spoken before about expanding our statement jewelry assortment, and I'm excited to tell you that a selection of new truly extraordinary pieces will be available next month when we host a select group of Tiffany customers from around the world at our annual Blue Book event in New York. That event will mark the pinnacle of Tiffany's 175th year anniversary celebrations.","Beyond jewelry, we will of course be expanding our leather assortment in 2013, and we just recently introduced a beautiful spring collection of bags and accessories to our stores and websites. And we continue to be delighted with Tiffany's eyewear business through our arrangement with Luxottica, and we will be expanding our successful collections with designs that are inspired by our most popular jewelry collections. And of course, we remain absolutely committed to developing Tiffany's watch business.","Our marketing in 2013 will support new and iconic designs in all of our product categories. Through advertising, events, catalogs and our famous window displays and our engagement ring app, we have been and will continue to make it possible for our customers to engage with Tiffany around the world. And we will debut a redesigned website in the second half of the year that will address overall changes in the digital landscape, including social media and the increased use of mobile devices.","In 2012, we added 28 company-operated locations, which increased our global store base by 11% and our square footage by 6%. This included opening 19 new stores and converting 5 existing locations in the U.A.E. and 4 locations in Canada from wholesale distribution to company-operated stores. In the coming year, we will further expand our global presence when we open 15 new stores and close 1 in Japan, increasing our store base by 5%. We are also focused on renovating a number of existing stores.","In the Americas, we plan to open 5 new stores, including 2 stores in the U.S., in New Jersey's Garden State Plaza and in Cleveland's Eaton Shopping Center; another store in Canada, in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta; our 10th store in Mexico, in Villahermosa; and our fifth store in Brazil, in Curitiba. And we are excited about the coming relocation this fall of our store on block -- Bloor Street in Toronto to a site one block west that will offer a more elegant and refined environment, with less gross square footage but actually an increased amount of selling space.","We are planning 7 new stores in the Asia-Pacific region. We have 4 stores planned in China, including 1 in Jinan and 1 in Xi'an, which will take us to 26 stores in China. 3 additional locations are slated for elsewhere in the region. We plan to add 3 additional stores in Continental Europe, which will bring us to 37 stores in that region by the end of the year.","Beyond new stores, we believe there are also incremental sales and brand enhancement opportunities to be derived from existing but -- from renovating existing stores. The objective of those renovations is to deliver the very best customer experience by creating retail environments that reflect the heritage of our brand and the evolving aesthetic sensibilities. Store renovations are also excellent opportunities for us to ensure that store layouts are optimally planned and incorporate new sustainable technologies and materials.","We've entered 2013 with considerable enthusiasm. We know that the Tiffany & Co. brand remains strong and is increasingly admired and desired by customers in existing markets and in new markets we enter around the world. The universal desire among consumers for extraordinary product designs, craftsmanship, quality and shopping experience has not diminished and, we believe, in fact, will grow stronger. The Tiffany & Co. brand is very well positioned to serve those growing needs.","That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark L. Aaron","Thanks, Mike and Pat.

","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. We issued Tiffany's first quarter results earlier today with a news release and with the filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. I hope you've had a chance to look at the financial results, which were close to what we expected. Following comments from Alessandro and Mark, we will be pleased to take your questions. And then following the Q&A session, Jason and I will wrap up the call with some closing remarks.

Those filings can be found on Tiffany's investor website, https:\/\/investor.tiffany.com by selecting Financials. ","I'll now turn the call over to Alessandro.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. There are many positive and exciting initiatives taking place at Tiffany that should further our ability to generate healthy long-term growth. And I'm pleased to have this opportunity to provide you a brief update. I will first state the obvious. Tiffany's results in recent quarters have not been up to the long-term growth standards we have set for ourselves. Regional results in the first quarter were slightly softer than what we expected. Worldwide sales declined 3% following a strong 15% increase in last year's first quarter. However, worldwide sales on a constant exchange rate basis were equal to the prior year with sales growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe on the same basis, offset by a decline in the Americas and then changed the results in Japan. ","We believe that external pressures had a significant impact on sales. For example, we believe that the strong dollar had a meaningful impact on first quarter retail sales attributed to foreign tourists in the Americas. Our internal estimates indicate that those tourist sales represents a low double-digit percentage of our American retail sales. Those sales were down approximately 25% from a year ago with sharper declines among Chinese tourists, which in fact were even more pronounced than declines in the second half of last year. ","However, our internal estimates also indicate that constant currency retail sales to local customers, which we believe are much more -- much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential, were up by approximately 3% from a global basis during the first quarter with strong growth in mainland China being particularly noteworthy. This is why we remain focused on the strategic priorities which are within our control and then identified and are aggressively pursuing numerous ways we can enhance the excitement and relevance of this amazing brand. We strongly believe that effectively executing our strategic priorities, first and foremost, will be what takes this company to new heights of success. ","Let me give you a few examples. Our strategy to renew our product offerings continues to gain momentum. After successfully launching the platinum- and diamond-based PAPER FLOWERS collection last year, we are continuing to add new designs to this collection. Another major collection we recently introduced is the TIFFANY TRUE collection, featuring an innovative modern engagement ring design with a new diamond cut in a gold or platinum setting as well as with accompanying band rings. ","Finally, on a smaller scale, we have recently introduced Tiffany Love Bugs that complements our Return to Tiffany collection. Importantly, we have also included a gold version of Return to Tiffany Love Bugs in addition to silver, which is consistent with our strategy to continue driving higher-than-average transaction value across all of our product categories.","And I can tell you that we have a substantial amount of newness planned for the second half of the year with additions to the Tiffany T and HardWear collections among others. And I'm also pleased that we now have even greater visibility into our product innovation pipeline for the next several years. And I'm excited about what is being developed. ","We are also steadily progressing with our strategy to amply and evolve brand message. Focused on our most iconic collections and especially Tiffany T., the current campaign showcases beautiful Tiffany jewels worn by a cast of some of the most recognizable and richly diverse fashion models in the world. The brand's unique joyful attitude and iconic blue color made the campaign unexpectedly Tiffany. Importantly, the campaign is truly a digital-first campaign with most of the investment and assets directly -- directed towards social and other digital media. ","I should also highlight the publicity we have received and substantial impressions that were made in social media after Lady Gaga appeared at the Academy Awards in late February wearing the legendary 128-carat Tiffany Diamond. And we are making substantial progress to enhance our in-store presentations. We launched our global display enhancement initiative last year to add fresh and innovative elements of visual merchandising for our stores in North America. And we are now on track to complete the rollout of that initiative to all stores globally by this fall. ","We have also added some new stores in the first quarter. We opened our first store in Washington, D.C. in the new CityCenterDC luxury complex. We also completed the relocation of our most important store in Australia, where we opened a magnificent new store at the corner of Pitt and King Streets in Sydney. We are continuing our exciting development in mainland China this year. And total sales continued to grow by a double-digit rate in local currency in the first quarter. Our recent initiatives included relocating our store in Beijing's China World to an exceptional location with a redesigned 6,000-square foot format, showcasing an innovative and distinctive retail experience that encourages interaction and self-expression. ","Also we opened a concept store in Japan on Tokyo's Cat Street. Located in Harajuku, the experiential design for Tiffany at Cat Street showcases the wit, creativity and timelessness of the brand. From jewelry to home and accessories, the store offers a thematically curated selection and presentation of iconic designs and even houses a caf\u00e9 at the top floor. In terms of our projects to transform the New York flagship store into 21st century experience, construction has begun on the adjacent space with an anticipated completion of that temporary space by year-end. Once completed, we will shift most of our retailing space to that adjacent location for 2020 and 2021. ","Complementing the store base, we relaunched all of our global websites in the first quarter which, going forward, will allow us to offer a blended experience of content and commerce with enhancements that we expect will enable us to more effectively test, personalize and optimize content and ultimately ensure a better customer experience in the long term. In addition, for the first time, customers in the U.S. can now order online from a select assortment of band engagement rings. ","While we are understandably excited about these new capabilities, we did make the conscious decision to suspend digital marketing for a portion of the first quarter to ensure that our newly revamped websites could handle the load balances associated with a complete digital replatforming. And we believe that decision, while prudent, negatively impacted first quarter sales, although e-commerce sales still grew faster than total company sales. It is probably also worth a second to mention that we are getting closer to introducing an e-commerce-enabled website in China, which we believe will further strengthen our business in this important market. ","So in closing, we are pursuing a substantial number of initiatives to benefit our customers and drive sales and earnings growth as we move forward on this long journey. We certainly do not believe that first quarter results are indicative of our longer-term earnings power and recent external pressures will not sway us from the growth opportunities available to us. ","And now Mark Erceg has a few comments before we open up the call to all the questions.","Mark Erceg","Thanks, Alex. As Alex indicated, first quarter reported sales results were slightly lower than anticipated but broadly in keeping with our overall guidance for the year, which called for a soft first half due to a very strong base period, lower foreign tourist spending and meaningful FX headwind followed by stronger second half results as year-over-year comparisons get easier, foreign exchange pressures lessen and the bulk of our 2019 new product launches and associated marketing support reaches the market. ","Since we expected first quarter sales to be under pressure, and we knew that the incremental strategic investment spending, which began during the second quarter of 2018, needed to be fully annualized, we correctly anticipated downward earnings pressure in the first quarter, which is consistent with the results we just released. Gross margin was below last year, which reflected negative sales leverage on fixed costs that are included in cost of sales as well as shifts in sales mix, including an increase in higher price point jewelry that earns a lower gross margin and an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that earn as little if any gross margin, partially offset by lower product-related costs. ","SG&A expense growth was restrained in the quarter through tight expense management, including cost savings from our global procurement program, labor cost reductions through organizational efficiencies and, of course, variable cost savings tied directly to sales. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated due primarily to an increase in estimated 2018 Foreign Derived Intangible Income benefit we realized as a result of recently issued U.S. Treasury guidance. That said, we continue to believe that our all-in effective tax rate for the full year will be in the low 20s. ","Net inventories as of April 30 were 6% above the prior year as we continue to work off higher-than-expected postholiday levels. But importantly, we continue to expect minimal year-over-year growth by year-end. Our balance sheet remains strong, having finished the quarter with $763 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with just over $1 billion of total short-term and long-term debt. This enables us to reinvest in the growth of our business while also returning cash to shareholders. For example, we are spending more on capital expenditures for the next couple of years to support the transformation of our New York flagship store while we also continue to invest in the modernization of our IT infrastructure. ","At the same time that we're investing in the future of our business, we are returning cash to shareholders as evidenced by $25 million we spent during the quarter to repurchase approximately 270,000 shares of common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, which is consistent with our stated objective to move over time our dividend payout ratio closer to 50%. This will be the 18th dividend increase in the past 17 years. ","Operationally, we are pleased with the progress being made with our IT system upgrades. Since our last earnings release, we have upgraded our e-commerce digital platforms and activated a new advanced supply chain planning system, which should enable more sophisticated load management and production scheduling across our suppliers and our vertically integrated manufacturing network. ","So all in all, we just reported an admittedly soft but mostly anticipated and overall productive start to 2019, during which a number of strategic initiatives continued to advance. From a guidance standpoint and relative to the top line, we are being impacted by further declines in foreign tourist spending, where we continue to look for low single-digit sales growth for the year. Relative to the bottom line, we implemented some modest pricing actions towards the end of the first quarter and have plans for strict cost control management throughout the balance of the year. But we are being affected by the softness in foreign tourist spending and, to a lesser extent, the recent imposition of higher tariff rates on jewelry products that we export from the U.S. into China and our decision to not meaningfully increase our retail prices in China at the present time. ","Since we are determined to properly support and protect our business in mainland China against our principal competitors, we do not have to contend with higher import costs into China based on their unique sourcing locations. And after taking everything else we have discussed today into account, we think it is prudent to modestly widen our earnings per share guidance range from mid-single-digit growth to low to mid-single-digit growth. And of course, as we mentioned on our last call, we should not lose sight of the fact that EPS growth in 2019 is expected to be affected by incremental expenses tied to the New York flagship store renovations, which we estimate at $0.10 to $0.15 per share in 2019 versus $0.07 per share last year as well as a change in accounting standards that no longer allows us to recognize approximately $8 million per year of deferred gains on previous sale-leasebacks. ","So with that, I'll turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Alessandro and Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are now ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup.","Tracy Kogan","It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul, had a couple of questions. I was hoping you could talk about your performance on some of the higher traffic periods, like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, so around those periods. And also if you can give us a little bit more detail on your local market performance by region.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Tracy, for your question. Well, the first quarter -- well, of course, it's not the biggest quarter in seasonality for our business. Of course, there was Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. But I would -- and there is nothing really particularly noteworthy on this. I think the comments refer more to the entire quarter, where our business with local customers on a global basis was positive. In constant currencies, we grew by 3% and [indiscernible] this growth spread around the different geographies, led, first and foremost, by China.","Tracy Kogan","Great. And then how about the local customers in the U.S.? Any comment there? Did it get better versus fourth quarter? Or did it decelerate?","Alessandro Bogliolo","In the U.S., the performance of local customers has been positive. But we have seen some degree of caution in the U.S. customer.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","I wanted to follow up on the second half sales opportunities. It sounds like the Chinese consumer spending has actually gotten worse in the first quarter, so maybe you could see some continued weakness as you continue to lap that through the year. What are your -- any specific product launches, marketing changes, store updates? Maybe just help us gain some confidence in that back half sales acceleration that you're expecting.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Lorraine. We have a very busy second [Technical Difficulty] in terms of many initiatives, first of all, in terms of new products. Then I would say marketing campaigns, enhancements in stores' visual merchandising. We have, as you mentioned, a year-over-year comparison that becomes easier, more favorable to us. And we bank on the assumption that Chinese tourist spending will level off after the sharp decrease we registered starting from the third quarter of last year. And so we have a lot of initiatives in different areas. It goes from important store relocations and openings for the second part of the year as well as a on difficult -- on a different point, the launch, after the very successful signature fragrance that we launched a couple of years ago, the launch of a new pillar fragrance in the second part of the year in the fall. So let me say, the agenda is a very busy, but teams are working very hard on all the different areas. And this is why we feel confident for a stronger performance in the second part of the year.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul","And Mark, I'm not sure if this is your last call with us, but thanks for everything. I don't know if you're doing the one in August. The first question I have is around the engagement category. Can you just talk about trends in engagement and sort of how you see that as a sort of underlying business metric? And then the second question that I have is can you just talk about your ability to sort of gain new customers, bring new customers in with a lot of the marketing that you're doing?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Bob. I will start from the second question. That is about new customer and existing customers because I think it's a very relevant point. What we have seen in local customers is a growth of overall 3% at constant exchange rate. Now this growth has been driven both by existing customers as well as new customers. And it's very relevant to share with you is that we have just completed the regular annual health -- brand health survey that we do in the key markets. And so we are now able to compare our brand, how it is perceived now compared to when it was -- when the last survey that was more than 1 year ago, so before the new marketing campaigns that we launched last year. ","And I'm pleased of the results because we have seen, for example, in the U.S., an increase in relevance for -- and distinctiveness of our brand among the consumers, especially sophisticated consumers. And we have recorded a very strong increase in brand power in China for the Tiffany brand. So I'm feeling very confident about the step we have taken in the last 12 months in terms of new communication because at least in these 2 key markets, we're showing that it has strengthened the brand and gives, I think, answer to your question about both existing customers and new customers, we are seeing progress in both of them.","Mark Aaron","Bob, thanks for your kind words.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erwan Rambourg from HSBC.","Erwan Rambourg","I wanted to take this opportunity also to tell Mark thanks for all the help and insights over the years, and welcome to Jason. I wanted to focus on the U.S. and wanted to get a sense of the American consumers. What percentage of the U.S. is local in nature? And would you attribute the 4% comp decline mostly to tourist inflows or maybe there's an impact of equity markets as well on the Q1? And then maybe just related to the U.S., my understanding is the former Niketown location that you're refurbishing, that will be open for the holiday. Will the main location also be open at that stage?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Okay. So there's a little -- thank you, Erwan. There are several questions altogether. Let me answer first to the last one. That is easier for holiday, not only the ground floor but the entire flagship -- current flagship building will be open. And now let's go to the other questions that are more articulated. So first of all, it's about the tourists in the U.S. The tourists in the U.S. represent a low double-digit percentage of our total sales in the U.S. And we have you seen a sharper decrease to sales to tourists in the U.S. in the range of 25%, even sharper for Chinese tourists. And this is in line -- it's not even a little bit stronger trend than we have seen in the past couple of quarters. Now this is -- of course, it has a negative impact on the comp sales in the U.S. because double-digit percentage of sales depends on tourists. And so of course, this affects the overall. And as I said, the local -- the domestic customers were positive but with, I would say, quite cautious. What is important for me is that the relevance of the brand with Chinese customers that keeps on being confirmed by the strong performance in China.","Mark Erceg","The one thing I would offer and add to that is we did see a little bit of a difference between what took place with respect to Chinese tourism in the U.S. relative to non-Chinese tourism in the U.S. We actually saw the Chinese tourism for U.S. retail fall off towards this latter part of the second quarter last year but principally into the third. The other tourism to the U.S. really started to denigrate in the fourth quarter and has continued since that time.","Mark Aaron","And to Erwan's question about whether the declining stock market might had some effect on consumer psychology?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. Well, referring specifically to the U.S. customer, I think that this caution is [indiscernible] to several factors. First of all, we have seen all the confidence index of the consumers in the U.S. that is in this first quarter of the year is pretty low compared to exactly 1 year ago when it was extremely high. We have seen also brands in the -- big brands in the cosmetic industry, in the fashion industry, if you look also department stores in the U.S. reporting soft sales in the first quarter. And they are all brands that have a big presence in the entire country of United States. So it's positive, but it's very cautious.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","Thank you very much for all the commentary on the U.S. tourism decline of 25%. Mark, could you -- can you tell us a little bit about what you're contemplating for U.S. tourism decline for the overall top line guide for this year? And then any commentary on the shape of the gross margin curve for the year as it progresses would be very helpful.","Mark Erceg","Thank you. I'd tell you, the tourism one is hard for us to be overly predictive of. But we are trend-takers, so to speak. Just like we take spot FX and presume that what holds through balance of the year, we're kind of doing the same thing here with the tourism. We're not assuming things get any better, but we're also not necessarily assuming things get any worse, just that the trends that we had seen continue on. Now realistically and practically, we are hoping that once we get to the third quarter, the rate of reduction that we've seen in Chinese tourism, we're hoping that, that moderates because frankly with such a swift decline, it would be kind of hard to believe that year-over-year, we could see a continuing step-down of that magnitude. But at this point, we're not being overly optimistic. We don't have our second half plans predicated upon tourism suddenly coming back to us, which is something we can't control. ","As for the gross margin, when you think about what happened in the first quarter, there was really three factors. One was the wholesale sale of diamonds, which we really can't be overly predictive of. We get the rough boxes in, sometimes we get to reprocess those and push them back out though not Tiffany quality. We also saw some negative sales leverage on fixed costs. I would expect that to continue for another quarter or so. But certainly by the second half of the year when we're ramping back up for our second half product launches and things, we expect our factory loads to be much more balanced. So that should be kind of a temporary phenomenon. And then as far as the mix is concerned, we talked about was the fact that we sold a lot of additional higher price point items in the first quarter. And that's really at the end of the day probably a good thing for us. So as we think about the full year on a margin basis, we knew the first half would be tough. We expect to make up ground in the second half. And so when the dust settles out on the full year based on the guidance we've given, we would expect operating margin to be flat to maybe slightly up as we sit here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","And Mark, best of luck, what a pleasure over all the years. As you think about the guidance for the year and just the cadence of the guidance, SG&A and also as you just commented on gross margin, new product introductions, when should we see them? And how do you think about expense management during the year, given the investments that are being made?","Mark Erceg","I'll let Alex comment on the new initiatives, which we're very excited about. But as far as expense management, I hope you did see as you look through the first quarter results that the SG&A growth really was restrained. And that's a testament to the fact in the hard work that the entire organization is doing to make sure that we are really only spending money on things that can drive sales growth at the end of the day. I would expect that to continue throughout the year as our procurement programs and other initiatives that we've discussed in the past continue to take hold. But there will be very tight reins on cost so that we can fuel additional investments in growing the business.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. And in terms of plans for the second part of the year, we will keep on pursuing the strategy that we have started last year. And they're, first and foremost, to products, which is the most important things we have. Because what we have been doing has been to launch, starting from PAPER FLOWERS in platinum, then Tiffany T True in platinum and gold and the jewelry in gold. We will continue with this approach of introducing newness, mainly in gold, at a very accelerated pace. And so far, even if it is only 1 year, we are seeing that in our results, the growth in revenues comes from the newness and especially from the newness in gold. And the higher the price, the higher the performance. ","So this, we find it very reassuring for the strategy we have taken and also reinforcing the brand and clearing, if anybody has a doubt that Tiffany is a luxury brand, clearing definitely this out because we are seeing increasing average transaction value and strong performance in the gold and more precious categories. We believe this is positive for the brand in the short term and the long term. And the launches that we have foreseen for the second part of the year continue in the same strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","And Mark, let me add my congrats and thank you for your help all over the years. I wanted to just -- so I just wanted to ask, on the SG&A, it looks -- I'm trying to think about the cadence of this year. And as you stepped it up last year in the second quarter, you talked about how you'll anniversary that this quarter. But I think you mentioned managing cost in both 4Q and now 1Q. So was any of that SG&A had to be pushed out to the second half of this year perhaps to support the comp acceleration that you're looking forward around the innovation pipeline? And then I guess as we think about trying to connect that to next year, Mark, maybe you could just remind us what are the components that are allowing you to lever SG&A on a low single-digit comp this year. And do those go back into the algorithm next year as we think out to 2020?","Mark Erceg","Yes. Thank you for the question. So with respect to the first portion of what you asked, when you think about when we really started stepping up our investment spending profile, last year, it was principally in the second quarter. So we said that we needed to really lap and annualize that. [Indiscernible] were there any costs or charges or investments in the first quarter of this year that maybe slipped a little bit toward the second quarter or third quarter? And Alex commented in our prepared remarks about [indiscernible] digital marketing elements as we stood up our 13 global e-commerce-enabled sites. So that arguably was a little bit of a push. From this point forward, I would say the run rate you're going to see as far as investment spending, marketing support, in-store [indiscernible], I think it will be fairly steady and constant from Q2 through the balance of the year. And then from that point, we already elevated and stepped up the amount of spending we think is appropriate in order to sustainably grow the business. So I think at this point, most of that is now behind us, which is important. As far as the cost takeout efforts are concerned, however, I think I would tell you that we felt [indiscernible] with respect to that. ","The global procurement group has been around for a number of years. They continue to do really good work. We're standing up a source-to-pay system as we speak, which will give them visibility into all of our global spend pools, which is something they haven't had up to this point in time. We're doing a lot of work with our suppliers and our supplier enablement and putting supplier scorecards in place, doing a lot more diligent tracking as it relates to that. The jewelry design and innovation workshop we talked about before has been a great intervention, where we bring the [indiscernible] and the design group and the engineering group together to let us do [indiscernible] costing, [indiscernible], allows us to do [indiscernible] modeling. I mentioned in the prepared remarks about the advanced planning system we just stood up on the manufacturing side of the house. This was a multimillion-dollar project that spanned well over a year and took a lot of multifunctional participation. But it's going to allow us to optimize our inventory levels. It's going to allow us to make better make-versus-buy decisions. It will enable much more sophisticated capacity planning. I mean frankly, we've been managing our production loads on Excel spreadsheets up to this point in time across our factory network. So to be able to do mass rescheduling across our facilities and vendors, detail the production scheduling for each manufacturer, those types of things are big enablers for us. So I could go on. But I think that should give you some sense of the things that we're working against.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.","David Bellinger","It's David Bellinger on for Brian. First of all, thanks for everything, Mark. Appreciate all your help over the years. I just wanted to follow up on the weaker sales to the foreign tourists, so estimated down 25% from last year's Q1 levels. Can you tell us how much lower that figure is versus what we saw in the later stages of 2018? And can you speak to how the trend tracked around Q1? Are there any indications your -- of stabilization you're seeing there throughout the business?","Mark Erceg","I guess what we would say is the sharp decline we saw in Chinese tourists of U.S. retail really presented itself for the first time in June of last year. And we have been running down significantly since that point in time. That said, the reduction that we saw in the first quarter was even more extreme than what we experienced in the third quarter of the last year as well as the fourth quarter of last year. So the good news there, if there is any, is the fact we're trying to come up upon when we should at least start lapping that in the base period. ","As far as the other tourism is concerned, again I mentioned that, that's going to fall off in the fourth quarter. And that has continued as well. Within the quarter itself, I'm really hesitant to say anything about month-to-month because again this is internal data. This is some work that we do. From an estimation standpoint, there's not a third party to fully validate all of this. It's our internal sourcing. So we believe it's good, accurate. But I wouldn't want to read much month-to-month. I think the quarter-to-quarter trends are probably more relevant.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. Sort of because consumer [indiscernible] from one market to one another. It's not actually part of our business. But these are trends that can be read on a 3-, 6-, 12-month basis. So I mean [indiscernible], I mean I don't think it's really relevant on a monthly basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Janet Kloppenburg from JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","And thank you so much to Mark. I'm really going to miss you. You changed the standards for investor relations and we're all benefiting from that. Lots of luck, Mark. I had a couple of questions on the breakdown of the Engagement and Fashion Jewelry business. I think there was some deceleration in those categories in the fourth quarter. And I wondered about their performance here in the first quarter. And Mark, if you could just help us on SG&A. It sounds like there was a cutback in the marketing expense for the first quarter relating to e-com. How should we be thinking about the rate of increase of SG&A in the second quarter?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Janet. So I will answer to your first question about the product categories. So in Jewelry Collections, we had a plus 1 -- reported plus 4% exchange rate exchange -- constant exchange rate basis performance. Now Jewelry Collections, as I said before, we have seen a strong performance in our newest, most iconic and most precious lines. Of course, the 4% is made of this strong growth and also negative on silver, less expensive items and, of course, products that were older in our assortment. But I'm -- while the 4% may seem just a low single digit, actually for me strategically, it's very important that is the average of some very strong growth in the lines in which we have invested for, for the future. So for me, that is strategically very important. ","The 2% negative in Engagement Jewelry, actually it's a little bit -- it's a flattish kind of situation. We have to also remember that we are comparing to last year when we grew at constant exchange rate 11% and engagement plus 11%, that was astonishing last year. So I see it as performance. We have benefited of the launch of T True. But consider that T True engagement ring is now, for the time being, rolled out in the markets in the higher carats and not yet in smaller carats. So the reception by the market has been very positive. And the product is in line with our expectations, but it's not yet in its full potential.","Mark Erceg","And [indiscernible] to your question, maybe I can just [indiscernible] and answer it a little bit more broadly. [Indiscernible] asking about is just marketing progression. If you think about the guidance we provided both on the top line and on the bottom line, it would suggest or imply that op margin will be flat to maybe slightly accretive year-over-year. Within that, what I would tell you is we expect [indiscernible] marketing as well as SG&A expense, inclusive of marketing as a percentage of sales, be roughly flat year-over-year. So there's not really a divergence between those two lines within the overall flat to slightly above margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","So maybe higher level, and I know probably not easy to do, but if you exclude the impact from tourism, what's your view on consumer engagement with the brand maybe by region? Particularly what are you seeing from local customers here in the U.S. and the driver of the strengths that you mentioned in mainland China?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Matt, for your question. So talking about local customers, we have seen actually a positive performance across geographies. The strongest one has been definitely the China -- mainland China customers. And I have to say that also in Europe, in spite of all the difficulties that, that continent has, we have seen pretty positive performance there, totally driven by domestic customers. And because also Europe, in France notably but also other markets, had been negatively affected for that tourist component. Now in terms of engagement, I'm looking mostly at the other factors. It is the engagement on social media. This is why I -- in my prepared remarks, I underscored how the initiative, for example, of the red carpet, Lady Gaga and also the new advertising campaign, where we are using very well-known models, like Carolyn Murphy, Mica Arga\u00f1araz, Kendall Jenner, et cetera. ","What we are seeing is an enormous increase in engagement on social media for Tiffany by customers. Now this is far from being an assurance of increase of sales in the near future. But for sure, it's very reassuring when it comes to the connection and the relevance of the brand with local customers. So of course, as I said, I was expecting slightly better results than what we have achieved. But if I look at really the fundamentals that is performance with domestic customers is gold and higher-priced products and engagement on social media, I'm really reassured about the direction that we have taken in terms of strategy.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up to that, on the Chinese consumer as a whole, I guess if we put together the spending abroad as well as the domestic spending that you just mentioned, I guess what's your view on the overall Chinese consumer in total relative to previous quarters?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, it's a mix of a very strong performance, high in growth in mainland China and a sharper decrease in the rest. So what we are seeing is actually a shifting of the mix of sales of Chinese because a few quarters ago, our sales to Chinese customers were typically split 1\/3 in mainland China, 2\/3 in the rest of the world. Now the components in mainland China has increased to about 40% and sales to Chinese outside of mainland China, including Hong Kong, the U.S., et cetera, has gone down to 60%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","And best regards, Mark. Thanks for all your help, and welcome, Jason. Regarding the overall operating margin on a long-term basis, what are your thoughts on dissecting the opportunity? Just a lot of our analysis relative to competitors shows a lot of good opportunity for you to improve the margin. I guess from the angle of business mix, fixed cost leverage and comp points and also supply chain and within business mix, are you thinking like-for-like changes? Just would love color around buckets on that long-term opportunity.","Mark Erceg","Look, we talked about this a number of times. And we had initially stated that after making the big investment step-up last fiscal, we expected our operating margin to expand this year. We're still hopeful that, that could occur. But with the strong reduction in tourism, we're now effectively saying it could be flat, maybe slightly up. If you look past the current year and you try and get past all these temporal effects that are affecting the business, we still are confident and believe that we should be able to -- through our cost management efforts and through growing the top line in a more consistent fashion, extract margin gains of roughly 50 basis points per annum, and that would over time obviously move us to a much better place. So without getting overly specific in the limited amount of time we have available for this call, I would simply say that our long-term growth algorithm, we don't view it as having been changed by these temporal effects that we're seeing right now with the tourism in particular.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward Yruma","Mark, thanks for all the help over the years. You've been incredibly helpful in understanding the story. I guess just two quick ones for me. First, I know it's early days, but any initial reads on diamonds on e-com? And then second, I know you said you had good results in mainland China. But any negative perception with Tiffany being an American brand? Are you seeing anything on social media that would indicate you could have a problem going forward?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Ed, for your questions. The first one, diamonds in e-commerce, you're right, it's very early. But I have to say that the reason why we decided to offer diamond rings on our online website for the time being in the U.S. has been, first and foremost, in order to give information to our customers.","Because we know out of research that the decision-making for a purchase of an engagement ring take several steps, typically 6, 7 interactions at least with Tiffany before completing the purchase. And we believe that the ability that now we -- a customer has to go on our website and understand what is the difference in terms of carat, color, clarity on the price is crucial and helps a lot the decision-making. But typically, it's an important purchase that is completed in the store. We have sold already some diamonds online. But that is not for me the measure of success. The measure of success is better information and better final sales in our stores. Now the second question...","Mark Aaron","Negative perception.","Alessandro Bogliolo","The negative perception of Tiffany in China, I have to say that we are not experiencing any negative sentiment by Chinese consumers towards the brand. For sure not in China, where sales are increasing very strongly, but also \u2013abroad even if we see a softness in sales to Chinese tourists, it's totally linked out of our recollection to exchange rates and also to the push that authorities in China are making in order to increase local consumption. Don't forget that the VIP has decreased in the period in China. And accordingly, we have also decreased our price because we have transferred this decrease in VIP to consumers. So absolutely, we are not experiencing any sentiment that is against our brand and definitely North America.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexandra Walvis from Goldman Sachs.","Alexandra Walvis","I'll add my thanks also to Mark for all your support. My question is on the inventory. So you mentioned there was a bit of a build versus where sales growth was this quarter. You mentioned that some of that was as you worked through excess inventory from the holiday season. Is there still an impact from a build and -- in your strategy to build high jewelry in the stores? And if so, can you help us to break down those two pieces? Where are we in that high jewelry build? And how are you thinking about the longer-term opportunity for inventory rationalization today?","Mark Erceg","That's a great question. And you're right. The high jewelry investment that we made and we were very public about hasn't fully annualized yet based on when the purchases did begin. So that is a component of it. And then of course, because we did have softer holiday sales and frankly a slight disappointment on the top line growth into our internal billing and projections of the tourism falling off so rapidly during the quarter. We ended up little higher balances than we otherwise would have preferred. That said, we have worked very closely with all of our planning teams. And we are still targeting and expecting to have inventories flat year-over-year when the dust settles out on January 31, 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad","I was hoping you could talk about your Fashion Jewelry initiatives for this year. There's been some big initiatives in the statement and engagement businesses since last spring over holiday. But maybe you could give us more ideas around what the innovation and newness we can see in that Fashion Jewelry business, which seems like it could be a pretty scalable opportunity for the company.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Omar. And so for the second part of the year, but I would say also for the first part of next year, we have a pretty robust pipeline of new products. We will focus for the second part of this year on existing iconic lines, like Tiffany T, like other, where we have a very good response by customers and where we believe there is the opportunity to injecting some newness that can be very, very effective. At the same time, we will launch also some new lines in very specific segments that probably are not going to be huge in terms of sales but are very meaningful for the brand positioning and they're totally accretive. And as soon as we will get closer to the date, I will be pleased to share which are these lines. But let me say, I feel very confident about the work we are doing. It's -- I can imagine that in some of you, there is a sense of frustration because you hear me being positive about these introductions. And on the other side, you see sales that at constant rates are basically flat. ","Now the reason is that, let's aside the tourism and all this, there is a factor that to modify, to evolve the assortment of a brand like Tiffany, it takes time. And we have to keep on going and adding newness. We are seeing that newness is paying back. But of course, the customer in front of the newness prefers the newness and leaves aside the existing products. So we will see -- we have to reach the critical mass in newness in order to give to the customer an option in our stores that is wider than it is now. And we are working very fast about this. But there are limits that are not just -- not really about manufacturing but is also the marketing and the time that is required in order to introduce new lines in the market without creating a [indiscernible] in the customer. Thank you, Omar.","Mark Aaron","Operator, it's now 9:28 a.m. So in the interest of everyone's time, we will now wrap up the Q&A session. But before ending the call, and as I think you all know, Tiffany recently decided to consolidate the IR and treasury functions. And as a result, I will be leaving the company later this year and transitioning the IR role to my colleague, Jason Wong, Tiffany's Treasurer, on August 1. I hope to see many of you in the next two months and to introduce Jason to you at meetings and conferences. Jason has a few words to share.","Jason Wong","Thanks, Mark. I'm honored to have been selected to add the IR function to my responsibilities. And I know I have big shoes to fill following Mark's incredible 34 years at Tiffany. Mark Aaron and I are working closely together so that we can ensure a smooth transition. I'm committed to maintaining Tiffany's reputation for clear, comprehensive, consistent, incredible communications to the financial community. And along with Mark Erceg, we look forward to working with our investors and security analysts to keep everyone informed about Tiffany's business and products. Please feel free to contact me at jason.wong@tiffany.com. I'll now turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Jason. In closing, I want to personally thank many of you on the call for your interest and support of Tiffany since our IPO in 1987 and for the engaging and productive dialogues that we've had. I appreciate the relationships we have built. And I look forward, as I'm sure you do, to following the progress of this great company. For now, please feel free to contact me and Jason with any additional questions or comments about these results. Please note on your calendars that Tiffany expects to report its second quarter results on Wednesday, August 28, before the market opens, and we'll host a conference call. Operator, we can now conclude the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"20508":["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call March 21, 2014  8:30 PM ET","Executives","Mark Aaron - Investor Relations","Jim Fernandez - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President","Analysts","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Good day, everyone. Jim and I welcome you to our conference call to review highlights of Tiffany's performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2013, as well as to provide key financial expectations for 2014.","Please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now, let's proceed. As an overview, worldwide net sales rose 5% in the fourth quarter or 9% on a constant exchange rate basis, which was a bit better than the respective 4% and 8% increases we had reported for the holiday period. Gross margin rose 1.4 points in the quarter. As previously disclosed, net earnings were impacted by the adverse arbitration rule that you are all familiar with resulting in a net loss of $104 million in the quarter. However, excluding net charge, net earnings rose 6% in the quarter.","Finally, we are pleased that the 6% increase in full year net sales met the expectations that we set a year ago, while net earnings growth excluding charges of 15% in the year surpassed our initial expectation. Let's now look at sales performance, where we posted growth in all regions on a constant exchange rate basis.","First, in terms of geographical mix by region, the Americans represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2013, which was unchanged from 2012. Asia-Pacific was 23% of sales, up from 21% in 2012. Japan was 14% of sales versus 17% in 2012, but the decline was currency-related and Europe was 12% of sales, up from 11% in 2012.","Starting with the Americans, the 6% sales increase in the fourth quarter was consistent with holiday results and was driven by an increase in the average price per jewelry units sold. A decline in jewelry unit volume was limited to the fashion jewelry category, which occurred mostly at price points under $500.","For the full-year, our sales in the Americas rose 5% due to price and volume dynamics that were similar to the quarter. We concluded the year on a stronger than expected note in the Americans. We attribute the improvement to at least some extent to selling initiatives taken by our regional management that focused first on our 25 largest stores to better engage the customers to our sales professionals and through enhanced visual merchandising. That focus will eventually be extended to all stores.","On a constant exchange rate basis, comparable-store sales rose 7% in the fourth quarter due to geographically broad based sales growth across most markets, and comps were up 3% for the year with sales growth in the New York flagship store outpacing modest growth in branch stores.","We are not ready to call the 7% comp increase in the quarter the beginning of a trend, but are encouraged nonetheless. You may be interested to know that our three largest branch stores by sales volume in the region in 2013, were in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, followed by our Union Square store in San Francisco and our store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago.","To reiterate what we have said previously, we can no longer quantify total foreign tourists sales in the Americas region, because of legal restrictions on data collection in some U.S. states. However in the New York flagship store, which in 2013 represented 8% of worldwide sales, were 16% of the Americas region, sales to foreign tourists increased and accounted for approximately 45% of that store's sales in 2013.","The increased spending came from Chinese visitors as well as higher spending by European visitors while a decline in Japanese tourist spending in New York and other markets too very likely reflected the yen's weakness. We believe that foreign tourist spending will continue to be a meaningful portion of sales in the Americans, as we generate greater brand awareness in Asia, Europe and elsewhere that also fosters greater spending when customers travel.","Elsewhere in the Americans, we achieved modest comparable store sales growth in constant currencies in Canada, Mexico and Brazil, in both, the fourth quarter and year.","We opened six stores in the Americas in 2013, in the Garden State Plaza Mall, New Jersey, in Cleveland, Ohio, Eton Center, in New Orleans, in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta Canada, in Curitiba, Brazil and in Villahermosa, Mexico. Store relocations, renovations and enhanced visual merchandising complement our worldwide expansion strategy and is one example in 2013 we relocated on Bloor Street store in Toronto to offer the utmost shopping environment to our customers. We finished the year with 121 company-operated stores in the Americas, including 94 the U.S. 12 in Canada, 10 in Mexico and 5 in Brazil.","Turning to the Asia-Pacific region, sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter due to increased jewelry unit volume and rose 17% for the full-year due to increases in jewelry unit volume and price per jewelry unit sold. While the 8% sales increase in the quarter was lower than we had initially expected, it was nonetheless better than the 5% increase we had reported for the holiday period, indicating substantial improvements in January that reflected strong growth throughout the region and perhaps reflecting the celebration of the earlier Chinese New Year.","Total Asia-Pacific sales on a constant exchange rate basis increased 11% in the quarter and 18% in the year, reflecting comp store sales growth of 4% in the quarter, with growth in most countries and 11% in the year with growth in all countries, and of course the opening of a number of new stores. In fact, we opened seven stores in the region in 2013, including four stores in China, one in Hong Kong and two in Taiwan, while closing one older store in Taiwan. We finished the year with 72 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. 45 of those stores are located in Greater China and represented more than half of the region sales in 2013. Our highest volume store in the region is on Canton Road in Hong Kong.","Continuing to expand brand awareness of Tiffany in China through our store base and marketing activities is critical to generating local sales growth, but also to influencing Chinese tourists when they travel to our other markets. When sales are measured in yen, our business in Japan performed well throughout the fourth quarter and year. In local currency, total sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and 11% in the full year due to a higher average price per jewelry units sold in both periods with some declines jewelry units sold.","Comp store sales in yen rose 8% and 10% in those periods. This was better than we had expected at the start of 2013, however the yen weekend about 20% against the U.S. dollar in 2013, which had a significant negative translation effect on our sales, resulting in reported total sales declining 12% in the fourth quarter and 9% in the full-year with roughly similar comp store sales declines.","While the weaker yen likely had a negative effect on our sales in New York, Hawaii and Guam and some other U.S. markets, it's very possible some of that demand shifted toward local consumption in Japan. For translation purposes, we are planning the yen at \u20ac105 to the $1 for 2014.","During 2013, the closing of the Matsuzakaya department store in Tokyo for multi-year renovation required the closing of the Tiffany store that they posted there, but we are guessing that much of that business probably shifted to our nearby Ginza store. We finished the year with 54 locations in Japan and our Ginza store produces the highest volume in Japan and accounts for more than 10% of total sales in Japan.","Tiffany stores in Europe faced some obvious macroeconomic challenges in 2013, but our expanded brand awareness and the opportunities provided by our under penetration in that region helped us to achieve generally healthy performance. Total sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter consistent with the holiday period and rose 9% in the year. The sales growth in both periods was fueled by increases in jewelry unit volume and in the average price per jewelry units sold.","On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 7% in both the quarter and year, while comp store sales increased 2% in the fourth quarter and 4% in the year. Geographical trends in Europe were mixed over the course of the year. Sales in the U.K. represented a little more than 40% of European sales in 2013, and our highest volume store in Europe is on Old Bond Street.","Over the course of the year, relative sales performance between the U.K. and continental Europe fluctuated, but there was no meaningful difference in performance for the full year. Foreign tourist spending has become a meaningful part of our business in Europe, which we estimate represented more than a quarter of total sales. Our stores in France had the highest percentage of those sales to foreign tourists with Chinese shoppers accounting for significant part of it.","We opened three stores in Europe in 2013, one in Stuttgart, Germany and two in Italy, in Rome and Verona, and finished the year with 37 locations in Europe. We also renovated our Frankfurt store and relocated our Florence store. Lastly, Tiffany's other sales rose 47% in the fourth quarter and 53% in the year. We are very pleased with comparable store sales growth of 23% in the quarter and 14% in the year, representing the five stores in the United Arab Emirates, three in Dubai and two in Abu Dhabi, that were converted from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations in July 2012.","The remainder of the increase in other sales in both periods was primarily due to wholesale sales of diamond that we acquired through our rough sourcing program and subsequently sell, because they don't meet our requirements. For the full-year across all regions, we opened 16 company-operated stores and closed two existing ones, representing a 5% increase in the number of locations and a 3% increase in gross square footage.","In terms of sales productivity, Tiffany's company-operated stores generated $3,100 sales per gross square foot in 2013, versus $3,000 in 2012. Productivity range from Asia-Pacific at $4,800 per foot up from $4,500 in 2012 to $3,800 per foot in Japan versus $4,200 in 2012, to Europe with $3,300 a foot consistent with 2012 and the Americas at $2,400 versus $2,300 a foot in 2012.","It's worth noting that the decline in Japan's productivity in dollars was entirely due to the negative translation effect from the weaker yen, while retail store productivity in Japan measured in yen rose 12%. Our store base is complemented by our multilingual web presence that spans across 13 countries with e-commerce site, as well as informational sites in six additional countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales which are included in each region represented 6% of worldwide sales in 2013 or 8% of the total sales in the countries in which we operate e-commerce sites. Those percentages were unchanged from the prior year.","We launched our redesigned site last October and visitors appear to be more engaged with its enhanced content as they are spending more time on the new site. Now, looking at some merchandising highlights, sales growth in the fourth quarter occurred across most product categories. The strongest sales growth continued to be in the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category, which incorporates jewelry with gemstones at the mid-to-higher price points and we were encouraged with improvement in the fashion jewelry category with the sales strength coming from gold jewelry, implying continued softness in silver especially at price points under $500.","Statement jewelry continued to post strong growth in 2013 as more customers, especially in Asia-Pacific and the Americans discovered Tiffany's extraordinary offerings. As we mentioned previously, we invested considerably in recent years to expand our statement jewelry assortment and we are delighted with the performance of this ultra high-end category.","Our success in fine jewelry reflects an extraordinary assortment of diamond jewelry, with increasing demand for colored diamonds and other gemstone. In particular, Tiffany's yellow diamond collection continued to sparkle with great success in 2013. Additional popular collections worth noting, included the Enchant collection, new jewelry designs with pink diamond accents introduced in 2013 and our beautiful Victoria Collection. Also, our Cobblestone and Soleste collections were well received with their expanded designs focused on diamonds and colored gemstones.","Engagement jewelry category performed well in most regions in 2013. While that category is anchored by our six-pronged Tiffany setting and complemented by additional settings we have introduced over the years. The latest innovation has been the successful Harmony engagement ring collection. We launched Harmony in Japan in 2012, expanded distribution globally in 2013 and then most recently broadened this assortment with Harmony band rings.","I said the word encouraged with improvement in the fashion jewelry category, the best example is ATLAS. We could not be more pleased with the success of that newly reinterpreted collection in various metals and styles which debuted last fall and will be expanded this spring. We targeted much of our advertising on ATLAS during the holiday season and that focused approach and powerful message drove strong results. It's also worth mentioning Tiffany's stepping back into the Jazz age earlier in the year with the launch of our Ziegfeld and Gatsby collections tied to the premier of The Great Gatsby movie.","Paloma Picasso's new Olive Leaf collection enjoyed a very successful first year and let's not forget the importance of some our Tiffany's iconic collection such as Metro, which continues to be a solid performer.","Our Keys collection introduced five years ago, enjoyed a strong sales resurgence in 2013. This popular collection in gold and platinum, which straddles fine and fashion jewelry benefited from newer designs in platinum, accented with colored diamonds. We finish the year feeling quite good about trends in most jewelry categories and are equally excited about new designs that will debut in 2014.","Our design team is focused on an array of new designs, including the expanded ATLAS collection this spring and with a special focus on invigorating fashion jewelry. Please stay tuned for an exciting new collection that will debut this fall as well as of course other design introductions across all categories.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to review the rest of the earnings statement, the balance sheet and our expectations for 2014.","Jim Fernandez","Thanks, Mark. Notwithstanding some obvious economic and consumer uncertainties as well as an unfavorable arbitration ruling, 2013 was indeed an excellent year for Tiffany's sales and earnings, excluding the arbitration related charge reaching record levels. Tiffany's achievements span the areas of product development, store expansion, marketing, the supply chain and strengthening the management team with new regional heads of Northern America and Europe, and bringing in a new design director.","Looking at the rest of the earning statement, gross margin increased 1.4 points to 60.5% in the fourth quarter and rose 1.1 points to 58.1% in the year. In both periods, we benefited from price increases we took earlier in the year to catch up with costs after avoiding any meaningful price increases in 2012. In addition, we benefited from diminishing pressure and our actual reductions in product costs.","Partly offsetting those benefits in the full year was a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced, lower gross margin in fine and statement jewelry, however I will add that those higher price points sales provide substantial incremental gross profit that can be leveraged against fixed costs and ultimately improve our operating margin. In addition, recent improvement in fashion jewelry sales helped in the fourth quarter and should eventually provide some further upside to gross margin.","Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 7% in the fourth quarter reflecting higher fixed and variable labor costs such as sales commission, and incentive compensation and higher store-related costs. SG&A expenses rose 6% in the year for similar reason.","Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weaker yen, SG&A expense growth would have been 3% greater in both, the quarter and the year. Please also note that full year SG&A expense includes $9.4 million pre-tax charge or $0.04 per diluted share recorded in first quarter related to staffing reduction and sub-leasing of certain office space.","As previously disclosed, we recorded the charge in the fourth quarter related to the adverse ruling in The Swatch arbitration. The total pre-tax charge was $473 million and the after-tax amount was $293 million or $2.27 per diluted share. We should note that $488 million of the pre-tax charge was recorded in earnings from operations while a $7 million foreign currency translation gain was recorded in interest and other expenses net.","In terms of earnings from operations, we think it is more relevant to look at the numbers on a non-GAAP basis that exclude the arbitration and other specific charges. Doing so, operating earnings increased 8% in the fourth quarter on the 5% sales growth and rose 14% in the year on the 6% sales growth giving us an adjusted operating margin of 19.7% for the year versus 18.4% last year.","Interest and other expenses net were $8 million and $49 million in the respective fourth quarter and year, excluding the $7 million transaction gain I just mentioned, interest and other expenses net would have been $16 million in the quarter and $57 million in the year, roughly in line with what we had previously projected.","Tiffany had an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter, due to arbitration award charge, while the full year effective income tax rate was 28.8%. Excluding the impact of the arbitration award and other specific charges, the effective tax rate was 36.1% in the fourth quarter versus 35% last year. The full year rate was 34.8% versus 35.3% in 2012.","The net $473 million pre-tax arbitration award charge led to a net loss of $104 million in the fourth quarter. Full year net earnings also included some specific charges that have been recorded in the first quarter, however excluding those charges Tiffany earned $190 million in the quarter and $481 million in the year representing EPS growth of 5% and 15%, respectively and putting us near the high end of our most recently disclosed expectations.","Our technically subpar 4% return on average assets and 7% return on average stockholders' equity in 2013 were due to the changes we recorded, and under more normal circumstances, would have been more in line with recent years and with our financial objectives.","I'm pleased to state that even after the payment of the arbitration award we finished the year with a balance sheet that provides with solid base to pursue our ongoing business plans and future expansions.","Inventories of $2.3 billion at year end were up 4% from the year ago. In comparison, net inventories had increased 8% in 2012, so we met our objective for a deceleration in the rate of inventory growth. The 4% increase in 2013, included a 3% increase in finished goods that support new stores and expanded offerings and a 5% increase in combined raw material and work in process inventories. Excluding foreign currency translation, net inventories would have increased 6% in the year.","We are pleased that, whether in dollars or local currency, inventory growth was less than sales growth in 2013, which is consistent with our long-term objectives. We are well positioned with high levels of inventory availability in our stores and our supply chain in diamond sourcing and internal manufacturing is operating efficiently to meet our growing product needs. Accounts receivables of $189 million at year end were up 9% in the year, reflecting worldwide sales growth. The increase would have been 14%, excluding foreign currency translation. Receivables turned at a rate of 22 times a year.","Capital expenditures came in at $221 million for the year versus $220 million last year and a bit less than our forecast due to timing differences and they represented 5% of sales. More than half of the spending went towards store openings, renovations and relocations. Investments in information technology is another major area and spending will increase this year and next as we upgrade and introduce new systems for global customer relationship management and for more advanced order and inventory management, all of which should yield longer-term sales and working capital benefits.","Adding it all up, Tiffany had free cash flow which we define as cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures, compared with last year's $109 million in ['12]. However in the fourth quarter, we made a payment to Swatch of $473 million for the adverse arbitration ruling. We expect to generate at least $400 million of free cash flow in 2014.","As a result of strong earnings growth and favorable working capital management, offset by the one-time arbitration payment, we finished the year with $367 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments versus $506 million a year ago.","Total short-term and long-term debt of $1 billion at year end was about $40 million above the $959 million a year ago. Total debt as a percentage of stockholders' equity was 37% at year end, unchanged from the year ago. In addition, we announced in a separate news release this morning that we have been authorized to resume share repurchases in 2014.","Tiffany's board approved a new program and authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of stock over the next three years. Based on our long-term outlook for earnings and cash flow, we think that this is an appropriate way to return a portion of the excess capital to stockholders while also mitigating dilution on earnings per share in stock based compensation.","Let's now turn to our outlook for 2014, which will be a year of exciting expansion and investing. My references to comparisons to 2013 will exclude the effect of the arbitration award in 2013's fourth quarter, as well as other specific charges recorded in 2013's first quarter.","We have a lot going on with the addition of new jewelry collections, the opening of some major new stores, incremental spending on IT systems and compelling marketing. In total, we are projecting net earnings to increase 9% to 11% to a range of $4.05 to $4.15 per diluted share. This compares with non-GAAP $3.73 per diluted share that Tiffany earned in 2013.","Looking at the components of the earnings guidance, we are projecting net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage in both, dollars and on a constant exchange rate basis, with total sales and comparable store sales growth in all regions. We finished last year with 289 company-operated stores in 24 countries and reflecting our ongoing strategy of opportunistic store expansion, we expect to open 13 new stores in 2014 and close four.","New store plans include opening four stores in the Americas, including three new stores in the U.S, in Aventura, Florida, in Miami Design District and on Boston's Newbury Street, closing our store in East Hampton and opening our 11th store in Mexico in Cancun, opening five stores in Asia Pacific, including three in China, one in Australia, in Adelaide and our first in Thailand and closing one store in Taiwan. Opening two stores in Japan and closing one existing store, opening a major store in Europe on the famous Champs-Elysee in Paris and in the emerging markets opening Tiffany's first company-operated store in Russia in Moscow and closing a small store in Dubai.","We will, of course, also be renovating a number of older stores to enhanced visual merchandising and the in-store customer experience. We are projecting an increase in our operating margin tied to a higher gross margin and SG&A expense leverage. The forecasted gross margin improvement is based on sales leverage on fixed costs as well as taking on average a single-digit percentage price increase in this first quarter and some residual benefit from lower input costs.","We are also expecting some improvement in the SG&A expense ratio this year coming from sales leverage on fixed cost. We are projecting interest and other expenses net at $65 million to $70 million in 2014, with the increase over 2013, essentially reflected in the interest cost on higher average debt levels. We are estimating an effective income tax rate of approximately 35% in 2014, which is virtually unchanged from the adjusted 34.8% rate in 2013.","In summary, Tiffany enjoyed a solid year of sales and earnings growth and we believe company is well positioned for continued success throughout 2014. We hope that you share our excitement about Tiffany's many growth opportunities.","On a final note, I presume you saw the announcement two days ago that Tiffany has hired Mr. Ralph Nicoletti as an Executive Vice President and to serve as the company's next Chief Financial Officer. Ralph brings solid experience to Tiffany and a valuable global perspective and I'm sure that Mark will be introducing Ralph to many of you.","I believe we put together a strong global management team to lead the company to even greater success in the future. I'm especially proud of the world-class finance, IT, operations and supply chain organization that we built, and has decided that after an exciting 30-year career at Tiffany, this is a good time for me to retire at the end of July.","I truly enjoyed my relationships with many of you on Wall Street and have appreciated your interest in Tiffany. You can be sure that I will be following Tiffany's progress and its stock price and I wish all of you the best.","Now, I will turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thank, Jim.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; and Michael Kowalski, Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Mark Erceg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","At this time, I like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you, Jennifer. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call. I am delighted that Tiffany's Chairman of the Board and Interim CEO, Mike Kowalski and our CFO, Mark Erceg, are on today\u2019s call. We will review actual results and comment on the 2017 outlook and then we will allow time to answer some questions. ","Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.","Okay. By now I hope you have had a chance to read today\u2019s news release which indicated fourth quarter and full year results that were in line with the guidance that we provided in January and reaffirmed last month. Worldwide net sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter and earnings per diluted share declined slightly. ","For the full year, worldwide net sales declined 3%, diluted EPS declined 1% on a GAAP basis, and 2% when excluding charges in both years and we managed our balance sheet effectively generating strong cash flow in the year.","So let us review the results starting with the top line. First there were no meaningful changes in regional sales mix in 2016 with the Americas representing 46% of worldwide sales; Asia Pacific at 25%; Japan at 15%; and Europe at 11%. ","In the Americas, total sales and comparable store sales declined both in the fourth quarter and the year as a result of lower jewelry units sold. In the US, we experienced softness across most of the countries for the year, although at lesser rates in some stores as the year progressed. In addition to the full year sales weakness in Canada was partly offset by growth in Latin America. We attributed a portion of the softness in the US throughout the year to local customers, which we believe was tied to macro-market and political uncertainties.","Sales attributed to foreign visitors declined in the full year, which we attribute to lower spending by Chinese visitors, but we believe total sales benefited in the second half of the year due to increased spending by Japanese tourists. We estimate that US sales in 2016 for foreign tourists remained at approximately 20%.","We have previously spoken about the impact of post-election activities near our New York Flagship Store, which represents less than 10% of worldwide sales. While we typically do not discuss individual store results, we are for at least this quarter reporting its sales results because of the unique situation and level of investor interest. Sales in the New York Flagship declined 11% in the full year and 7% in the entire fourth quarter versus a 14% decline in the November December holiday period due to some large transactions in January.","In addition, we estimate spending by foreign tourists in that store remained at roughly 40% of its annual sales. Elsewhere during 2016 we opened one store in Canada in the Holt Renfrew department store in Toronto, relocated our store in Holt Renfrew in Vancouver, and relocated our store in the King of Prussia Mall outside Philadelphia. Of course, we also continued to renovate many stores, highlighted by magnificent upgrades to our stores in Beverly Hills and San Francisco. ","Turning to Asia-Pacific, while total sales were roughly unchanged in the year we were pleased to see a healthy rate of growth in the second half and fourth quarter that was generated by increases in jewelry units sold. During the year, we were very pleased with strong total and comparable store sales growth in Mainland China as we believe the Tiffany & Co. brand continues to gain in recognition and prominence with customers.","I should add that lower spending that we attributed to Chinese tourists in other regions in 2016 may have led to some of the higher spending that we saw by local consumers within China. Also in the greater China market we were pleased to see smaller sequential sales declines in Hong Kong as the year progressed. However, there was noteworthy softness in much of the year in Australia and Taiwan.","We significantly enhanced our store presence in Asia Pacific in 2016. We opened seven stores, relocated two and closed three. In China, we opened three stores in Ningbo-Heyi, in Tianjin incense, and in Shenzhen-Mixc, and we closed two stores, one in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and one in the Tianjin Friendship Store. We finished the year with 31 stores in Mainland China.","In addition, we opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Gangnam Department Store. We opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland\u2019s magnificent Britomart precinct. And we opened two stores in Australia, one in the Gold Coast Pacific Fair and one in the Sydney Airport. And in Singapore, we relocated our store at Changi Airport and closed our store in Raffles Hotel.","In Japan, we achieved healthy retail sales growth in 2016 even excluding the favorable translation benefit from the stronger yen, and finished the year on a strong note. We were pleased to have an increase in jewelry units sold in the fourth quarter and full year in Japan that spanned most categories.","Anecdotally, we believe our already strong presence in Japan further benefited from the brand exposure we received on a popular television show called [for the romantic], which aired in the July-September time frame. In addition, we believe that the stronger yen has been a factor contributing to the increased purchasing attributed to Japanese tourists that we have experienced in other regions.","Conversely that stronger yen has likely been the reason for lesser tourist spending in Japan primarily attributed to Chinese visitors, which reversed the trend we saw in 2015. However, we believe our sales in Japan are made largely by Japanese customers and we continue to estimate that spending by foreign tourists represented less than 10% of sales in Japan. Lastly in Japan we had a net reduction of one store in 2016 as we closed the store in the [Indiscernible], while we relocated two stores during the year in Nagoya and Kagoshima. ","Conversely it was a challenging year a Europe. Total sales declined on a reported basis in the fourth quarter and full year, partly reflecting weakening European currencies. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined to a lesser extent in the year and actually rose slightly in the fourth quarter. The sales weakness arose largely from lower jewelry unit volume across all categories.","Throughout the year, we experienced varying degrees of soft demand partly attributed to local customers that we believe is the result of economic and political condition, and also attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists likely tied to the effects of the tragic events in Paris and elsewhere. ","We estimate that spending attributed to foreign tourists generally represents in the neighborhood of one quarter to one third of total European sales. In both the fourth quarter and the full year results were soft across much of continental Europe, while sales on a constant exchange rate basis in the UK, which represents roughly 40% of European sales \u2013 sales rose in the UK, which represents about 40% of European sales.","In fact we believe the sales lift that we saw in the UK in the second half of the year was from spending attributed to foreign tourists after the British pound declined following the Brexit vote. Built three stores in Europe in 2016, including two in Italy on Rome\u2019s Via dei Condotti and in Venice, and a second store in Amsterdam in the De Bijenkorf department store, and we closed a small store in the Frankfurt Airport.","I commented several times on the significance of spending attributed to foreign tourists in most regions. In general, tourism flows from one region to another maybe affected by changes in currency values as well as geopolitical and other external factors. Therefore we believe that creating and reinforcing local and global brand recognition is most relevant to growing our business regardless of where we are spending money in the short-term.","Lastly, lower sales in our other segment in both the fourth quarter and full year resulted from comp store sales decline in our five stores in the United Arab Emirates. Also [store sales] increased in the full year, but were roughly unchanged in the fourth quarter.","In terms of store productivity, worldwide sales per gross square foot for company operated stores was $2700 in 2016 compared with $2900 in 2015 resulting from the 3% increase in worldwide gross square footage and the modest worldwide sales decline. ","By region, sales productivity in 2016 ranged from $3800 in Asia Pacific to $3700 in Japan to $2500 in Europe and to $2200 in the Americas. Keep in mind that these productivity levels are calculated in US dollars and therefore year-over-year differences also reflect foreign-currency changes.","Our strategies partly revolve around optimizing our worldwide store base through openings, relocations, renovations and closings. We expect this to result in increasing global square footage by approximately 2% a year for the foreseeable future. This initiative goes hand-in-hand with our strategy to more proactively reach customers to deliver a more engaging shopping experience, to deepen long-term relationships with customers and ultimately to increase the frequency of store business and the conversion rates.","Beyond the Tiffany & Co. we operate in 28 countries, we also serve customers through e-commerce enabled websites in 13 of those countries. Worldwide e-commerce sales were approximately unchanged in the year, and continued to represent 6% of Tiffany's worldwide sales, but were somewhat a higher percentage in the US alone.","As we have said many times, our website serve an important dual function of generating online sales but also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. That covers regional sales results. ","Looking at the products side, from a sales perspective trends indicate a general softness across all jewelry categories to varying degrees. Despite that there were some noteworthy product related highlights in 2016. During the year, we introduced some new designs, refreshed some existing collection and importantly have said that we intend to accelerate the pace of doing this going forward. ","A relative improvement that we have seen in fashion jewelry sales can be attributed to higher gold jewelry sales, exemplified by the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs. ","We also saw relative improvement in fashion silver jewelry in 2016 led by the popularity of the new Return to Tiffany Love collection with silver jewelry sales approaching stabilization after years of decline. We focused on product newness in silver jewelry in 2016 and grew the number of new items under $500 by more than 10%.","I should also mention success in our designer jewelry category, which we are now disclosing on its own. Driven by Elsa Peritti\u2019s jewelry collection, highlighted in 2016 by her exquisite Diamonds by the Yard and the Open Heart design, and the designs of Paloma Picasso, highlighted by her popular olive leaf, and her New Paloma's Melody collection.","The engagement jewelry and wedding bands category posted mixed sales performance by region during the year, although we were pleased to see unit volume growth in the quarter and the full year on a worldwide basis. Relatively speaking [Indiscernible] this product activity was high, fine and solitary jewelry.","We continue to be pleased with the success of our Victoria collections in platinum and diamond. However there was some softness at the highest end in this category. We had held our Blue Book event this spring attended by global audience as we do every year and the results while strong did not measure up to the huge success of those events in the prior two years. You should note that the term high jewelry now replaces the former term statement jewelry.","Lastly, I will just mention that we continue to see healthy sales growth in the watch category in 2016. While watch sales have grown albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, we see considerable opportunity over the longer term to expand that business through a combination of product developments and marketing medication.","That covers the top line review. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg.","Mark Erceg","Thanks, Mark, and welcome everyone. Let me start by stating that while fourth quarter and full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share both were in line with our expectations, Tiffany's financial performance over the past couple of years has been disappointing, which is why I am so pleased to be working with Mike Kowalski, the board and all of Tiffany's dedicated and talented employees to accelerate the execution of our key strategies in the years ahead.","One of those strategies is expanding our e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities, which require us to upgrade certain IT systems. So I want to briefly comment on the $25.4 million impairment of capitalized software development costs we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Simply put, as part of a comprehensive system review we identified a solution which negated the need to install a separate inventory management and merchandising system, which work had already begun on.","By further leveraging our existing ERP system and the order management system we are in the process of implementing, we expect to be able to access the full range of capabilities we are originally seeking but at a lower cost. ","This project, now that it has been [recast] along with the rest of the investments we are making in information systems will we believe make our supply-chain more efficient, improve the customers\u2019 in-store experience and generate incremental sales by expanding and leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities.","Let us now look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 64.1%, which was up 110 basis points versus a year ago. In fact gross margin increased year-over-year in every quarter as we benefited from favorable product input costs, 2015 pricing actions, which carried over into 2016 and a favorable shift in product sales mix.","For the full year gross margin was 62.2% versus 60.7% last year, but unfortunately the 150 basis points of gross margin expansion generated during 2016 was more than offset by increases in SG&A expense.","SG&A expense as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was 43.2%, up 170 basis points versus year ago and for the year was 44.2%, which was up 200 basis points. The increases in SG&A expense as a percent of sales reflected sales deleveraging due to higher store occupancy and depreciation costs as well as higher labor and incentive compensation costs. Lowering the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales remains a top priority for the company going forward. ","Marketing spending as a percent of sales was roughly unchanged from the prior year. We continue to broaden Tiffany's presence in a variety of media, and as an example appeared on television in February with our first Super Bowl commercial. A 60-second ad, which ran in 10 key markets, featured Lady Gaga in order to set the stage for our new HardWear jewelry collection, which is launching next month.","Net interest and other expenses in the fourth quarter and for the full year were below prior year due to both reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense. Tiffany's full year effective tax rate was 34.1%, which was down from last year\u2019s rate of 34.7% due to the favorable impact from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow, we finished the year with reasonable debt levels and generated strong cash flow, both of which gives us the ability to continue investing in our business while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Inventory finished the year 3% below year ago at $2.2 billion.","Accounts receivable at January 31st were 10% higher than the previous year end with the increase partly tied to the timing of collections driven by sales growth in Japan since the majority of our stores in that market are operated within department stores. A portion of the increase was also currency related.","Capital expenditures for the year came in at $223 million with more than half of the spending related to the opening, renovation and\/or relocation of stores. Capex represented approximately 6% of worldwide sales during both 2016 and 2015. It is also worth pointing out that we made an unplanned and voluntary contribution of $120 million to Tiffany's US pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect this to lower our 2017 pension expense as a result of incremental returns expected to be generated on the investments made with that contribution and lower premiums owed to the PBGC.","Putting it all together we generated $702 million of operating cash flow and $479 million of free cash flow in 2016 after giving effect to the $120 million voluntary pension contribution. Importantly this was well above our initial goal of generating at least $400 million of free cash flow for the year.","In terms of share repurchases, we spent $184 million and bought more than 2 million shares in 2016. Turning to dividends, we increased the quarterly dividend by 12.5% in May, which marked the 15th dividend increase in the past 14 years.","We finished fiscal 2016 with $986 million of cash and short-term investments versus $1.1 billion short-term and long-term debt. So total debt represented just 37% of stockholders equity, which was unchanged from the prior year. Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and return on stock orders equity was 15%, both of which are generally consistent with our long-term objectives, which call for a return on assets of at least 10% and a return on equity of at least 15%.","Looking into 2017, our financial expectations recognize two important external challenges. First, we remain mindful of economic and geopolitical uncertainties and their potential effects on both local and foreign tourist spending. Second, since over half our sales continue to be outside the United States and we expect the US dollar to be stronger on average than the prior year, we should be facing a sizable headwind in terms of translating our non-US sales into dollars.","In addition, we will have to overcome the negative effect a stronger dollar may have on foreign tourist spending in the United States. Of course, we do openly acknowledge that we will partly benefit from the translation effect of non-US expenses into dollars but that positive impact is expected to be relatively minor compared to the two foreign exchange headwinds I just mentioned.","We plan to open 11 stores in 2017, half in Asia Pacific, relocate 9 and close 6, representing a net 3% increase in global square footage. As part of our strategy to optimize the global store base we also continue to renovate some of our existing stores.","With this in mind we expect total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year, which importantly translates into a mid single-digit increase over the prior year on a constant exchange rate basis.","Moving further into the P&L our 2017 outlook assumes an increase in operating margin entirely due to an increase in gross margin with SG&A expense growth just slightly higher than sales growth. The assumption of higher gross margins tied to favorable product input cost and proactive expense management.","In addition, [F&F] taking any meaningful price increases in 2016 expect for currency changes we took modest price increases in the past month that varied by country but averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. Our 2017 outlook further assumes interest in other expenses net of approximately $40 million and effective tax rate consistent with the prior year and that we continue buying shares under our existing share repurchase program. Although we expect minimal benefits to diluted earnings per share from the current planned repurchases.","Taking all this into account our outlook calls for net earnings per diluted share to increase by a high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis. And to increase by a mid single-digit percentage over the adjusted $3.75 per share last year. We also plan to manage the balance sheet efficiently but a particular focus on not growing that inventories. In order to generate net cash from operating activities approximately $700 million and free cash flow approximately $450 million for the full year. The difference of $250 million represents our planned capital expenditures.","I am now pleased to turn the call over to Michael Kowalski for some brief comments before we open the call to your questions.","Michael Kowalski","Thank you gentleman for providing everyone with a thorough of understanding of Tiffany's performance in 2016. I just wanted to address few matters and then we will be happy to take your questions. First we began an external search in early February to fill the role of Chief Executive Officer when Fredric Cumenal stepped down from that position in order to become interim CEO. We assume that it may take time to find the right person with broad experience and broad management with the global perspective and who possess the strong leadership skills to motivate and inspire our Tiffany's colleagues around the world.","Second although Tiffany luxury industry faced numerous challenges in 2016 we have not been pleased with our financial performance. While we were able to realize important improvement in gross margin and generate a healthy level of free cash flow sales results were disappointing. And we were unable to generate sales leverage on our fixed costs.","Third and most importantly we believe that Tiffany has a set of powerful strategies that can propel our business forward in the long term. With the right leadership and pace of execution we believe there are substantial opportunities to grow our business. Specifically we are focused on increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovations and we recently announced the hiring of Reed Krakoff as Chief Artistic Officer. We are also focused on maximizing our marketing effectiveness and building stronger relationships with customers. Optimizing our store network and improving our business operations and processes all well effectively managing our capital and costs.","And we remain absolutely committed to our industry leading effort around corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability an area of great importance and relevant to us and we believe to our customers as well. In essence we are committed to executing with excellence the strategies that are within our control and pursuing long term growth opportunities.","This May 5, will mark the 30th anniversary of Tiffany's initial public offering in 1987. Since then our company has generally produced strong returns for shareholders. And we intend to pursue opportunities that could continue to generate attractive total shareholder return in the future.","In my role as Interim CEO I have been actively engaged with the management team and employees across our business and I have no doubt that my colleague at all level share an extra ordinary sense of dedication and passion for our company. I truly appreciate their efforts. And all of you on this call I appreciate your ongoing interest in Tiffany's progress.","And now I would be happy to answer some of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We will go first to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning this is Warren Chang on line for Omar. I just had a question on accelerating the pace of newness so at the Investor Day last year you discussed some ways that you are speeding up the processes of both product design and also the supply chain and bring product to market more quickly. What part of these assortment are turning faster than they were year ago and what's changed in terms of your structural capabilities to deliver on frequency and freshness?","Michael Kowalski","Certainly, this is Mike. Certainly the portion of the product assortment in which we delivered new greater newness at a greater pace is in fashion product. And I think we have seen the sales result to the extent the fashion has grown faster so we certainly continue our emphasis on that segment of the assortment. We have also had increase success with sales under the $500 price point and once again as we indicated on the call we have stabilized that segment and we hope to grow it. We have put \u2013 we have begun to put into place many of the innovations that we spoke of earlier to bring product to market. It's still relatively early stages but we are seeing progress and speed of bringing product and the efficiency with which we do it and then of course most importantly the arrival of Reed several weeks ago we believe will be yet another way to increase the pace of newness new product introduction. So at this point we are feeling good about 2017 and beyond.","Mark Erceg","We are also very pleased with the progress we are making in our jewelry search design center and we expect to have that fully online by the end of this fiscal year.","Michael Kowalski","We are definitely adding more resources in the whole product development, design and development area and you will see it play-out over the course of the next year.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Good luck this year.","Mark Aaron","Next question.","Operator","We will go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you good morning. When you talk about increasing the pace of newness how should we be tracking that is it a number of new collections, number of products and then will Reed\u2019s impact these sales by holiday? Will you be able to get some product in the stores by then?","Michael Kowalski","Yes. Absolutely. It might begin \u2013 certainly there is a number of individual new products and collections in work. You will certainly see some of Reed\u2019s impact in holiday specifically you will see luxury collection accessories which are very, very exciting and non-jewelry collection you will see that on and around November. But I think you will manifest you will see the new product the pace of new product introduction manifest itself both ways both in individual new products, importing new collections or categories like luxury accessories. You will of course see important watch introduction in the second half of the year and obviously jewelry collections.","Mark Erceg","And Lorraine as we have historically said new jewelry designs in any one year represent less than 10% of our sales in that year the objective is ultimately to raise that to more than 10%.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Mark Erceg","Jenifer next question.","Operator","We will go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. We had a longer term question in relation to supply chain. What are your thoughts regarding capacity utilization and how in your philosophy regarding vertical integration and the opportunities you see and as that relates to what you have been on a really good journey with the networking capital management and as we another topic was IT, I was just curious from a consumer facing perspective what features are you looking forward to having in terms of what consumers are demanding and what capabilities will be different in terms of what you are looking for over the next few years? Thank you.","Michael Kowalski","Thanks for the question. I will try and answer it in the order in which it was presented. So with respect to supply chain you\u2019re right we are very pleased with the vertically integrated nature of our supply chain. It does a number of things for us which is control the quality of the offering, which is control the pace and the speed of innovation which we are going to be accelerating ramping up even further with it towards research design center which will allows us to fast prototyping and also allow us to get really tight on the design specs so we can do a lot of design cost element thing work right up front which we are very pleased by.","We have been looking at ways for us to maximize the efficiency of the team that we have in all areas and we have been doing a lot of additional training which is allowing us to cross views of the capacity that we do have within our internal system more efficiently and more effectively each and every year. So we are very pleased with what we are seeing on the supply chain side. With respect to IT it's an area of clear focus for us. We have been investing a lot behind it. We are confident that we are going to bringing forward a lot of additional capabilities that the consumers are going to be the direct beneficiary of as far as what we are focusing on right now. A lot of it has to do with client selling and I mean a lot of it has to do with our digital capabilities and the shopping experience more seamless for the customers all around the world.","Oliver Chen","Thank you and the question, we had a quick question Lady Gaga was an exciting kind of aspect of the brand. From a newness perspective what do you thinking about, how you are thinking about customers in terms of what you want to target, what's the opportunity and thinking about self purchasing versus gifting as you make \u2013 as you drive a lot of innovation in your portfolio and marketing?","Mark Erceg","Oliver, well I think certainly it's true that self purchase and gifting must move forward together self purchase greater degrees of self purchase have always been part of and has been an objective of this company for many, many years and I think to the extent that we are seeing relative strength in our fashion collections and individual fashion items that we are making progress and we will continue to make that a focus and at the same time our investment in luxury collection, luxury accessories and the gifting component of that also is critically important. We think that's terribly important because it's necessary to drive traffic into our store so we intend to move forward on all those fronts.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Mark Erceg","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer & Co Inc.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, the first question I have this with respect to guidance. There is an initial guidance that you put out for 2017 if I look at those middle figures particular at the top line number it does assume a better trend that we have seen recently at the chain and we have talked a lot of in prepared comments in response to some of the questions about newness. But how should we think about the drivers of that improved top line are there key factors that sort of say realize upon and then the second question is that how did the cadence of sales through the year. You expect better sales later in the year or should be relatively spread out through the year? Thank you.","Mark Erceg","Brian it's Mark. We are not talking about the cadence throughout the year, no quarterly guidance. So you will have to make your own assumptions on that. But clearly, with all of the initiatives that are happening here in terms of better engaging customers and here we are talking about product development and here we are talking about exciting innovations and marketing communication we have to make some assumptions and we think with all of these things happening we ought to be able to perform little bit better than we did in 2016.","Michael Kowalski","And let me just add returning here five or so weeks ago I have been terribly pressed by the number of initiatives again they are in various stages of development but there is an awful lot going on around here in terms of improving the store experience the Tiffany Touch customer service program that are gold setting in measurement around the Tiffany experience index which measures client's satisfaction. There is an awful lot happening and of course as we have spoken now with some length new pace of product introduction so I think we are reasonably confident that the goals that we have set in terms of sales and in 2017 are in fact achievable.","Brian Nagel","Got it. Thank you. In fact, one follow-up with one question. Thank you for that. With respect to it is obviously more focus on the U.S. business, domestic business but there is a lot of chatter out there within retail about the impact of declining mall traffic and recognizing Tiffany's located in the better malls but nonetheless is declining mall traffic at all something that's affecting the Tiffany business?","Mark Erceg","Yes I mean one of the reasons that of course it is we are certainly not immune to that and as we have said earlier one of the reasons that we are excited about the luxury accessories collection, the gift collection because it's designed very specifically to drive traffic in Tiffany store. The business that we walked away from slowly but consistently over the past ten years. And we think it's time to put that back. So we think that that can help traffic and finally again improvements in the store experience itself we are not immune to the decline in store traffic, but we think we have to do something about it on an individual store basis whatever maybe happening in the mall.","Michael Kowalski","We are also working proactively to make sure that Tiffany is relevant and acceptable wherever shoppers happen to be. So our true ship initiative is example way for us to make sure that we are evolving with the current times.","Brian Nagel","Well thank you very much. Best of luck for the year ahead.","Mark Erceg","Jenifer next question.","Operator","We will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good morning everyone. One just one quick one for me first and then I will follow-up. The timing of Chinese New Year help your January accelerated from your holiday did timing of Chinese New Year helped at all with that potentially impact your first quarter?","Michael Kowalski","Yes I mean the shift did have some to January. It happened in the first quarter but clearly if we had some benefit in late January it worked the other way in the early February.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Okay. Great and Mark I wanted to ask just now that you have been saw a little bit of timing I had a chance to really think deeply about you have talked about wanting to help improve efficiency with the business. Could you talk about some of the specific initiatives I know you talked a bit about this new order management systems but anything else as you think about strategies for 2017 and how can you improve the inventory efficiency or optimize the cost structure that would be helpful? Thank you.","Mark Erceg","Thank you very much for the question. I mean as with Mike, he made the comment and he was very pleased to see the enormous number of initiative that were being auctioned when he kind of parachuted back in I will tell you that there was a lot of things being done in a lot of good regards by a lot of really accounted people, which I am going to now in your partial beneficiary along with the shareholders that are out there and those of you on the call today.","A lot of this is just basic locking enactment we have a global procurement group that's relatively early in its formation which is doing extremely good. We must get our arms around those global spend pools, we are able to negotiate harder and better with more visibility and with more impact. That's the key initiative I have mentioned earlier that newer research design center I don't want to overplay but I want to -- either being able to do fast prototyping on the ideas that Reed and his team are generating is going to put us well down the path of being able to design for efficiency in all of our internal production processes and frankly the loss allows for those items that we do choose to put out to external bid with tighter in that process as well. Clearly the systems that we have available to us today are going to be optimized in the years ahead and that's going to allow us do better assortment planning and with better assortment planning we will able to do more high level analytic that go along with that we will be able to get pricing in a lot more discrete ways we are going to be able to make sure that in each store we have the right product at the right time or is as much as practical versus what we have today in several pretty exciting initiatives all year marked in that regard.","The plant structure as I indicated earlier is also doing a lot of really good work to cross train so that we have the ability to do multiple operations at multiple sites and that's allowing us to extract a lot more value and we are starting to play with some different technologies as well which we think over time will lead to some additional productivity gain. So there is a broad based basket of things that we are aggressively pursuing and I am confident that we are going to be able to affect our cost structures in a favorable way which allow us few additional money into other investment areas going forward.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","On the inventory side, I know for many years where Tiffany was lengthening out its inventory \u2013 its diamond inventory in order to safeguard against the shortage and supply and obviously diamond markets are little bit different today than back then. Is there an opportunity to extract more efficiency out of your diamond inventories by taking a less conservative approach to new guide inventory on hand?","Michael Kowalski","Short answer is yes and that's something we are actively engaged in as well. We are trying to make sure that we are getting the right collection of rough stones and then being able to quickly and efficiently process those is obviously an area of focus for us.","Mark Erceg","Yes I mean that's building up as a diamond supply chain was a ten year process and we are done. We are maxed out now there is an opportunities to identify ways to improve it.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael Kowalski","Jenifer next question.","Operator","We will go next to Robert Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul","Hi and good morning. Mike welcome back.","Michael Kowalski","Thank you Bob.","Robert Drbul","I guess the question I have is can you comment a little bit about January flagship stores changed in January. And your assumptions in the 2017 around the flagship store?","Mark Erceg","Bob it's Mark. I will just mention in January the flagship store technically did very well. But that was really driven by couple of very large one off transaction. So we are not going to read too much into that but technically that's why you saw the flagship store down by considerably smaller amount in the fourth quarter versus what it had been in holiday period. And with the plan someone cautiously to the New York flagship store for 2017 but we are not going to share our assumptions with online store. And obviously we [indiscernible] service NYPD to maximize access to minimize the disruptions but it is large and beyond under our controls but we will do what we can. We also have obviously other stores here in the city which we can we will better utilize it as the year progresses. Yes.","Robert Drbul","Okay and I guess my second question would be when you look at the comp leverage point in the business overall do you see an opportunity to bring that down over the longer term from where we are right now?","Mark Erceg","I think you heard us say that with respect to SG&A in 2017, the SG&A growth as a percentage of sales will just be slightly ahead of our sales forecast. So that's something that we are very mindful of and it's something that we are going to be working hard in order to begin to make sure that we can fund all these investments areas that we think will really accelerate the top line for us. So we are definitely moving in that direction Bob again to find what we can resume getting leverage on SG&A.","Robert Drbul","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck. ","Michael Kowalski","Thanks Bob. Next question?","Operator","We will go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning everyone. Nice to hear the progress that you have been making so far on the product side and it also sounds like there is progress on the gross margin side. If you look at the opportunities going forward, what do you see for product import cost product input cost and also on the marketing spend and also Mike since you\u2019ve been back what's the biggest difference from when you left the operational role? Thank you.","Michael Kowalski","Real quickly on the input side what I would tell you is that we have been in a relatively favorable environment as it relates to both metal prices as well as rough and polished diamonds. We except that to continue through at least 2017 time horizon relatively long supply chain on rough and polished. So a lot of the cost visibility that we have in the 2017 is basically pretty tight and worn out by things that already come to past so to speak. And then with respect to our metals we tend to go out forward and lock in our metal pricing as well. So we are pretty confident about the gross margin plot that we spoke to in the context of our 2017 guidance.","Mark Erceg","And Dana in terms of what's changed again is I said a moment ago and as Mark indicated when he arrived few months ago. I think I am not surprised by it but certainly impressed by the number of initiatives underway both in terms of improved customers service the work that it's been doing around inventory productivity and efficiency and IT development and I think most importantly what hasn't changed is that this culture remains very strong and resilient and everyone at Tiffany despite the obvious challenges in terms of the changes continues to be passionate about the brand and confident in our future, Tiffany most certainly is one of the world's great luxury brand. It's not broken and everyone here is simply committed to making it greater so I feel really good.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Michael Kowalski","Thanks Dana.","Operator","We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The investment of [indiscernible] in cost savings budget in 2018 I think of which $30 million was close to P&L can you tell us how much closely in 2016, how much should we anticipate for 2017 and finally are there any opportunities to increase that $50 million target beyond 17?","Mark Erceg","Hi Laurent, it\u2019s Mark. In answer to the first part of your question we are definitely moving in that direction through savings that we already achieved in global procurement and savings that are anticipated we are not going to get more granular than that in terms of exactly how much it was in 2016 it will be 2017 but we are definitely hitting that target that we specified for 2018. And then the opportunities for cost savings beyond that I turn it to the other Mark here, but I think the answer is going to be we are always going to be looking for opportunities to run the business more profitability more efficiently.","Mark Aaron","I completely agree. And as I mentioned little while back the global procurement initiative is still in its early days. And we are finding enormous benefit from the work that's being done in that area and it's now starting to go into a lot of other areas of the business with respect to store design, case lines, lighting, we are finding enormous opportunities in all those areas. And we are very confident that as Mark said we will be able to achieve the target levels savings that we laid out by the indicated days not sooner.","Michael Kowalski","But Laurent, I will just add, ultimately we need better sales growth. I think that's the obvious. And if all of these initiatives we are pursuing generate better sales growth combined with what we are working on our expense side that's what will give us a return to good operating margin improvement.","Laurent Vasilescu ","Okay. Thank you. And as a quick follow-up your e-commerce sales have been relatively flat over the last two years are there opportunities for to get the double-digit percentage of sales and any update on that partnership would be appreciated?","Michael Kowalski","To say in terms of [indiscernible] we have been very pleased for the relationship with them and it's certainly -- but it's certainly possible that 6% of sales could gradually move up close to 8% or 10% and it\u2019s beyond some customers certainly opt more for shopping online and they will use our website more but everything is going to be a very large number because it's not the nature of our business.","Mark Erceg","Luxury accessories revamp that we are underway which that will lend itself we think to more e-commerce transaction in nature.","Michael Kowalski","Yes I think it's that critically important point that the disappoint sales growth in e-commerce over the year I think more than any years, recent years more than anything else is a function of merchandising assortment and the fact that we have not had growth in lower price point jewelry and of course there has been an absence of gifts. Those are gifts are being put back active product development in so in jewelry under $500 and that's going to have that should have an important impact on our ability to grow e-commerce sales because those are that's the heart of that business.","Laurent Vasilescu ","Thank you. And best of luck.","Michael Kowalski","Jenifer next question.","Operator","We will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley & Co.","Kimberly Greenberger","Thank you so much. Good morning. I am wondering if you can go through some of the revenue growth drivers that you have got in place, I know there are lot of macro factors impacting Tiffany's sales growth but knowing that there are certain aspects of sales growth that are in your control I think you have got a number of different strategies in place I think one would be the pace of innovation, you mentioned some development of additional service metrics in the stores. Could you just maybe take through the two or three or four or five different revenue growth strategies that you have got inflation and \u2013","Michael Kowalski","We have already touched on a few that are critically important so let me just add certainly enhanced client telling effort that are going to be informed by our new CSR systems something somewhat operational but it will have an impact on sales. It would be more intelligent client focused staffing programs in all of our stores where we are working very hard to improve the store experience built around better assortment and create a visual merchandising. Again, I think you referenced, I referenced also the Tiffany Touch customer service program I think so much of the effort around in addition to obvious new product development pace of new product development really is going to be built around enhancing all the attention of the customers in store experience.","Mark Erceg","As Mike said I am sorry CRM bias.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you very much.","Michael Kowalski","Thanks Kimberly.","Operator","We will next to Betty Chen with Mizuho Securities.","Betty Chen","Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about [indiscernible] things like you saw unit growth there in 2016 for the quarter also it sounds like Hong Kong may have seen some sequential improvement maybe if you can share your thoughts with us on that region and also longer term any updates on how you read the Mainland China opportunity and any learning from some of the initial folly on how to maybe accelerate some of that growth? Thanks.","Michael Kowalski","Let me start with last part of your question because it's the easiest. We certainly see the Mainland if I can use that term Mainland China opportunity as continuing to be very, very significant and again the brand is still in its early relatively early stages of development in that market we have good awareness but lots of opportunity to improve lots of opportunities to optimize the store network. So I think we are as optimistic as we have ever been about the opportunities in Greater China.","Mark Erceg","Yes and in terms of your question about unit growth, jewelry unit volume growth in Asia-Pacific during the year part of it was just core better growth but a lot of it was due to fact that we opened the new stores. So that unit growth is not on comp store basis. Not a total region basis, total sales basis but nonetheless we were pleased with it and then in terms of Hong Kong as everyone knows Hong Kong really softened almost two and half years ago started in October 2014 but finally in 2016 we started to see some improvement. Still down but certainly getting less bad from quarter to quarter and what point it will completely bottom out and start growing is anybody's guess but we certainly think that's the worst part is probably behind us and we are getting closer to stabilization there. ","Betty Chen","Okay. My second question is if I could, in the last year I think you mentioned a lot of units under 500, I think maybe up 10% or so any sort of material increase in 2017 or 2018 that we should think about for that category especially since it\u2019s an important area for not only inflow but also online as well? Thanks.","Michael Kowalski","Well, we will be there in across all categories for 2017 and 2018. There will be newness in silver, gold, platinum, diamonds so we are not going to get too technical in terms of how we are dividing up our newness by category or by material but they will certainly be newness in silver just as there will be across every category.","Betty Chen","Great, thanks, best of luck.","Michael Kowalski","Thank you. Jenifer next question.","Operator","We will go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura Global Research.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks good morning. Mark, it seems like the loan impairment this quarter went beyond the liquidity loan if that's right is there anything we should think about regarding further potential financing impairment and then just maybe taking a step back falling up on the supply chain commentary, maybe it's still early but as you have looked through the operations you have been referring to the aspects of the integration that you\u2019re pleased with anything you call out as parts of the process you might want to image the opportunity and changing? Thanks.","Mark Erceg","Two good questions. So with respect to the loans that we had previously made in order to be able to access supply the good news is that that has all largely packed at this point we have one loan as outstanding as a performing loan. After this quarter it may be couple of million dollars and as I said it's a performing loan that should be all that remains with us so what we think is we have a processed through all of that.","With respect to your other question I don't want to evade because it's a fair question but I think for me there is just abundance of opportunities that is across. So a lot of work has been done a lot of really good work has been done but that said and despite the fact it's a 180 year old company there is still enormous opportunities going forward that we have the ability to access. So maybe one thing I would offer is the state of the IT systems because the company is rapid growth days there is an opportunities for now that we ability the ability to stitch that together in seamless way and that's going to give us a lot of additional capabilities going forward. So, maybe one thing is I would have thought that maybe there is little bit more of evolved IT infrastructure and related to the financial cue but there is only addressed and we are going to get after in short order and again I don't speak from an opportunities.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks, best luck for the year.","Michael Kowalski","Jenifer, next question.","Operator","We will go next to Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","Good morning everyone. Welcome back Mike. ","Michael Kowalski","Hey Janet, thank you.","Janet Kloppenburg","I wanted to just ask the question about the mix of the business, it sounds like the silver business is stabilizing and the fashion silver business is improving. And I am wondering if encourage Mike that that mix can contain to be favorable and that you are a turning point in the fashion silver business?","And for Mark I was wondering how influential that would be to the gross margin as we look into fiscal 17 and whether or not you think, you will be able to generate the same level of gross margin improvement in 17 as was seen in 16. And just lastly Mike or Mark whoever on marketing the legendary marketing campaign launched in the fall. I was wondering if there is any way to discuss the effectiveness of that campaign and reaching the millennial customers how well was it resonated and if the program will move forward? Thank you.","Michael Kowalski","Let me try to answer the first question Janet around the overall going forward direction of product assortment, product categories as I think everyone on the call knows part of the magic of Tiffany over the very, very many years has been our ability to balance that those categories and to move forward with them all simultaneously critical to that has always been our ability to drive lower price point sales because of the very favorable margin profile that category. And once again as you have heard before we stabilized that segment.","We also feel very good about fashion segment, gold fashion part of the segment. And once again to the entire mix that also has favorable gross margin profile. So I think we are not finished certainly but right now we are feeling relatively good about the direction of category evolution and of course as we have said now many times on the phone we have the work in progress on watches which we are pleased with and of course the upcoming gift collection which also should be additive incremental to gross margin.","So on that score of product balance relative category growth going forward we are in a pretty good spot right now and what I would offer is at the end of the day when you ask questions about gross margin and things we are really focused on operating margin. We\u2019re trying to put together sustainable business model to get about this basis point in the operating line each and every year.","Certainly within our product offerings certain groupings within that have higher gross margins than others. Silver fashion is an example that said we enjoy pretty attractive gross margins in the absolute across all of our product offerings. And I don't want us to become articulated on gross margin as it relates to product mix because at the end of the day I am happy to sell an incremental item across any of our offerings because in the absolute they are very accretive and attractive to us. So product mix does play into it but I don't want to overplay the role of that in our overall business model.","Mark Erceg","And certainly we continue to try to drive sales at jewelry because again [indiscernible] are not as robust as they are another parts of the product spectrum on the margin they are just wonderful. So we have no problem. We have no problem in joining the success in those sorts of sales. And finally Janet last question about the millennial and the advertising campaign I don't know that always a difficult on answer, difficult to know questions but as some quantitative evidence I would simply point out that again there is the fashion categories where we enjoy the most relative success so I think that be at least directionally of some success in appealing to millennial.","Janet Kloppenburg","Thanks so much and good luck.","Michael Kowalski","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. ","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good morning. I guess for Mike, I was just curious about your new board members, your new investors what in your mind do you think the new board members bring to the table and maybe what could be the timing of their influence on strategy for the business? Thanks very much.","Michael Kowalski","Well certainly in terms of timing they are already at the table we had our first board meeting which was a very productive helpful meeting. Certainly the new directors collectively they bring a wealth of obviously a wealth of highly relevant experience and expertise whether it's consumer products luxury and life style products and obviously retailing. I don't think that as we said a couple of weeks ago we still, we feel very, very confident in the fundamental strategic direction of the company so I am not from my perspective not especially looking for a dramatic left or right turns in our strategies. I think they along with the entire board will help evolve our strategic direction and again we are confident that they will all contribute importantly to that.","Okay Jenifer another question.","Operator","We will go next to Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys good morning. It's Jen on for Paul. Two quick ones if I may. First wondering if you could talk a little bit about January comps improvements beyond the flagship what you saw kind of Americas and then Europe and Asia-Pacific where trends also improved versus holiday?","And then secondly, I think you said that we will start to see some of the luxury accessories in November I was wondering if we started to see some of that already and will start to see like more in November or if we should \u2013 if we won't see anything until November and gross margins on that categories should we think of them as being higher than some of the other categories? Thanks.","Mark Erceg","Well to say, it will be November for the introduction of the full non-jewelry luxury gift collection. March is attractive and in terms of January trends we did say that things were slightly better in the U.S. part of that just coming from the big transaction in the New York flagship store and we did already mentioned that we had some shift from the earlier Chinese New Year that benefited some business in Asia and so but we are not going to get more specific than that. So January came in a little bit better than we had expected. And we planned accordingly for 2017.","Paul Lejuez","Alright. Great. Thank and best of luck guys.","Michael Kowalski","Jenifer next question. ","Operator","We will go next to Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. ","Ike Boruchow","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow up into Asia-Pacific and any guiding explicitly for the reason but just kind of curious embedded in your outlook are you assuming that the declines I Hong Kong continue to improve a little bit and then I am just curious about how you view the changes in travel in terms of Korea and China and how that's changing and how that might impact other business on the Mainland?","Michael Kowalski","Yes, we are assuming that at some point business in Hong Kong will stabilize without getting more specific than that but we said it 2016 we saw it sequential getting better and we hope them that we can continue to see that 2017 certainly would be very nice at some point to talk about it flattening out, but not yet. In terms of Chinese Tours Travel and Korea [indiscernible] we will see it's a little bit early to make a comment and implications of that but again we are pretty comfortable in dealing with the dynamics of tourist movement around the world so we will see how that develop. We certainly got strong physician in Korea strong store day.","Ike Boruchow"," Got it, thank you.","Michael Kowalski","Maybe one or two questions and we will wrap it up. Jenifer?","Operator","We will go next Christian Buss with Credit Suisse Securities.","Christian Buss","Good morning. I am wondering if you could provide some perspective on your e-commerce business and how that's evolving on how that's trending in the percentage of sales and what combination if did she have for 2017 on that business?","Michael Kowalski","It's been 6% of worldwide sales for several years now. And I think it's important to put it in perspective relative to our global luxury peers 6% is probably about average for luxury peers and significantly larger than our luxury peers. Having said that we do believe that obviously we would like to restart growth but again I think the key is as I said before the key to that segment or to that distribution channel really is going to be about product innovation and development. So I think I will leave it at that. Yes.","Christian Buss","Thank you and best of luck.","Michael Kowalski","Thanks. Okay one more question.","Operator","We will go next to Randal Konik with Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Randal Konik","Thank you for taking my call. So couple of questions I guess one on the product newness factor here it talks about increasing the pace of newness kind of any further color on how you are thinking about that either from a skew count perspective or an actual category perspective because when I look historic about over the last 17 years or at least over the last time. You guys are doing great job when you announced Tiffany keys collection, the key marketing around the celebration rings so when you basically come out with the new categories it does very well and I am just trying to get a sense of how you are thinking about launching new collections and versus launching just additional excuse within existing collection and then lastly around skew counts do you think about increasing gross skew counts but basically leading net skew counts flat to increase skew count productivity. I am just trying to get a sense of how you think this all plays out from the product newness perspective? Very much appreciated.","Michael Kowalski","Correct. Well, let me say the obvious maybe we are not about two profligate the skew count so probably more or less your suggestion that combined with the pace of new product and productions and increased pace of new product, new collections reductions, new skew count probably will stay where it is and it might even continue to decline a bit. But the key will be building, growth is going to come from a combination of one new collections and if you look at the evolution of our assortment of the past ten years far more concentrated today in important collections than it was ten years ago in multiple smaller collection. So we want new collections but they have to be big and they need to be impactful of course Tiffany would one of the models going forward for that. At the same time we need to be mindful that existing collections return to Tiffany and return to Tiffany Love they have to be renewed and we have to continue to animate and increase and inject energy into those. So it's going to be as it always is a very careful balance of making sure that we have significant new collections that marketing can drive at the same time making sure that core collections that are still the majority that will always be the majority of sale continue to grow at the same time. So it's a complex balancing act.","Randal Konik","And can I add some follow up if possible with Reed, I think that\u2019s a great hire what are your expectations of him or what has he seen when you review the business on how you can better tie product launches to the store look and importantly the marketing cadence or the marketing look out there with the product on people etcetera. So how to see, what is your vision for him or what's his vision for the brand and how to tie it all together since he is more his role is kind of the in-charge of your multiple areas not just product?","Michael Kowalski","Yes I think, I will at this point I will decline to speak for Reed, he hasn't been here that long although tremendous he has bent for my perspective tremendous progress but I think what you said if I can just repeat because I think it is critically important for everyone on the call and in addition to product design Reed will lead the brands artistic and design vision with respect to stores to e-commerce to marketing to advertising right now he is heavily engaged and looking it at there is new store prototypes. So I think we are going to look to Reed for obviously a comprehensive integrated brand vision what that brand vision is going to be other than it's not going to be radical left or right turn from where we are I think it's going to be a continued evolution fine tuning of what we have but I think probably would be premature for us to speak about that today.","Mark Aaron","Right. I think we are going to wrap it up. I hope this has been helpful to all of you and have a great day. Thank you all. Jenifer let\u2019s wrap it up.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Aaron - Vice President of Investor Relations","Patrick F. McGuiness - Chief Financial officer and Senior Vice President","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Co. Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Patrick McGuiness, Tiffany's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark L. Aaron","Thank you for joining us today. Pat and I are going to review second quarter results on this call and also take the opportunity to update you on the full year outlook.","Before we continue, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now let's proceed with a review of Tiffany's performance. Looking at the big picture, these second quarter results were better than our expectations. Three months ago, we had forecast second quarter net earnings would be about equal to last year on mid-single digit sales growth and some lingering margin pressure. So what changed? The 4% total sales growth in the second quarter was in line with our expectation, and I should add that the increase was a stronger 8% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with solid growth in comparable store sales in all regions outside the Americas. On the upside, however, we were pleased to see a greater-than-expected improvement in gross margin, reflecting both diminishing product cost pressures and the price increases we've taken this year. And SG&A expenses were well controlled. So adding it up, the better margin performance helped produce 16% net earnings growth in the quarter, which now leads us to increase our annual earnings guidance. And during the quarter, we launched some exciting product designs, opened 3 new stores and finalized plans for some others, which I'll talk about shortly.","Let's now take a look at sales by region. Sales in the Americas increased 2% in the quarter to $444 million. Continuing the trend, sales growth was entirely due to an increase in average price per jewelry unit sold. A modest decline in jewelry units reflected softness in the moderate price point fashion jewelry category, which more than offset unit growth in higher-priced statement and fine jewelry.","Comp store sales in the Americas were equal to last year and in line with our expectation. Performance varied geographically, with growth in the New York flagship store sale, tied to both increased local and tourist demand, being offset by a slight decline in comparable brand store sales. And those brand store results were mixed by market, with no discernible pattern except for pronounced softness in Hawaii and Guam, reflecting a decline in Japanese tourist sales that we believe is attributed to the weaker yen.","Rounding out the Americas geographical review, sales were soft in Canada but we had reasonably good increases in Mexico and Brazil. Internet and catalog sales in the Americas mirrored store sales performance and we finished the quarter with 116 stores in the Americas, which included the opening of our 10th store in Mexico in Villahermosa.","Now let's look beyond the Americas to our other regions where results were quite good. In Asia-Pacific, sales rose 20% to $208 million, which was virtually on our expectation. That 20% increase reflected unit growth across most jewelry categories and an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Asia-Pacific sales also increased 20%, with comp store sales up by a solid 13%. The strongest comp growth was across Greater China. We finished the quarter operating 67 stores in that region, which included opening a new store in the Times Square shopping mall, marking our ninth store in Hong Kong.","As we've said repeatedly, we believe that expanding Tiffany's store presence and marketing, especially in China, increases brand awareness and stimulates local sales demand, but also is a catalyst for spending by Chinese customers when they travel to other regions. When we analyze our performance in Japan, we believe it's most relevant, especially now, to examine sales growth in local currency because of the substantial weakening of the yen versus the dollar over the past year. And just as other foreign brands have done, we've increased retail prices in Japan this year to address that weaker yen. When measured in local currency, we're pleased that total sales rose 7% in the quarter and comparable store sales rose 8% on top of the 10% comp increase in last year's second quarter. This exceeded our expectation. The total sales growth in yen was due to an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold. While the overall unit decline in the quarter reflected declines in moderate-priced fashion jewelry categories, it was partly offset by unit growth in engagement and higher-end jewelry.","We believe we are partly benefiting from improved household spending that reflects consumer optimism around the Japanese government's efforts to stimulate their economy and it's possible that some of the decline in Japanese tourists spending in the U.S. could be showing up in more locally made purchases. Most importantly, we believe the overall sales growth continues to demonstrate the strength of our brand. So the good news is that sales in Japan are performing quite well, but the picture on paper looks different when considering that the yen year-over-year has weakened more than 20% versus the U.S. dollar. As a result, the 7% sales growth in yen translated into a 14% sales decline to $136 million. Our internal sales and earnings forecast for the second half of the year incorporates a yen rate roughly in line with recent levels.","We now operate 54 stores in Japan. During the quarter, a Tiffany store in Tokyo located within the Matsuzakaya Ginza department store was closed due to the entire department store's closing for a multiyear renovation, but we are well-situated to serve their existing customers in our major Ginza store nearby and in Mitsukoshi Ginza store.","In Europe, total sales rose 11% in the quarter due to higher average price and an increase in units sold in most jewelry categories. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales increased 10% in total and 7% on a comparable store basis, which met our expectation.","Looking across the region, like-for-like sales growth actually accelerated in the United Kingdom and exceeded more modest comp growth in most of Continental Europe in the second quarter, after seeing the opposite pattern in the first quarter. Sales to local European customers were up in the quarter. Sales to tourists have also become a meaningful factor, estimated to represent more than 1\/4 of our European sales. But there were no discernible local-versus-tourist sales patterns from country-to-country from which to draw any conclusions.","During the quarter, we opened a store in Verona, Italy, marking our sixth store in that important country, and we finished the quarter operating 35 stores in Europe.","Rounding out the geographical review, Tiffany's other sales increased 33% in the second quarter. July marked the first anniversary of the conversion of 5 existing Tiffany stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi, from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations, and we began to record the retail sales of those stores during July 2012. We believe there is solid, long-term growth potential for Tiffany to enhance brand awareness and expand its customer base in the Middle East. We finished the quarter with 277 company-operated stores. Our plan continues to call for opening 16 stores this year, with 4 already opened in the first half of the year. We've also closed 1 store each in Japan and Taiwan, resulting in a net addition of 14 locations for the year. And of course, we're also renovating a number of existing stores.","In the Americas, the 6 planned stores include 3 in the U.S.: in New Jersey's Garden State Plaza, which opened earlier this month; in Cleveland's Eton Center, which will open tomorrow; and a store in New Orleans, in The Shops at Canal Place. As well as our 10th store in Mexico in Villahermosa, which has opened; a store in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada; and our fifth store in Brazil, in Curitiba. And we're excited that later this week, we will relocate our Bloor Street store in Toronto to a site 1 block away that gives us more selling space with actually less gross square footage, and will provide an extraordinary shopping environment and experience for our customers.","The 7 new stores planned in the Asia-Pacific region this year range from 4 in China, one of which has opened in Xi'an, to the store we opened in Hong Kong's Times Square shopping mall in the second quarter and 2 other locations elsewhere. Lastly, in Europe, the 3 new stores this year include the store we opened in the Excelsior in Verona, Italy in the second quarter; as well as the store in Stuttgart, Germany in the Breuninger department store; and 1 other planned store, which will get us to 37 European stores by year-end. And we're very excited to recently announce our plans to open Tiffany's first company-operated store in Russia next year. The 4,500 square foot or 420 square meter location will be situated in the renowned GUM department store in Moscow.","Before reviewing merchandising highlights, let me take a moment to define some categories for those of you less familiar with us. When we have been referring to fine jewelry, we are primarily talking about platinum and gold jewelry with the diamonds and\/or other gemstones. Statement refers to jewelry pieces typically retailing for more than $50,000. And fashion jewelry is predominantly about non-gemstone jewelry and silver, gold and the RUBEDO metal, although small gemstones might be used as accents in some pieces. Now having provided those definitions, merchandising highlights in the quarter continued to reflect sales growth in fine and statement jewelry that outperformed the modest growth in fashion jewelry sales. Our success in higher-price-point jewelry does revolve around diamonds, including strong response to our growing assortment of colored diamonds. This range is from the statement jewelry category that had continued sell-through from April's Blue Book event and sales from our very successful Gatsby collection to solitaire diamond engagement rings, including the distinctive new Harmony collection, to the extraordinary Yellow Diamond jewelry collection, the Enchant diamond jewelry collection, our select collections with diamonds and colored stones, Tiffany Keys in diamonds and in gold and Tiffany's Metro collection. But as we've been saying recently, we're also focused on improving the fashion jewelry category, but in a luxury-brand-appropriate way. New designs, such as the Ziegfeld collection in silver, freshwater pearls and onyx that was introduced in the second quarter to strong customer response, and the reinterpretation of our iconic Atlas collection that makes its official debut on September 10, along with others in the product development pipeline, are intended to generate improving fashion jewelry sales trends over the next year.","That wraps up my comments, so I'll now turn the call over to Pat.","Patrick F. McGuiness","Thanks, Mark. We were pleased with Tiffany's second quarter results in a number of ways and certainly pleased with our earnings growth. We were very satisfied with sales results in all regions, except the Americas, where sales remained quite soft. In addition, we saw a favorable gross margin movement, and we were pleased with our management of expenses. And as such, this second quarter performance leads us to raise our full year outlook.","Now let's look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin was 57.5% in the second quarter compared with 56.3% last year and better than our previous guidance. We are now benefiting from a moderation in product cost, tied to product flow-through and also benefiting from a needed price increase that we took during the first quarter this year after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2012. However, these gross margin benefits are still being partly offset by a continuing shift in sales mix toward higher-price-point, lower-gross-margin products. And we took an additional price increase in Japan in the second quarter to account for some further weakening of the yen versus the dollar. We are now forecasting gross margin for the full year to be at least equal to last year. Although we are focused on improving fashion jewelry sales with new product introductions, we continue to forecast 2013 fashion jewelry sales growth to lag growth in higher-priced categories.","Selling, general and administrative expenses rose by only 3% in the second quarter, largely due to store-related costs and marketing spending. The effect of foreign currency translation primarily from a weaker yen, reduced SG&A expense growth by about 3 percentage points. For the year, we continue to forecast SG&A expense growth slightly less than sales growth. Earnings from operations increased 14% in the quarter, and we are forecasting it to increase more than sales growth for the full year.","There remains ample opportunity to improve the operating margin over the longer term by achieving stronger sales growth and leveraging it against a relatively fixed expense base. Other expenses, net of $15 million in the quarter, were up slightly from last year and we continue to forecast other expenses at about $58 million for the full year. The effective tax rate was 34.2% in the second quarter, and we continue to estimate a 35% rate for the full year. Adding it all together, net earnings increased 16% in the second quarter and diluted EPS rose 15%, which was considerably better than our previous forecasted earnings equal to last year. Three months ago, we had reduced our sales growth expectation for the full year due to a disappointing performance in the Americas, as well as to factor in a weaker yen. At this point, we are maintaining a cautious sales outlook for the Americas until we see solid evidence of an upturn. Our assumptions call for full year worldwide sales to grow by a mid-single digit percentage in dollars and by a high-single digit in local currency. With local currency comp growth ranging from high-single digits in Asia-Pacific and Japan to low-single digits in the Americas.","Given these second quarter results, we are increasing our earnings forecast to a range of $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share from the previous forecast of $3.43 to $3.53 per diluted share and last year's $3.25 per diluted share. This earnings forecast excludes $0.05 per diluted share of expenses tied to cost-reduction efforts that we recorded in the first quarter.","We are also well-positioned with our balance sheet. At July 31, we had $490 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $366 million a year ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $964 million at July 31, up from $940 million a year ago. Total debt was 35% of stockholders' equity versus 39% a year ago. Net inventories of $2.3 billion, which represents about half of total assets, have increased just 4% from a year ago, with finished goods inventory up 8% and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories down 1%. Net inventories would have increased 7% when excluding the translation effect of a stronger dollar, primarily against the weaker yen. We continue to project about a 5% increase in net inventories for the year or slightly less than projected sales growth.","Accounts receivables were 6% lower than last year, largely due to the translation effects from the substantially weaker Japanese yen. Receivables are turning at more than 20x per year. Capital expenditures were $87 million in the first half of the year versus $97 million in last year's first half, and we are continuing to project $230 million of CapEx for the year versus $220 million last year. All of this keeps us on track to achieve positive free cash flow of about $300 million in 2013 versus $109 million in 2012.","Tying it together, our return on average assets was 10% on a trailing basis and return on average stockholders' equity was 17%. Our long-term financial objectives continue to call for achieving at least a 10% ROA and a 15% ROE. So I am pleased to say that it was a good quarter for Tiffany. Looking forward, we remain focused on a range of growth opportunities, including new product introductions and further broadening brand awareness through marketing communications. On a related marketing note, Tiffany is one of the most recognized and awarded leaders in the luxury digital space. Our passion and creativity in this area is seen within tiffany.com, as well as in our innovative social media programs, online advertising and mobile applications. Everywhere in the world, Tiffany is maximizing connectivity with our customers through all digital platforms. And to become even better, we will relaunch our website later this year with enhanced content that will be even richer and more robust in an integrated presentation. We will, of course, also be focused on expanding our global distribution and on growing comparable store sales, and we have a strong management team in place to achieve that. In fact, during the second quarter, we bolstered our global organization when we brought in experienced leaders to head 2 of our regions. For Northern America, Anthony Ledru comes to us with many years of global retail jewelry experience; and in Europe, Florence Rollet comes to us with a strong luxury background, where she had retail management responsibility across Europe. Anthony and Florence, along with our other regional leaders, report to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cumenal, our Executive Vice President who joined Tiffany 2 years ago.","That concludes my comments.

Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Participating on today's call will be Mr. Mike Kowalski, Chairman and CEO; Mr. Pat McGuiness, Senior VP and CFO; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark L. Aaron","Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this call. Pat McGuiness and I will review fourth quarter and full year results as well as the company's outlook for 2012, and then Mike Kowalski will wrap up the call with some remarks. ","Before we continue, please note Tiffany's Safe Harbor provision that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now let's proceed. One year ago, we reported broad-based strong financial results for fiscal 2010 with sales up 14% and net earnings from continuing operations up 39%. We are now pleased to also report strong performance for fiscal 2011, with net sales up 18%, net earnings up 19% to $3.40 per diluted share and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items up 24% to $3.60 per diluted share. ","At the same time, we are disappointed that the year finished on a softer note than we initially expected, with fourth quarter sales up 8%, net earnings down 2% and net earnings excluding nonrecurring items down 4%, but that does not diminish our satisfaction from achieving another successful year. And it's worth noting that the $3.60 per diluted share of earnings in 2011 excluding nonrecurring items was above the initial guidance we provided to you one year ago that called for $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share. ","Let's first review some key sales highlights by region for the fourth quarter and full year. Sales in the Americas increased 5% in the fourth quarter, with comp store sales up 3% on top of an 8% comp increase last year. This was a slight improvement from the 4% increase in November, December holiday sales that we had previously reported. The 5% sales increase in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. In fact, while price stratification for the Americas in the fourth quarter indicated continued declines in sales and transactions below $250, it was more than offset by sales growth in most of the higher-priced categories. It was a pretty similar dichotomy for the full year, with the greatest strength in sales over $20,000 and $50,000. ","We believe that the slower sales growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter might have been in varying degrees due to restrained spending by customers employed in the financial sector, which especially affected our sales in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., substantial competitive discounting and particular softness at our entry-level silver jewelry price points that might be tied to some resistance to price increases among other factors. ","Sales in the New York flagship store rose 2% in the quarter, which was a bit better than the 1% decline in the holiday period. The 2% increase was due to higher sales to foreign tourists. The overall Americas region also benefited from higher sales to foreign tourists but also saw increased sales to local customers. Comp store sales in branch stores rose 3%, with growth somewhat skewed toward the western half of the region, which includes continued strong growth in Hawaii and Guam, driven by Japanese tourists. Our stores in Canada and Latin America posted solid sales growth in the quarter.","For the full year, sales in the Americas rose 15% due to an overall increase in the average price per unit sold. Growth in jewelry units sold at higher price points was offset by declines in the silver jewelry category. The Americas region represented 50% of worldwide sales versus 51% in 2010. Americas comps rose 13% in the full year. Sales in the New York flagship store rose 20% in 2011 and remained at 8% of worldwide sales. ","In 2011, more than 40% of sales made in the New York flagship store were to foreign tourists versus somewhat less than 40% in 2010. Americas branch store comps rose 11% in 2011 on a constant exchange rate basis due to strong increases in most parts of the U.S. as well as in Canada and Latin America. ","I mentioned that higher foreign tourist spending generated a good portion of the fourth quarter sales growth in the U.S. That reason also applied to the full year. In fact, full year sales to foreign tourists represented an estimated 23% of U.S. sales in 2011 versus 17% and 15% in 2010 and 2009. European, Japanese and Chinese tourists represented roughly similar amounts of that spending in 2011. ","The 5 highest-volume branch stores in the Americas in 2011 included 3 in the U.S. and 2 in Canada, and they are South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, San Francisco and Chicago as well as in Vancouver and on Toronto's Bloor Street. We opened 6 new stores in the Americas in 2011, including one in Richmond, Virginia, a fourth store in Las Vegas in the Fashion Show Mall, a fourth store in the Chicago market in Northbrook, a store in Calgary, a second store in Vancouver in the Oakridge Centre and a third store in Brazil in Brasilia. Their results range from quite good to very strong, and that follows excellent first-year results from the 5 Americas stores we opened in the previous year. ","We finished 2011 with 102 stores in the Americas, including 87 in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 7 in Mexico and 3 in Brazil. Rounding out the Americas are Internet and catalog sales, which declined 4% in the fourth quarter as an increased amount per order was more than offset by a decline in the number of orders shipped. Internet and catalog sales rose 6% in the full year due to increased sales per order and accounted for about 10% of sales in the Americas for the year. We continue to believe that our Internet presence serves the dual purpose of generating online sales and expanding brand awareness, which drives traffic to our stores. We are currently in the process of revamping our website with some exciting enhancements that will debut later this year. ","Tiffany's second-largest region by sales is Asia-Pacific. Sales rose 19% in the fourth quarter due to increased units sold and a smaller increase in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales for the quarter rose 18% with growth in most countries and especially in Australia, Hong Kong and Macau contributed to a 13% increase in comp store sales. That was on top of a 16% comp increase in last year's fourth quarter and was basically in line with the previously reported November, December sales results. ","For the full year, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 36% due to similar increases in units and in the average price per unit sold. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 31%, and comp store sales rose 27% on top of a 14% comp increase in 2010, with strong increases in most countries.","Asia-Pacific represented 21% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010. Sales in Greater China represented 12 points of the 21%. We have a meaningful opportunity to achieve much higher brand awareness in China, and as we proceed, we should undoubtedly see the benefits through sales growth in China as well as in other markets serving the growing numbers of Chinese tourists. ","During the year, we opened 6 stores in Asia-Pacific, including 3 in Korea, in Seoul, Daegu and Incheon; 2 in China, in Guangzhou and Dong Cheng; and one in Taiwan, in Taichung. And their early results are good. We also did a major renovation and expansion, which doubled the size of our very successful store on Collins Street in Melbourne. We ended 2011 with 58 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. Our 2 largest stores by sales volume in the region are on Canton Road in Hong Kong and in Ngee Ann City in Singapore. ","Now let's turn to Japan. Total sales rose 12% in the fourth quarter due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was essentially in line with the 13% sales increase in the holiday period. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 5% in the quarter and comps rose 4% on top of a 1% increase last year due to relatively similar growth throughout Japan. ","One year ago this month, we were looking at a sales decline and considerable uncertainty in Japan following the tragic earthquake and tsunami. But our sales growth resumed one month later, demonstrating the enduring value and emotional resonance of our brand combined with the extraordinary efforts of our Tiffany colleagues in Japan. For the year, on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comparable store sales rose 4%. However, due to the yen strengthening by 10% against the U.S. dollar in 2011, total sales increased 13% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. ","Our flagship store on the Ginza in Tokyo generates the highest volume of our stores in Japan and accounted for 12% of our total retail sales in Japan last year. During 2011, we opened a new store in Hakata and closed 2 locations in Kokura and Wakayama and finished the year with 55 locations in Japan. For the full year, Japan represented 17% of worldwide sales in 2011 versus 18% in 2010.","Now let's review performance in Europe. Sales in the fourth quarter increased 3% due to an increase in the average price per unit sold. This was slightly better than the previously reported holiday sales result. On a constant exchange rate basis, sales rose 3% and comp store sales declined 2% on top of the 16% comp increase on last year's fourth quarter. The 2% comp decline reflected mixed results that range from solid growth in Continental Europe, with the highest growth in Germany and Austria, to a sales decline in the U.K.  ","For the full year, sales in Europe increased 17% due to increases in units sold as well as in the average price per unit sold and continue to represent 12% of worldwide sales. On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales rose 12% and comp store sales rose 6% on top of an 18% comp increase in 2010. Strong sales growth across Continental Europe surpassed a more modest increase in U.K. sales in the year. We think that softness in London has probably reflected restrained spending by customers in the financial industry, similar to what we've experienced in New York, along with overall challenging economic conditions. ","The vast majority of our European sales are generated by local customers. However, Tiffany stores in Europe also derive a growing benefit from sales to non-European tourists, which we estimate now represent about 1\/4 of European sales, with the highest percentage of those sales in Paris. In addition, Tiffany's Internet sales in Europe through websites in 9 countries are also growing very nicely and represented almost 10% of total European sales in 2011.","During the year, we opened 3 stores in Europe, including a second store in Milan, in the Excelsior, which is posting excellent initial results, as well as second stores in both Frankfurt and Z\u00fcrich, in their airports. And I should add that we've had excellent results from the 2 stores we opened in 2010 in London's Canary Wharf and in Barcelona. ","The U.K., with 10 stores, accounted for slightly less than half of our European sales in 2011. Our 2 highest-sales-volume stores in Europe in 2011 were on Old Bond Street in London and on via della Spiga in Milan. We operated 32 stores in Europe at the end of 2011. ","Putting it all together, our solid sales growth contributed to improved sales productivity in 2011 coming from comp store sales growth and the successful results from new stores. Looking at that sales productivity by region, the 247 stores we operated in 21 countries at year end generated total worldwide sales per gross square foot of $3,000 in 2011 versus $2,600 in 2010. ","By region, the Americas generated $2,300 in 2011 versus $2,100 in 2010. Europe generated $3,400 versus $3,000 in 2010. Japan was at $4,100 versus $3,500 in 2010. And the highest productivity continued to be in Asia-Pacific, with $4,700 per gross square foot versus $4,000 in 2010. ","Let's briefly look at other sales, which declined 22% in the fourth quarter. That segment consists primarily of wholesale sales of diamonds and sales to independent third-party distributors of our products, primarily in the Middle East and Russia, and the sales decline reflected lower sales in both components, as we had expected. For the full year, other sales declined 5% as sales growth to independent distributors was more than offset by a decline in wholesale sales of diamonds. ","We recently announced that we have signed a memorandum of understanding with Damas Jewelers to establish a joint venture in the UAE. The JV will give us overall responsibility for 5 existing stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and we will soon commence new merchandising and marketing initiatives there to drive sales growth. ","Let's now review some merchandising highlights. While total sales growth decelerated to 8% in the fourth quarter after increasing 24% in the first 9 months of the year, there were some differing patterns by category and price point in some regions. High-end statement jewelry sales softened after experiencing strong growth in the first 3 quarters of 2011. On the other hand, the most resilient category was engagement jewelry, with a very solid increase in the quarter, continuing its strong growth from earlier in the year. Fine and fashion jewelry sales were up modestly in the quarter after strong growth in the first 3 quarters of the year. We are extremely pleased with the continued success of our extraordinary yellow diamond jewelry collection and with its long-term potential. ","We've also seen customers all year attracted to platinum- and diamond-focused products, such as studs and pendants, and to important collections, such as Victoria, Metro and Celebration Rings. There's also been a growing desire for gold jewelry in collections like Return to Tiffany, 1837 and the new Locks Collection, which followed the unprecedented success of the Keys Collection. Conversely, silver jewelry sales have been growing more modestly. ","We were pleased with growth in designer jewelry sales in the quarter that continued our success from earlier in the year. Elsa Peretti's designs had a healthy sales increase, led by the always alluring Diamonds by the Yard collection. Paloma Picasso sales growth was stimulated by her stunning new Venezia Collection, and we are also continuing to be pleased with the sales growth of Tiffany's Leather Collection. ","Product development has always been an important strategy and sales driver at Tiffany's, and you can expect to see a very exciting and eclectic array of new jewelry designs over the coming year. ","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Pat McGuiness.","Patrick F. McGuiness","Thanks, Mark. I will now focus my remarks on the rest of the earnings statement. Let's start with gross margin, which at 60.4% in the fourth quarter was 0.5 point lower than the prior year. The downward pressure in the quarter came from higher product cost, a continued shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products that earn a lower gross margin, and a lack of sales leverage on fixed cost. ","For the full year, gross margin of 59% was 0.1 point lower than the prior year. Higher product acquisition costs and shifts in product sales mix were mostly offset by sales leverage on fixed costs. Throughout the year, we have spoken about gross margin pressure from significantly higher cost of precious metals and diamonds, which, in turn, have led to increased retail prices at Tiffany and in the overall jewelry industry. If product input costs stabilize, we would expect less pressure on gross margin in the latter part of 2012, and future pricing actions, if any, would be more modest. For the full year, though, we expect gross margin to be lower than the prior year based on our assumptions for product cost, inventory turnover, sales volume and sales mix. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in store occupancy, labor and marketing costs. In last year's fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the relocation of our New York headquarters staff in June 2011. Excluding that expense, SG&A expenses increased 11% in this fourth quarter, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales would have been 36.3% versus 35.1% last year. For the full year, SG&A expenses rose 18%. This is also primarily due to higher cost for store occupancy, labor and marketing. ","SG&A expenses also included $43 million of nonrecurring expenses in the first half of 2011 related to the headquarters staff relocation. In 2010, we recorded $17 million of those nonrecurring expenses. So excluding nonrecurring expenses in both years, SG&A expenses increased 16% for the year, and the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales improved to 38.4% from 39.2% in the prior year. ","We will remind you that the vast majority of our SG&A expenses are relatively fixed, in fact, about 80%. So there's further opportunity to leverage those costs and improve the ratio to sales. For 2012, we believe we have put together a well-controlled and prudent expense plan. Our plan calls for high-single-digit expense growth, which includes increased spending for new stores, labor, occupancy and marketing. Our plan will enable us to improve the expense ratio to sales for the full year. Excluding nonrecurring charges, the improvement will be comparable or better than the 80-basis-point reduction achieved in 2011. The SG&A expense growth in 2012 also factors in higher pension and post-retirement costs due to asset performance and a reduction in the discount rate. ","For the full year, the slight decline in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio gave us an operating margin of 19.4% versus 19.3% last year. However, excluding nonrecurring items, the operating margin was 20.6% versus 19.8% last year. For 2012, the expected decline in gross margin and improvement in the SG&A expense ratio will likely result in the operating margin being unchanged from 2011 to 20.6% excluding the nonrecurring items. ","Other expenses rose to $13 million in the fourth quarter from $11 million last year, while other expenses in the full year declined to $43 million from $47 million due to lower interest expense. We expect other expenses in 2012 to be roughly unchanged from 2011. The effective income tax rate of 34.5% in the fourth quarter was a bit higher than we anticipated, which cost us a few cents per share in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 came in at 34%. That was higher than the 32.7% rate in fiscal 2010, which included benefits from nonrecurring items primarily related to a change in tax status of certain subsidiaries. We are projecting an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% for 2012. ","Adding it all up, net income declined 2% in the fourth quarter to $178 million or $1.39 per diluted share. For the full year, net earnings rose 19% to $439 million or $3.40 per diluted share. Excluding nonrecurring items, net earnings declined 4% in the fourth quarter but rose 24% in the full year to $3.60 per diluted share. Due to the higher-than-expected effective tax rate, this was at the lower end of the range we had projected when we reported holiday sales results on January 10. The full year net margin rose to 12.1% in 2011 from 11.9% in 2010. Excluding the nonrecurring items, net margin was 12.8% in 2011 versus 12.2% in 2010. ","Whichever way you measure it, Tiffany had a very strong year, and earnings surpassed the healthy objective that we set at the start of 2011. Our return on average equity and return on average assets improved in 2011. ROE was 19% for the full year versus 18% in 2010, while ROA was 11% for the full year versus 10% in 2010. While the improved ROA reflects the strong earnings in 2011, it also reflects a large increase in inventory levels, which I'll discuss in a moment. ","We finished the year with a solid balance sheet that we believe serves as a competitive advantage. Accounts receivable of $184 million at year end was 1% below the prior year end, and receivable turnover remained very high at 20x. Net inventories of $2.1 billion at January 31 were 28% higher than the prior year end, but it's important to look at the components of that increase. ","Finished goods inventories rose 16% in fiscal 2011, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, new stores, product launches and expanded product assortments, including our statement jewelry category.  And the lower-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter temporarily inflated year-end inventory levels. It's worth noting that the larger driver of inventory growth was in raw material and work-in-process inventories. Combined, they increased 46% in the year, reflecting higher product acquisition costs, increased internal manufacturing and substantially higher rough and polished diamond purchases. ","For 2012, we are planning for a 15% increase in net inventories, partly due to new stores, expanded product assortments and further vertical integration of our diamond supply chain. The inventory growth also includes a meaningful increase of extraordinary statement jewelry pieces to support the celebration of Tiffany's 175th anniversary over the 2012, 2013 timeframe. ","Capital expenditures were $239 million in 2011 or 7% of sales. This was substantially higher than the $127 million we spent in 2010. The largest single piece of the CapEx increase resulted from the relocation of our New York headquarters staff. We also increased our CapEx by renovating more of our store base, and CapEx also went toward opening 14 stores. Our CapEx budget of $240 million for 2012 reflects both a higher rate of new store openings and an increased number of store renovations. The budgeted amount represents about 6% of sales and is consistent with the long-term plan to spend about 6% to 7% of sales per year. ","As a result of the factors I've cited, Tiffany's 2011 free cash flow, which we define as cash flows from operating activities minus capital expenditures, was an outflow of $29 million. At year end, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $442 million, total short-term and long-term debt was $712 million, and stockholders' equity was $2.3 billion at year end. As a result, the ratio of total debt to equity was 30% at year end compared with 32% at the end of fiscal 2010 and 40% at the end of fiscal 2009. In 2011, we paid off $61 million of maturing long-term debt in Japan. We also entered into a JPY 4 billion or about $50 million one-year credit facility in Japan, which was fully utilized at year end. ","During the year, we continued returning cash to stockholders. We remained active in our share repurchase program in 2011, spending $174 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $66.23 per share. And once again, we increased the quarterly dividend rate on common stock, announcing a 16% increase in May 2011. That represented the 10th dividend increase in 9 years, which has also led to a meaningful increase in the dividend payout ratio over that period. The annual dividend of $1.16 per share represents a payout ratio of 34% on 2011's earnings per share of $3.40. ","Looking to our financial guidance for 2012. We stated in today's news release that we are projecting an approximate 10% increase in worldwide sales in 2012 primarily driven by sales growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Our expected 10% worldwide sales increase in dollars equates to a 12% increase on constant exchange rate basis with comp store sales growth of 8%. ","I've already mentioned our full year assumptions for gross margin, SG&A expense growth, other expenses and the effective income tax rate. Bringing it all together, we are projecting net earnings for 2012 in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2011 EPS of $3.60 per diluted share, which excluded the nonrecurring items. ","As we noted in today's news release, we expect a large portion of the earnings growth to be weighted toward the fourth quarter. The unusual spread is largely due to our expectation for some continued gross margin pressure in the next few quarters. We also noted in today's release that we are now halfway through the first quarter, and worldwide sales growth is tracking in line with our internal expectation. ","We know there are economic challenges and uncertainty in a number of markets around the world, as evidenced by the fourth quarter results, and we believe we have factored a reasonable degree of caution into our forecast. However, we also continue to take a long-term approach to managing our business and are striving to increase Tiffany's presence and customer base. Our 2012 plan includes making those investments to reap both immediate and longer-term benefits. ","I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mike Kowalski.","Michael J. Kowalski","Thanks, Pat and Mark. I'm glad to be on this call and pleased to say that we achieved, if not exceeded, the objectives we set for 2011. We generated strong sales and earnings growth for the year despite the softness in the fourth quarter, and we continue to build an even stronger platform for future growth. The new stores we opened and the new products we introduced performed well, and we have exciting plans for 2012. Specifically, one of our key initiatives will be the continued expansion of our company-operated worldwide store base. Our plan for 2012 is to open a net of 24 stores, representing a 10% increase in the number of locations. ","In the Americas, we are planning to open 9 stores, comprised of 4 stores in the United States, including a store we are opening this week in Salt Lake City and a store in Manhattan SoHo in September.  We are planning for 2 new stores in Canada, including one we opened last month in at Montr\u00e9al, and we are planning to open 3 stores in Latin America, with 2 in Mexico and 1 in Rio de Janeiro. ","In Asia-Pacific, we plan to open a net of 7 stores this year, including one store in Bondi Junction, Australia, our sixth in Australia; our second store in Singapore at the airport, which will be our fifth store in Singapore; and a net of 5 stores in China, bringing us to 21 stores in China by year end. Our plans continue to call for expanding our store base to 30 stores in China in the next several years. In Japan, the store total will be unchanged. ","Our plans for Europe call for adding 3 stores this year in Prague, in Nice and in the Berlin airport, which will bring us to 35 European stores by year end and closer to our goal of 50 stores in Europe in the next 5 or so years. ","Our worldwide store expansion plans in 2012 also include adding 5 company-operated stores in the Middle East. Two months ago, we announced our signing of a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in the UAE with Damas Jewelers. Under the JV, Tiffany will soon take on responsibility for merchandising, assortment and pricing, advertising and promotional activities, staffing, store design and visual display and financial services in 5 existing Tiffany company stores, including 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi. We are very excited about converting these stores into company-operated locations and believe there is substantial potential for us to reach a large base of customers who undoubtedly appreciates Tiffany's extraordinary product offerings. Beyond the Middle East, we are also exploring opportunities to expand Tiffany's modest existing presence in Russia and Brazil and to eventually enter India. ","Tiffany's website has been widely recognized for its innovative excellence in the jewelry category. We believe we can enhance the customer experience even further and are working on a comprehensive revamp of the website to launch later in the year, which we expect will generate additional marketing and sales benefits. ","We also have developed an exciting and impactful array of new products to be introduced in 2012. I'm sure you are all aware that Tiffany's 1837 jewelry collection has been an enormous success. To commemorate the year of Tiffany's founding, we are excited about the current launch of the next generation of 1837, with new designs in gold and silver and a significant portion of the collection executed in Tiffany's new RUBEDO metal. RUBEDO is a luminescent blend of copper, silver and gold, which our metallurgists took several years to develop. It has a radiant, innovative glow, and initial customer reception has been very strong. We plan to further expand our assortment of statement jewelry with important pieces, and we'll continue to offer our extraordinary engagement jewelry in a compelling and competitively dominant assortment of styles. ","Beyond engagement and statement jewelry, we have developed a new Enchant Collection for later this year with designs inspired by the natural world in platinum, gold and tanzanite. There will also be new designs featuring pink diamonds, a continued focus and expansion of our very successful Yellow Diamond Collection, additions to our Somerset jewelry collection and new pearl jewelry offerings. And we will debut a new collection of designs inspired by the Art Deco period to coincide with the fourth quarter debut of the movie The Great Gatsby, for which Tiffany has designed the jewelry. We are also currently launching Paloma Picasso's new Villa Paloma collection in gold and silver, inspired by the beauty found in Paloma's favorite gardens around the world. ","Finally, we will continue to build on the strength of our core collections with additions to our very successful Return to Tiffany, Keys, Locks and Charms collections and new additions to our Leather Collection. And of course, you can be certain that we will employ an active marketing program through advertising and print and digital media, public relations and store events to focus on these new designs as well as the wide range of Tiffany classics. ","Supporting our ongoing business and store and product expansion is our strong infrastructure. Tiffany's 2 distribution centers are very effectively handling worldwide store replenishment and direct-to-customer shipments. Very importantly, we have developed excellent product manufacturing and sourcing capabilities. In 2011, we internally manufactured about 60% of Tiffany's merchandise sold. The new jewelry manufacturing facility we opened in Lexington, Kentucky in 2011 gives us additional capacity to complement our facilities in New York and Rhode Island and can support our future growth. ","Tiffany has built an extraordinarily powerful diamond supply chain through relationships with many of the world's diamond producers. Less than 1% of the world's diamonds meet Tiffany quality standards. As we continue to seek global wealth creation in the future, we and others in our industry expect that the worldwide supply of diamonds, especially at our quality levels, keep pace with growing customer demand, and therefore, diamond cost will likely move higher. While we cannot mitigate higher cost, we can feel assured that the diamond supply chain we have developed will enable us to serve our growing customer base with a comprehensive supply of the finest-quality diamonds that they expect from Tiffany. ","The 2012, 2013 period marks the 175th anniversary of Tiffany's founding. Our brand is now globally recognized and admired. 54% of our worldwide sales in 2011 were transacted outside the United States, and the percentage of sales made to non-U.S. customers is even greater if you include the spending by foreign tourists shopping in our U.S. stores. ","Tiffany will continue to grow as the place that customers from around the world come to celebrate life's most important occasions. The Tiffany & Co. brand is flourishing because it represents the finest product quality and craftsmanship, enduring value, a rewarding shopping experience and a bond of trust with consumers. We know that these traits will remain the keys to our future growth and our success. ","We believe we have put together a reasonable and achievable financial plan for 2012 with approximately 10% worldwide sales growth and net earnings growth of 10% to 13%, excluding last year's nonrecurring items. What we accomplish in 2012 should yield benefits for years to come, and we remain committed to our longer-term financial objective to increase net sales by 10% to 12% annually and net earnings by at least 15% per year. ","Thank you for joining us today for our review of Tiffany's results and outlook. I look forward to seeing many of you during the year and updating you on Tiffany's progress. In fact, please note that we expect to report Tiffany's first quarter results on Thursday, May 24. I appreciate your ongoing and growing interest. Here's Mark again.","Mark L.

First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations and MR; and Mr. Mark Erceg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Good day, everyone. On today's conference call, Mark Erceg and I will comment on the first quarter financial results, our growth strategies and the full year outlook. ","Of course, before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances except as required by applicable law or regulation. ","Now let's proceed. As an overview, Tiffany's first quarter results showed a slight increase in worldwide net sales and higher growth in net earnings and our balance sheet remains strong. We believe that those results keep us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance in light of an expectation for continued challenges from macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty and a strong U.S. dollar. ","In terms of the first quarter, starting with the top line, regional results included a total sales increase in Asia-Pacific, contrasting with modest declines in the Americas, Japan and Europe, although sales in Europe actually increased on a constant exchange rate basis. ","In our largest region, the Americas, total and comparable store sales declined in the first quarter primarily due to lower jewelry unit volume. The U.S. experienced geographically mixed but generally soft performance across the country which we attributed to varying degrees of weakness in both local and foreign tourist demand. Elsewhere, our business in Canada was soft while we were pleased to experience solid growth in our stores in Latin America. ","During the first quarter, we completed the major renovation of our store on Union Square in San Francisco and earlier this month, we relaunched our renovated and expanded store on Burrard Street in Vancouver. Both stores have extraordinary new presentations to serve customers in those important markets. ","Our second largest region is Asia-Pacific, where an increase in total sales was due to higher wholesale sales and the effect of new store openings over the past year while comps declined slightly. The regional sales growth was entirely driven by increased jewelry unit volume, with the decline in the average price per unit sold. We attributed the continuation of strong sales growth in Mainland China to local customer spending. ","Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline which we attribute to lower Chinese tourist spending, but the sales decline was only modest due to our increased focus on local clientele in that market. And we continued to experience varying degrees of softness elsewhere in the region. During the quarter, we closed 1 store in China that had temporarily overlapped with a new store opened last year and we relocated a store in Korea. ","Turning to Japan. Total sales and comparable store sales declined slightly in the first quarter with minimal changes in jewelry unit volume and average price. Total sales also declined in part due to lower wholesale sales. We were pleased to see higher spending attributed to local customers who we believe represent about 90% of our sales in Japan. As part of our efforts to further strengthen local customer sales in the important bridal category, we've recently expanded the presence of our major Ginza store in Tokyo by opening a nearby boutique dedicated to that category. We've been pleased with customer's reaction to this heightened experience. ","On the other hand, we continued to see a decline in sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan. However, as you may recall, we benefited in the first quarter of 2016 from higher sales attributed to Chinese tourists in Japan which then tapered off in the second quarter. During the first quarter, we closed 1 store in Japan. ","Our business continues to gradually improve in Europe. Total and comp store sales in the quarter declined modestly as reported. As we saw in 2016, there were varying degrees of softness across Continental Europe, but we were pleased to see a resumption of sales growth in France in the first quarter. Total and comp store sales rose modestly on a constant exchange rate basis as we have been seeing healthy local currency sales growth in the U.K. that we attribute partly to increased demand by local customers and partly to multinational foreign tourist spending in London tied to the weak British pound. There were modest changes in the average price per jewelry unit sold and unit volume. Sales in the other segments had a big increase in the quarter but that was mostly due to an increase in our wholesale sales of diamonds with comp store sales roughly unchanged. ","Given our focus on improving top line growth going forward, it's worth reiterating four important global strategies to do so, first, continuing to pursue clienteling and CRM strategies to more effectively engage with customers and enhance their Tiffany experience; second, adding newness to the product assortment at a faster pace; third, optimizing the global distribution base through store openings, renovations, relocations and, in limited cases, some closings; and fourth, enhancing brand awareness through effective marketing communication. We believe these are the key ingredients to achieve better sales growth in the future by increasing the frequency of customer store visit and improving the conversion rate. ","Rounding out the sales review, global e-commerce sales were roughly unchanged in the first quarter, but as we've said before, our website served an important dual function of generating online sales while also delivering marketing communication that drives awareness and store traffic. From a product perspective in the first quarter, we were pleased with fashion jewelry sales which, once again, performed relatively better than our other categories. Fashion jewelry which represented 33% of worldwide sales in 2016, primarily consists of non-gemstone gold and silver jewelry. ","In the first quarter, while gold jewelry sales led the category's growth, highlighted by the Tiffany T collection, we were pleased that fashion silver jewelry sales were modestly above last year led by the Return to Tiffany collection. Sales of the 1837 collection were also up nicely. And a few weeks ago, we launched the new hardware collection which spanned gold and silver in a range of styles and price points and customer feedback has been positive. Looking forward, additional designs in the T and hardware collections are planned for this fall. ","Designer jewelry sales which represented 12% of worldwide sales in 2016, posted healthy growth in the quarter. The category consists of the designs of Elsa Peretti, highlighted by her Diamonds by the Yard and open heart designs; and the designs of Paloma Picasso which include her new Paloma's Melody collection. ","The engagement jewelry and wedding bands category which represented 28% of worldwide sales in 2016, continued to underperform relative to our expectation and to the prior year. And performance in the high fine and solitaire jewelry category which represented approximately 20% of worldwide sales in 2016, was mixed. Our Victoria collection continued to perform well, though this performance was offset by softness in other collections in this category. ","And regarding high jewelry, we were pleased with our annual Blue Book event that we held in New York in April. The event serves to highlight our extraordinary designs and craftsmanship and to strengthen our relationships with our top clients from around the world. We were pleased with the response to the event. ","I should add that our sales growth in the watch category is encouraging, albeit off of a low single-digit percentage of sales base, as we continue to expand brand awareness in that category through advertising and by introducing new designs that are planned for later this year. ","Rounding out the product overview, I'll just add that we're looking forward to this fall when we plan to launch our luxury accessories collection and a new signature fragrance for women. ","And now Mark Erceg will comment on additional financial highlights as well as our outlook. Mark?","Mark Erceg","Thanks, Mark. Welcome, everyone. Looking at the rest of the income statement, gross margin improved by 80 basis points in the first quarter despite an increase in wholesale diamond sales. Several factors accounted for the increase. First, we continue to benefit from favorable product input costs, particularly lower diamond acquisition costs, where we have seen favorable trends over the past couple of years. Second, after not taking any meaningful price increases in 2016, expect to adjust for weakening foreign currencies, we took modest pricing actions in the quarter that varied by country but which averaged out to a low single-digit increase on a worldwide basis. Finally, we also benefited from favorable product sales mix as the percentage of total sales coming from fashion jewelry rose during the quarter. ","With respect to SG&A, you may recall that during our last call, we commented that one of our priorities is to lower the rate of SG&A expense growth as a percent of sales. And while it goes without saying that we need better sales growth to achieve that objective on a sustainable basis, we were very pleased to see that first quarter SG&A expense which included some severance costs, rose less than 1%. Now with that said, we do expect higher rates of SG&A expense growth throughout the remaining quarters of the year as we invest in various growth initiatives. ","With improvement in both gross margin and the SG&A expense ratio, Tiffany's operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 16.2% in the quarter from 15.1% last year. ","Net interest and other expenses declined in the first quarter due to lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 31.7% in the quarter which was lower than expected largely due to the implementation of a new accounting standard related to the treatment of the excess tax benefits associated with divesting or exercise of stock-based compensation. Importantly, this new standard has the potential to create some level of additional earnings volatility in our future results as the amount of the excess tax benefit or shortfall will vary with changes in the stock price. ","And finally, before leaving the income statement, it is probably worth mentioning that our tax rate last year was 29% which you may recall benefited from the conclusion of a tax examination in the first quarter of 2016. ","Turning to the balance sheet and statement of cash flow. At April 30, we had $960 million of cash and short term investments which was up $170 million versus a year ago. Lower inventory contributed to that increase with net inventory at April 30 down 5% versus a year ago, although we still expect full year inventory to finish flat versus the prior year-end. ","As we've stated in the past, we're focused on managing inventories more efficiently both through process improvements and by leveraging a new inventory management system which we anticipate will be fully implemented over the next several years. ","Receivables were 5% higher than a year ago. Much of that was timing of collections related to the quarter ending on a Sunday. About 1\/3 of our receivables are related to our in-house customer financing offerings, while the majority of our accounts receivable balances are related to other third parties such as credit card companies, department store operators and wholesale customers. ","There's nothing particularly noteworthy regarding capital expenditures in the first quarter outside of saying we remain on track to spend about $250 million for the full year. We spent approximately $12 million repurchasing 123,000 shares during the quarter. And as of April 30, 2017, we had $299 million remaining available under our existing share repurchase authorization. ","We're pleased with our strong balance sheet and high rate of cash conversion which collectively enables us to continue investing in our business while also providing us with an opportunity to return excess cash to our shareholders. ","And now that we've pretty much built out our manufacturing and diamond supply chain which we believe provides us with important strategic and competitive advantages in the areas of supply availability, product innovation, product cost and corporate social responsibility, we're well positioned to maintain a strong balance sheet and generate strong cash flow going forward. ","Finally, in terms of our outlook, first quarter results have not fundamentally changed our view for the full year. Specifically, our annual forecast calls for total sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage over the prior year and we're still assuming an increase in operating margin just at a slower rate of growth than in the first quarter. We expect that the increase in operating margin will be entirely due to an increase in gross margin with SG&A expense growing slightly above sales growth. ","We also expect net interest and other expenses of approximately $40 million, an all-in effective income tax rate consistent with the prior year and the continued repurchasing of shares, although for the full year, we expect minimal benefits to diluted earnings per share growth from those repurchases. ","Our 2017 outlook continues to call for net earnings per diluted share to increase by high single-digit percentage from last year's $3.55 on a GAAP basis and to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year's adjusted EPS of $3.25 per share. ","So to summarize today's call, while our first quarter bottom line results slightly exceeded our near term expectations, they certainly do not satisfy our longer term ambition. We believe this is an important distinction because tight cost control and disciplined cash management are prerequisites for a well-run business, but sustainable long term success can only be achieved when the top line is growing consistently. ","With this in mind, we're not overly focused on macroeconomic factors we cannot directly influence. Instead, we remain focused on and excited about the top line growth initiatives we're pursuing, namely our efforts to bring more product newness and innovation to our customers while simultaneously enhancing the customer experience, sharpening our marketing efforts and optimizing our store network. ","We also believe we have the potential to improve our financial performance by further leveraging our vertically integrated supply chain and by capitalizing on what we believe is a growing global awareness and affinity for the Tiffany brand by consumers all around the world. We continue to strongly believe that executing our strategies in a disciplined way will create sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead. ","I'll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Mark. That concludes this conference call.

(NYSE:TIF) Q4 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call March 20, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Frederic Cumenal - President","Ralph Nicoletti - EVP and CFO","Mark Aaron - VP of IR","Analysts","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to the Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Frederic Cumenal, President, Mr. Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Greetings from New York, and hello everyone. We reported Tiffany's fourth quarter and full year results this morning and I presume you've already had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and Tiffany's 2015 plans and outlook. And we are pleased to have Frederic join us, to wrap up the call with some strategic observations.","Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Okay. Let's begin with an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales performance by region was mostly inline with the holiday sales results we've reported on January 12. Net worldwide sales in the fourth quarter declined 1% but rose 3% on a constant exchange rate basis that excludes the translation effect of the stronger U.S. dollar. We expect to see a continuation of that substantial headwind from the strong dollar in 2015.","In local currencies we were pleased that Tiffany performed well in Europe and Asia Pacific and not surprised that we experienced softness in Japan. However, we were disciplined with the underperformance in the Americas.","Also in the fourth quarter the operating margin was down slightly from last year's margin excluding the charge, while growth margin increased in the quarter the improvement was offset by higher marketing spending and deleveraging of SG&A fixed costs.","Interest and other expenses net were above last year but the prior year included a one time foreign currency transaction gain. The effective tax rate was below last year. So in total net earnings of a $1.51 per diluted share in the fourth quarter was up slightly from last year's $1.47 excluding charges and at the high end of the forecast we provided in January.","For all of 2014, worldwide net sales rose to $4.25 billion. That represented a 5% increase in dollars or a 7% increase on a constant exchange rate basis which was on top of a 10% increase in 2013 on that same basis.","Net earnings for the full year rose 167% to $484 million or $3.73 per diluted share. However, on an apples-to-apples basis excluding charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% and EPS of $4.20 was slightly better than the original guidance of $4.05 to $4.15 that we published at this time a year ago. And that 13% earnings increase in 2014 was on top of the non-GAAP 15% increase in net earnings that we achieved in 2013.","Let's now look at the details of our regional sales performance. First, there were minimal changes in our regional sales mix in 2014. The Americas represented 48% of worldwide net sales in 2014 unchanged from 2013.","Asia Pacific was 24% of worldwide sales, up slightly from 23% a year ago. Japan was 13% down slightly from 14% in 2013, and that was largely due to currency translation and Europe at 12% of worldwide sales was unchanged.","Let's look at the Americas which had a good year but finished on a soft note. On a constant exchange rate basis, both total sales and comp store sales were unchanged in the fourth quarter versus a 7% comp increase last year. However, for the full year on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales and comps rose 6% on top of a 3% comp increase in 2013.","In dollars, total sales in the Americas declined 1% in the quarter due to lower units sold offsetting favorable average price and mix. A 6% sales increase in the full year reflected favorable average price in mix currently offset by jewelry unit declines in silver jewelry under $500.","The strong U.S. dollar had a minimal negative translation effect on the Americas sales but is having an adverse effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S. especially in New York. And this effect certainly worsened in the later part of 2014.","Foreign tourist spending has historically represented about a quarter of annual U.S. sales. Although we no longer can precisely measure it due to privacy laws in some large markets but we can safely say it is the meaningful portion of the regional sale. And in fact continue to represent more than 40% of sales in the New York flagship store in 2014.","We attribute the Americas comp decline in the fourth quarter to softness that was broad based geographically across the U.S. and in most product categories except fashion jewelry. On a related note, while the Tiffany T collection preformed very well, it is possible that the concentrated advertising focus on that collection may not have benefited other collections as we had expected.","We attribute the softness in the under $500 silver jewelry category to a lack of product newness and marketing focus and perhaps also the competitive and macro pressures on the jewelry purchaser at those price points. So we do have some opportunity to fine tune our approaches to those issues within our control.","Elsewhere in the Americas, we were pleased with solid total sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant exchange rate basis in both the fourth quarter and the full year.","We finished the year operating a 122 Tiffany stores in the Americas versus 121 at the end of 2013. During the year we opened three stores in the region on Boston\u2019s Newbury Street, in Florida\u2019s, Aventura mall and in Cancun, Mexico and we closed two small stores in East Hampton, New York, and in the whole ran through department store in Ottawa, Canada. Already in early February, we've opened a stunning store in the new Miami Design District.","Let\u2019s now turn to the Asia Pacific region. On a constant exchange rate basis total sales rose 7% in the quarter and comp rose 3% on top of a 4% comp increase in last years quarter. While the full year, total sales rose 10% and comps rose 4% on top of an 11% comp increase in 2013.","Translated into U.S. dollars, Asia Pacific sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter due to favorable average price in mix partly offset by some unit declines. Sales in the full year rose 9% due to favorable average jewelry pricing mix as well as higher jewelry units sold.","Quarterly sales performance in Asia Pacific on a constant exchange rate basis was led by strong growth in China, Australia and Singapore, partly offset by softness in Hong Kong. While for the full year we were pleased to achieve broad based growth in most countries.","Sales in greater China was a total of 45 stores in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau continue to represent more than half of Asia Pacific region sales in 2014.","Starting in the third quarter, Tiffany has seen a mark softening in sales results in Hong Kong and we're also experiencing weakness in Macau. We believe that some tourists may be diverting their travels to other markets or perhaps increasing their spending locally.","So we concluded 2014 operating 73 Tiffany stores in the Asia Pacific region versus 72 at the end of the 2013. Opening only one store in this region during the year in Adelaide, Australia is not indicative of our planned rate of annual expansion. However three stores that we have planned to open in the region last year were temporarily delayed.","Two of those stores in China in the MixC mall in Hangzhou, and in the New World Daimaru Department Store in Shanghai have already opened this year. It was certainly a volatile year for us in Japan, dealing with the effect of an increase in the consumption tax on April 1, followed by the effect of a weakening Yen and then an economic recession.","When measured in Yen, total sales in Japan increased 1% in the fourth quarter due to favorability in average pricing mix, mostly offset by decline in jewelry units sold.","For the full year, a 4% total sales increase in Yen was due to favorable price and mix also partly offset by a decline in jewelry units sold. Comp store sales declined 5% in Yen in the quarter versus an 8% increase in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and comps increased 1% for the full year versus a 10% increase in 2013.","So while we definitely had our challenges in Japan in 2014, we believe our two year run rate is respectable.","The Yen weakened 8% on average against the U.S. dollar in 2014 and that's after weakening about 20% on average in 2013.","Therefore when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 13% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. Such a substantial move in the Yen has clearly caused softness and spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan.","In addition although we have seen a gradual increase in spending by Chinese tourists in Japan, overall spending by foreign tourists visiting Japan is still not yet meaningful for us. During 2014, we opened two stores in Japan in Kobe and in the Shinjuku section of Tokyo and finished the year operating 56 Tiffany stores.","Now turning to Europe, we also faced some macro economic challenges but nonetheless performed well. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter led by growth in our three major continental European markets of Germany, Italy, and France and comp store sales rose 4%. Our net basis for the full year total sales rose 6% but comp stores declined 1%.","Sales in the U.K. represented about 40% of total Europe in 2014 and its performance was relatively softer than Continental Europe in both the quarter and full year.","The Euro and the Pound weakened against the U.S. dollar in 2014. Therefore when translated into U.S. dollars, total European sales in the fourth quarter were flat with the prior year with no significant changes in jewelry units sold, price or mix, while conversely for the full year, total sales rose 6% due to similar favorability in jewelry units sold average price and mix.","Those weaker currencies have likely contributed to the attractiveness of shopping in Europe and foreign tourist spending represents approximately a quarter of our European sales.","During 2014, we expanded Tiffany's presence in Paris with the opening of the major store on the important Champs Elysees. The prominent point of location is enjoying a successful first year serving foreign tourists as well as for Asians and it has been important complement to Tiffany's other stores on Rue de La Paix and in the galleries Lafayette and Printemps department stores. We finished the year operating 38 stores in Europe.","Rounding out the geographies is our other segment which primarily consist the retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as wholesale diamond sales and some licensing revenues.","In the fourth quarter, other sales increased 12% due to incremental sales from our store that we opened in Moscow in February 2014, while comp store sales declined 8% due to soft demand in the five stores we operate in UAE. Although I should add that this compared with the strong 23% comp increase in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","For the full year, other sales rose 26% partly due to the Moscow store sales as well as an 8% increase in comp store sales. So in total, we opened eight company operated Tiffany & Co stores in 2014 and closed two.","That net addition of six stores was a 2% increase in our store base and a 3% increase in worldwide square footage. You should also keep in mind that beyond opening new stores we are equally focused on enhancing the quality of our existing store base and as such we will be pursuing a number of relocations and some major renovations in 2015.","We are currently planning to increase our company operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores during 2015. A majority of that net addition is planned in Asia Pacific with the balance in the Americas and Europe. In total, this will represent a 4% to 5% net increase in our company operated store base and in worldwide square footage.","Looking at regional sales productivity in 2014, total sales and dollars per growth square foot for company operated stores was unchanged at approximately $3100. By region, the ranking remained unchanged from the prior year with Asia Pacific continuing to rank highest with $5,000 productivity versus $4800 in 2013, followed by Japan at $3400 versus $3800 in 2013, then Europe at $3200 down from $3300 in 2013, to the Americas at $2500 per square foot up from $2400 in 2013.","At this point it's also worth mentioning the effectiveness of Tiffany's omni-channel platform. Our company operated store base as complemented by e-commerce enabled websites in 13 countries and informational sites in several others.","We have a dual objective of generating ecommerce sales growth in each region, but importantly also communicating Tiffany's brand and product message to consumers in order to drive store traffic as well. Total e-commerce sales continue to represent 6% of net worldwide sales in 2014.","There was a noteworthy merchandising highlights in 2014. First, we were pleased to experience growth in all major categories for the year led by growth in our fashion jewelry categories and specifically in gold jewelry.","We also saw a healthy growth in engagement jewelry in 2014, but only modest growth in the statement fine and solitaire category. From a worldwide price stratification perspective there was sales growth in every price strata above $500, up to statement jewelry above $50,000.","Following on the successful launch in 2013 is the exciting reinterpretation of our Atlas collection, our design team created another success with their modern innovative new Tiffany T collection.","Ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to $20,000, the Tiffany T collection is targeted towards stylish female self purchase customers, as well as attracting gift purchasers. And as intended its appeal is global.","Consistent with our brand strategy, it's worth noting that Tiffany T continues our evolution toward introducing compelling designs at higher price points. And in its first few months, is generating the highest ever average transaction size for a new fashion jewelry collection at Tiffany.","On a related note, while both Atlas and Tiffany T incorporate the use of various precious metals, we have seen a clear preference for the gold design. In fact that trend is evidenced throughout the fashion jewelry category, with considerable strength in gold jewelry sales being partly offset by the softness in silver jewelry sales especially in that price strata under $500.","I should also call up the resurgence of our Keys collection originally introduced in 2009 but expanded over the past two years with a beautiful new designs incorporating colored gemstones as well as rose gold.","I mentioned sales growth in the engagement jewelry category, which is led of course by the popularity of our iconic six pronged setting. A strong addition to the engagement category has been the harmony engagement ring, which in just over two years has become our second best selling style in our bridal assortment. And sales of wedding band rings in the engagement category were strong in the year.","Overall our sales growth in the engagement category was led by strength in the Asia Pacific and the Americas regions. The more modest sales increased in fine and solitaire jewelry in 2014 was spread among various collections and designs.","With noteworthy callouts being the classic Victoria collection with new styles added in 2014, and the beautiful Soleste collection, which is diamond-focused and was expanded in 2014 to incorporate greater use of colored stones.","As on aside and a possible explanation for some of the softness in fine and solitaire jewelry sales, especially in the fourth quarter, we've heard anecdotal speculation that strong demand for the Tiffany T collection may have pulled some demand from the fine jewelry category.","Lastly, while there was plenty of activity in high-end statement jewelry in 2014, worldwide sales of that category were about equal to the prior year's level.","I hope you now have a better understanding of Tiffany's top line performance in 2014, and I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark for that comprehensive sales review. Reflecting on 2014, I'd like to highlight a few important points before getting into the specifics.","We are effectively executing our strategies to continue to strengthen and elevate the Tiffany brand. In 2014, we expanded our global footprint in key locations, we strengthened our position in the important fashion jewelry category with the introduction of the Tiffany T collection, and we advanced key product development initiatives for introduction in 2015 and beyond.","We improved gross margin and operating margin, while increasing our investment in marketing. And we strengthened or balance sheet by keeping our inventory growth to a lower rate in sales growth, and we lowered our cost of debt significantly, while extending maturities and generating strong free cash flow.","As we exited 2014, we were clearly facing challenges in 2015 from the strong U.S. dollar. Tourist purchases are expected to continue to be pressured in Americas, gross margin is expected to improve in 2015, but at a lesser rate than in 2014, and negative translation is expected to continue to mute sales and earnings growth.","However, we have the ability to continue to invest in the Tiffany brand and improve our capabilities to continue to deliver value for our shareholders over time.","Now that I've framed that overall message, let's take a look at the rest of the components in the earning statement that, excluding charges in 2014 and 2013, contributed to deliver our -- contributed to our delivering the 13% increase in net earnings for the full year.","Gross margin in the year rose 1.6 points to 59.7%, benefiting from favorable product input cost, price increases taken earlier in the year, and a sales mix that moved favorably toward our higher margin fashion jewelry category later in the year.","Gross margin in the fourth quarter was three-tenth of a point higher than the prior year. We're continuing to experience some benefit from favorable product input costs, which we believe will help gross margin in 2015.","From a pricing perspective, the substantial weakening of the yen, euro and pound would normally result in our taking price increases in those regions to fully offset the negative impacts. However, in light of the magnitude of those currency swings and considering local conditions, we are taking only measured price increases in this first quarter. As a result, we expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in the full year, partly due to a combination of higher labor and other store related cost, as well as a substantial increase as expected in marketing spending.","In fact, for the full year, we increased marketing spending to 6.7% of net sales from 6.3% in 2013. SG&A expenses rose only 1% in the fourth quarter as higher marketing spending was mostly offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar.","I think most of you know that about 80% of our SG&A expenses are fixed in nature. And we have said that we require a mid-single-digit comp store sales increase to gain leverage on those costs. Therefore, our sales growth in 2014 was not sufficient to achieve the leverage on those costs.","Based on our current sales outlook, we expect SG&A expenses will increase at a greater rate than sales growth in 2015. This expected increase in the expense ratio partially reflects our store expansion and marketing plans, but also reflects a meaningful increase of approximately $30 million of non-cash expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions, principally reflecting lower interest rates for our U.S. pension and post retiring benefit plans. In fact, that $30 million increase alone restrains EPS growth in 2015 by $0.15 per diluted share.","Operating earnings on a non-GAAP basis declined 3% in the fourth quarter and rose 12% in the full year when excluding the arbitration charge in 2013, as well as a smaller expense in that year related to staffing and occupancy reductions.","The operating margin rose to 21% in the full year 2014 versus an adjusted 19.7% in 2013 and a margin of 18.4% in 2012. Our expectation calls for operating earnings in 2015 to be about equal to the prior year.","As you probably know, we have redeemed $400 million of long-term debt in the third quarter and issued $550 million of debt. This was a significant step in lowering our interest cost and extending maturities.","The net effect of these debt transactions was a $15 million reduction in interest expense, or $3 million to $4 million per quarter, which we began to experience in the fourth quarter, and is incorporated in our full year projection of approximately $50 million of interest and other expense in 2015.","The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the fourth quarter and 34.4% in the full year. The effective tax rates in 2013 were 36.1% in the fourth quarter and 34.8% in the full year, when excluding the charge for the inverse arbitration ruling. We expect the effective tax rate in 2015 to be about equivalent to the rate in 2014.","So, adding it all up, net earnings were $196 million in the fourth quarter and were 3% higher than net earnings of $190 million in last year's fourth quarter, excluding the arbitration related charge.","For the full year, net earnings were $484 million or $3.73 per share, compared with $181 million or $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year. However, excluding those charges in both years, net earnings rose 13% to $545 million or $4.20 per share, up from $481 million or $3.73 per share in 2013.","Our balance sheet was strong at January 31, 2015. Net inventories rose 2% in 2014 to finish the year at $2.4 billion. The overall increase supported new stores, product introductions and expanded offerings, and we were pleased with the level of inventory availability in our stores.","The 2% increase included a 4% increase in finished goods and a 2% decrease in combined raw materials and work in process inventories. Inventories would have grown 6% and still below to the rate of sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation.","In addition, I believe you all understand that the year-end inventory level was impacted by the unanticipated sales softness in the fourth quarter.","So, whether measured in dollars or on a constant exchange rate basis, both the 2% and 6% increases respectively met our long-term objective to keep growth and inventories below sales growth. Our 2015 plan calls for minimal inventory growth in dollars in the full year.","Accounts receivable rose 3% in 2014 to $195 million, in line with sales growth. Receivables are turning at 21 times per year. Capital expenditures were $247 million in 2014. That was an increase from $221 million in 2013 due to increased spending on systems and internal manufacturing capacity.","CapEx was 6% of worldwide net sales versus 5% in the prior year. Approximately half of our capital spending goes towards store openings, renovations, and relocations. We are forecasting CapEx around $260 million for 2015.","We spent $5 million in the fourth quarter to repurchase 53,000 shares. In the full year, we spent $27 million and bought 301,000 shares at an average cost just under $90 per share. At year end, we had $273 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017.","We believe that share repurchases and dividend growth are appropriate long-term measures to return excess cash to shareholders. Putting it all together, we generated free cash flow of $368 million which included the effect of $61 million after-tax debt extinguishment charge and expect to generate free cash flow exceeding $400 million in 2015.","We finished 2014 with a solid balance sheet and liquidity. Total short term and long-term debt was $1.1 billion with 39% of six stockholders equity versus $1 billion and 37% a year ago.","Tiffany\u2019s return on assets and stockholders equity were 10% and 17% respectively in 2014 and clearly meeting our long-term objectives for at least 10% ROA and a 15% ROE.","Turning to our financial forecasts for 2015, I've already highlighted our assumptions for the operating margin, interest and other expenses and the effective tax rate. In terms of our sales forecast, we believe that taking a cautious view in certain markets is appropriate in light of what we saw in the fourth quarter specifically the strength of the U.S. dollar, as well as challenging conditions in certain markets.","In total we are planning a mid single digit percent increase in worldwide net sales in local currencies which would translate into low single digit increase in dollars for the full year.","While we don\u2019t typically talk about quarterly forecasts, we think you should be aware that we have a very difficult comparison in Japan to a 30% comp increase in last year's first quarter. And we have also continued to experience softness in the Americas, both of which will contribute to a forecasted 10% sales decline in the first quarter on a reported basis in U.S. dollars.","Combined with our assumptions for operating margin interest expense and the effective tax rate, we are forecasting minimal growth in the full year EPS over the $4.20 per share excluding charges that Tiffany earned in 2014.","This was not indicative in any way of Tiffany's long-term earnings power, but it is a reflection of the various near-in macro challenges currently affecting us.","As I mentioned, the expected minimal EPS growth in 2015 incorporates the non-cash increase in employee benefit related expenses costing $0.15 per share or about 4% of earnings growth and of course it\u2019s safe to add that the strong U.S. dollar is costing us a few percentage points of earnings growth. So without those two factors we would have been looking at high single digit increase in EPS.","The change between our original preliminary 2015 guidance that we provided in January calling for low to mid single digit increase in net earnings for the year and our current forecast of minimal earnings growth in 2015, is essentially the result of the added non-cash pension expense and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since then.","I would now like to highlight the phasing of our expected sales and earnings in 2015 which will be affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Japan's volatility in 2014 and the timing of marketing spending.","From a quarterly perspective based on the top line challenges in this first quarter, we expect that first quarter EPS could be 30% lower than the $0.97 we\u2019ve earned last year, which had represented a 49% increase over the prior year.","We expect that the second quarter will also show a net earnings decline, but at a more modest rate pressured by the continuation of the strong dollar and substantial marketing spending tied to the watch launch.","And then we expect net earnings to grow by double-digit percentages in both the third and fourth quarters. So just to make it clear, our sales and earnings plan assume progressively improving performance as we move through the year.","In conclusion, I joined Tiffany just about a year ago, since then we\u2019ve been focusing on a number of fronts including but not limited to effectively allocating resources for growth, driving improvements in cost and inventory management, and doing all of this in a tax efficient manner. I\u2019m very excited about our opportunities to grow Tiffany's business in increasingly profitable and productive way.","I presume you all are aware that Tiffany's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Kowalski, will be retiring from Tiffany on March 31, and remain as non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On April 1, Frederic Cumenal, currently Tiffany's President will become CEO.","I am now very pleased to turn the call over to Frederic.","Frederic Cumenal","Thanks Ralph. Thanks Ralph and Mark and good morning everyone. I'm glad to have this opportunity to briefly share with you my thoughts about Tiffany's business and our exciting plan.","First, I believe we achieved good financial results in 2014, but certainly finished the year on a disappointing note primary in the Americas. While we know about the unavoidable challenges rising from the strong US dollar, we can and we\u2019ll be nimble in fine-tuning product developments and marketing communications.","Most important, we have a clear roadmap for the future focused on the store experience, products, marketing, logistics, and margin improvement. I\u2019m pleased with the progress that our company made in 2014 in these areas that I believe will drive our longer term success.","That strategic direction focuses on continued elevation as a global luxury brand. In our stores, we are striving to better engage customers through a more consultative approach and with enhanced visual merchandising presentation.","Over the next couple of years, we would strengthen our abilities when we finish developing a global CRM system and are able to better analyze our customer base and shopping partners.","We opened some major stores in key markets in 2014 and I'm particularly speaking of the new ones in Paris and Moscow. Our strategy includes further investing in our distribution base with new stores likely at the rate of 10 to 15 stores per year when we find the right opportunities, but also enhancing the impressions we create with customers through renovations, relocations, and even some select clothing's.","In 2014, we increased our focus on the stylish female sales purchase customer when we introduced the dramatic and innovative Tiffany T collection, following the successfully debut in 2013 of our reinterpreted Atlas collection.","Our strategy includes launching additional collections in the coming years. But our design group will also be refreshing our product assortments with important new interpretations of our iconic collections.","In April, we will proudly introduce to the world CT-60 a major new collection of watches as the first step in a long-term investment to be a meaningful watch business.","To enhance our growth potential last year, our talented marketing team further developed impactful messages of customer relevance. Operationally, we've continued to expand our capabilities in manufacturing and sourcing, while focused on maximizing the efficiencies of that supply chain, which should enable us to further improve our gross margins in the coming years.","From an IT perspective, we're continuing to invest in new systems to support our long-term objectives. So we enter 2015 with many plans but also with the cautious short-term view regarding the external challenges and uncertainties affecting our business.","We believe that planning for modest sales growth and minimal earning growth is both prudent and justifiable. However, we remain constantly focused on that strategic roadmap I referred you by investing in various facets of our business to achieve healthy results over the long term.","We have made key additions to our management team in the past couple of years both in New York and in our regions which reinforces my confidence and our ability to achieve our long term goal.","Tiffany has accumulated an amazing heritage since its funding 178 years ago.

Today's call is being recorded.","Participating on today's call is Mr. Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Mark Erceg, Tiffany Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","I will turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron.","Mark Aaron","Thank you and good day, everyone. On today's call, I am pleased to have our CEO Alessandro Bogliolo and; and our CFO, Mark Erceg here with me, to share some observations, insights and commentary about Tiffany's recent performance, strategies, and outlook. We will then allow time to answer your questions, and I should add, that going forward we will take questions on all future calls as well.","Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Except as required by applicable law or regulation.","Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, as well as the required reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures referenced in this presentation to their comparable GAAP measures, is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K filed earlier today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. Both filings could be found on Tiffany's investor web site, www.tiffany.com, by selecting financial information in the left hand column.","So I believe we can now proceed, and I will turn the call over to Alessandro.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I would like to share a few thoughts with all of you and then later, we will be pleased to answer your questions. As you know, I joined Tiffany last October, and I can tell you that I am increasingly excited about the capabilities of this amazing company, the growth opportunities available to us and the very talented and dedicated people work here in all aspects of our business.","In my first six months, I have been pursuing a strategic assessment of our business with my senior management colleagues, and with active review by our Board of Directors. We all believe that our brand is remarkably powerful.","Our mission is to be makers of beauty, creators of joy. Simply put, Tiffany brings beautiful enduring designs to larger than life, that would be cherished for generations.","Our artisans craft some of the world's finest jewelry, timepieces and accessories, yet everybody's ultimate purpose at Tiffany is to create memorable moments of joy for our customers.","We have also agreed on the strategic direction that we must follow. One, that I would characterize somewhat as an evolution of where Tiffany has been. But we also agree, that we need to accelerate the pace of execution of those strategies, and we need to increase the required investment spending to achieve the sustainable sales and earnings growth that I believe Tiffany is capable of.","The outcome of our strategic review is a set of six priorities, that will be totally focused on as we move forward.","Now the first priority is amplifying an evolved brand message. We have already begun to see some evolution in our marketing communications, through a variety of media. The above messaging will be more evident to you, as the year progresses, and one example is our recent Believe in Love marketing campaign.","Our second priority is renewing our product offerings and financing the in-store presentation. We will accomplish that through an accelerated rate of product introductions across all categories. Specifically, our new jewelry design and innovation workshop will be instrumental in developing more distinctive units in jewelry.","Importantly, we have also planned and allocated resources to evolve the visual merchandising of assortments in our stores.","Third, while Tiffany has made progress in its e-commerce past years, our efforts are now focused on delivering a seamless omnichannel customer experience. We all know that our customers are more fluid than ever in their shopping, and we must enhance our capabilities and functionalities to match the growing and evolving expectations, whether in Tiffany stores or on our web sites.","As we grow our business, our fourth priority is to calculate a more efficient operating model. We intend to achieve that through the continuation of a major revamp of our IT systems, and their vision of selected core processes, such as procurement, all while restraining expense growth when appropriate, so that we can ultimately drive margin growth.","Our fifth priority is to inspire and align an agile organization to win. I said before, that Tiffany organization is filled with talented and dedicated people, and I would add passionate to that description. Now, with a clear direction and a shared sense of urgency, everyone from our longest tenured to our newest colleagues, is called upon to focus on healthy and sustainable acceleration of growth.","Following from all of these initiatives, is the final priority to strengthen our competitive position and lead in key markets. The global jewelry and luxury industry is competitively fragmented, and our brand strength and global reach position us very well. Our regional teams are empowered to leverage their relationships with customers, and that the power of our physical and digital network to increase the brand relevance, and thus market share in local communities.","As I said on the last call, I accepted this position because I strongly believe that the Tiffany and Co. brand is healthy, but it also has tremendous opportunities to grow. At least in line with, if not better than our industry peers.","As we move forward, we will leverage our core strength and adapt as appropriate, while of course, always remaining true to our heritage and brand integrity.","Well, I will stop here and allow Mark and Mark to make some comments before we take your questions. I will just add that I look forward to meeting some of you in the coming weeks and months, and appreciate your interest in this great company. Thank you.","Mark Aaron","Thanks Alessandro for sharing those insights. Now let's look at the financial results. I hope all of you on the call have had an opportunity to read the news release, so I will just focus on some key highlights of our performance.","These fourth quarter sales results are pretty consistent with the holiday sales reports that we reported in January, which had indicated improvements in our business by region and across product categories. We had varying degrees of sales growth in the quarter in all regions, ranging from total sales growth of 13% in Europe to 2% in Japan. Although the performance was a bit different when viewed on a constant exchange rate basis.","We also had growth in all product categories, ranging from the strongest growth in the Jewelry Collections category, to fractional growth in the Engagement Jewelry category, and that regional sales growth was driven by increased unit volume.","We saw a decline in gross margin in the quarter, as we expected, and an increase in SG&A expense, and net earnings were pretty much in line with our forecast.","Let's look at performance in each regions; in the Americas after beginning 2017 with declining sales, there was some improvement as the year progressed, and we were pleased to finish the year with a solid sales increase in total, and on a comp basis in the fourth quarter, that was generated by continued increase in jewelry units sold. E-commerce sales also had a solid increase in the quarter and full year.","Sales growth in the quarter was geographically broad based across the U.S., Canada and Latin America, and it was largely comprised of higher spending attributed to local customers.","While spending attributed to foreign tourists in the quarter was unchanged from the prior year, that is nonetheless an improvement from the past couple of years, when we face the challenge of a strong U.S. dollar and its negative repercussions on tourist spending here.","For all of 2017, we estimate that the spending attributed to foreign tourists represented a bit less than 20% of the U.S. sales. It was modest store activity in the region, and we finished 2017 operating 124 stores in the Americas, including 94 in the U.S., 13 in Canada and 17 in Latin America.","In addition to opening one store, we also tested some top-up stores in the latter part of the year, that we do not include in the store count, and have been quite pleased with their results. And as we noted on our last call, we renovated the fourth floor of our New York Flagship store to showcase our new home and accessories collection and to open our first ever Blue Box Caf\u00e9, which has fast become a New York tradition.","Results of the Asia Pacific region were mixed in the fourth quarter and in the full year as well, but total Asia Pacific sales did increase in every quarter in 2017, partly reflecting the opening of new stores.","We were pleased with sales growth in Mainland China throughout the year and we returned to growth in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter, after three years of declines. Sales in greater China represented roughly 60% of Asia Pacific region sales in 2017, similar to the prior year. Results were less favorable in some other countries, which we attribute at least partly to lower spending by Chinese tourists. However, it's worth noting very strong, wholesale sales growth in Korea throughout the year, which, while not included in our comp store sales, reflect duty free sales demand that we attribute largely to Chinese tourists.","Overall, jewelry unit volume was up in both the fourth quarter and year. During the year, we opened five stores in the Asia Pacific region, closed three, relocated four and renovated many, and finished the year operating 87 stores in the region.","We were pleased with results in Japan throughout the year, although results fluctuated from quarter-to-quarter due to some difficult year-over-year comparisons. Most spending in Japan is attributed to local customers, and there was no discernible pattern to changes in unit volume and price in the quarter or the year. We closed one store in Japan in 2017 and finished the year operating 54 stores.","In Europe, total sales increased in the quarter and full year, as reported in dollars, primarily reflecting the translation effect of stronger European currencies, and through major new store openings in Milan and Moscow, which we believe negatively affected existing store sales.","Performance was soft across much of the region and the U.K. continued to represent about 40% of European sales. In addition, the growth was largely generated by higher spending that we attribute to local customers, which we estimate represent about three quarters of our European sales. And we were pleased with growth in jewelry unit volume in both periods.","The picture was a bit different in Europe on a constant exchange rate basis, while total sales rose in both periods, but to a lesser extent, and as reported in dollars, comp store sales on that basis declined in both periods. During the year, we opened three stores in Europe and finished the year with 46 stores in the region.","Other sales growth in the quarter and year, primarily resulted from increased wholesale sales of diamonds. We also operate four stores in the UAE and comparable store sales rose modestly.","In terms of the sales productivity, for the year, we achieved worldwide sales per square foot for company operated stores, up $2,700 in 2017, which was approximately in line with 2016. This resulted from our sales growth and the 3% increase in square footage.","By region, sales productivity ranged from $3,800 in the Asia Pacific to $3,600 in Japan, to $2,300 in Europe, and to $2,200 per square foot in the Americas. Now keep in mind, that these productivity levels are calculated in U.S. dollars, so the numbers could vary, based on currency changes.","Looking at the coming year, we are currently planning to open nine stores, including at least one in each region, close two stores, and relocate at least 15 existing stores, primarily in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and continue to renovate many stores. This is all expected to equate to an increase in global square footage of approximately 2%.","Beyond stores, we are increasingly looking at an overall omnichannel perspective. You just heard Alessandro say that we will be more focused on optimizing our omnichannel presence and capabilities. We were pleased with e-commerce sales growth in the quarter and the year, which worldwide, increased at a slightly faster pace than overall sales growth. We also believe that a complete omnichannel view should include not only e-commerce sales, but also sales generated through our catalogs.","Taking that full view, indicates those non-retail sales accounted for 7% of worldwide sales in 2017, which was consistent with the past two years. I should add that beginning with the first quarter of 2018, we will report comparable sales for the periods presented on an omnichannel basis, which combines company operated retail store sales performance, with sales generated by our web sites and catalogs.","Lastly, we still strongly believe that our web site and catalogs, also serve as a powerful information source and are catalysts for customers to visit our stores for unique in-store experience.","There are several things to point out regarding product performance. First, from a reporting perspective, you should note that we are now combining the previously reported Fashion Jewelry and the High, Fine and Solitaire Jewelry categories into one new category called Jewelry Collections to parallel the way that we are now internally analyzing our jewelry assortments, as well as reflecting how customers shop for jewelry.","Additionally, the designs of Jean Schlumberger, which was previously reported within the High, Fine and Solitaire Jewelry category, has been reclassified into the Designer Jewelry category, and we made no changes to the Engagement Jewelry category.","You can see this new presentation of product category sales by region in the report on Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC this morning.","Looking at it the old way or the new way, we were pleased with improving sales trends as the year progressed. The Jewelry Collections category posted growth throughout the year, with improvement over the course of the year, and finished the year on a strong note. Sales in the designer jewelry category increased in the quarter and the year, and the Engagement Jewelry category finished the year, with a fractional sales increase in the fourth quarter, but it's full year sales were lower than 2016.","Complementing jewelry as our collection of watches, and we were very pleased with sales growth in 2017, and our new home and accessories collection gave a strong boost to that area, when it was launched in the fourth quarter.","Speaking of innovation, it was a relatively active year. In addition to the Home and Accessories collection, we introduced the Tiffany hardware jewelry collection, and added new designs in existing Jewelry Collections, such as within the Tiffany T, Return to Tiffany and the Keys Collections. We introduced the Tiffany Metro watch collection, and we launched our new signature fragrance with great success.","But as Alessandro said earlier, one of our strategic priorities is to accelerate the rate of product introductions. As one example, we will soon launch a new jewelry collection, focused on platinum and diamonds, our first in many years, and there will certainly be other newness during the year.","I hope you now have a good understanding of our sales performance from a geographical and product perspective, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg for some comments on the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet and our 2018 guidance.","Mark Erceg","Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. From a financial standpoint, 2017 was an interesting year. On the one hand, comparable store sales were flat, which is clearly below our long term growth target. On the other hand, while net earnings per share declined, due to tax charges, net earnings per share on a pro forma basis, excluding charges in both years, were up 10%. We also generated very strong cash flow, with $932 million of cash flow from operations and $693 million of free cash flow for the year. Finally, we returned significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends, where we increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and through the repurchase of $99 million of stock, at an average price of $95 per share.","The cash flow generation in 2017 certainly reflected strong earnings. In addition, an increase in accounts payable was partly tied to more effective management of payables, but also to the timing of inventory purchases in the fourth quarter, and lastly, tax payments were lower.","Now these results tell me several things; first, we are doing a much better job managing cost, as evidenced by the fact that for the full year, SG&A expense as a percentage of sales, again, on a pro forma basis, excluding charges in 2016, was virtually flat versus prior year for the first time in four years.","Second, although we slightly increased marketing support as a percentage of sales during 2017, we should be investing more to support and amplify the Tiffany brand, which we believe has tremendous upside potential.","Third, having finished the year at $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, and with short term and long term total debt, representing only 31% of stockholders equity, we have the financial strength to continue investing in our business, and also return cash to our shareholders.","Ultimately, our long term objective is to drive solid and sustainable growth in both comparable store and online sales, to increase customer visits and higher conversion rates, in order to drive higher total sales, expand margins, and grow earnings.","Being mindful of the fact that these long term goals will only be achieved, if we increase investment now, and properly execute the strategic priorities Alex has laid out, we are maintaining our guidance for the coming year, which we had disclosed on a preliminary basis, excluding the potential impact of recent U.S. tax reform, back in January.","Specifically, we expect 2018 pre-tax earnings to be flat to slightly down from last year, and net earnings to increase over last year's non-GAAP earnings, after taking into account a lower tax rate.","Importantly, in saying this, we acknowledge that pro forma earnings per share just grew by 10% in the year, when comparable store sales were flat, and while we expect an improvement in comparable store sales growth during 2018, we are also planning to make significant investments in technology, marketing and communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentation. These are all investments which we believe are ultimately needed to generate sustained mid-single digit sales and high single digit earnings per share growth.","With that said, let's take a few minutes to discuss U.S. corporate tax reform, which reduced the statutory corporate tax rate to 21%, but also added several new complexities, impacting both our 2017 results, as well as future earnings.","The $1.17 per share charge we reported during the fourth quarter of 2017 on a GAAP basis, was primarily comprised of three items; first, the transition tax is a onetime tax on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which drove a charge of $56 million or $0.45 per share.","Second, we were required to remeasure the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, to reflect the new statutory rate of 21%, which resulted in a tax charge of $95 million or $0.76 per share.","Finally, since the new tax law went into effect January 1 -- but our fiscal year ended January 31, we realized a $5 million or $0.04 per share benefit from having a lower statutory tax rate in the U.S. in effect for one month.","With respect to the 2017 transition tax, the cash tax payment will be made in installments over an eight year period beginning in 2018. The expected tax implications for 2018 and beyond, likely will require a bit more explanation.","For many companies, particularly those of little to no domestic manufacturing and quick inventory turns, the effect of a change in the U.S. corporate tax rate may be realized in the financial statements, immediately post enactment. However, because we manufacture a large portion of our jewelry in the U.S., sell it to our international affiliates and have relatively long inventory turns, we expect to see a gradual phasing in, before we realize the full benefit of the lower statutory rate.","This is because while we pay tax on the intercompany profit on these sales from the U.S. to our international affiliates, when the intercompany sale occurs, U.S. GAAP requires that the profit and the associated U.S. tax expense be deferred for financial reporting purposes, until the merchandise is sold by our global affiliates to our customers.","The simple way to think about it is, that when our global affiliates sell merchandise, they purchase intercompany from the U.S. Prior to 2018, the associated tax on the intercompany profit recognized from the sale of that merchandise, will reflect the historical 35% statutory tax rate.","As a practical matter, this means we will not realize the full benefit of U.S. tax reform, until all of the individual items our global affiliates had on hand, or were in transit, as of December 31, 2017 are physically sold.","With this understanding, we expect an overall 2018 effective tax rate of somewhere in the high 20% area, before seeing a further stepdown in rate in 2019.","Now with respect to the balance of the 2018 P&L, there is just a handful of things we'd like to point out. We have built our 2018 financial plan assuming mid single digit sales growth, the majority of which we expect to come from comparable sales growth.","Gross margin should expand, due to somewhat lower diamond input costs, with the balance coming from product mix and pricing, including a low single digit price increase. But SG&A expense growth, due to the investments we will be making, is expected to exceed worldwide sales growth. So all in, our sales and earnings guidance implies a decline in operating margin in 2018.","However, once higher levels of SG&A spending are annualized, and assuming healthy sales growth, we expect to resume operating margin expansion in 2019 and beyond, and to reiterate what we have said before, we do not believe there is any structural barrier, which would preclude Tiffany from meaningfully improving its operating margin over the long term.","One of the key projects we are investing behind, is our foundational information technology platforms. A year ago, you may recall, that we took a $25 million charge to write-off certain developmental efforts associated with our IT replatforming. Today, we are pleased to report that we recently stood up our first key geographic market, as we continue to work towards the development of our new information systems platform, as part of a multiyear rollout plan, which when completed, is expected to dramatically improve our business and omnichannel capabilities.","Interest and other expenses should be roughly in line with 2017 levels. All of this, excluding taxes, including the effect of the recent changes to U.S. corporate tax law, would be expected to result in 2018 earnings per share being flat to slightly down from 2017's net earnings per diluted share on a pro forma basis. However, after factoring in and passing through the full benefit of a 2018 overall effective tax rate, somewhere in the high 20s, we expect net earnings to increase to somewhere between $4.25 to $4.45 per diluted share. Within that, we expect first quarter earnings to be up versus a year ago, after which the phasing in of increased investment spending should have some effect on year-over-year earnings growth over the balance of the year.","We are planning for inventory growth, in line with sales growth in 2018, as we invest more in certain categories, and anticipate CapEx spending continuing between 6% and 7% of sales.","Based on our forecast for net earnings, in the balance sheet, we are projecting approximately $660 million of cash flow from operations and approximately $380 million of free cash flow in 2018, which is lower than the prior year, largely due to the timing of payables and taxes in late 2017.","So in summary, despite a moderate increase in top line performance in 2017, we delivered solid pro form earnings per share growth, strong cash results and continue to return cash to our shareholders. Our brand remains strong, and we have a clear set of strategic priorities, which we are committed to executing against, as well as the balance sheet to fund those activities; and by making the clear declaration, that we are going to be managing this 108 year old business for the long term benefit of our shareholders, we are investing what we believe requires to generate solid returns and drive sustainable, mid-single digit sales and high single digit earnings per share growth annually over the long term.","I will now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Well thanks Mark and Alessandro. And now I will turn the call back to the operator, so we can answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go first with David Schick from Consumer Edge Research.","David Schick","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just a quick question on any impact of Chinese New Year movement into mid-February from late January, and how you feel about the fourth quarter numbers?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, thank you, David for your question. Well as you all know, Chinese New Year shifted a little bit compared to the previous year. So this had a slight effect on our retail sales, but actually, the way we look at the results, is every year, we try to neutralize these effects of shifting in calendar, so [ph] there was this effect.","David Schick","Okay. So you feel, it did not affect the reported regional comp for 4Q?","Alessandro Bogliolo","[indiscernible].","David Schick","Okay. And then the second question is, you know, sort of a bigger picture question is, there is a lot of moving pieces to what you are talking about, with your -- and thanks so much for laying out the six pieces of the strategic planning. Some of which are adding costs in the near term as different revenue drivers go at work. I guess, a sense for all of us on the call, of how much is undoing older initiatives, whether it's around IT, some of the things that were already started, certainly in merchandising or in the in-store presentation, or the digital, so how much is an unwind versus an amplification or an acceleration of projects that have been going on, for say a year or longer?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well I guess, your question refers maybe to a write-off we had some years ago, about certain investments in our IT technology. But honestly, okay, that was few years ago, but honestly, what I see is not really about unwinding, about restructuring or cutting, but it's really about building. I think that, when it comes to the barriers aspects of our business, you can call it the infrastructure, the technology, we had a lot to build there, for future growth. Likewise, when it comes to the product offering, we have a very strong product offering, but we are really committed to come with more newness and more distinctive newness, but honestly I think that the brand after six months in the job, is really healthy. So it's not about curing problems, but actually to build on a very solid basis.","David Schick","Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","We will go next go to Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks guys. On the relaunch of Home, I am curious what you learned, what did you work and what's next on that product line? And if you can share comp performance of that line of business in the fourth quarter, how much of that helped 4Q comps? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Sure. Thank you for your questions. Actually, Home and Accessories has been a very meaningful test for us, because it has been substantial newness that has been introduced in that product category, with the leadership of Reed Krakoff, and for me, it was meaningful price.","First of all, for sales, because actually it has generated a nice double digit growth in that category, which of course, is important and we are pleased with. But it was even more important for me, because of the reaction of the consumer to meaningful innovation. And in retrospect, the test was extremely positive and this is what makes me confident about accelerating the pace of innovation, because we can see and we can measure that when we do something new, that is truly innovative and different, consumers, customers, react in a very positive way. So the connection between customers and the brand is there and is solid.","Paul Lejuez","Anything particular within the line, that stood out as being a big driver of sales, versus maybe if it wasn't as successful?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Always referring to the Home and Accessories; well, that is a category that -- I mean, we call it one category, but in reality it's a mix of very different items, because it ranges from silver to gifts to crystals to many. So honestly, it has been an overall success, it is not being driven by a particular sub-category. So I will say, it was overall positive across the categories.","Paul Lejuez","Okay. Thank you guy. Good luck.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Simeon Siegel with Nomura.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good morning. Recognizing what looks like a January deceleration off a difficult compare, any color you could provide on current trends from then? And then just more broadly, Alessandro, can you talk about your store strategy? You have now successfully opened up pop-ups, it seems like you are looking for more remodels -- relocations, rather than in the past. So any change to how you are thinking about your stores versus the past? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. Thank you for the question. Well actually, what is really relevant for me, is going forward, about the stores; because the stores are really the place, where our customers can feel the entire experience of the brand, and when I say stores, I mean, of course, the physical stores, but let's not forget also the non-physical stores that are our web sites, where the traffic is huge. So stores are definitely one of the key areas of attention and the investment for us going forward, which doesn't mean to increase dramatically, the number of stores, it's not about that.","Our story is and want to be a story of like-for-like. But what we want to dramatically improve and modernize, is the experience for customers in our stores. So this is why we also mentioned, I think Mark was very clear about that, about this need of increasing investments in areas such as visual merchandising, store presentations, because we want to make a difference, and we are working on that, in order to finance the newness and the icons in our stores, for the benefit and better experience of our customers.","Simeon Siegel","Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide updated thoughts regarding the vertical integration of the supply chain? According to this morning's 10-K, I think 60% of your jewelry is still produced internally. Any color on vertical integration, how it should evolve this year and beyond would be appreciated?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you Laurent for your question, because I am very-very proud of our supply chain, because I really believe that Tiffany is really a best-in-class in our luxury when it comes to it, not only selling and marketing skills, but also to the craftsmanship, prototyping and manufacturing of products.","So it's true, we are a vertically integrated company, and we are in jewelry making, where you are right, but depends on the year, about 60%, 65% of our jewelry is manufactured, made in-house, in several sites in the U.S. And I think that this ratio, which is substantial, is a strength of the company, because this allows us to, first of all, to be independent when it comes to product capacity. But even more so, to really master the way we make the products and the cost of it. Now, I would never go to 100% of the internal production, because that would just make our system too rigid, but let's say, 60-40, two-third, one-third is a very-very healthy kind of ratio.","Now even more specific for Tiffany, differently from other global jewelers is our vertical integration in diamonds. Now for me, this is not only a strength, but is a real point of difference; because when it comes to diamonds, the fact that we have internal capabilities to cut and polish the rough diamond, that means that we master the craftmanship of diamonds, and this is one of the reasons, and an important one, why Tiffany is rightfully so, considered the brand that stands for diamonds in the market. It's of course, a matter of legacy, 130 years ago we designed the Tiffany setting, it's a matter of size, because of our sales volumes in this category, but it was a matter of expertise, and this is what really makes a brand great and set for leadership.","Simeon Siegel","Thank you for that. And as a follow-up, the prepared remarks called out strong cash flow generation tied to more effective management of payables and inventory purchases. Should we expect further opportunities around working capital in 2018? Are there any target metrics you are willing to share around inventory turns and days payable outstanding?","Mark Erceg","Yeah. It's a great question. One of the things we have been talking about, is the new information architecture and platforms that we are putting in place. One of the things that that will bring for us, is much better visibility across our payable spend pool. We have 35,000 active suppliers, and we don't currently have best in class systems to allow us to manage that appropriately. You will see us doing better with working capital, as a result of the initiatives that we are driving, capturing discount payment terms, getting to electronic receipt, all those types of things will make us a much more efficient company, and it will generate additional working capital on the positive side, which will help us then fund other investments that we may choose to make, as we drill out more product innovation, which may require slightly higher levels of inventory.","Mark Aaron","And let me just add, Laurent, I will just add that, we also did mention that there was a timing issue on some of that as well at the end of the quarter, and that's the reason that we are forecasting somewhat lower free cash flow for 2018. So yes, we are certainly getting more effective and efficient on that, but there was some timing shift from late 2017 into 2018.","Laurent Vasilescu","Thank you and best of luck.","Operator","We will go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good morning. Alessandro, as you review the business, have you found any other pockets of sales opportunities, be it categories or channels that the brand has not targeted before?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Lorraine, for your question. As we all know, the large majority of sales revenues of Tiffany is from jewelry. Now having -- so I would answer your question two ways; first, let's look at what is not jewelry. I mean, we have watches, that for me, is an absolute priority. It's something that is important for any jeweler in the world, is a category where the brand, even if we go back in history to Mr. Tiffany, was in the 19th century, very much devoted and interested in this, and it's a must. So this is a category, where I truly believe, we are putting a lot of efforts in it. We all know, that is a category where growth and development is slow, but we are absolutely determined to go that path, in order to achieve the position that this brand deserves in the world of watches and especially, women's watches.","Then, the Home and Accessories category, we just -- as I mentioned some comments before, it's an equally important one. I mean, Tiffany has a special competitive advantage in that area, and I think we should keep on exploiting it, as we have started redoing from the last quarter of 2017.","And there is fragrances, where last year has been very important for the launch of our new fragrance. It's through a license, as you know, but it's a product that is very poetic and that is in my opinion, perfectly in line with Tiffany, with the world of Tiffany, our values and also our customer's profile. So these are three, let me say, categories outside of jewelry, where we are totally focused on, and I think we will have a lot to do, but also great satisfaction going forward.","Now I would go back to the other 90% of the business, which is jewelry. When we talk about that, jewelry is a group of very diverse categories, subcategories usage price points, and I tell you, I see a lot of opportunities in the different segments of the jewelry where we operate. And if you want, that is the lower hanging fruit, for a company that has been leading in jewelry for 108 years, and that has all the capabilities to do that. So I am honestly very-very confident also on that side. What we are not considering in the short or medium term, are diversifications in very different kind of businesses from this.","Lorraine Hutchinson","And then, as some of these categories become larger portions of the business, does wholesale become a bigger part of your revenue mix?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well with the exception of fragrances, where obviously the wholesale is the natural business model. For the other categories, I think that one of the key strengths of Tiffany, is the fact of having a fleet of mono-brand directly on stores, that is very powerful, and the fact that those products can be purchased only in a Tiffany environment. I think, is an enormous strength, that is limited to very-very few, less than a handful of brands, luxury brands. Tiffany is one of those, and I would definitely stick to that.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Erwan Rambourg with HSBC.","Erwan Rambourg","Yes hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks a lot for the Q&A today and in the future. I had three questions; one is more sort of helicopter view for Alessandro. There has been historically, a sort of dichotomy in the brand between affordability and then higher end. You have a background, where you have obviously worked for an exuberant high-end Roman jeweler, but also you have worked for more fast moving consumer type goods. I am just wondering, how do you think about the dichotomy within Tiffany between affordable goods and goods that are more in line with some of the European peers? How do you think about your competitive positioning and where would you push in the future?","Secondly, just a question on jewelry for this year. I had in mind that you had a new platform or a new product launch that was quite important for the year to come. I am wondering if you could, maybe mention what the product pipeline is there? And then thirdly, sorry a bit of a technical question, maybe for Mark, very clear on the tax rate taking a while to come down, because you have to basically get the benefit only if you have shipped products for the first of January 2018. In an ideal situation, where 100% of the products are there, where do you see the sort of exit rate of the tax rate going? Whether it's in late 2019 or in 2020? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you Erwan for your questions. Well, on the first question, first of all, I think this dichotomy of the brand is a great thing, because this was probably one of the reasons why I was hired for this job, having the experience on both extremes of the product range. But now, apart from jokes, Tiffany has since -- more than essentially almost two centuries, has the capabilities of offering women, and in general, customers products that are of very high quality in a wide price range. Now I consider this a blessing. Also because it's not an offer that is bifurcated in something, let me say, very cheap, and something very expensive. That's not the case. The offer in Tiffany is very well structured, starting from, we can say 100 -- I mean, if I think about, for example, the famous silver bracelet at $180, up to $1,000, $2,000, $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $50,000, $100,000, and then we are on top, $1 million, $2 million, $3 million, $5 million. So it's a very well stratified kind of offer, that I find it extremely modeled, because this is the way customers, and especially women, shop today.","At the end of the day, all these different products, that as we can analyze in different price ranges, but at the end of the day, they are all products for the adorning of a person, and that ends up in the same jewelry box of a woman. So for me, that is a real reach of the brand.","Now the point is, to be balanced and have the different price points, and also to keep real innovation in the different segments of that diverse offer.","As for the second point, yes, you are absolutely true, we are thrilled that we have, after now, one year in the job as Chief Artistic Officer, is really on the verge to present its first new jewelry collection, is a jewelry collection that is in platinum and diamonds. Is across different price points, and I think is going to be a very nice surprise for the market, but especially a very addictive kind of product we would offer [ph].","So we are very confident about it. We are very excited about it, and we really look forward to launch it very soon.","Mark Aaron","And then relative to the tax rate, and with the full understanding that there are still a lot of moving parts, there is a lot of regulations that still haven't been fully clarified, whether it relates the branch operations or whether it relates to the foreign derived intangible income provisions and a whole bunch of other things that still need additional materials published on them. We believe that, on a going basis, because 70% of our income is earned in the U.S., will end up somewhere in the mid-20s.","Erwan Rambourg","Very clear. Thanks a lot for your help, gentlemen. Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your comments regarding investments in IT platforms, and Mark, you referred to expecting some better inventory management out of the new IT system investment. But I am wondering, if you can just sort of step back and talk more broadly about the new or improved capabilities you are looking for from these investments in IT systems? And then lastly, you talked about expectations longer term from meaningful improvement in your operating margin, do you have any initial thoughts on long term margin targets that you care to share with us today? Thank you so much.","Mark Erceg","Thank you for the question. So with respect to the information replatforming, we are very excited by what we are doing in this regard. It's going to give us one global order management system, which is going to allow us to effectively run one global distribution network, which currently is a bit of a challenge for us, given the complexity of the items, where we ship around the world, and requirements for the duties, given the fact that we ship precious metals and gemstones.","We are also going to be able to consolidate our financial instances. We are currently running over two dozen financial instances all around the world, we are going to be able to consolidate that down to one. You could imagine what that will do for shared services and other types of platforms that can drive a lot of efficiencies. We have talked about indirect procurement. We began our indirect procurement journey back in 2015. The team has been doing fabulous, generating a lot of savings across all aspects of the business. But they have been doing it, and in fact, with one hand tied behind their back, because they haven't had a global procurement system to let them aggregate suppliers, let them do electronic invoicing and receipting, let them capture discount payments. And so that's another big element of it.","And then really, the biggest one probably is what the omnichannel capabilities will be, that we will be able to have. We will have a seamless network from orders to shipment to fulfillment. You will be able to order online and pickup in store. I mean, this is really all kind of additional elements that will come along with it, and our digital capabilities will also be significantly enhanced, with a focus on mobile and mobile technology first, as far as that is concerned.","Kimberly Greenberger","And then just the long term margin targets, Mark?","Mark Erceg","Of course, yes. Look, we are confident that we are going to be able to continue to expand operating margin, after we get past the reset year or so. In 2018, we are going to be making some significant investments, as Alex indicated, in technology, in marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital store presentation. But we have had our operating margin the low 20s in the past, and we see no reason at all, structurally, why we won't be able to get back to that level, at some point in the future, and beyond.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We will go next to Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ed Yruma","Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just a broader picture question Alessandro, the business sales gap or growth gap versus the European luxury peers has narrowed a bit recently. But any big takeaway as to why sales growth has been slower than some of your big peers? I know obviously mix and geography is certainly different. But any kind of big takeaway? And then I guess second, on e-com, you do have an existing relationship with Net-A-Porter, I guess, how do we think about growth both in an owned basis and through select third parties? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you for your question. Yes, you are absolutely right, that if we look at the last few years, there has been a gap between our growth, very limited, and the one of some European luxury brands, and jewelers and not jewelers. Now the reason for that, I would say, is nothing structural. I mean, after six months in the job, I can tell you that, because this is obviously my first area of concern, and I can tell you that, my assessment says that, there is nothing structural why Tiffany has not been growing, at least in line with other players. Honestly, we have had newness also, in the past few years. The point was, that that newness was probably not as distinctive as the one that we would like to have in the future, to really make a difference. I think that, the brand has been a little bit understated during the last period of time. So nothing was really wrong, but I think we can get that up and increase the things that we are doing well, and we can just do it more intensively, faster, and with a bigger impact on the market.","So honestly, I see -- okay, the past is the past, but I see that as a marvelous opportunity for the future, because there is nothing really broken to fix. On the contrary, there is a wide space that has been left there, and we are ready to occupy that.","Now for your second question about e-commerce. Now, first of all, Tiffany has been one of the pioneers. I remember, when I was on the other side of the fence, and Tiffany was really a pioneer in e-commerce, and the proof of that is that we have a quarter of billion business in e-commerce in our own web site. So we are talking about something that is substantial, really substantial in the industry.","I don't want to repeat what we already said. We are committed to make that business grow, and about your question about other platforms, yes, we are in Net-A-Porter. We are looking very carefully at that world, because it's a world that -- as we all know, it's changing at a very fast pace. And we don't have any prejudice towards platforms, as far as, which is for example, the case of Net-A-Porter, among others, are platforms that are luxury platforms, and we have to be consistent online, as we are brick and mortar, when it comes to a controlled environment where our customers purchase a proper price integrity, adequate marketing communications. So these are the criterias for us, totally open and looking at it closely.","Ed Yruma","Thank you very much.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thanks Ed.","Operator","We will go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. Alessandro, as you look ahead to the in-store experience, what are your thoughts on the future of the store, and how you can ensure that you get the customer engagement and innovation in store, that's consummate with the brands? And a related question, is that the future of luxury in digital, and what does that mean in terms of where you should be in offering elevated convenience and engagement and how the supply chain and inventory management will intersect with the evolution of omnichannel and digital, just to drive an effective experience as well as net working capital and the human side of engagement as well? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you. Well as for our stores, at the end of the day, our aim is to surprise our customers, and of course, as a result of this, we will achieve meaningful comparable sales growth. But the point is really about the surprise of the customers. Customers nowadays have everything, they have such a huge offer in all kinds of facets of luxury and not luxury. I think Tiffany can bring a lot in terms of innovation attention through frequent, more frequent innovation, but especially meaningful and distinctive newness, in all categories.","Now together with that goes the presentation of the products in the stores. This is why we want to invest more in different merchandising and this is why we are investing, even if this will take a little bit longer, more into the omnichannel experience; because nowadays, there is no silos anymore for a customer between the digital advertising or media that the customer sees, the tiffany.com where he or she lands, the physical store, I mean, all these things in the mind of consumers will even more so millennials. But results say, it's not only millennials, it's also baby boomers of my generation, we are changing our pattern of purchase, and that we are very-very fluid from one to another and there are no siloses [ph] anymore.","So that is definitely the tact for the future, and what I would like to underline, is that in all this, Tiffany is set in a very good position, because of the positioning of the brand. I mean, Tiffany has always been compared to other brands and more, inclusive, more open to innovation. Less absolutely -- or less formal, and more about a joyful experience. For sure, very relevant for younger consumers. So we are really set in a special place, in order to succeed in this kind of challenge.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And any thoughts on the supply chain; because really revolutionizing digital has a lot to do with thinking about inventory accuracy in non-linear networks of placement, as well as enabling the salespeople to facilitate the convenience factor. So are there thoughts on where you are in that journey, and how that will match up with what you will be like, in terms of offering supreme digital convenience to new customers?","Mark Erceg","Yeah. What I would offer on that is, as we think about our information platforming, there is a bunch of base elements that go along with it, call that the source to pay procurement module, call that the financial model, call that the order management modules. We are also doing a digital replatforming, and then we are also endeavoring to build a data hub, which will allow us to put all kinds of additional analytical overlays on top of our merchandising tools and our pricing tools. So this is a complete suite of services we are effectively bringing forward, that's going to allow us to enhance our capabilities across all the areas. Alex talked about the fact we do a quarter of billion dollars of business on e-com.","There is a huge treasure trove of customer data there, that we are going to be able to mine more efficiently, once we get all of our IT systems in place. We do that work today, but we are going to have a lot of additional enhanced capabilities, as it relates to it, and we are getting closer to our customers, and doing an even better job of clienteling.","So we think we have a lot of upside in all of those regards.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Just lastly, Alessandro, self purchases versus gifting, the brand carries both, in terms of opportunities and range, would just love your thoughts on your diagnosis from that angle, in terms of what you want to do?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well that for me is a real blessing of this brand, because it's a brand that is relevant for a customer that wants to make a self purchase, as well as it's a magic brand for somebody who wants to gift a significant other or just a friend or whoever. This brand suits all these different cases, and this is not something obvious of many jewelers around the world.","Now this is -- it's important, it's a competitive advantage, and these will be sustained in the different initiatives that Mark was referring to before, also digitally; because when you go on tiffany.com to buy a gift for somebody or when you want to do a purchase for yourselves, you must clearly find in our web site, the path, the area that is more -- makes it easier for you to do your purchase. So we are definitely on it, and I truly believe that is a big advantage for Tiffany.","Oliver Chen","Thank you and best regards.","Mark Aaron","And if I could just add, just in the interest of time, we still have a number of people I am sure who want to ask questions. Could you please limit yourself to one question and not these multipart questions? Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","Hi, good morning. Thank you for all the color, thank you for taking questions. So I will ask one question two parts. But first off, and it's all financially related really; on a very short term, you are recognizing that fourth quarter sales seem to hit the guidance you weighed out in mid-January. What explains the -- what seems to be a comp slowdown in the month -- I guess since the holiday, so probably in the month of January. Then the second part of the question, longer term, you talk a lot about the initiatives here, we obviously now have guide to 2018. To what extent or potential benefits of some of these key initiatives think into guidance for 2018? Thank you.","Mark Erceg","I think it's a great set of questions. So with respect to the comp stores, I just want to make sure that we are clear. We finished 2016 and our comps were down mid-single digits. Throughout the course of 2017, we have seen that strength and we were down two in the first quarter, we were down one in the second. We went flat, then we went to plus one. So at the end of the day, we are feeling that we are making progress. We still have a long way to go, but we are clearly moving in the right direction, and we are not overly concerned about what might be one month, particularly when there was the Chinese New Year, which kind of flopped from one period to the next to some extent.","So we feel that we are strengthening, and we want to look at things over the quarters, which again sequentially, have improved.","Mark Aaron","And we did have a strong January last year, so it was a bit of a tougher comparison.","Mark Erceg","Correct. As far as whether or not there are some of these initiatives already baked through the 2018 guidance, I think I would say, that the simple answer is yes. We have been working on a number of these initiatives for a while now, and they are starting to provide meaningful benefits. We think those benefits will increase over time, which we are excited about. But yes, there are some factored into 2018.","Brian Nagel","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thank you for taking my question. Just a little bit of a follow-up; it seems like Asia was the area where you saw the biggest drop-off, holiday to January? And then as you think about the comp guidance, low to mid singles for 2018, help us think about e-com, now that you are going to be including in the comp, as most retailers do at this point, what's the growth rate there, how much of a contributor is that to the kind of overall comp trends we should expect going forward? Thank guys.","Mark Aaron","Yeah Omar, I will just say that, in terms of Asia, looking like it dropped off. We said there was no big effect from the shift in the Chinese New Year. There was certainly some effect. We also have noted a lot of wholesale sales in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in Korea, and that can be a little bit choppy from month-to-month and certainly quarter-to-quarter. But there is nothing really unusual to point out in terms of AsiaPac slowing down technically from the holiday season to the full fourth quarter.","Mark Erceg","And then with respect to e-com, we do expect e-com to grow faster than our base business during 2018, which I think Mark shared in his prepared remarks.","Omar Saad","Great. Thank you guys. Welcome Alessandro.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. And a lot of my questions have been answered, but maybe I could just ask on -- I might be curious on the economics of the pop-up stores, and how you guys look at that strategy? Is that something that you guys could see rolling out more going forward, and maybe just touch on the economics about how it impacts some of the touchpoints along the P&L? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Michael, for your question. Yes, we were very excited in the last quarter of last year to open a few pop-up stores, a couple of them in New York City, and some also in Canada. During the year, we had also one for few weeks in Tokyo. So all this is a very effective way for me to connect with customers out of the usual skin, and it is also a way to measure the reaction of consumers and to see if the link with the brand is there.","And in this respect, all these top up stores have been really a positive factor in this respect. When it comes to the financials, I have to say, they have been financially profitable, in the sense that we didn't lose money doing that, but it is not -- first of all, it is nothing material, and especially, is not really the main purpose of that exercise. Let me say, they are self-financed kind of activities, but the major work of it is testing new things with customers.","Michael Binetti","Thank you very much.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning and welcome Alessandro. Given your background and coming from Bulgari, what are the similarities and differences between your assessment of Tiffany's and how you accelerated and enhanced Bulgari? Are there similarities between the two businesses? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well the similarities are many. Of course, we talk about two global brands. Two brands that are really founded on jewelry, where most of the business relies on jewelry. And what -- and I think two wonderful and very respectful brands.","Now having said so, what I see directly, after six months in the job, as a difference of Tiffany versus Bulgari, is that Tiffany is more understated, younger, and also more joyful than Bulgari as a brand. And this for me is very important, because this is the DNA of the brand, is the way the brand is, is like the personality of a person. There is not good or bad personality, everybody has its own personality. But the factor being so, younger, joyful and understated, I think is a great opportunity for Tiffany, because this is very much in line with the changes that are going on in the luxury experience in this space.","In these days, luxury is very solid, but the luxury experience is changing. Luxury is no longer equal to formality, luxury is no longer predominantly for richer and typical traditionally, more older people. Now luxury is meaningful to a large audience, and I think in that respect, Tiffany, because of its DNA, because of its personality, is really best set to define the new cost of luxury. And I think this is so exciting, both personally as a professional challenge, as well as I think financially for the future of this company.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Rick Patel with Needham and Company.","Rick Patel","Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could provide more color on your plans to increase marketing this year? You have done a really nice job, over the last year on the creative side, and partnering with some ambassadors. When we think about the increase this year, are you just going to be doing more of that, are you taking a different approach, and how do we think about the emphasis between digital versus more traditional channels? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Rick. Well I said before, that we want to surprise our customers. So we will not repeat anything that we did last year, that was successful. For example, the launch of HardWear and it was a very good launch, it was successful. We are pleased with it. But we are in the business of surprise. So we have a long list of projects for this year, to surprise customers in a different way. And --","Mark Aaron","It will surprise you too.","Alessandro Bogliolo","And we really look forward. But really, I am talking about the next -- starting from the next few months, you will start seeing a lot of activities in marketing, related to the new launch that we were referring to before, as well as -- and this is very important, icons, our icons. So it's about the new product, but it's about our icons, that we sustained together with high jewelry, throughout the year, with a lot of exciting marketing initiatives. All of them will be also digital, and most of our marketing investment is since -- already two years now, is more on the digital side, rather than the traditional print media. This is a trend of all the brands, and Tiffany is surely leading that.","Rick Patel","Look forward to seeing you. Good luck.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will got next to Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Tom Nikic","Hey, good morning everyone. This is actually Tom Nikic on for Ike. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to ask you, you spoke about accelerating the pace of new product introductions, and you have obviously had some success over the last couple of years with new products that you have launched, such as HardWear and Tiffany T, but you also have this vault of very classic styles and classic collections. And I guess, sort of how do you balance this initiative to sort of accelerate the rate of new product platforms, while also maintaining that sort of classic Tiffany style? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you for your question. I don't remember exactly the day and the year, but when Tiffany opened a new store, a big store, I am talking about the 19th century, in Union Square, the newspaper, I think it was the New York Times or the equivalent at the time had that. Now in New York, there is a new palace of jewels. Well Tiffany has been true to that statement through centuries. So really, as the palace of jewels, there is room, and it' needed under that roof to have a wide offer, that covers the different consumers preferences, occasions of usage.","To this mix of very design lines, Tiffany T for example, or more edgy lines, HardWear or more classic lines, like Victoria for example. Not to mention, all the solitaire diamond, these are all different facets of today's jewelry, of today's way of wearing jewelry by women. So I don't see absolutely a contrast or a contradiction there, on the contrary, it's all complementary, in order to provide a really full experience, in line with the palace of jewels that our predecessors managed to build more than 100 years ago.","Tom Nikic","All right. Sounds good. Best of luck this year.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","Good morning everyone and congratulations on a good holiday. Just two quick questions; Alessandro, if you could talk a little bit about the Engagement category opportunity, you talked about watches and homes. I was wondering, what you envision for the Engagement category and if there was an opportunity to perhaps capture market share there? And Mark, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes on gross margin and how we should be thinking about it for fiscal 2018 and 2019? I know mix issues are at hand, as well as commodity pricing and some potential price increases. Thanks so much.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you. Well touching on your first point, Diamond and Engagement Jewelry. Now Tiffany stands for several things in the mind of consumers since generations. For sure, love, engagement, is definitely equal and synonymous to Tiffany. And this is something that is very important, and is the strength of the brand.","Now the world changes, the world has changed. The way people love, the way people express their love has changed and is changing recently, and we see a tremendous opportunity for Tiffany in that area, because we believe that the business of love is a business that will be there forever until humanity exists. But our opportunity is to evolve with the new morals of society, and if there is one brand that can do that, that is definitely Tiffany.","I think we have seen already a little bit of that, I mean to give you something more tangible, in the recent Believe in Love campaign. I don't know if you have seen it, otherwise you can find it easily on YouTube. That is a first indication of a direction. But Engagement, although it has been a challenging category in the past few years, I think at the same time, reserves us a very good opportunity.","Mark Erceg","And real quickly on the gross margin question; we do expect gross margin to expand somewhat in 2018. Over the past many years, there has been a large benefit we have been deriving from significantly lower metal and rough diamond prices. We think metals will be roughly flat year-over-year, but we do expect a little bit of health from lower diamond input costs. We do believe that we are still a brand, and increasingly still, a brand that has pricing power, as we reassert ourselves more aggressively in the marketplace. The pricing power we have always enjoyed, we believe will expand frankly over time. And so we are confident that we will be able to continue to push gross margin.","We also are confident that we are doing other things to find ways to structurally address our costs. We have talked in the past about the need to be able to achieve SG&A leverage at a lower rate of sales growth, and we have a lot of initiatives that are related to that, and while the primary intent of the jewelry design and innovation workshop is just that to drive innovation, it will also allow for fast prototyping. It will allow for [indiscernible] analysis. It will allow us to have some additional high end costing tools. We will be able to bring detailed spec packages forward, and that will let us manage our production network more nimbly as well.","Janet Kloppenburg","Thanks so much. Good luck.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Kevin Heenan with Guggenheim.","Kevin Heenan","Hi good morning. This is Kevin on for Bob Drbul. I just wanted to follow-up on the advertising, as we move into 2018 I think, as a percent of sales, if that stepped up over the past few years. I was wondering, how we might be able to think about the change, as a percent of sales into 2018, and just any thoughts on what the right level for the company might be, over the longer term? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Kevin. Now as you know, marketing is typically 7%, 7.5% of our total sales turnover. Now honestly, I believe that there is not a magic number. I wouldn't know to tell you, which is the magic percentage of marketing over total sales. 7.6% is in the range. There are brands that spend more than that, whether it's a substantial amount. Now honestly, more than talking about the percentage of marketing investment over the total sales, for me the most important thing is, the effectiveness of that expense and to use that money in a way that really, I come back to my obsession, surprises the customers; because sometimes, you can put a lot of money in more traditional kind of campaign or media, and you don't sort the same effect on doing something else.","Let me make an example. For me, one of the great campaigns of last year, has been the opening of the Blue Box Caf\u00e9. Now honestly speaking, that was not media. We actually opened the caf\u00e9. But that had a huge number, that we talked about mediums of impressions, and that was a fantastic marketing tool. So the world has become more complicated maybe, but also more open to smart ideas, and this is where I am really challenging and trying to push and inspire the teams to be more bearing, when it comes to our way to communicate to customers, above and beyond the marketing budget.","Mark Aaron","And Kevin, I would just add to that that, it sort of ties to a previous question, that we don't disclose our marketing mix in terms of how much is print versus digital versus social and all that. But certainly, it's a combination of all three. Print is still very important, but increasingly digital and social as well, and as Alessandro said, even PR activities, which can really resonate with customers as well. So it's a whole big combination of things.","Okay, next question?","Operator","We will go next go to Laura Champine with Loop Capital.","Laura Champine","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just wanted a little more color on the changes that you plan to make in the store environment, just because to us, stores already look pretty good. So if you could be specific on changes you are looking to make there, we are very interested? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Laura, for this question; and thank you for your appreciation of our stores. Yes definitely, Tiffany has a wonderful fleet of stores, and I have to say, some are brand new, some are less new, but all of them kept a very high level. Honestly, I have seen also stores 13, even 15 years old, some of them, and they look good. So that is not the point. The point for me is to inject some freshness, some newness, some excitement in the store, because nowadays, consumers are more demanding. It's not enough to have a beautiful store. The point is that, you have a beautiful store, I have been to the store a couple of times, why shall I come a third time or a fourth time, when I can comfortably buy the same product from tiffany.com. So it is that excitement that is needed, and this is what we are planning to do. This is why, in the guidance or the financial indication that we gave, we said that we are going to increase investment in visual merchandising, store presentations, because it's exactly to deliver excitement in the stores.","Above and beyond store construction, store comps at the end of this, because this is a totally different area that is a multiyear kind of work, is more linked to CapEx than expenses. I am more referring to visual merchandising and the in-store presentations as a way to animate the point of sale.","Laura Champine","Got it. Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Thanks very much. Curious Alessandro, if any of the six strategies you laid out, particularly focus on the millennial customer? There was a lot of focus these last couple of years there, so just curious anything very focused on the millennial, bring the new customer in? And my second question, can you maybe help us understand or benchmark from a product newness or introduction perspective, how Tiffany would rank versus the global luxury peers that you refer to? Thanks very much.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Brian. Well, let me share with you my thoughts, because there is a lot of talking about millennials in all industries. Now if we look at luxury, and especially jewelry. If there is a brand that traditionally has been dealing with the millennials of all the years, since 180 years, that is Tiffany. Now we call them millennials, but Tiffany having been so strong historically with the Engagement business and also with the gift business, has been the brand of choice for young customers that were there for graduation, for engagement, for marrying. So Tiffany, because of its past as being the brand of millennials, is almost 100 years.","Now all these six priorities that we have set down, all of them are focused over millennials, because millennials are the clients of Tiffany, an important portion of the clients of Tiffany, and especially, because of these changes that are going on in society, that actually are starting from millennials, from the younger generation, and then they contaminate, let me say the other generations, it's even more important for Tiffany, that whatever we do, in all six priorities, they are really focused over the way young generations act. And I would -- and this is just to take an example, the first priority, amplify and evolve brand message.","What do I mean by evolve? By evolve, I mean, really to shift our historic perceived brand message, to being more -- to be closer to today's younger generation's way of approaching life, more self attraction, celebrating love in a different way, and more everyday usage of jewelry or simply a more and strong empowered kind of woman. So for me, the real objective is, when I say amplify and evolve brand message, is to bring Tiffany in the middle of the new cultural conversations. This is really what inspires all the priorities we have set.","Operator","We will go next to Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro","Thank you. Congratulations on a great holiday. So Alessandro, as you think about -- a lot of terms, a lot of conversation on this call, it feels like there is a lot of energy at the brand here, and a lot of, what I would think of as, more modern energy. You are relocating and renovating a bunch of stores this year. How will you use what you have learned from your pop-up stores in your caf\u00e9, to inform what the stores will look like going forward? And you mentioned that luxury doesn't -- and no longer has to -- is no longer equal to formality. How should we think about your sales associates going forward; because Tiffany sales associates have historically been a very formal proposition in your store?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you for your question. Well definitely, I can assure that the energy is there, and this is what keeps us moving and going every day. Now, one of the reasons -- of the many reasons, why we invest in some pop-ups, is also to experiment things, that -- to see if they are relevant for consumers, and in order to then roll them out or not, in the rest of the stores.","I will give you a small example; one of the recent pop-ups was one on the West Coast --","Marni Shapiro","In the Grove?","Alessandro Bogliolo","In the Grove, exactly, and it was a very small store, and quite unusual, and it lasted just for a few weeks, it was in February. But one of the highlights of that pop-up was the personalization of jewelry. So basically, you could go there, buy a pendant in gold and silver whatever, and have a personalization, where you were basically the designer. You could draw simply on an iPad itself and design and that design would be engraved on the spot, on the product that you are purchasing. Now that resonated very strongly with the consumers, to the previous question, to millennials, but also non-millennial. And we found that, that was a proof of concept, that for us was very important, and this is an area where we are going to invest a lot. And to roll it out in many other stores.","So yes, the answer is definitely these pop-ups are also useful for this kind of experiments.","Marni Shapiro","The sales associates?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes, about the sales associates. Well you know, I think we have thousands and thousands of sales associates in our stores, where we really focus about is, the level of service that -- I have to say, that service is a real obsession in this company. I was impressed, how all the retail teams are really serious about that, and not only in talking, as a lip service, that every brand would do, but also in terms of resources, money, that is invested in training, in metrics that are strictly monitored at store level, at country level, at global level, sales associate level. So service is definitely there.","Well about modernization, I don't think it is a company role to modernize people. I think that -- the good thing of luxury brand, is that they are very inspirational for all of us as employees of the brand. So the moment the brand gets more -- I mean, more modern and more joyful, more easy going in its communication, in its product, in its marketing; naturally, we will all be contaminated and sales associates, as well as the CEO will become more modern, I hope.","Marni Shapiro","Thank you very much. Best of luck for spring season.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Mark Aaron.","Mark Aaron","Okay. Thank you. I think we can wrap up the Q&A now. I hope our formal remarks and the Q&A sufficiently addressed your areas of interest. Please note on your calendars, that we expect to report first quarter results on Wednesday, May 23, with a conference call and Q&A. Please feel free to call me with any other questions or comments, and I thank you all for listening today.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.","Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; Mr. Mark Erceg, Tiffany's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Alessandro Bogliolo, Chief Executive Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you and good day, everyone. On today's call, we are pleased that Tiffany's new CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo will begin by offering a few of his initial observations, which he will do in a moment. I will then review third quarter sales results, and Mark Erceg will comment on the rest of the financial results and forecast.","Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.","And now, I am pleased to introduce Alessandro Bogliolo.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you. I am pleased to have this opportunity to briefly introduce myself to you, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. Let me begin by saying that I am very excited to be here at Tiffany. I spent many years in the jewelry business at Bulgari, and I have long respected Tiffany as a house of extraordinary design and as a formidable competitor.","In my first seven weeks at Tiffany, I have met with many members of our HQM regional teams, and I am impressed with their skills and passion for our unique brand. I have traveled and visited so far about 40 stores in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan, and I am very glad I also visited three of our manufacturing and logistic sites in the United States; in New York, Rohde Island, and the New Jersey.","We have powerful internal operations with hundreds of truly exceptional jewelry artists, stone setters, hand engravers. It's thanks to them to their skills, their hands that Tiffany can offer such robust [ph] assortment from multimillion dollar one-of-the-kind creations to everyday jewelry with a consistent and supreme quality.","I accepted this position because I strongly believe that the Tiffany & Co. brand is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow. As we move forward, we will leverage our course plan and adapt as appropriate, while of course we will always remain true to our heritage and brand integrity. We will be accelerating the pace of product innovation. We are focused on the most effective marketing communications. We will continue to enhance the in-store and online experience, and our growth is reinforced by our strong supply chain capabilities and the solid financial position.","I believe our company has the capabilities to further delight our customers, inspire our employees, and reward our shareholders. At the same time, we acknowledge that some of our competitors have recently posted stronger sales growth than us, which I can assure you, will not be acceptable in the long-term.","I am increasingly passionate about Tiffany, and I am honored to be given this great opportunity. As I further study our business, I will be reviewing my thoughts with our Board of Directors, and will then have more to say to you in the coming months. I appreciate your interest in this great company. I can assure you that we will continue to work very persistently to achieve the healthy long-term financial performance that you have come to expect from us. Thank you.","And now, I return the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Okay. Thanks Alessandro for sharing those thoughts with us. Now, let's look at the results. As an overview, we were pleased with some of the underlying factors reflected in the third quarter results. Important to us was that total sales growth was again driven largely by higher jewelry unit volume, and not price. We were pleased to see a continuation of growth in fashion jewelry, and also encouraged to see a resumption of growth in the high fine and solitaire jewelry categories.","Comparable store sales rose in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, but declined in Japan and Europe. Gross margin was up. SG&A expense growth was roughly in line with sales growth. Other expenses were unchanged, and the effective tax rate was a bit lower. The result was a 5% increase in net earnings which was a bit higher than what we had expected. We added net of three stores and introduced some new jewelry designs, a new watch collection, and a new fragrance.","And organizationally, Alessandro joined Tiffany and our board of directors elected Roger Farah as its chairman. It was indeed a very active quarter. Let's look at performance in each region. In the Americas, sales rose slightly due to an increase in the number of jewelry unit sold across all categories except engagement jewelry. In the terms of the region's customer mix in the quarter, we attribute sales growth to higher spending by local customers while sales to foreign tourists continued to trend lower.","It will be interesting in coming quarters to see whether there is any impact from the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. Comp store sales rose 1% in the quarter. Results on a constant exchange rate basis were not materially different than as reported. And around the region, there were no significant variations in geographical performance worth highlighting.","There has been quite a bit of recent store activity. During the quarter in the U.S., we opened a store in Fort Worth, Texas, representing our third store in the Dallas Fort Worth market. And we relocated our store in Century City, California. In our New York flagship store, we recently reopened our newly renovated fourth floor offering a dramatic new presentation and experience.","The floor showcases our new home and accessories collection. And we are pleased to say that you can now enjoy your breakfast or lunch and tea at Tiffany in our newly opened Blue Box Cafe on the fourth floor. Based on the long queues every day, the cafe is fast becoming a New York tradition. For the first time ever, we recently opened to two pop-up shops in Manhattan in Rockefeller Center and in Grand Central Station, which are important hubs for both New Yorkers and tourists.","These shops offer a curated selection by our Chief Artistic Officer, Reed Krakoff, of jewelry including the new hardware collection and gifts including the new home and accessories collection. And we are excited about the sales potential and brand exposure from those two shops. We also opened four pop-up shops in Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada. Now let's turn to the Asia-Pacific region which experienced growth in the quarter due to increased unit volume across jewelry categories.","The region's sales increase came from a continuation of very strong comparable store sales growth in Mainland China, increased wholesale sales in Korea to support strong duty free sales, and the effect of new stores. Comp stores up 2% on a constant exchange rate basis. While we were pleased with sales growth in Mainland China, we were also encouraged to see sales in Hong Kong almost flat with last year after three years of substantial declines.","However, comp declines some other countries which we attribute at least in part to lower Chinese tourist spending, affected the region's overall results. During the quarter, we opened one store in Wuxi, China, and have several openings and relocations planned in the fourth quarter. The picture was reasonably good in Japan. Sales declined on a GAAP basis due to a weakening of the yen versus the dollar. However, third quarter sales were equal to last year on a constant exchange rate basis.","A decline in jewelry unit sold was offset by an increase in average price. So as a reminder, the number of unit sold had a large increase last year. Comp sales stores decreased on a GAAP basis, but on a constant exchange rate basis were flat. We are planning for a tough comparison in the fourth quarter when we go up against the comp store sales increase last year that we believe was at least partly tied to extensive favorable publicity from a popular television show.","There were no store openings or closings during the quarter. Turning to Europe, we saw a mixed result. Total sales were up on a GAAP basis due to increased price and volume. The pound and euro have strengthened in recent months which bolstered GAAP results. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales were up slightly and comps declined. On continental Europe, total sales rose in most countries.","Sales declined in the U.K. but keep in mind the very strong growth at this time last year when spending that we attributed to foreign tourists in London was surging in reaction to the weaker pound. During the quarter, we added to our successful business in Russia when we opened a second store in the heart of Moscow on Petrovka Street. And we opened a store in Birmingham, England in Selfridges Department Store, representing our eleventh store in the U.K.","Lastly, sales in our other segment declined in the quarter entirely due to lower wholesales sales of diamonds. This segment also includes four stores that we operate in the UAE. And we are pleased to see that their comps improved with a 7% increase in the third quarter. We closed our store in Abu Dhabi mall during the quarter, but expect to replace it with a new store in the Abu Dhabi Galleria next year.","In addition to these sales highlights, I should point out that ecommerce sales increased at a slightly faster pace than overall sales growth. We will certainly continue to invest in the online channel and digital marketing, but believe that most customers after getting their information online still are and will continue to be attracted to the in-store experience.","Looking at product categories in total for the quarter, we continue to see solid growth in the fashion jewelry category. We're very pleased with the results in the Tiffany hardware collection which we launched earlier in the year, and recently added new SKUs to the collection. We also recently expanded our very successful Tiffany tea collection.","Near the end of the quarter, we launched an interesting build-your-own program on our Web site that allows customers to construct and personalize their own charm bracelets, and it's worth pointing out the growth in our Tiffany keys collection, which spans both fashion and fine jewelry and includes new fleur de lis design in earring, pendants, and rings. In the high fine and solitaire jewelry category, we were pleased to see a resumption of growth in the quarter led by iconic diamond jewelry designs which included extensions of existing collection.","In that regard, it's worth mentioning the popular Victoria yellow diamond and Soleste collection. And we had a solid increase in the high jewelry sales in the quarter. Partly offsetting growth in those categories was engagement jewelry where sales continued to underperform in the quarter. While Tiffany offers a wide ranging and we believe dominant diamond ring assortments, we have also observed that some customers wanted to customize their own rings.","As a result, we recently introduced a program in our stores in the U.S. and Canada that allows customers to personalize their ring by separately choosing a diamond cut, setting, and metal. We're pleased with progress in several non-jewelry categories as well. In watches, we saw a good growth in the quarter, and there has been very favorable initial reactions to our new Tiffany Metro Watch collection for women.","We also launched our new signature fragrance in the quarter which is now available in Tiffany stores as well as in other select stores globally. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently introduced our new home and accessories collection both online and our stores. The already popular collection spans more than 300 item, both functional and whimsical in a wide range of price point and is now being distributed worldwide.","We've met with many of you in recent months and I want to reiterate that Tiffany's top strategic priority is to drive solid comparable store sales growth. While we expect square footage to increase modestly each year in the future, it is comparable store and e-commerce sales growth through increased frequency of customer visits and the conversion rates that will ultimately contribute to driving higher margins and earnings growth.","With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg.","Mark Erceg","Thanks Mark, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter results reflect continued progress towards our long-term financial goals, which include mid single-digit sales growth and high single-digit diluted earnings per share growth.","Worldwide sales growth of 3% in the quarter is obviously below that range, but importantly, some sequential progress was made in comp store sales, which were down 1% in the third quarter after being down 3% in the first quarter and down 2% in the second quarter. And net earnings growth of 5% in the third quarter brings fiscal year-to-date diluted earnings per share growth to plus 7% versus year ago. So, while we are encouraged with third quarter results, we also acknowledge that we have a lot more work to do, and that the risk of stating the obvious we will not be satisfied until we achieve meaningful and sustainable comparable store sales growth across all regions.","Moving to gross margin; gross margin increased by 30 basis points due in part due to a decline in wholesale diamond sales. Sales mix was on a meaningful contributor to the increase as sales growth was generally balanced across a wide range of price points and product categories. Also, while we have continued to benefit from lower commodity input costs, we are seeing that benefit diminish as the year goes on, which is consistent with our prior expectations. We now expect gross margin to be roughly unchanged for the full year.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses were roughly in line with sales growth in the third quarter with the increased tied to increased labor and incentive compensation costs, as well as higher store depreciation and occupancy costs partly offset by various ongoing cost savings initiatives. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A expenses have grown 2.4%, versus reported sales growth of 2.3%.","Consistent what has been previously stated, we remain committed to managing SG&A expense prudently and reducing costs where feasible in order to free up investment dollars to reinvest in the growth of our business. Modest gross margin expansion coupled with SG&A expenses growing in line with sales allowed third quarter operating margin to expand by 10 basis points. Our full year forecast calls for operating margin to increase over last year as reported, but to be roughly in line with last year's margins when charges are excluded.","Interest and other expenses were essentially unchanged in the quarter, and we expect it to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million for the full year. From a tax standpoint, the third quarter effective tax rate was 33.4%, which was more than four points below last year's rate of 34.6%. Nonetheless, 2017's full year effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 33%.","Net inventories at October 31 were only 1% above last year, which is below the rate of sales growth, which you may recall that at July 31 of this year, inventory was 4% below year ago. Simply put, we've increased our internal manufacturing targets over the past couple of months for several key gold products that have been selling faster-than-expected which in turn has pushed up raw material and work in process inventory levels. Because of this change, we now expect net inventories for the year to increase at approximately the same rate as sales growth.","Capital expenditures year-to-date were $146 million, and our full year forecast which assumed approximately $250 million in spending has been revised slightly downwards with our best estimates now being somewhere in the $235 million to $250 million range. The revision is solely due to timing expenditures as we continue to anticipate annual CapEx spending of somewhere between 6% and 7% of sales. We invested $28 million in the third quarter to buy shares at an average cost of $92 per share, which is slightly up from $21 million we invested during the second quarter, and more than doubled the $11 million we invested during the first quarter.","Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong having finished the third quarter with $1 billion of cash in short-term investments and total debt representing only one-third of stockholders equity. Putting in all together, we continue to expect total sales for the full year to increase by low single-digits and our forecast for diluted EPS continues to call for a high single-digit increase over last year's $3.55 per share on a GAAP basis, and the mid single-digit increase over last year's $3.75 per share, excluding charges.","Relative to cash, we remain on pace with our expectations to deliver approximately $700 million of net operating cash flow and approximately $450 million of free cash flow for the full year.","So, in closing, while progress was made in the quarter, we remain focused on sharpening our strategies and improving our execution in order to generate sustainable comp store sales growth and consistent diluted earnings per share growth.","I will now turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Mark and Alessandro for your insights. Everyone please note that we expect to report our November-December holiday sales results on January 17. As a reminder, we do not have a conference call of that release.

(NYSE:TIF) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call May 25, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark Aaron - Vice President-Investor Relations","Analysts","Q - ","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to Tiffany & Company First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn it over to Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relation. Mr. Aaron, you may begin.","Mark Aaron","Thank you, Kayla. Good day to everyone and greetings from sunny New York City. Tiffany reported its first quarter results earlier today and I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review the news release. On today's call, I\u2019ll elaborate on the results as well as on management\u2019s outlook for the full-year.","Before saying more please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts or forward-looking statement, actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Okay, so now let\u2019s review the results. Overall, these first quarter results generally represented a continuation of the softness in sales trends that we experienced in the latter part of 2015 and were largely what we expected. Our earnings forecast that we first provided in March assume that we would begin the year with lower sales in most regions which combined with a higher gross margin and SG&A expense deleverage let us to anticipate a 15% to 20% decline in EPS in the first quarter and it essentially did.","The actual 15% EPS decline which included a tax benefit and a 21% decline excluding the benefit were generally in line with our expectation. Most relevant however is that despite the persistence of well-known macroeconomic challenges we are continuing to pursue a number of important strategic initiatives designed to strengthen Tiffany\u2019s position as one of the world\u2019s most important luxury brand.","So let\u2019s look at the quarter\u2019s results. Starting with the topline worldwide net sales declined 7% both as reported and on a constant exchange rate basis due to softness in most regions. There was no overall translation effect on sales as the recently strengthening yen offset any negative translational effect for this stronger U.S. dollar against other currencies.","Looking at sales performance by region, in the Americas total sales declined 9% and comparable store sales declined 10%. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 8% in the first quarter and comp store sales declined 9%. We attribute the overall lower sales to softness in domestic customer spending in many U.S. markets as well as lower spending by foreign tourists of many nationalities in New York and other high tourism markets.","The total sales decline was due to unit related softness across most jewelry categories. Beyond the U.S. results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. We didn't add any stores to the Americas store base in the first quarter nor do we anticipate any growth in store locations in the Americas throughout the remainder of fiscal 2016.","However, as part of our ongoing store optimization strategy, we are in the midst of significant renovations of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Vancouver similar in scale to what we completed in Chicago last year.","Moving to the Asia-Pacific region, total sales declined 8% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis however sales declined 5% in total and comp store sales were down 12% with softness across much of the region.","We achieved total sales growth in China fueled by strong results in some significant newly opened stores which we believe may have affected comp store sales in the near-term for few existing stores. We also saw solid sales growth in Korea. However, that growth in China and Korea was more than offset by a continued significant decline in Hong Kong as well as more moderate declines in some other markets. We continue to assume that results in Hong Kong will be pressured throughout the year.","As reported in U.S. dollars the total Asia-Pacific sales decline in the quarter was due to roughly equal declines in jewelry units and in changes in average price and product mix. Our Asia-Pacific store count was unchanged during the quarter although we do expect to add stores later in the year in China, Australia, Korea and New Zealand while also closing some older ones in a few countries.","I am pleased to say that we had a good quarter in Japan. Total sales in Japan rose 8% and comparable store sales rose 12% in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, which excludes the recent dramatic strengthening of the yen comp store sales rose 5%, which we attribute to increased spending by local customers, but that growth was mostly offset by lower wholesale sales resulting in a total sales increase of 1%.","And looking at comp store sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis, it is also important to note that comp store sales have declined 24% in last year's first quarter after surging 30% in the first quarter of 2014 when consumers accelerated their purchasing prior to an increase in Japan's consumption tax.","So we are really looking at a modestly positive three-year average annual run rate as we would expect for Japan. Total sales in Japan increased largely from higher jewelry unit volume. During the quarter, we closed the department store location in Yonago and plan to relocate a few stores in Japan over the course of this year.","Tiffany's business in Europe remained under pressure in the first quarter particularly on the continent, which continued the trend we experienced late last year following the tragedy in Paris and also affected by the more recent tragedy in Brussels. Total sales in Europe declined 9% and comp store sales declined 15% in the quarter.","On a constant exchange-rate basis total European sales declined 7% in the quarter and comp store sales declined 14%. Although you should remember that was on top of the very strong 18% comp increase in last year\u2019s first quarter.","In addition to the difficult year-over-year comparison, we attributed the lower sales primarily to softness in foreign tourists spending across the continent. It's worth noting that our sales in the UK were relatively better than results on the continent and our business in Russia continued to perform very well.","The total sales decline in Europe in the quarter was entirely due to lower jewelry unit volume. During the first quarter, we were pleased to add two stores in Italy. One on the fashionable Via Condotti marking our third store in Rome and a new store in beautiful Venice. There is additional store activity planned for later in the year in Europe.","Lastly, other sales were 30% lower in the first quarter, primarily reflecting softness in our retail sales in the UAE as well as in the wholesale sales to other markets in the Middle East. In an effort to improve our performance around the world, we continue to be focused on further enhancing the consumer experience through in-store training and systems even more effectively engaged with our customers, optimizing our store base with renovations and relocation and of course introducing new designs across all product categories and price point.","The objective is to increase the frequency of customer visit to our stores and the conversion rate. Complimenting Tiffany\u2019s company operated stores is our web presence around the world with e-commerce sales accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. I think it's worth noting that worldwide e-commerce sales rose slightly in the first quarter.","We continue to believe that our dual focus on stores and online reinforces global brand and product awareness while enhancing customers overall experiences with Tiffany. And on a related note, we were pleased last month to launch Tiffany\u2019s relationship with NET-A-PORTER which we view as another step toward building greater awareness among a worldwide group of fashion conscious luxury shoppers.","Touching on a few product category highlights in the quarter, while the 7% decline in worldwide sales is reflected in varying degrees of softness across all product categories. It is worth noting that both the engagement jewelry and wedding band category and the fashion jewelry category performed relatively better than the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category.","Fashion jewelry sales continue to reflect the success of our Tiffany T and Atlas collection and while we've seen lower overall unit volume in fashion silver jewelry in certain regions. We are pleased with the initial reaction to new silver jewelry pieces that have been added to the return to Tiffany and Infinity collections to address softness that price points under $500.","Our goals in fashion jewelry are to sustain growth in gold jewelry and stabilize sales in silver jewelry. And we plan to continue to pursue those objectives with new designs and advertising. We\u2019ve spoken about some softness in the engagement jewelry and wedding band\u2019s category in some regions over the past year and we are now focusing our marketing communications on more directly conveying the competitive strength of our engagement assortment.","The ads not only celebrate the 130th anniversary of Tiffany introducing it's extraordinarily beautiful six-prong diamond rings setting in 1886, but they also emphasize the exceptional quality and rarity of our diamond. We believe that's a compelling message to couples who planned to marry.","In the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category there are few key takeaways. At the highest end of our product offerings, we were pleased with the results that our annual Blue Book events that we held in New York in April. While the year-over-years sales comparison was quite difficult due to a record setting result at last year's event. Customers nonetheless showed their enthusiasm for the unique collection of statement jewelry that was focused on the theme the art of transformation.","Rounding out that category, we saw continued success with our important and recently expanded Victoria collection, but this was offset by soft and mixed performance in other collections. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with our progress in building a larger and more significant watch business as we increase awareness of new design and Tiffany's heritage in that category.","So that covers the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the earnings result. Gross margin roses 2.1 point to 61.2% in the first quarter due to a continuation of favorable product input costs, price increases taken over the past year and sales mix, partly offset by the effect of currency translation and a lack of sales leverage on fixed costs coming from the sales decline.","Our forecast continues to assume an increase in gross margin for the full-year, in fact more than we had initially expected. However, we continue to also expect the full-year increase to be more modest than we experienced in the first quarter as we anniversary some of the positive effect of favorable product input costs from last year as well as some of our pricing actions.","Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3% in the quarter. The bulk of the modest increase was for labor occupancy and depreciation cost much of which was store related. We continue to expect deleveraging of SG&A expenses for the full-year. The effective tax rate declined to 29% in the quarter from 34.7% last year and the reduction reflected in unanticipated benefit related to the conclusion of a tax examination.","For the full-year, our forecast continues to be based on an assume rate slightly lower then in 2015. As a result, EPS for the quarter of $0.69 was 15% lower than a year ago and as I mentioned earlier would have declined 21% excluding the tax benefit.","Either way results were generally in line with our expectation that called for a 15% to 20% decline in the first quarter. We believe our balance sheet places us in a strong position to support our growth initiatives, while also providing flexibility and opportunities to return cash to shareholders and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long-term.","Cash and short-term investments totaled $790 million at April 30, compared with $715 million a year-ago. Short-term and long-term debt totaled $1.1 billion and as a percentage of stockholders equity was unchanged versus a year-ago at 37%. Net inventories at April 30, were 2% lower than a year-ago and the effective foreign currency translation was negligible.","Accounts receivable of $221 million was 15% higher than a year-ago partly reflecting the timing of collections at quarter end as well as in-house credit related to both statement jewelry and wholesale sales. The receivable turnover rate remained high at 20 times per year.","Capital expenditures were $46 million in the first quarter versus $37 million in last year's first quarter. Beyond reinvesting some of our free cash flow on our business, our objective is to provide opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","As a reminder, at the end of last year our Board terminated a previously existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization remaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting the repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock.","Under our stock repurchase plan in light of our share price, we maintained a healthy pace of repurchases in the first quarter spending $78 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $66 per share. At April 30, approximately $416 million remained available for repurchases under the new program that expires in January 2019.","So in terms of our outlook for the year we believe it is prudent at this point of the year to moderate our annual forecast and call for a mid single-digit decline in diluted EPS in 2016 versus last year's diluted EPS excluding charges.","We do acknowledge some of the specific risks to the guidance for the remainder of the year primarily related to the difficulty in accessing the potential for a slower than expected improvement in U.S. activity, continued substantial softness in Europe and weakness in foreign tourist spending among the Chinese and other nationalities.","Beyond this full-year forecast we are modifying our near-term expectation and now forecast diluted EPS in the second quarter to decline by a percentage similar to what we just experienced in the first quarter. For the full-year this assumes net worldwide sales declining by a low single-digit percentage. It also factors in a bit more upside to gross margin than we initially expected.","I should add that our forecast also continues to assume a moderate strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the balance of the year and about a 2% net increase in worldwide gross square footage. Our full-year assumptions for inventories, CapEx and free cash flow are unchanged from the previous guidance. So that covers the outlook for this year.","We're all well aware of the near-term external headwind. However, we believe that the initiatives we're currently pursuing combined with an assumption that these headwinds will begin to abate at some point will eventually set the stage for Tiffany to achieve its longer-term objectives that call for a high single-digit net earnings growth driven by mid single-digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis and continued generation of strong free cash flow.","We were pleased with the large attendance and interest that our recent Investor Day in New York and with the substantial webcast audience as well. As we emphasized in the management presentation, which are available on our Investor website, we are focused on generating an attractive total shareholder return in the long-term. As I noted before this focus revolves around our objective to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brand.","Strategically this is premised on initiatives to effectively communicate with and serve our customers to optimize our store base to delight customers with new product design and to improve our cost structure and enhance our supply chain. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and the right management team to execute on those strategies and on a related note we've begun the search to fill our recently vacated CFO position.","So I hope you found today's conference call to be informative, but feel free to call me with any questions.

Fernandez - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Tiffany & Co. Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Jim Fernandez, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark L. Aaron","Thank you. Greetings from our corporate offices here in New York, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Jim and I will review results on this call and update you on our current full year outlook.","Please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now let's proceed with a review of Tiffany's performance. We are pleased to report a very solid quarter with a healthy rate of worldwide sales growth and a faster rate of earnings growth. Net sales rose 7% in dollars and 11% on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with the difference primarily reflecting the substantial weakening of the yen over the past year. And on a local currency basis, sales rose in all regions.","Operating earnings rose 31% as we benefited from a higher gross margin and SG&A expense leverage. Our effective tax rate was lower than last year. As a result, net earnings rose 50%.","In other news, we introduced important additions to our Atlas jewelry collection. We launched our redesigned website. We announced the hiring of Tiffany's new Design Director and we opened 6 new stores.","Let's look at sales performance by region. In the Americas, sales rose 4% in the third quarter, which was largely due to a higher average price per jewelry unit sold. A small increase in jewelry units sold included greater growth in fine jewelry, but we were pleased to see some growth in fashion jewelry, too.","Comparable store sales rose 1%. The New York flagship store posted a solid increase, primarily resulting from higher sales to foreign tourists from China and Europe but also with modest growth in domestic spending.","However, brand store sales were mixed by market. In the U.S., there was softness along much of the East Coast, strength along the West Coast and there were substantial sales declines in Hawaii and Guam due to lower Japanese tourist sales likely tied to the weaker yen.","Elsewhere in the region, results were mixed in Canada, Mexico and Brazil. We opened 4 stores in the Americas during the quarter: in the Garden State Plaza mall in New Jersey; in Cleveland, Ohio's Eton Center; in the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada; and in Curitiba, Brazil, finishing the quarter with 120 stores in the Americas.","We also relocated our Bloor Street store in Toronto to a nearby site that is providing our customers with an extraordinary shopping environment and experience. And we're delighted to be entering New Orleans when we open a store tomorrow at The Shops at Canal Place near the city's historic French Quarter.","The Asia-Pacific region posted a strong 27% sales increase in the quarter, with broad-based double-digit comp store sales increases in Greater China and in most other markets in the region. The increase was generated by roughly equal growth in the average price per jewelry unit sold and in the higher jewelry unit sold in most categories.","On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total Asia-Pacific sales rose 29%, with comp store sales growing 22% after a 4% comp decline last year.","We opened a store in Jinan, China during the quarter, marking Tiffany's 24th store in China. At quarter end, we operated 68 stores in the Asia-Pacific region. In the fourth quarter, 2 more stores are planned to open in China and we are adding 2 stores in Taiwan, 1 of which opened 2 weeks ago in the Shinkong Mitsukoshi Ximen store in Tainan.","We operate 54 stores in Japan, and our business there performed well in the quarter. In local currency, total sales increased 9% and comparable store sales rose 5%, which is on top of a 5% increase in last year's third quarter and was in line with our expectations. That 9% total sales increase was due to increases in the average price per jewelry unit sold, as well as unit growth in most jewelry categories. However, the yen has weakened more than 20% versus the U.S. dollar in the past year. So the 9% sales growth in the yen translated into a 13% sales decline in dollars.","Beyond our growing brand strength and product desirability, we believe our sales in Japan might also be benefiting, to some degree, from the decline in Japanese tourist spending in the U.S., which might be boosting local demand in Japan.","Our results in Europe were mixed in the quarter. Total sales rose 7% due to increases in both average price per jewelry unit sold and in the number of jewelry units sold. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 4% on a 2% comparable store sales increase that was below our expectation and was on top of an 8% comp increase in last year's third quarter.","Within the region, for the second consecutive quarter, sales growth was led by the U.K., which more than offset softness in Continental Europe. The sales growth reflected higher local customer and foreign tourist demand, although with no discernible pattern.","We opened a store in Stuttgart in the Breuninger department store in the third quarter, marking our seventh store in Germany, and giving us 36 company-operated stores in Europe at the end of the quarter.","We also completed a major renovation of our Frankfurt store during the quarter and recently relocated our Florence store to a more spacious nearby site on Via Tornabuoni. One more store is planned to open in Italy before year-end.","Lastly, Tiffany's other sales increased 14% in the third quarter, largely due to an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds that we acquire and then subsequently sell to meet our quality requirements.","Comparable store sales rose 1%, representing the first quarter of comparability for our 5 stores in the United Arab Emirates, 3 in Dubai and 2 in Abu Dhabi, that were converted from wholesale distribution to company-operated locations in the middle of last year. We're excited about the sales growth potential for Tiffany in the Middle East to enhance brand awareness and expansion of our store and customer base.","Complementing our store base is a strong global web presence, which now includes e-commerce in 13 countries and informational sites in a number of additional countries. And I should add that these websites are featured in 9 languages.","Worldwide Internet sales growth, which is included in each region in the third quarter was in line with retail sales growth in our stores. As I mentioned in the overview, we launched our newly redesigned website in October. The new site is, without doubt, more engaging with greater storytelling and video content. It's easier to navigate. And for the first time, we are showcasing our Blue Book Collection of million-dollar jewelry.","The new site also offers suggestions of related product ideas for customers and an interesting and fun Drop a Hint feature for the holidays. Early indications show that visitors are spending considerably more time on the new site and we encourage you to visit the site and take a look for yourself.","And as a reflection of our effective use of digital media, we were pleased to see that Tiffany, for the third consecutive year, was recently ranked #1 by L2, a think tank for digital innovation, in their Digital IQ Index, assessing the digital competence of 80 global watch and jewelry brands.","Now let's look at a few merchandising highlights for the third quarter. Overall, we continued to see the strongest sales growth in statement, fine and solitaire jewelry, meaning jewelry with gemstones at mid to higher price points. But we're also pleased to see some initial signs of improvement in the fashion jewelry category.","Strong statement jewelry sales in the quarter reflected the success of an exclusive event in New York that we held in October for some of our Tiffany registered customers as well as statement sales in some other markets.","Notable highlights in fine jewelry in the third quarter were strong sales in the Enchant collection, with an expansion of the collection coming next year; our extraordinary Yellow Diamond collection; new jewelry designs with pink diamond accents and our Victoria collection. And we are pleased with sales of our Cobblestone and Select collections, which have been expanded with a focus on diamonds and colored gemstones.","Straddling both the fine and fashion jewelry categories is our Keys collection, which is enjoying a strong sales resurgence. After being introduced 4 years ago, this popular collection is showing continued strength in gold and platinum styles accented with diamonds, and is now also benefiting from newer designs in platinum accented with colored diamonds.","In fashion jewelry, the big story right now is the success of our reinterpreted and recently launched Atlas collection in various metals and styles but with noteworthy popularity in gold pieces.","I should add that our marketing communications in support of the Atlas collection will be ongoing. The Ziegfeld collection in silver pearls and onyx continues to post strong results 5 months after the premiere of The Great Gatsby movie. And Tiffany's Metro collection continues to be a solid performer.","Engagement jewelry sales in the quarter were higher in most regions. While that very meaningful category is certainly led by our 6-pronged Tiffany setting, we've also successfully expanded the range of designs over the years. The latest innovation is our Harmony engagement ring collection, which we launched exclusively in Japan last year and rolled it out globally earlier this year and just recently expanded the assortment with the addition of Harmony band rings.","So we were pleased with either solid performance or initial signs of some improvement across most of our jewelry categories. There are a lot of new products in the development stages under the leadership of our new Design Director, Francesca Amfitheatrof, who we were delighted to welcome to Tiffany in September. She's already fully immersed in our design process with her team, especially focused on reinvigorating the fashion jewelry category.","Regarding our watch business, we are proceeding with plans to design, produce, market and distribute our own Tiffany & Co. brand watches. However, the previously disclosed claims and counterclaims between Swatch and Tiffany are still pending in a confidential arbitration in the Netherlands, and the panel will issue its decision at an undetermined future date.","I'm now very pleased to turn the call over to Jim.","James N. Fernandez","Okay, thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Tiffany's third quarter results continued the improvement we've seen in the past few quarters and we're very pleased with our progress. Earnings benefited from healthy sales growth, gross margin improvement and sales leverage on well-managed cost.","Gross margin of 57% in the third quarter was 2.6 points above last year and above our expectation. This contrasted with a 3.5-point decline in last year's third quarter when we were experiencing significant pressure from higher product costs.","As we have previously noted, we began to feel diminishing product cost pressures near the end of 2012, which turned into a tailwind in the second quarter of 2013. I'm sure you are all aware of the lag we experience in realizing changes in gross margins due to our long lead times and relatively modest inventory turnover. And we are now benefiting from those reduced product costs, which should continue at least through year-end.","We are also benefiting from price increases we took earlier in the year to catch up with costs after avoiding any meaningful price increases in 2012.","Partly offsetting the product cost benefit in the quarter was a continuing shift in sales mix toward higher price point, lower gross margin products, including strong statement jewelry sales. However, we are now seeing some improvement in fashion jewelry sales growth, although it is not growing as fast as the total company.","Sales mix is an important component of gross margin and always more difficult to forecast, and we believe that it could have some mitigating effects on the extent of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter as well.","But all in all, we are now forecasting that gross margin for the full year will be higher than last year's 57%.","Moving down the income statement, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% in the third quarter, largely due to higher labor and store-related costs. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weaker yen, SG&A expense rose 8%. So measuring it either on a GAAP or a constant-exchange-rate basis, we improved the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales by leveraging fixed costs and we continue to forecast an improved SG&A expense ratio for the full year.","As a result of the increase in gross margin and the improved SG&A expense ratio, earnings from operations rose 31% in the quarter on a 7% sales increase. And we are expecting operating margin improvement for the full year.","Interest and other expenses, net, were $14 million in the third quarter versus $15 million last year and we continue to forecast it at about $58 million for the full year.","Our effective tax rate of 32.3% in the third quarter was down from 38.4% in last year's third quarter. This year's rate benefited from the onetime favorable impact of tax regulations related to the tax basis of fixed assets as well as differences in the geographical mix of earnings. Last year's higher rate resulted from our truing-up of the prior year's tax position upon filing our tax returns. We estimate a full year effective tax rate in the range of 34% to 35%.","So with virtually everything moving in a favorable direction, we were able to generate a 31% increase in operating earnings and a 50% increase in net earnings in the third quarter, and diluted EPS rose 49%. This was better than the expectation included in our last published guidance, which leads us to increase our full year forecast.","Our guidance for the full year now calls for earnings per diluted share of $3.65 to $3.75, which does not include a $0.05 charge we recorded earlier in the year, and which compares with last year's $3.25 per share. We are basing that on full year assumptions, calling for mid-single-digit worldwide sales growth in dollars or high single-digit growth in local currency, with comp store sales growth in local currencies ranging from low-double digits in Asia-Pacific in Japan to mid-single digits in Europe and low-single digits in the Americas.","Backing into a fourth quarter sales forecast, this implies mid-single digit sales growth in dollars or high-single-digit sales growth in local currency with single-digit comp increases in all regions.","And our assumption of a full year improvement in the operating margin coming from a favorable gross margin and expense ratio implies a modest improvement in the operating margin in the fourth quarter.","We continue to pursue an active pace of organic expansion and we have a healthy balance sheet to support it. Our return on average assets was 10% on a trailing basis and return on average stockholders' equity was 18%. Our long-term financial objectives continue to call for achieving at least 10% ROA and 15% ROE.","I'm pleased to report that inventories are at very appropriate levels. Net inventories of $2.4 billion at October 31 was 6% higher than a year ago comprised of a 5% increase in finished goods and a 7% increase in combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. Excluding the effect of currency translation, primarily the stronger dollar versus the weaker yen, net inventories would've increased 9%.","For the full year, we are forecasting a 5% inventory increase in dollars. Whether it's measured in dollars or local currency, inventory growth this year has been slightly less than sales growth, which is consistent with our long-term objective.","Accounts receivable on October 31 were 3% above last year, reflecting worldwide sales growth and would've increased 10% when excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. Receivables are turning at more than 20x per year.","Capital expenditures were $149 million year-to-date versus $157 million in last year's year-to-date. And we are projecting about $225 million of CapEx for the year versus $220 million last year.","In terms of liquidity, we had $521 million of cash and cash equivalents at October 31 versus $345 million a year ago. Total short-term and long-term debt increased $30 million from a year ago, but as a percentage of stockholders' equity, declined to 36% from 40% a year ago.","So we have a solid balance sheet and continue to forecast achieving positive free cash flow of around $300 million in 2013 versus the $109 million in 2012.","Behind the scenes, our manufacturing facilities, diamond sourcing organization and distribution centers are functioning effectively to maintain high in-store product availability and to efficiently ship products to customers.","In summary, the third quarter was another good one for Tiffany and we believe we are well positioned for the holiday season. We have pursued an active pace of store expansion this year, which includes adding a net of 14 stores in 2013. We've introduced several exciting and well-received new jewelry collections and we've enhanced our marketing communications.","Despite the obvious economic and consumer uncertainties in some regions, our management team sees great opportunities ahead of us, and we're enthusiastic about our ability to fully realize Tiffany's longer-term growth potential.","That wraps up my comments. I'll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark L. Aaron","Thanks, Jim. We hope all of you found today's conference call to be informative.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Tiffany & Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Frederic Cumenal, Tiffany's CEO; and Mr. Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead sir.","Mark Aaron","Thank you, good morning everyone. We issued Tiffany's fourth quarter financial results earlier today and hope you have had the chance to read the news release. On today's agenda, I will review sales results, Ralph will cover the rest of the earnings statements and the balance sheet and the 2016 outlook and then Frederic will close with some comments on strategy before we then answer your questions.","Before continuing, please note the statements made on this call that are not historical facts or forward-looking statements, actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now let's proceed. I think we can begin with a candid assessment that overall financial results 2015 were disappointing. On the positive side, we accomplished many on-going strategic initiatives tied to expanding and optimizing our store base and web presence, introducing new product designs that resonated with customers, managing inventories well and achieving strong free cash flow. We improve Tiffany's gross margin by full point in the year and managed our SG&A expenses prudently while increasing marketing spending. However, a worldwide sales increase of only 2% on a constant exchange rate basis and 3% decline as reported combing with the 9% decline in EPS excluding charges in 2014 & 2015 clearly did not meet our initial targets. For a good part of the year we achieved healthy sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis in most regions outside the U.S. But sales were negatively affected by the translation effect of strong U.S. dollar. ","In the Americas, our largest region, we faced the daunting challenges in the U.S. of sharply lowered foreign tourists spending along with weaker sales to domestic customers. And then the year concluded on a softer note in most markets around the world. While we can attribute some of the pressure on results of the strong U.S. dollar and other macro factors that affected consumer spending, bot with local customers and foreign tourists which we expect will continue into 2016 as Frederic will discuss. We continue to focus on catalyst to drive our business effectively and efficiently as we invest in longer term growth opportunities. ","And wrapping up the summary on a positive note, our disciplined inventory management enabled us to exceed our objective for free cash flow. While a portion of that cash gets reinvested into growing our business, we also were pleased to return cash to shareholders through dividends including our fourteenth dividend increase in the past 13 years and share repurchases with our board authorizing a new and larger purchase program in January. ","For now, let's look at sales performance in our various regions. First, there were no meaningful changed in the geographical mix in 2015 versus 2014. With the Americas again representing just under 50% of worldwide sales followed by Asia-Pacific at 24%, Japan at 13% and Europe at 12%. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis total and comp store sales in the full year were down 2% and 4% and trends were a bit softer in the fourth quarter with declines of 6% and 8%. ","In dollars total sales declined 4% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter reflecting lower unit volume in the cross categories especially in silver jewelry under $500 partly offset by favorable pricing mix. I already mentioned the adverse effect from the strong U.S. dollar on foreign tourist's sales in Americas. Although it cannot be tracked precisely we now estimate that foreign tourist's sales represent less than a quarter of U.S. sales for roughly 40% of the sales in New York flagship store. We saw a marked deceleration in Chinese tourist's spending in the fourth quarter in the Americas and frankly in most other regions as well.","In addition it's worth noting that domestic sales were also generally soft across the U.S. in varying degrees in the full year and more so in the fourth quarter. However, we were pleased with local currency total sales growth in Canada and Latin America. During the year we added a net of two stores in Americas. Opening in the U.S. in the Miami design district, in Ottawa, Canada and in Santiago Chile and closing the U.S. store in the Mohegan Sun Resort. We also relocated a few stores in the Americas region in line with our strategy to optimize our store base and continue with the worldwide program to renovate stores to a new design aesthetic.","In the Asia-Pacific region on a constant exchange rate basis total sales in the full year rose 3% and comparable store runs unchanged. While total in comp stores sales softened in the fourth quarter declining 3% and 8%. Within the region Greater China is comprised of the 51 total stores we operate across China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau and represents more than half of the total sales of the region. For the year we experienced some growth throughout most markets in the Asia-Pacific region led by strengths in mainland China and Australia but we also saw substantial softness in Hong Kong.","Growth decelerated in the fourth quarter across most of the region reflecting the further softening of Chinese tourist spending that I alluded to earlier. Spending within China was strong throughout the fourth quarter but it's been more volatile since then. In addition there is clearly no way to predict when sales growth will resume in Hong Kong, so we are assuming that softness will continue through 2016. When measured in U.S. dollars total Asia-Pacific sales declined 2% in the full year and 8% in the fourth quarter due to generally lower jewelry unit's volume in most categories partly offset by higher average pricing mix.","We continue to be pleased with our progress in developing brand awareness of Tiffany with the Chinese customers. Volatile economies, currencies and soft markets certainly effect short term spending by customers of all nationalities including those in China. However, we remain committed to serving the growing desires of those customers seeking extraordinary jewelry of the finest quality and with a wonderful in-store experience. It was substantial store activity across the Asia-Pacific region during the year with the net addition of 8 stores. We opened 11 stores including 5 in China, 2 in Macau, and 1 each in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. ","We also closed 3 existing stores in the region including one each in China, Korea and Taiwan. Now turning to Japan, we had a very successful year in 2015.","On a constant exchange rate basis total sales rose 10% and comp stores sales rose 5% in the full year and we finished with increases of 12% in total sales and 10% in comps in the fourth quarter. Throughout the year our results in Japan benefitted from higher foreign tourists spending predominantly Chinese while domestic customer spending fluctuated and was roughly unchanged for the full year. The weaker Yen versus the Dollar had a substantially negative effect on the translation of those sales into dollars in the year although less so in the fourth quarter. And when measured in dollars, total sales in Japan declined 2% in the full year but rose 9% in the fourth quarter.","We kept the number of company operated stores in Japan and unchanged at 56. Although during the year we expanded two stores and relocated two others. We also achieved strong sales growth in Europe through most of the year, on a constant exchange rate basis due to a combination of higher foreign tourist spending likely tied to a weak Euro in town as well as local customer demand. For sales growth decelerated considerably in the fourth quarter, especially in France following the tragedy in Paris that reverberated across other countries in the region as well. However, for the full year on a constant exchange rate basis, total and comparable store sales grow 12% and 9% with strength across continental Europe and the U.K. which represents the vast 40% of our European sales.","In the fourth quarter however, total sales grows 2% and comp store sales declined 3% due to the pronounced softness and France and mixed results elsewhere. When translated into U.S. Dollars, total sales in Europe declined 1% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter, partly due to modest declines in jewelry unit volume, as well as lower average price that was largely currency related.","We were active on the store fronts in Europe in 2015, opening our first store in Geneva and our second in Madrid, and we also enhanced our store presence in London with relocations in both Harrods and Selfridges. We also now include our Moscow store which has been posting strong growth since opening in early 2014 within the Europe region instead of in the other segments. We concluded 2015 with 41 stores in Europe and last month we opened the third store in Rome on Via dei Condotti.","Lastly, other sales declined 13% in the full year and were down 6% in the fourth quarter. Both periods were affected by comp store sales declines in our stores in the UAE and there were lower wholesale sales in diamonds in the full year. From my comments on this region you can see that it was an active year on the store development front as we continue to optimize our store based partly with store openings, but also with a substantial number of renovations and relocations and some closings. The ultimate objective is to drive better topline growth through stronger comparable store sales growth rather than from simply opening substantial numbers of stores.","For the full year we opened 16 stores and closed four, representing a 4% increase on the number of company-operated stores and a corresponding 4% increase in worldwide gross square footage. Our plan for 2016 is open 11 stores across most regions while also closing or relocating some existing ones resulting in a 2% net increase in company-operated retail square footage. The longer term expectation is to approximately maintain that square footage gross rate. In terms of store productivity worldwide sales per gross square foot, for company-operated stores declined slightly $2,900 compared with $3,100 per foot in 2014, resulting from the 4% increase in worldwide square footage for lesser growth in sales.","By regions, sales productivity in 2015 ranged from $4,300 in Asia Pacific, to $3,100 in Japan, to $2,900 in Europe, to $2,300 in the Americas region. Of course keep in mind that the negative translation effect on sales from the strong dollar had a meaningful effect on any decline in productivity. Before concluding the regional sales review, it's worth reminding everyone of the meaningful benefits that we derive from complementing our store presence with our website which reinforce brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic. E-commerce sales in dollars grows modestly in the full year which was better than the 3% worldwide sales decline, and continue to represent 6% of worldwide sales. This dual focus on stores and online supports our global strategy to enhance our relationships with customers and optimize their overall experiences with Tiffany.","Finally from a merchandising perspective, the decline fourth quarter sales did not include any significant differences in performance among our product categories on a worldwide basis. For the full year, the 3% worldwide sales decline in dollars or the 2% increase on the constant exchange rate basis included virtually in line performance relative to overall sales for the statement fine and solitaire jewelry category. Although with strong sales growth with statement jewelry. ","In line relative performance for the fashion jewelry category, although with continued strong gold jewelry sales and a slight relative underperformance in the engagement jewelry category, although a new marketing campaign that we launched last month is intended to address that engagement softness. We were pleased with customer response to new products that we introduced in the fashion and fine jewelry categories, including design reinterpretation in our Return to Tiffany and Infinity collections which have been successful in mitigating some of the softness in silver jewelry sales under $500. Our new designs in the Victoria and Bow fine jewelry collections, including diamonds, the continued success of the Tiffany T collection which reached the highest sales level ever for a jewelry collection in its first 12 months, and we were pleased with sales of our new watch collections including the CT60 and the East West collections.","So that covers the regional and product sales highlights, and I'll now turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark. For forward looking and the rest of the results, I would like to reinforce some few points. Sales force was challenged by the strong U.S. dollar throughout the year, both on the effect on the translation of results and the effect on tourist spending in the U.S. While we saw a higher gross margin in the full year and fourth quarter, the operating margin was pressured all year by the lack of sales growth and the resulting sales deleverage on SG&A expenses. A 9% decline in EPS for the full year excluding charges in 2015 and 2014 was below our initial expectation a year ago that had called for minimal growth. ","However we managed the inventories more efficiently, meeting our objective to keep inventory growth below sales growth and finished the year generating higher amount of free cash flow of then initially planned. We return cash to shareholders to substantial share repurchases and another increase in dividend, and we expect the further strengthening of the dollar along with challenging and volatile external conditions that affect customer spending to continue to pressure results in 2016 and especially in the first half of the year.","Let's look at the rest of the earnings statement, the balance sheet and our forecast. Gross margin grows in the full year and the fourth quarter. We benefitted throughout the year to varying degrees from favorable product input cost while sales mix fluctuated during the year. We also took price increases during the year that addressed most of the pressure from the strong dollar and has enabled us to restore our global pricing structure pretty much back to normal levels. Our forecast for gross margin in 2016 close to some increase primarily due to lower product input cost as well as benefits from price increases taken within the past year, and anticipated modest increases in the coming year. For our expectation for minimum sales growth will continue to put some pressure on gross margin as it will be difficult to get sales leverage on fixed cost. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses grow 5% in the full year and 6% in the fourth quarter. Both of those results included translations benefits from the strong dollar. We would also note that the full year SG&A expenses included a $38 million loan impairment charge with $10 million of that in the second quarter and $28 million in the fourth quarter related to a diamond mining company in Sierra Leone, and also included a $9 million charge recorded in the fourth quarter for staffing and occupancy reduction.","Excluding these charges, SG&A growth in the quarter and year was due to store related spending and higher pension cost, partially upset by lower variable cost. In addition, marketing spending grows in the full year to represent 7.4% of net sales, from 6.7% in the prior year. Although marketing spending declined in the fourth quarter as we expected due to disproportionally high spending in the fourth quarter of 2014 tied to the launch of the Tiffany T Collection. ","We expect SG&A expenses in 2016 to increase over 2015's SG&A expense including charges due to increase in store related and marketing expenses with some benefit from lower pension clock. Our projections for 2016 of a modest increase in the gross margin and for the SG&A expense growth exceeding sales growth mostly due to higher store related costs will result in a decline of the operating margin for the year. Interests and other expenses net declined in the full year due to our refinancing of long term debt to lower interest rates in October of 2014. Interest and other expenses net were about flat in the fourth quarter. We are projecting interest and other expenses net to be approximately unchanged in 2016.","The effective tax rate for the full year was slightly higher than last year and we are projecting a fractionally lower rate in 2016. Adding it all up net earnings declined 5% in the fourth quarter and 9% in full years excluding charges in both years. This followed a 13% increase in net earnings in 2014 excluding charges. Putting together our assumptions for 2016 we arrive at a forecast going for net earnings ranging from unchanged to a mid-single digit decline compared to the $3.83 per diluted share excluding charges in 2015. While we expect a gradually improving pace of sales over four quarters we also expect a similar progression in terms of earnings with earnings declining in the first quarter by 15% to 20%, a 5% to 10% decline in the second quarter and then followed by a resumption of growth in the second half.","Most importantly, we will continue throughout the year to focus on investing and improving the business despite a choppy and uncertain environment. Looking at our balance sheet, we finished the year in a very solid position. Net inventories of $2.2 billion as of January 31 were 6% lower in the prior year-end. Raw materials and working process declined 4% and finished goods inventories declined 7% reflecting more effective inventory management. Even excluding the translation effect from the strong dollar, net inventories would have declined 4% in the year compared with the 2% on worldwide net sales on a constant exchange basis.","We are projecting inventories in 2016 to be roughly unchanged. Accounts receivables of $206 million were 6% higher than year ago largely reflecting in house credit tied to strong sales of statement jewelry but the receivables turnover remained a very high at 21x per year. Our capital expenditures totaled $253 million in 2015 versus $247 million in the prior year and represented 6% of sales in both years. Approximately half of our CapEx is store related for openings, renovations and relocations. With that store related mix shifting more toward renovations and relocations. CapEx also currently includes substantial spending during a multi-year period to introduce new IT systems with a major focus on a global customer relationship management system and a new inventory management system.","We began 2015 projecting that we would generate free cash flow of at least $400 million and later in the year revised the forecast upwards to at least $500 million based on better inventory management. We are pleased to now report that actual pre cash flow for 2015 amounted to $561 million and for 2016 we are projecting to generate free cash flow of at least $400 million. In addition to continuing to reinvest some in the business we regularly evaluate opportunities to return cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. We were quite active in that area in 2015.","In the second quarter we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% which represented the fourteenth dividend increase in the past 13 years and as the year progressed we stepped up the pace of share repurchases to take advantage of a lower stock price.","For the full year we spent $220 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares at an average cost of $78 per share. In January our board replaced an existing $300 million repurchase program that had only about $59 million of authorization maintaining and replaced it with a new authorization permitting repurchase up to $500 million of common stock. At January 31, approximately $494 million remained available for repurchase under that new program that expires in January 2019. Factoring everything we highlighted we finished the year in cash and short term investment of $887 million and $1 billion of short term and long term debt that represented 38% of stock holders equity. Despite the lower earnings Tiffany's full year returns on assets as recorded was approximately 9% and the return of the stockholders equity was approximately 16% close to our long term objectives of at least a 10% ROA and at least a 15% ROE.","Looking at our longer term we believe that by continuing to invest in sales growth opportunities and managing cost effectively helped by more favorable external environment Tiffany will be well positioned to achieve and improve sustainable financial performance. Given this our earnings objectives ultimately includes reaching high-single digits net earnings growth driven by mid-single digit worldwide net sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis by also continuing a very strong pre cash flow.","Wrapping up my remarks, with a challenging year with overall disappointing financial performance, however, that should not over shadow the progress we are making to operate Tiffany's business more profitably over the longer term.","I will now turn the call over to Frederic and we will then take some questions. ","Frederic Cumenal","Thank you Ralph, and thank you Mark for those reviews. While our financial results in 2015 were clearly disappointing, I also believe that challenges can help us to learn and sharpen our focus on number of important initiatives within our control in order to derive better financial performance going forward. And I believe that Tiffany has many fantastic growth opportunities world over. On our call a year ago I talked about a clear road map of the future focused the historic experience, product, marketing, and supply chain and margin improvements. I believe we made progress in all of those areas in 2015 and we have continued opportunities to do more in 2016 and beyond.","Our overall objective is to derive separate total shareholder return through self-growth and improving margins and cash flow, strengthening the brand and the customer experience and achieving operational excellence. Our key strategy focuses on selling and what I mean by that is to better engage with our customers through a more consulted approach in our thoughts, through enhanced visual merchandizing presentation, through better customer data analytics using a new global CRM system and through optimizing our store base. In regard to stores we were active in 2015 through openings, renovations, relocations and a few closings.","In the coming years we will continue to be very focused in optimizing our existing store base with a 2% net increase in worldwide square footage, that includes opening 11 new stores through most regions. As we continue to increase Tiffany's worldwide store base our ultimate objective is to ensure that we are best positioned in every market where we have a presence. We were pleased with customer reactions to the new design that we have introduced in 2015. Those designs included extraordinary statements pieces in the Art of Sea collection in our Blue Book that was introduced to very strong demand.","And at the other extreme we worked at improving our entry level silver jewelry assortment with some encouraging early results. We were so very proud to make our official strategic reentry into the watch category and double our watch sales albeit on a very small base. I also believe that our marketing through print and digital media and catalogues is more effectively communicating Tiffany as the global luxury brand with appeal to both the gift giver and the self-purchaser. With an extraordinary product assortment and a 170-year age heritage, we have strong messages to convey to customers. ","I'm pleased to say that we attracted some highly skilled new members of management at various levels and in different areas of responsibility over the past year, and now have experienced teams in place at the global and regional levels to execute our strategies. And despite the operation sales and earnings in 2015, I was pleased that we increased our growth margin and managed expenses prudently and we all well maintain a strong financial position. While we invested in our business in stores into outsourcing and in developing new IT system, we were still able to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. ","I'll close by reiterating our objective to reinforce Tiffany's position amongst the world's most important luxury brand. External pressures on our business will eventually evade and we believe that the long term global growth opportunities for the Tiffany brand are compelling. We will remain committed to building on Tiffany's great heritage by delivering the finest products and experiences to a growing number of customers.","I hope that many of you will participate in our investor day meeting on April 12, whether in person or on the webcast, and I look forward to seeing many of you throughout the year and updating you on our progress. I'll now turn the call back to Mark, and we can open up the call to answer some questions.","Mark Aaron","Thank you, Frederic. Taylor, I think we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you, good morning. I want to follow up on the state of the domestic consumer spending in the U.S. What do you think is driving the sales decline there? And then what is the pace of newness look like to try to reinvigorate that business from here?","Frederic Cumenal","Talking specifically about the domestic consumer in the U.S. because we all know the very negative impact of foreign tourist that we have to deal in '15 and frankly that we will mostly likely have to continue to deal with in '16. The domestic consumers in the U.S. behavior have been quite fickle and frankly we can put that partly on the economic uncertainty on the volatility of the financial market and on a particularly tensed electoral campaign in a year of presidential election. The pace of introduction of novelty will continue to remain high and frankly we will continue and we will faster the introduction of newness at or below $500 price point. What we think and what we experience by the end of the year in the U.S. through the introduction of new SKUs, namely, behind Infinity as a collection and Return to Tiffany. We've really enjoyed some significant success behind those introductions. So what we have in our plans for the year is to faster the pace of introduction especially below $500 price point on several collections.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Mark Aaron","Okay, next question.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Anne-Charlotte Windal with Bernstein.","Anne-Charlotte Windal ","Good morning. So looking at your Q1 EPS guidance, it seems to imply a little bit of deterioration in supply trend compared to Q4, so could you please elaborate for us on the trends and drivers you are currently seeing across regions from a topline standpoint. I think you are alluded to a little bit of weakness in China going into Q1. Thank you.","Ralph Nicoletti","Anne-Charlotte, it's Ralph. Good morning. What I'll do is maybe talk a little bit about the earnings that I spoke about just previously on the remarks and then maybe Frederic will turn a little bit more to a view of the regions in your question as related to what we were seeing at the end of the fourth quarter. Clearly we're in a very choppy volatile environment. We saw that coming out of the fourth quarter. So when we look at the progression of our sales and particularly in the first quarter and what the comparisons also look like. We see the first half of the year more challenging than the second half, and then with that as you know on this business you need solid growth to get expense leverage, and frankly we're going to be not seeing that. It's going to build through the year so it's difficult to get expense leverage and that puts some pressure on the EPS particularly in the first half of the year, and most acutely in the first quarter.","Frederic Cumenal","Last year, I mean 2015, the first part of the year we've enjoyed a very nice growth in Europe thanks to influx of tourists, and we believe that because of what's going on in Europe has a combination of break sit in the U.K., migrants in continental Europe and in the U.K. and risk of terrorism or perception of risk of terrorism, we believe that the tourist business in Europe that is a main driver of sales for this region will be very significantly down. You also remember that Q1 of last year we're above by comparison to Q1 of '14. A very good performance in Japan. Despite the fact that we are continuing to grow and we plan to continue to grow in Japan, frankly. We want to enjoy such higher growth and the one that we have been able to enjoy during the first part of the year of '15. And lastly, just on your comment on China, frankly we are quite pleased with mainland China and all performance in China.","We have had very solid performances in '15 in China, and we have no reason to think that our performance won't be good in mainland China in '16. Truth is that greater China because of Hong Kong continues to be a nightmare. There is no other word, and I believe this is the same for all of us, all the luxury player. We don't know when we will bottom up and we don't believe that the situation will significantly improve in Hong Kong during '16. So this is why we are not too bullish and Hong Kong is a significant market despite the decrease in '15, and this is why despite of overall good performance or we plan for good performance in '16 overall in Asia, but it will be negatively impacted by a low performance in Hong Kong. ","Ralph Nicoletti","Exactly.","Frederic Cumenal","Okay. Next question?","Operator","We will take our next question from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks for all the information and thanks for taking question. I wanted to follow up on the topic of newness and innovation and fashion, trying to understand it sounds like those areas outperformed the rest of the categories and portfolio. I'm trying to understand why it didn't maybe help the overall business more. Can you talk a little bit more about the opportunity to accelerate the process of bringing new products and collections and innovation to the stores and to the consumer? It sounds like the under $500 price point is going to be a focus, but is there opportunity to do more at higher price points as well? Are there supply chain constraints that make it more difficult? Just trying to understand the overall picture there around newness, new collections, new products. Thank you.","Frederic Cumenal","Okay. Omar, in a nut shell, we will continue and we will accelerate the newness on some of our core collections. Remember as stated by Mark that we are very successful with Tiffany T but it's only the beginning so we are going to continue to focus on establishing Tiffany T as an icon and we are to continue to leverage on newness and so you will see the emphasis on newness on T to engage even more with the consumer. You will also see newness on the very important collection that is particularly relevant on silver and under $500 around return to Tiffany that is going to be supported by new market access. ","And frankly, we know that this collection is particularly relevant, it's not the only one but to millennial. You will also see some more refresh on 1837 and some other collections but at the same time not only we see that it is clearly a collection cutting on retail between $750 and $5000 but you will see newness on some more classic fine jewelry we have introduced big refreshed collection around Victoria in bold in Q4 of 2015. We are going to continue to push behind those collections and to introduce some more newness behind those collections. You are going to see us to continue to activate and to refresh and to introduce new things on key so we are going to be particularly active in 2016 on the front of the newness frankly at every price point, not only under $500.","Ralph Nicoletti","And Omar its Ralph, on the back end of your question on the supply chain this one really highlights it. This was where our unique vertically integrated manufacturing and diamond sourcing capabilities, your positions very well here and so there's no issue in the supply chain and in fact we think it's a strong asset that we have to execute against the areas that Frederic just mentioned. ","Omar Saad","Thank for all the information.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","Hi good morning, thanks for all of that and my thanks for taking questions on the call. So the question I have is a strange one but a lot of talk for a while down to today's call about the impact the stronger U.S. dollar has upon domestic business, you have stores elsewhere, so when currency shifts you see sales throughout your system but the question I have is, Is there a lever or levers that Tiffany can pull in attempt to mitigate the impact of the stronger dollar in the U.S?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yes, I will start maybe from the supply chain, how we think in terms of the capital and that side and then Frederic can pick up on the more strategic end of it. First, as we look at it, Brian as we have talked about this before in different conferences as such, our cost base and our footprint is largely still in an evolving way, going from a U.S. centric in, when most of our revenue not long ago was mostly coming from the U.S and maybe to a lesser extent Japan to a real global footprint. And, building out our global capabilities in terms of how we source from a procurement standpoint, how and where we manufacture are all areas that we are taking a hard look at and have some action plans to extending our capabilities there, so there is on the -- I will go on the infrastructure side we are taking steps that over the next few years is going to make us better positioned to manage a strong dollar environment or frankly a more volatile currency environment over time in any direction that the dollar moves. ","So taking a lot of steps in that direction and then on capital allocation these volatile conditions, up from a strategic standpoint on capital allocations doesn't deter us from investing in key locations and key markets that we think strategically important to be at and you saw some of that in our investments in stores this year particularly in Asia, Europe and I think you will continue to see us invest smartly in locations so just will even better position our global footprint stores. ","Frederic Cumenal","And in the question of volatility of currencies is the critical one because it is not so much the value of the dollar that is the concern. The concern is the unpredictability and the reality for consumers is that perception is reality so, when you have a currency moving in one direction or the other direction consumers and tourist really tend to believe that everything is on deal in a given country or that everything is super expensive in another country. And brands as powerful as we can be or as powerful as some other brands can be there is not a lot of things we can do to counter this perception frankly when we look internally at our price differentials in the world, we are not any cheaper in Europe than we are in the U.S. so for Chinese consumers, buying Tiffany in Europe is not really a better deal than buying Tiffany in the U.S.","But they believe that everything in Europe is cheaper and there is nothing that I can do and we are not going to enter in terms of promotional, we are not going to reinforce promotional activities and started to discount things, we will never do that. We have a lot of concerted effort to manage and to track and to risk but the key for us is really always and always about the brand equity, brand management, reinforcing the relevance of the brand with all of our customers throughout a great job in their local market and second, reinforcing the customer experience both online and offline in retail stores when they are paying us a visit. ","Brian Nagel","It's all very helpful thank you and if I could just slip one short follow up in there. Would the market rebound recently? Have you seen a positive impact in your, I recognize this is a short term question?","Ralph Nicoletti","Yes, it is very short term so we will pass on it.","Brian Nagel","Okay, thanks anyway. Thank you.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you.","Frederic Cumenal","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Antoine Belge from HSBC.","Antoine Belge","Yes, hi this Antoine Belge at HSBC. I have got three questions. You discussed the product pipeline but could you also discuss the marketing initiatives especially others in terms of new traditional marketing but also in terms of digital, do you think you could do a few things better? Second question is on the rhythm on the face of store openings, it's indicated to be only around 2%, but it also looks like it is going to be structural because it is also becoming your long-term guidance. So could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And finally, can you -- regarding the gross margin with seeing favorable raw material prices at the end of last year, usually there is a certain time lag like 12 or 18 months, could you also tell us when you expect those tailwinds to feature in the gross margin? Thank you.","Ralph Nicoletti","Yes, Antoine, hi it's Ralph, good morning. I'll pick the gross margin first since you ended on that one. First overall we are pleased with our gross margin performance as we said in our remarks, we grew at a 100 basis points in 2015 and I guided to making some improvement in 2016. In 2016 we are seeing the benefit from lower product cost benefitting gross margin in the metals area. On the diamond side we are, we have said in the past we have seen some recent declines in rough diamond prices. We do have some of those lower cost diamond inventory in our process but it's going to take really into 2017 for that to work into the P&L. So 2016, lower product cost, metal driven, and some of our manufacturing initiatives, and then 2017 we'd be beginning to get the benefit from diamond pricing.","Frederic Cumenal","On the store front, I guess that we've always been very clear in terms of messaging about the fact that we are very much about locations, locations and locations. So while working a lot that's always improving the quality of our location, and you know that the line is changing in the world. So some of our stores were maybe perfectly located ten or 15 years ago and they are not anymore, so this is why you can see us relocating or even some places. But the future, our future, is not about opening a very high number of stores per year. We are still in the very unique position of being able to continue to grow geographically and to reinforce our position, but it's more critical for us to reinforce the customer experience through new design, better fitting, better lighting and by design I'm talking about the store design, the store concept, and always working on that opening a very high number of stores.","So we are very selective and very picky in making the case for this kind of long term 2% growth in term of square footage. In term of marketing because the operation was a branch of different question, in term of marketing and communications specifically, two things; you've seen the beginning of the year and this is what we are doing right now that we've introduced 360 marketing approach behind our Bridal and FDR. This is the year of the celebration of the 130 anniversary of the introduction of Six-Prong setting, the Tiffany Setting, and frankly we are using that as an alibi to highlight our craftsmanship, heritage and authority that we are on a category that is quite pivotal to the jewelry segment.","And lastly on digital, we are spending, we have been spending and we are trying to be state of the art on digital. Are we? No. Will we ever be? No, because always someone will do better than the ones after, but not in luxury actually. I will argue that we are probably more leading the pack, the group, in luxury than following all the luxury players. Do we have a lot of things to improve? Absolutely. Will you see some new things in digital? Frankly, you will see from us new things from digital every day because this is of pay and this is very demanding, this is high cost of doing business because you need to have your own team, you need to work with a lot of different partners and nevertheless you need to try the right balance between allowing social media and the word of mouth to do a part of the job for you but also to control the key messaging.","Antoine Belge","Thank you very much.","Mark Aaron","Next question?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is Kevin leaning on for Bob. I was just wondering if you could discuss some of the efforts and progress you've made on improving the store experience whether it's the quality of relationship of sales associates with the customers, the presentation of product, and then maybe what you've seen from the renovations you've done in Chicago, and then I think you talked about San Francisco and Beverly Hills as other locations that you were looking at to do some of the renovations.","Ralph Nicoletti","It's Ralph. I'll start in just maybe responding to the renovation question and what we've seen-- not getting into any specific stores because how we think about renovations is first, we have a disciplined process to approaching this, to our priorities to renovate to upgrade the experience for the customer in the stores, and we prioritize around key locations. So stores like Chicago is an example are very evident to that, and it's important. Frankly, our results, and we've said in the past, the results in terms of incremental revenue growth from after renovation has been mixed. It really depends on the store. It depends on what we're bringing in around it, and nonetheless it's very important that we do that for making sure that we're providing a great customer experience, and in some ways you could think of it as a cost of doing business and others. It is an investment in our presentation to customers.","Frederic Cumenal","The story trend by itself is only a part of a larger ambition that is again about better engaging the customers to frankly improve our fair over all. And it's made of different elements. It's related to leveraging better on our client based, and frankly we have been ramping up our clienteling programs and CRM activation, a little bit everywhere in the world but frankly we are focusing a lot on the U.S. It's also about raising the level of set mindset of thought through better program of animation and employee engagement around what I call a service signature that is beyond excellence, and we are deploying very aggressively and generally training and coaching, and we have big programs. And they are ongoing, and fully there is not a D-Day about that, there is not the day where things are done, but really we are investing significant time and money behind that.","And it's also, as we already pointed out about the consent optimization of store design to provide a better experience in term of basic things, comfort, lighting, sitting, it's depending of the categories or range of products that we are talking about. We need sitting or we don't need sittings, and it's also about mobility, better use of tablets and things like that. So we just recently opened a new store in Chengdu in China, in Taikoo Li, where we've tried to implement the latest concept that we have right now, and we are tracking and learning day by day. But we are extremely pleased by the results. So some more to come.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning everyone, and thank you very much for doing this question and answer session. As you think about the refresh of Tiffany with experience, Omni channel, product innovations, store selling. How far along are you, and as you do move along how do you see the long term ability for operating margins? Could they return to a 20% plus type of level or what do you see on the horizon? Thank you.","Ralph Nicoletti","Hi Dana, it's Ralph. On the operating margin question, we've said in the past and we continue to be confident that we could grow our operating margin about 50 basis points a year, over time. We don't have a clear view of where the feeling is on that, but we think we have plenty of room to grow our operating margin, and it's driven by a combination of mid-single digit sales growth with a focus frankly on comp store sales which as you know would help margin, improving our manufacturing and distribution for print for a more global presence, and a real sharp attack on cost on the SG&A area and driving that. So I think a combination of those areas while continuing to invest in marketing. It's an equation that we're comfortable saying that we could overtime grow 50 basis points. But we need to get as you know now, in the near term we need to get the sales growth back to mid-single digit levels.","Frederic Cumenal","And if I may, and we can be very clear about that. We don't believe that the structure of business should be around 20% growth margin, we have much higher operating margin sorry. We have much higher ambition. How long will that take is really the question but it's really your ambition is not to come back and to say a 20% but to achieve much higher numbers and on the first part of your question, there is no final line there is nothing, I believe that you will never hear us at least not me saying oh, this is done. It's an endless journey because the day you believe you have done everything you wanted to do there are more things to do because consumers are more exigent rightly so, they have different experience, they want to enjoy themselves even more and that said and we have to take on the challenge of delivering. ","Dana Telsey","Thank you","Operator","And we will take our next question from Randal Konik from Jefferies.","Randal Konik","Great, thanks a lot. I wanted to go back to the product focus and the collections etcetera. When you think about the innovation, strategy, just wanted to be clear you have about 15 collections on the website. How should we be thinking about the number of collections for the next few years and then as you add newness, should we be thinking about the gross add for the skew count of the portfolio or are you looking to kind of pair down some of the existing skews in the portfolio of products as you ramp up innovation and from Francesca's standpoint, she did a great job with the Tiffany T collection, you know from her vantage point, is it something she believes that the company needs to have more named collections or more standout pieces within the existing collections of the portfolio?","I am just trying to get some perspective there, and then lastly as related to your price strata, you talked a lot about your really innovating price points below 500, can we get some perspective on what kind of attrition is of price points below 500 today and what's the goal of that penetration over the medium term? Thanks.","Frederic Cumenal","So to start on the number of collections and frankly just for reference, the role of a design director is to design on bricks so the design director by definition doesn't have any opinion about the number of collections, because any design director will live to develop one end or two ends of a different collections and we are clearly not of this school of thought. Now, the skews, it is clear that when we are introducing new skews we are also using that as an opportunity to review the skew base and we are not about proliferation of skew. So if anything within the past few years we have reduced the number of skews and we need to do a better job and this is particularly on the net on all sites because we are presenting too many skews that some of them, you won't find them in stores. And it is a little bit, the tail of the collections, so it's probably and we are not considering that right now. And it's not making a good service and it's not helping us in this direction so, no skew proliferation if anything let's keep skew and then more skews.","About the number of collections, frankly we have got six or seven key collections. Will we introduce new collection in the future? Yes, absolutely, we will and the life of some of the collections that are maybe smaller and some we will focus less in the future on some of them but remember that those collections, lot of them have the capabilities and the ability to cover different price points. Not necessarily all of them below $500 price points but let's use T today or T tomorrow, yes, we have got one or two skews actually at $500 price point but we all know that the core offering of T is more on $1500 than anything else but this is a collection that can go much higher. And today it's going as high as $5,000 but there is no reason not to consider in the future this collection to have more accent diamonds and some other things so you know those collections can play a role at very different price points. So, it will be a mix of reworking, refreshing collections and innovating in existing collections but it will also be completed by a new T or something totally different but, in the coming few years. ","Randal Konik","And then just on the price point of $500 below, what's the penetration, where do you want the penetration to be? ","Frederic Cumenal","Thank you.","RalphNicoletti","Yes Randy, we don't have a specific goal on that but rest assured we have growth opportunities across the whole portfolio and in the under 500 price points, it's an important part of our business but it's not the core of everything we have going on here as Frederic said, we have a lot of, lot of strong initiatives across all price points. ","Frederic Cumenal","And we are talking about those initiatives because as you know they are a part fewer event some U.S. customers, they are much less outside the U.S.","Mark Aaron","So, as we said Randy we have not been looking to turbocharge those price points over jewelry but we certainly want to stabilize that category at some point and new products have indicated that we are moving in that direction.","Randal Konik","Great, thanks guys.","RalphNicoletti","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dorothy Lakner from Topika Capital Markets","DorothyLakner","Thanks and good morning everyone. I wondered if Ralph you talked about initiatives in manufacturing and making sure that Tiffany has a true global footprint there so I just wondered if you could provide a little bit more color on what you are working on, how you are planning to do that? Thank you. ","RalphNicoletti","Thanks Dorothy for the question. The way we are thinking about is a couple of ways. First, not that long ago, we got into manufacturing on a vertically integrated basis and so we have been building the capability and in time and in over time we have been doing this, we have been finding more and more ways to be more efficient in the operations we have so, one element of this is within the manufacturing footprint we have to continue to invest in the capabilities to improve our efficiencies.","Second, and I talk about this around systems, we have systems today that support our manufacturing and distribution network to our stores that was in place 20 years ago or more. When we were basically a small U.S. company and as we upgrade some of those systems capabilities, it will enable us to be much more nimble in terms of how we manage our inventory much more efficient of in the movement of our products and the accuracy of how we deploy and replenish our stores. So those kind of areas all bring us significant amount of cost inventory and service opportunity for us.","Those are a couple of examples and then maybe the last one I would add is just the area of procurement. And this runs both in SG&A and also in direct cost in particular that sit inside our gross margin. This year we really created a global procurement function and it's because we weren't really leveraging our global scale and footprint. And we put that in place and have got a very good start to it this year. We are going to see benefits in 2016 and it's going to build over time and that's the area and capabilities that we think there is a lot of runway at and that will help us manage costs as well. ","DorothyLakner","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Paul Swinand from Morningstar.","PaulSwinand","Good morning and thanks for taking all the questions. Just wanted to ask you a little bit about the long term cash flow. I know you improved cash flow despite the sales deleverage. I know in your other markets, I know it's largely inventory but it looks like on the balance sheet other assets as well. Can you comment on the long term efficiency and ability to improve those cash flow buckets over many years?","RalphNicoletti","Paul, its Ralph. A couple of ways I want to address your question. I think your first, an overall working capital, our focus has, in this past year as you can see from our results, has been on inventory management and there I just want to frame a little bit that the way we think about it and I would also say our inventory management process in the results that we have is really been an internal team effort here. It's a cross functional group, our merchandising marketing sales and finance team is really working hard at this, and you could see the benefits. But as we think about it, we're thinking about inventory management is a way to enable sales and improve cash flow, both, not one of the other but both. And so it's about getting more efficient on the raw and packaging material, front and diamond side linked to having better deployment and accuracy on the product placement in our stores and improving turns over there. So that's one clear aspect of it.","We have a lot of runway for improvement there but it cuts and widespread at this way because it cuts into two directions. One, there is an effort to this process to remove some of the excess that we have that is inefficient and not working for us. But as we better deploy our inventory we're also going to improve the turnover, and that's the other side of it so we can improve our turns as we get better in terms of how and where we replenish. So that's how we're thinking about it. We have a lot of runway. That's why I'm confident that overtime we can manage our inventory growth, grow our sales growth. As it relates to the other parts of the balance sheet, frankly I think we're in good shape on capital. We're getting very sharp on our discipline around the cost side of capital.","We've always been disciplined on the location and strategy side, but getting sharper principally through procurement on capital. And then areas of payables and accounts receivables, and what I would call cash conversion cycle. Frankly, we haven't put a lot of focus on that. I think we've been operating it pretty well, and that maybe an area in the future that we take a look at but I don't think the opportunity there is as big as the areas I just spoke about. ","PaulSwinand","A really quick follow-up. Is it more on the diamond side or is it across collections for the opportunities on the inventory?","Ralph Nicoletti","It's across the whole supply chain from rough diamond sourcing to finished product.","PaulSwinand","Okay. Thank you very much and best of luck.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you.","Mark Aaron","Operator, maybe one more question.","Operator","And we have time for one more question, and we will take our last question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the guidance for the second half of 2016. Is the return to gross in earnings a function of what are certainly easier comparisons or is there something else that you expect to drive that acceleration in the back half of the year? And then Ralph, I know you've been looking at the efficiency of operations and aggregate. You've talked about some of these things on this call today. But also looking in particular the efficiency of the expenses with organization and how you can deliver the greatest impact for the expenses that you're incurring.","Can you give us just some sort of big picture takeaway from the last year as you've been looking at that and where are the big buckets if there are any or even several small buckets of potential expense efficiencies that you could realize in the next one to three years. Thank you so much.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thanks, Kimberly. I'll address first the question you had on the phasing of our guidance throughout the year. In the back half of the year, the improvement in the back half of the year is really driven by two things. One, we've sited we do have easier comparisons in the back half of the year, but I think more importantly we are taking actions and we have been, and we are taking actions to improve our self-growth performance and we're expecting some improvement on our self-growth trend, and that's the principal driver of the improved various performance that we're projecting in the back half of the year. A combination of our marketing and new product initiatives, either really build over the course of the year, and that's why we believe that we'll improve the earnings performance in the back half. ","Mark Aaron","Okay.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session, and I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mark Aaron for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Aaron","Okay, thank you. So in closing we hope you find today's conference call informative. We certainly also hope that you've enjoyed the addition of an annual Q&A period on our year-end call. A replay of today's call is available on our website or by dialing 888-203-1112 in the U.S. or 719-457-0820 outside the U.S. and entering passcode 6324380. Finally, please note on your calendars that we expect to report first quarter results on May 25. Thanks for listening.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"20409":["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call November 29, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark Erceg - Executive Vice President and CFO","Mark Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Operator","Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, everyone. Welcome to this Tiffany & Company Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Erceg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Good day, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Joining me for today\u2019s call is Tiffany's new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Erceg.","Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.","Okay. By now you should have had a chance to read the news release which we issued earlier today, which indicated worldwide sales increased 1%, net earnings were up 5% and net earnings per diluted share were up 9% during the third quarter versus a year ago.","So in order to make the most efficient use of today\u2019s call, I will provide some additional perspective on segment sales and product trends, after which Mark will take us through the rest of the P&L and comment on Tiffany's outlook for the remainder of the year, and as always you can refer to the report on Form 10-Q we filed earlier today for additional details.","Starting in the Americas, total sales were 2% below prior year at a modest decline in jewelry units was mostly offset by an increase in the average price per unit sold. Comparable store sales improved to a 2% decline with no effect from currency translation after a 10% decline in the first half. While this is encouraging we did have an easier comparison to last year.","Sales in the U.S. were again pressured by lower spending attributable to local customers, which we believe was tied to macro, market and political uncertainties. Interestingly, spending by customers that we identify as foreign tourist actually rose in the quarter in contrast to a decline in the first half, as continued lower spending attributed to Chinese tourists was more than offset by increased spending attributed to visitors from Japan and elsewhere.","I presume you saw the comment in today\u2019s news release regarding our Fifth Avenue Flagship Store in New York. Sales in that store in every quarter of last year represented less than 10% of worldwide sales and had been a similar level so far this year in the third quarter and year-to-date through October 31st.","There certainly has been a lot of attention focused on the potential effect of activities related to the recent U.S. Presidential Election on stores along the relevant part of Fifth Avenue. What we've seen has been some adverse effect on traffic in our Flagship store, as well as the continuation of sales softness relative to last year and to our other U.S. stores this year. Because of obvious uncertainty, we will maintain a cautious outlook in the near-term and we cannot provide any assurance that sales in these both in the fourth quarter and beyond will not be negatively affected.","During the quarter we relocated one of our Canadian stores located within the Holt Renfrew department store in Vancouver and also relocated one of our U.S. stores located within the King of Prussia Mall, which is in the Philadelphia market.","In the Asia-Pacific region we were pleased to return to sales growth in the third quarter, with total sales up 4% as reported and 3% on a constant exchange rate basis. There was an increase in jewelry units and a decline in the average price per unit sold. Comp store sales declined 7%. Currency translation had no year-over-year effect on comps in the quarter.","The growth in the region partly reflected the continuation of solid total and comp store sales growth in Mainland China. We were also pleased to experience a smaller sequential sales decline in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region sales were strong in both our retail and wholesale business in Korea, but remained especially soft in Australia and Singapore.","The Asia-Pacific region had a lot of store activity in the quarter, where we opened four stores and closed two. In China, we opened the store in Ningbo-Heyi and one in Tianjin incense, also in China we closed a very small store in Beijing in the Peninsula Hotel and we closed one in the Tianjin Friendship Store. We also opened our 15th store in Korea in the Shinsegae Gangnam Department Store and we opened our first store in New Zealand in Auckland\u2019s magnificent Britomart precinct.","Sales in Japan in the quarter were mixed. Total sales rose 13% and comp store sales rose 20%, but that entirely resulted from the favorable translation effect of the stronger yen versus the dollar. However, translation aside, there was a solid increase in jewelry unit sold.","On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales declined 4% in the quarter and comps rose 2%. I should point out that the disparity between the total sales declined and the comp sales increase, reflected lower wholesale sales in Japan.","The strengthening of the yen this year has made purchasing by foreigners more expensive in Japan, which we believe is negatively affecting our business as a result of the reduced tourist spending.","In addition, while the modest comp increase in yen that I noted earlier was a sharp contrast to the substantial local currency sales increase in last year\u2019s third quarter, when spending attributed to domestic customers and Chinese tourists, likely tied to the weekend at that time was exceptionally strong, the two-year run rate is still quite positive.","It\u2019s also worth noting that in addition to higher local spending attributed to Japanese customers in this latest quarter, we are seeing, as I mentioned earlier, a solid increase in spending attributable to Japanese tourists in other regions.","In Europe, total sales declined 10% due to a combination of lower jewelry units sold and the lower average price per units sold, and comp store sales declined 14%. On a constant exchange rate basis, comp store sales were down 7%, which compared with a healthy increase in last year\u2019s third quarter.","Demand across Continental Europe remained soft, although, varying degrees and has been especially soft in Paris since the tragic events of last year. Economic conditions also likely contributed to weak spending by domestic customers in many countries.","On the other hand, the bright spot for us in Europe was the U.K., where we attribute sales growth of spending by foreign tourists reacting favorably to the weakening of the pound after the Brexit vote. It is worth noting that we recently took a single-digit price increase in the U.K. to partly offset the effect of the weaker pound.","Lastly, sales in our other segment increased 18% in the quarter, but that entirely reflected an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds since comp store sales actually declined [technical difficulty] due to continued weak sales in our five stores in United Arab Emirates.","In terms of product categories, funds in the quarter were similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year, with jewelry at lower price points outperforming pieces at higher price points.","The best performing jewelry category was fashion jewelry, which posted a modest increase over last year. This was driven by an increase in gold jewelry sales tied to the strength of the T collection, which we have continued to build upon with new designs.","In addition, fashion silver jewelry stabilized with sales up slightly from the prior year, although, that varied by region and was led by the popularity of the Return to Tiffany Love collection. We\u2019ve added quite a bit of product newness in silver jewelry this year, with a double-digit percentage increase in the number of new SKUs under $500.","At the other extreme was continued softness across the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry category, led by decline in high-end statement sales, which in contrast had posted strong growth last year, performing roughly in line with the prior year on a worldwide basis was the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category, with results varying by region.","Rounding up the product review is the watch category, which posted strong growth, albeit from a still small base, as we continue to be pleased with our customer\u2019s interest in new designs. Finally, worldwide e-commerce sales in the third quarter increased in line with overall sales growth.","To summarize our topline results, we would say that third quarter results were mixed with some improvement in certain geographies and product categories, but with softness in other areas making it premature to say that there has been a meaningful turn in the business.","I am now pleased to turn the call over to Mark Erceg.","Mark Erceg","Thanks, Mark. Welcome everyone. Before jumping straight into the P&L, let me take a minute to explain why I joined Tiffany. Simply put I joined Tiffany, because I believe we have tremendous opportunity to increase the profitability of our business and in so doing create attractive total shareholder returns in the years ahead.","Consistent with this my three primary objectives will be helping Frederic and the rest of Tiffany\u2019s strong management team. But; first, identify profitable and sustainable growth opportunities; second, to invest behind those opportunities with funds generated from tight cost control efforts and the efficient deployment of capital; and third, to drive execution discipline in order to enable us to achieve that growth in the way that enhances shareholder value.","Now let\u2019s quickly look at the rest of the income statement. Gross margin was up 80 basis points versus year ago at 61% as we continue to see some benefit from lower product input costs and a continued shift in product sales away from statement jewelry and towards fashion jewelry, which as you know carries a higher gross margin.","SG&A rose 4% in the third quarter, after having declined 4% in the second quarter. The increase partly resulted from some marketing spending that was shifted from the second quarter into the second half of the year. The increase also reflected higher store occupancy and depreciation costs along with higher labor and incentive compensation costs.","Interest and other expenses were lower than last year due to a combination that reduced foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest expense, and our effective tax rate came in at 34.6%.","Turning to the balance sheet, we believe Tiffany\u2019s strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage in giving our cash balance, available liquidity and modest leverage we are well-positioned to support all of our key business initiatives going forward.","That said, we will continue to explore ways to improve asset productivity, including through the proactive management of inventory both at the store level and throughout the entire supply chain in order to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. And speaking of free cash flow, inventory at quarter end was 2% lower than a year ago. Our long-term objective of keeping inventory growth below the rate of sales growth remains unchanged.","Accounts receivable were 4% higher than at this time last year, with the increase being mostly currency related. Capital expenditures were $157 million in the first nine months of the year versus $159 million during the same period last year. A large part of that spending was to support our global store network. For the full year, our plan is to open 11 company-operated stores. We also plan to relocate six stores and close six stores, and we expect square footage to increase by approximately 3%.","We\u2019ve also been devoting significant portions of our CapEx budget to upgrade and enhance our IT systems, which we continue assess and evaluate. We believe these investments will over time make our supply chain more efficient, improve our in-store experience and generate incremental sales by leveraging both our CRM and omnichannel capabilities.","Share repurchase activity continued throughout the quarter, with approximately 455,000 shares purchased at an average cost of just under $68 per share, which along with the dividend increase from earlier this year continues to demonstrate our practice of returning excess cash to our shareholders. Total short-term and long-term debt represented 38% of stockholders equity versus 37% last year.","Looking forward, despite the modest sales improvement in the third quarter, we remain cautious about the near-term outlook for several reasons. First, overall global economic conditions remain highly volatile, so we would like to see several quarters of sales acceleration before making any conclusion that our turn in global luxury goods spending.","Second, and as a practical matter, given the close proximity of our Fifth Avenue Flagship Store to the Trump Tower, we have noted that recent election related activity has caused the minor disruptions to pedestrian foot traffic around that store. Federal, state and local officials and Tiffany security personnel are all doing a fabulous job trying to minimize any disruptions. However, given the importance of the holiday selling season to our Flagship Store, we remain understandably cautious at the how this situation might impact sales over the coming weeks.","Finally, we are mindful of the uncertainty which surround the upcoming Hong Kong elections next year and how that might impact tourism and spending in one of our largest markets.","So taking all those into accounts and despite third quarter results coming in better than expected, we are holding to our previous annual forecast. Specifically, we continue to expect that full year sales will decline by a low single-digit percentage from the prior year and diluted EPS will decline by a mid single-digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which you may recall excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges.","These expectations are based on our plans and assumptions, including those set forth in the news release we issued earlier today. We expect to report Tiffany\u2019s holiday period sales results on January 17 and planned to follow that up with our year-end report later in March, when Frederic will join Mark and I for commentary and your questions.","So, with that, let me turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Mark. That concludes this conference call. [ph] Sharlon (16:42), please provide our audience with the replay information, and investors and analysts I look forward to speaking with you soon.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","A replay of today\u2019s call will begin November 29, 2016 at 9:30 a.m. Central Time and will end December 6, 2016 at 9:30 a.m. To access the replay, please dial 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and use the passcode of 8603179 to access the automated system.

Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today\u2019s call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Hello everyone. Earlier today we reported Tiffany\u2019s third quarter results and I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review the news release. On today\u2019s call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and on the full year outlook.","Before continuing, please first note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany\u2019s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Now turning to results. As an overview, Tiffany\u2019s worldwide sales rose 5% in the quarter, with mixed performance by region due to a variety of factors that I\u2019ll address in a moment. There was a 2% negative translation effect from the strengthening U.S dollar. And sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 7%. By product category, we saw the greatest strength in fashion jewelry sales.","The operating margin was up from last year, resulting from a gross margin increase that more than offset higher SG&A growth. And that SG&A increase included the stepped up marketing spending that we had discussed on last quarter\u2019s call. During the quarter, we completed a long term bond issuance to prepay high rate existing debt, which reduced the future interest expense and extends long term debt maturities. We recorded a $94 million one-time charge for the debt extinguishment. Adding it all up, Tiffany\u2019s third quarter net earnings increased 5%, excluding the charge, but declined 60% with the charge.","Let\u2019s now look at regional sales performance in the quarter. Starting with the Americas region, total sales increased 10% in the quarter due to an overall increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold, reflecting price increases taken in the Americas and other regions as well, but also stronger demand for gold within the fashion jewelry category. It\u2019s worth noting that there was healthy unit growth in most categories, but that was offset by continued unit declines in entry level price point silver jewelry. ","We attribute the healthy sales growth from the Americas to a range of factors, including more engaging selling initiatives and visual merchandizing in our stores, new products, compelling marketing, and what has been a favorable macro environment for our core customers. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 11% in the quarter and comparable store sales also increased 11%, following an 8% comp increase in the first half of this year, and compared with a 1% comp increase in the third quarter of last year.","We experienced healthy rates of sales growth in most markets of the U.S. Sales growth in the New York flagship store benefited from increased local demand, while foreign tourist spending was about equal to last year. In terms of new stores, earlier this month we opened a 2,000 square foot store on Boston\u2019s fashionable Newbury Street and expect to soon open a 5,000 square foot store in the exciting Miami Design District. Elsewhere in the Americas region, we were pleased to see solid, double digit local currency sales growth in Canada, Mexico and Brazil in the quarter. ","The Asia pacific region had its challenges in the quarter, starting with the difficult comparison to a 22% comp store sales increase last year, which at that time had been driven by broad based growth across the region, including some statement jewelry sales. It was a different picture in this third quarter, with double digit comp store sales growth in mainland China, offset by varying degrees of softness in other markets. We\u2019d expected only modest comp growth in Asia Pacific in this third quarter.","As we\u2019ve said before, Greater China now consisting of a total of 45 stores in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, represents more than half of our Asia Pacific sales. And our nine stores in Hong Kong contribute a meaningful part of those greater China sales. To no one\u2019s surprise, recent protests and demonstrations have led to a decline in visitors coming to Hong Kong, which we believe was the primary factor adversely affecting sales at several of our Hong Kong stores, including one at their airport. In total, Asia Pacific sales increased 2% due to growth in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category and the fashion jewelry category.","Looking at results on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales also rose 2% and comp store sales declined 3%, which as I said reflected mixed performance across most markets, but strong comp growth in mainland China. Regarding new store activity in this region, just a week ago we opened our seventh store in Australia in Adelaide and we anticipate opening our 27th store in China in January.","Turning to Japan, total sales on a constant exchange rate basis declined 5% in the third quarter due to lower unit volume in all jewelry categories. And comp store sales declined 6% versus a 5% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. However, the Yen averaged 106 to the dollar in the third quarter, versus 98 a year ago. So including that negative translation effect, sales in dollars declined 12%. The Yen has weakened further since the end of the quarter, being quoted at 118 to the dollar today.","I presume by now you\u2019re all aware of the extreme volatility in consumer spending before and after an increase in Japan\u2019s consumption tax on April 1st. As a result, Tiffany\u2019s comp store sales on a constant exchange rate basis had increased 30% in the first quarter due to substantial pull forward of demand and then declined 13% in the second quarter. The return to monthly sales growth is taking longer than anticipated and we believe softness is now being exacerbated by weakening economic conditions. Despite the volatility, our sales in Japan and year to date have grown at a modest single digit rate in Yen as we typically expect over the longer term. We increased our store count by one in Japan during the quarter when we opened a highly visible, 3,000 square foot free standing store in the important Shinjuku area of Tokyo. ","While we were pleased with an overall improvement in European sales performance, sales results by market were mixed. Total sales rose 9% in the third quarter due to sales growth in all jewelry categories, tied to both higher volume and average price. And that total sales growth came from higher spending by both local customers and foreign tourists. Looking at it on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales rose 10% and comp store sales rose 2%, which followed a 5% comp decline in the first half of the year and compared with a 2% comp increase in last year\u2019s third quarter. ","We saw quite a contrast in European sales results between the UK and the continent. All countries in which we operate stores in continental Europe, achieved varying degrees of comp store sales growth in local currencies tied to both local customer and foreign tourist spending. However, comps continued to decline in the UK, reflecting some softness in both customer categories. In Paris, we continue to be very satisfied with the initial sales results and brand enhancing exposure from the major store we opened on the Champs Elysees earlier this year, which is serving both foreign visitors and local shoppers. Lastly, we had a solid quarter in our other segment, with 28% sales growth in the quarter. This performance was driven by strong 35% comp store sales growth and the sales in our first company operated store in Moscow, which opened earlier this year.","With all the talk about tourism, it\u2019s important to think about it from a global perspective. Tiffany\u2019s expanding store base positions us nicely to benefit where the customers spend locally or when they travel. Therefore shifts in spending from one market to another, whether local or tourist related tied to currency shifts or other macro events, become less relevant as long as we are serving the customer somewhere. ","Summarizing our worldwide store expansion plans, we are on track to have opened 10 stores by the end of this fiscal year and to have closed two older ones. In total, this represents net increases of 3%, both in company operated stores and in gross square footage. In addition to expanding our company operated store base, we continue to focus on renovating, and in a few cases, relocating existing stores to enhance the in-store experience for our customers and to optimize space utilization. So while we continue to expand our store base at a measured pace, it goes without saying that maximizing the quality of distribution is the highest priority. Beyond stores, I just want to reiterate that our websites around the world continue to serve two important functions, as sales vehicles, but equally important, for marketing communication that can drive brand and product awareness and store traffic.","That concludes the regional sales review. In terms of merchandizing highlights, we saw strong growth in our fashion jewelry category and at relatively higher price points. In the fashion jewelry category, which primarily includes jewelry without gemstones, we\u2019re delighted with the initial response to our new Tiffany T collection, targeted to the style conscious female self-purchase customer with wide ranging and global appeal. Tiffany T is offered in a range of materials with the majority of designs in yellow, white or rose gold, with and without diamonds, as well as some pieces in sterling silver, making the collection available in a wide range of prices from a few hundred dollars up to about $20,000. For the T collection, as well as our successful Atlas collection launched over the past year, it\u2019s worth noting that gold jewelry is performing especially well.","Sales in the engagement jewelry and wedding band category rose modestly in the quarter and our relatively new Harmony engagement collection is growing in popularity. Our expanded Keys collection is also performing well globally, with some expansion of styles and fashion in fine jewelry. Also worth noting is the continued success of our yellow diamond collection, Elsa Peretti\u2019s Diamonds by the Yard collection and our beautiful Victoria collection. ","Ralph will now review the rest of the earning statement, the balance sheet and our full year expectations.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark for that sales review. Topline results were clearly mixed for a variety of reasons during the quarter, but we are executing our strategies well despite the volatile global environment. I think the key takeaways affecting third quarter results were sales growth benefited from strength in the Americas and improving trends in Europe, partially offset by softness in Asia Pacific and Japan.","Healthy fashion jewelry sales growth was led by strength in gold jewelry and operating margin increase that was tied to continued solid gains in gross margin, despite a substantial year over year increase in marketing spending. And we are maintaining our most recent full year earnings outlook.","As Mark provided an update on our sales performance, I will now review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin was 59.5% in the third quarter, up from 57% last year due to favorable product and book costs and price increases taken across all product categories and regions as well as strong sales growth in fashion jewelry.","Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 10% in the third quarter, notably reflecting the substantial increase in marketing spending that we planned and had highlighted on our call three months ago. Much of that marketing increase was tied to the launch of the Tiffany T collection, which will continue to substantially lift marketing spending in the fourth quarter as well.","Operating earnings increased 10% on the 5% sales growth and the operating margin increased 70 basis points in the quarter as the higher gross margin more than offset the higher SG&A spending. As previously disclosed, we took a one-time charge in the third quarter for a loss on debt extinguishment tied to prepaying during the quarter $400 million of long term debt that carried an average interest rate of 9.8%, with maturities between 2015 and 2019. The $94 million pretax charge equated to $61 million after tax or fully $0.07 per diluted share. We replaced it by issuing $550 million of long term debt during the quarter, with an average interest rate of 4.4% and maturities of 10 years for $250 million and 30 years for $300 million. This was an important step to lowering our ongoing interest cost and extend maturities.","Interest and other expenses net in the third quarter was $15, versus $14 million last year. And the effective income tax rate of 35.5% in the quarter was 3.2 points above last year when we had benefited from a one-time favorable impact of tax regulations as well as differences in geographical mix of earnings. ","In total, net earnings, excluding the debt extinguishment charge, rose 5% in the quarter to $99 million or $0.76 per share, although net earnings declined 60%, including the charge.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter in a strong position, with substantial liquidity. Net inventories at October 31 were up 6% versus year ago to support new stores and product introductions. We now expect a high single digit increase in net inventories for this year. Our longer term objective continues to call for keeping inventory growth less than the rate of sales growth.","Capital expenditures of $153 million in the year to date were similar to the $149 million at this time last year. For the full year, we are now forecasting CapEx at $250 million versus $220 million last year, with the increase tied to information technology with the development of a global customer relationship management system and more advanced order and inventory management capabilities.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 63,000 shares at an average cost of $92 a share. This leaves $278 million available for future repurchases under our $300 million three-year program that expires in March of 2017. ","Factoring in everything I\u2019ve mentioned in our overall liquidity position, at the end of the third quarter we had $383 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments versus $521 million a year ago. The total of short term and long term debt as a percent of stockholders equity was 37% versus 36% a year ago.","I want to wrap up the call with a brief comment on our full year outlook. We began 2014 projecting net earnings in the range of $4.05 to $4.15 per share or 9% to 11% higher than the adjusted $3.73 per share that was earned in 2013. We have raised the range twice after reporting first and second quarter results. And today, based on these third quarter results, we are affirming our most recent forecast at $4.20 to $4.30 per share, excluding the debt extinguishment charge, representing estimated full year EPS growth of 13% to 15%.","Our full year forecast now calls for a mid to high single digit percentage increase in worldwide sales in dollars versus our previous high single digit forecast. We have been feeling some adverse effects from the stronger U.S dollar, which would have had a greater effect on the rate of sales growth in the fourth quarter and into next year if the current exchange rates hold where they are now. We continue to expect a healthy increase in the operating margin for the full year but coming entirely from the higher gross margin. ","To conclude, Tiffany has performed well so far this year, although regional performance outside the Americas has been volatile. Most importantly, we\u2019ve successfully added stores in a number of key markets. We have expanded our assortment with the exciting Tiffany T collection, among others. We have evolved our marketing communications and we continue to enhance our in-store experience. Those initiatives position us well going forward. ","We wish you happy holidays in the coming weeks and now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks Ralph. We hope you\u2019ve all found this third quarter review to be informative.

You may now disconnect."],"20404":["Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call August 27, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Ralph Nicoletti - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Mark Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Operator","Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Tiffany & Company Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Ralph Nicoletti, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Thank you. Good day, everyone. We reported Tiffany's second quarter results earlier today. So hopefully you've read the news release. I am coming to you this morning from New York while that\u2019s evening in Shanghai where Ralph is joining us on this call. On today's call we will review the quarterly results and how they relate to our growth strategies and then comment on the outlook for the rest of the year.","Before continuing please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the expectations projected in those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","So from an overall perspective second quarter financial results from the top line to the bottom line continued to be significantly pressured by the strong U.S. dollar and worldwide net sales as reported were flat to last year. However, excluding the substantial negative translation effect from that strong dollar, second quarter worldwide sales rose 7% ranging from an increase of 27% in Japan, to 19% in Europe, to 9% in Asia-Pacific, to the Americas were sales were unchanged from the prior year. And lastly to other sales which declined 27% all of which I'll explain in a moment.","The strong dollar has also had meaningful and diverging effects on foreign tourists spending by region. We added six new stores in the quarter and expanded our product assortment with new jewelry and watch designs. Gross margin was unchanged in the quarter and the SG&A expense ratio rose.","We also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share for a portion of a loan we made to a diamond mining company. As a result net earnings declined 16% in the quarter, but excluding the impairment charge net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis which was inline with our expectation.","Let's now look at sales performance by region in the second quarter. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis both total and comparable store sales were equal to last year, which compared with an 8% comp increase in last year's second quarter. And looking forward we are facing another tough comparison to an 11% comp increase in last year's third quarter.","In this second quarter once again higher domestic spending in the Americas largely tied to strengthen statement jewelry sales was offset by lower foreign tourists spending in the U.S. especially in New York and Hawaii, which we attribute primarily to the effect from the strong U.S. dollar.","But generally speaking our sales results in the Americas in the second quarter and first half apart from the strength at the highest statement jewelry price points have reflected varying degrees of softness across much of the U.S. Conversely comp store sales in Canada and Latin America have been strong.","In dollars total sales in the Americas declined 2% as favorable price and mix was offset by lower jewelry unit volume largely tied to continued weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points as well as the unit decline in fine jewelry. We opened one store in the Americas during the quarter in Rideau Centre in Ottawa replacing an older store that we had closed last year.","And we are looking forward to opening Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago next month. Also we recently relocated one of our shops in Montr\u00e9al from Holt Renfrew to the nearby Ogilvy department store. We will soon be relocating our store in Denver's Cherry Creek Mall to an enhanced location within the mall. We are in the process of doing a similar relocation of our Century City store in L.A. and we are relocating a department store location in Mexico. All of which exemplify our strategy to optimize the quality of our distribution base.","Moving to the Asia-Pacific region sales on a constant exchange rate basis rose 9% in total led by fashion gold jewelry and statement jewelry sales, while comp store sales increased 6% on top of the 7% increase in last year's second quarter. As we saw in the first quarter performance in the region was once again mixed and led by double-digit sales growth in China and Australia as well as varying degrees of growth in most other markets.","However, our stores in Hong Kong and Macau continue to experience weakness that began in the second half of last year as we believe a number of Chinese tourists have shifted their traveling and shopping to other markets at least for the moment. In addition while our sales rose in Korea in the quarter we believe the rate of growth was constrained by foreign tourists who avoided traveling to Korea during the MERS outbreak.","It is possible that an improvement in sales growth maybe gradual as foreign tourists bookings take some time to improve. With regard to recent news from China in the same way that it's not possible to quantify the positive wealth effect from a rising stock market on our sales growth there in the past couple of years. It\u2019s similarly difficult to predict any potential negative effect on sales in magnitude or duration from their recent stock market correction or currency devaluation.","But most important Tiffany remains focused on the long-term growth opportunity to serve Chinese consumers both locally and globally and we have not in any way altered our strategies. When measured in U.S. dollars the total Asia-Pacific sales increased 4% due to favorable price and mix.","We expanded Tiffany's presence by adding four new stores in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter including our first Company-operated store in Thailand in the Emporium Shopping Complex in Bangkok. Our 29th and 30th stores in China in Hangzhou and in Chengdu and our third store in Macau in the newly expanded Galaxy. We are planning five additional store openings across the region in the second half of the year as well as three closings all consistent with our global store strategy.","Now let's look at Japan and its local currency sales performance. We think one can only really evaluate our results this year in Japan by reflecting on the dramatic sales volatility we experienced last year when comp store sales had increased 30% in yen in the first quarter due to a pull forward of customer demand and anticipation of the consumption tax increase on April 1 followed by a 13% comp decline in last year's second quarter.","So we clearly had an easier comparison in this second quarter, but nonetheless we were very pleased with the 21% comp increase that we achieved in the second quarter and year-over-year comparisons in Japan are frankly also relatively easy for the balance of the year. The 27% total sales growth in the yen in the quarter was due in similar degrees to both unit volume increases across all jewelry categories as well as favorable price and mix.","In addition, while our sales in Japan are largely made to Japanese customers the year-over-year sales growth has been due to increase sales to foreign tourists particularly Chinese visitors which are perhaps tied to some degree to the attractiveness arising from the weaker yen. And due to the substantially weaker yen versus last year that 27% total sales growth in yen in the second quarter was reduced to 5% when translated into U.S. dollars.","To repeat something we said on our last call, we believe the weaker yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel, but conversely might be generating local sales demand in Japan. The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 Company-operated locations, but we are enhancing our store base by relocating two department store base locations this year. In terms of our business in Europe we were certainly pleased with the continuation of very strong local currency sales growth in the second quarter.","On a constant exchange rate basis both total and comparable store sales rose 19% compared with an 8% comp decline in last year's second quarter when we were seeing broad-based softness across Europe at that time. However, sales growth in this second quarter was geographically broad-based across continental Europe and in the UK reflecting strong sales growth to foreign tourists as well as to a lesser extent an increase to local customers.","Engagement jewelry was the strongest category in Europe in the quarter. To perhaps state the obvious the euro and pound have weakened against the dollar in the past year. This has attracted foreign tourists to shop in Europe while potentially discouraging some Europeans from shopping abroad and instead encouraging them to spend locally. Our performance in Europe reflects both phenomena. When translated into U.S. dollars total second quarter sales in Europe increased 2% due to favorable price and mix.","During the second quarter we opened 550 square meter two-level store on the fashionable Rue du Rh\u00f4ne in Geneva. We also recently relocated our store within Selfridges in London to a more prominent location within that store and are relocating our store within Harrods to a new location within that store. We now operate 39 stores in Europe and believe there are considerable long-term opportunities to further develop our company operated European store base.","Rounding out the segment review are other sales which represented only 2% of worldwide sales in the quarter and includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenue. Other sales on a constant exchange rate basis declined 27% total in the second quarter largely due to lower wholesale sales of diamonds.","On the other hand comp store sales were up 8%. Earlier this year we were pleased to relocate our store in the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai taking advantage of the opportunity to update to our current store design and to expand the size of the store. We mentioned in the regional commentaries that store openings are complemented by store renovations, relocations and several closings this year.","Totaling up this activity both completed and planned we are on track to increase our Company-operated worldwide store base by a net of 12 stores this year representing a 4% net increase in both our Company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage.","At the same time our strategy is to enhance our website with compelling content that builds brand and product awareness and drive store traffic. All of these initiatives support our broader global strategy to more effectively engage customers and enhance their experience and relationship with Tiffany.","In terms of a few merchandising highlights as measured in dollars the strongest performer in the quarter was the fashion jewelry category with a continued shift toward gold jewelry. Our statement, fine and solitaire category was mixed with substantial growth and high-end statement jewelry but some softness in fine jewelry. And there was a bit of softness in the engagement jewelry category as well.","Product innovation is an important strategy at Tiffany, which consists of introducing entirely new design collections but also periodically expanding refreshing and reinterpreting existing collections. An excellent example of newness and a strong contributor to growth in fashion jewelry sales is the Tiffany T collection that we launched about a year ago.","The collection continues to successfully attract style seeking customers as well as those purchasing gifts and is one of the reasons we've seen strength in gold jewelry sales. Another successful collection worth mentioning is our diamond focused Soleste collection which spans engagement and fine jewelry. When we speak about expanding existing collections with new designs one example is our popular Return to Tiffany collection with a particular focus on pieces and silver.","In addition our fall ad campaign will also feature new interpretations of other iconic jewelry collections including Victoria and Tiffany Bow in fine jewelry and the Infinity fashion jewelry collection in gold and silver. So there will be a wide range of newness in our assortment this fall with freshness intended to improve overall sales growth and to also reinvigorate the silver jewelry category.","Lastly, we recently completed the months long global rollout of CT60 collection of watches as previously discussed we are supporting the watch category with extensive marketing to strengthen product awareness and brand credibility and heritage. And we\u2019re pleased with initial reactions from customers and the media.","So that covers the sales highlights. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark and hello everyone. I'm in China this week visiting many of our locations to stay close to the numerous growth opportunities for us to pursue here. Now I will get right into our second quarter results in a few key takeaways. The strong U.S. dollar continued to be a significant headwind on the translation of our results transacted outside the United States having a 7% negative effect on worldwide sales.","It also continued to have a significant negative effect on tourist spending in the U.S. a decline in the operating margin reflected a lack of SG&A expense leverage, higher marketing spending and an impairment charge tied to a loan to a diamond mining company.","Net earnings declined 16% as reported, but excluding the impairment charge net earnings declined 10% on a non-GAAP basis, which was a smaller rate of decline than in the first quarter and in line with our expectation. But in light of the strong U.S. dollar and macro uncertainties we modestly tempered our full-year expectations for net earnings and to be sure it's not overlooked we are pleased with inventory performance and cash flow year-to-date.","Let\u2019s briefly review the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.9% in the second quarter was unchanged from the prior year due to the favorable effects of product input costs and lower wholesale sales of diamonds, which typically earn minimal if any margin, but also the negative effect from shifts in product mix especially contrasting the relatively low gross margins of high price point statement jewelry sales, which were strong with relatively high gross margins of silver jewelry sales, which were weak.","In addition previous price increases taken have been offset by the unfavorable effect of the strengthening U.S. dollar. We are now in the process of further raising prices in regions that have experienced the most dramatic weakness in their currencies versus the dollar, while also taking some modest increases in other regions. For the full-year we continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin.","On a related note, I should add that the more recent declines we\u2019ve seen in precious metals spot prices this year should eventually result in some benefit to gross margin, but it will take some time based on the rate of inventory turnover. Similarly you may have seen recent industry reports that softening global demand has resulted in a retreat in diamond costs albeit less pronounced for high-quality stones. While this has some favorable effect on our acquisition cost now again there is a long lead time before we will see any benefit in gross margin.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% in the quarter and would have increased 6% excluding a roughly $10 million impairment charge for a portion of a loan to a diamond mining company. In both of those year-over-year comparisons SG&A growth was reduced by 5% due to the translation effect of the strong dollar. Similar to the first quarter the SG&A increase reflected higher marketing spending as expected partially tied to a bridal campaign and the launch of our watch collection.","We also recorded a portion of the $30 million of annual incremental U.S. pension and postretirement benefit costs. There were also increases in labor and store related occupancy costs as well, but we expect the SG&A expense ratio to increase in the full-year due to the lack of sales leverage we do expect some improvement in the ratio in the fourth quarter.","In regard to the impairment charge for many years we have occasionally entered into financing arrangements with diamond mining companies as part of a strategy to secure high-quality diamond supply based on recent developments associated with the contractual terms of our agreement with the Koidu mine in Sierra Leone. We determined that it is probable that a portion of that loan will not be collectible in accordance with the contract terms. Therefore, we recorded the charge and as you could see in today's 10-Q filing the situation is still evolving.","In total our forecast which excludes the impairment charge in any potential future similar charges now calls for operating earnings for the full-year to be modestly below last year. Interest and other expenses net in the quarter was below last year from our refinancing of long-term debt to lower rates in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, the year-over-year delta also included modest foreign currency transaction losses in the second quarter after we benefited from some gains in the first quarter. We continue to project interest and other expense net at approximately $50 million in 2015.","The second quarter's effective tax rate was less than last year\u2019s second quarter as we expected. Last year's rate was somewhat inflated by changes in tax legislation while this year's rate benefited from a reduction in a tax valuation allowance. We continue to forecast an effective tax rate in 2015 similar to last year's rate of 34.4%.","Tiffany's balance sheet remains strong at the end of the quarter. Total cash and short-term investments were $771 million at January 31. Short-term and long-term debt totaled just over $1 billion representing 37% of stockholders equity. As we have stated in the past our financial strategy is to maintain more than adequate resources to support the growth of our business regardless of short-term economic cyclicality.","At the same time we also regularly consider appropriate opportunities to return excess cash to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. As examples, we recently increased our quarterly dividend by 5% which represented the 14 dividend increase in the past 13 years and we spent approximately $56 million in the first half of the year to repurchase our shares at an average cost of $88 per share.","At July 31 we had approximately $217 million available for repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017. Our strategy for inventories is to always maintain deep assortments and high availability in our stores, but our goal for this year and beyond is to also keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth by achieving better productivity in our stores as well as in our overall supply chain.","At July 31 net inventories were 7% lower than a year ago. When excluding the effect of translation of the strong U.S. dollar, inventory still declined by 2% compared with the first half 4% increase in worldwide sales on a constant exchange basis.","Capital expenditures of $98 million in the first half were up slightly from $91 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to call for spending about $260 million this year with an emphasis on stores and also new IT systems being implemented over several years such as for global customer relationship management and inventory management.","Lastly, we think it's prudent to revise modestly downward our full-year net earnings forecast in light of the dollar being even stronger than we initially anticipated as well as ongoing external volatilities. We had previously forecast minimum earnings growth on top of the $4.20 per share excluding a debt extinguishment charge last year. Now we are forecasting net earnings 2% to 5% below last year when excluding the loan impairment charge taken in the second quarter and any further similar charges that could potentially be recorded later in the year.","In addition, this assumes no net earnings growth in the third quarter versus EPS of $0.76 per share in last year's third quarter which excluded the debt extinguishment charge and then we expect the resumption of earnings growth in the fourth quarter. In conclusion we met our overall expectations in the first half of the year despite the significant adverse effects from the strong dollar.","Looking forward we are pursuing numerous initiatives tied to further expanding and enhancing our global store base, product development and effective marketing communications in order to strengthen Tiffany's relationship with its customers. So we intend to stay focused on global growth opportunities ahead of us.","I will now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks Ralph for dialing in from Shanghai.

","I'll now turn the call over to Alessandro.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thanks, Jason, and welcome, everyone. Let me start by saying right upfront that our second quarter results were mixed. The top-line admittedly came in a bit light versus our ongoing expectations, but we are encouraged by the slight over deliver we achieved on the bottom-line versus our internal forecast, which Mark will elaborate on during his prepared remarks. ","But first, let's spend some time putting our second quarter sales results in context. Global reported sales did drop by 3%, but this was against the backdrop that included last year's strong 12% increase, a significant decline in both sales attributed to Chinese and all other tourists and meaningful business disruption in Hong Kong. ","Let's take a few additional seconds on each of this. Last year during the second quarter of 2018, we generated significant U.S. and global attention the holistic launch of PAPER FLOWERS in New York, and our Believe in Dreams campaign, which we believe drove a meaningful increase in both traffic and sales. We expect similar excitement behind our main product activations this year, but those will take place during the later stages of the third and the early part of the fourth quarter.","Second quarter sales results were also impacted by continued sharp decline in sales to both Chinese and all other tourists, which we believe lowered our reported sales by [indiscernible 5:12] percentage points. In Hong Kong where we have 10 stores and which is our fourth biggest market relative to total sales, only after the United States, Japan and Mainland China, has been presented with a unique set of challenges. Obviously, we hope for a quick and peaceful resolution to the unrest being experienced there, but in the meantime, we must acknowledge that the current situation is taking a toll on our business. In fact, we estimate that during the second quarter we lost nearly six full selling days due to unplanned store closures.","Despite all of this, our internal estimates indicate that during the second quarter, we grew constant currency retail sales to local customers on a global basis by 2% which we believe is a much better indicator of underlying brand strength and our future growth potential. And within which we once again posted strong double-digit growth with local customers in Mainland China.","Having provided some short-term commentary on the second quarter, let's now move to something much more important, our mid and long-term effort to generate sustainable top and bottom-line growth rate consistent with our position as global luxury jeweler.","We are now six quarters into the long and exciting journey we effectively began at the start of fiscal 2018, when we took the bold decision to meaningfully increase investment spending to support our six key focused areas. As we stated then, and as we continue to believe now, those investments have been carefully designed to be self reinforcing, and to work in concert with each other over time in order to ultimately allow us to consistently deliver sustainable top-line sales growth. ","You have also heard us repeatedly state that we do not expect to deliver sustainable top-line sales growth until we have been able to introduce a sufficient number of distinctive new products, amplify and evolve marketing message with sufficient impact as to attract a significant number of new customers, reactivate lapsed ones while continuing to delight our existing customers, upgrade key aspects of our physical store network while also adding experiential elements to our in-store environment such as visual merchandising, jewelry styling bars and et cetera and develop through enabling technologies a seamless omni-channel customer experience. ","We are making good progress on all of these fronts. However, as an illustration, since we believe there are inherent limits on the maximum amount of product units we can be properly supported with 360 degree marketing and PR campaigns as well as robust in-store execution without becoming confusing or distracting for our customers, we estimate that it make take until fiscal 2021 to properly refresh our product assortment with enough newness to generate balanced and sustainable growth across our entire product portfolio.","We're committed to reinvigorating the business the right way as we aim for industry leading levels of shareholder value creation which we believe defines long-term success. In the meantime it may admittedly be a bit hard to see how the strategic investment decisions we have made so far are positively impacting the business given timing shifts in new product launches as compared to last year, macroeconomic noise from lower tourism spending and the disruption taking place in Hong Kong. ","Therefore, we talk it might be helpful to spend a few minutes, taking about how all of the decisions we have made about the past 18 months are working together in Mainland China, A key strategic market which from the beginning of this journey we have identified to receive a high level of management focus and investment. For example, Mainland China is where we chose to this proportionately increase marketing spending and media penetration last year. It was also Mainland China where we took the decision to stand up our retail foundation information technology platform first, back in the first quarter of 2018. ","During the first half of 2019 we increased the high jewelry presence at our Beijing China World store as well as in a number of additional major stores such as Shanghai IFC and Beijing Shin Complex. And during the second quarter of 2019, we sold through limited quantities of specialty Tiffany Keys diamond pendants on WeChat for 520 or I Love You Day supported by Liu Haoran, a famous Chinese actor with 30 million Weibo followers and we enabled e-commerce on our tiffany.cn website for the first time. ","We believe that all of these actions plus improvement in the relevance of our message into Chinese consumers and the launch of PAPER FLOWERS last fall has enabled us to significantly improve our brand power scores as surveyed by a third-party in Mainland China across critical consumer segment such as self-purchasing women, high spenders and gifters. These in turn allowed us to improve our overall brand power ranking in China from fourth to second place during the past year. And even more importantly we believe these actions plus others have allowed us to dramatically improve our business among domestic Chinese consumers. ","For a perspective, constant currency comparable sales during the first half of 2019 grew 4 times faster than the first half of 2018 and second quarter 2019 sales grew more than 25%. In order to maintain this momentum, we have a number of real exciting strategically important initiatives, some have already begun, and others will take place in the second half of the year across Greater China, all of which are designed to continue to broaden our appeal among Chinese consumers. ","Such initiatives can be grouped in four key strategies. First, we are strengthening our store network by opening or upgrading our flagship stores in three key metropolitan areas, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. In Beijing, the relocation and upgrade of our flagship store in China World took place in Q1. In the next two quarters, we expect to have two major flagship launches in Hong Kong and Shanghai respectively. In Hong Kong, we plan to open a three-floor street-facing flagship store at 1 Peking Road in the most popular shopping area in Hong Kong among Chinese tourists, which we expect to help close the gap with other major luxury brands which have prominent stores in that area. ","In Shanghai, we plan to relocate and enlarge our store to arguably the most prominent corner location in the city at Hong Kong Plaza, an area of Shanghai, where other prestigious luxury brands have significant street frontage presence. With our three flagship stores in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, we expect customers to be able to more fully experience the refinement, assortment, service and ultimately the power of the Tiffany & Company brand. ","Second, we are in the process of expanding our airport duty-free store network. In Q3, we plan to open the first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in Mainland China at the Beijing Airport with a partner. Next month, we plan to relocate and upgrade our directly owned store at the Hong Kong Airport, currently the smallest in our airport network to a full sized duty-free store. With these two stores, we expect to be able to more efficiently target the Chinese traveler retail segment.","Third, we are setting up our digital relevance with the recent e-commerce enablement of our China company website. This is important for us to be able to inform and influence purchasing decisions of customers when they are deciding which brand and specific product to buy. Apart from the additional online sales opportunity, especially in third tier Chinese cities where we don't have a physical presence, we expect these e-commerce efforts to increase traffic and conversion rates in our physical stores and increase effectiveness of our digital marketing. ","We are also increasing our weight in the Chinese digital ecosystem with the addition to WeChat limited addition program we did for Chinese Valentine's Day in August and additional ones for the holidays and for Chinese New Year. ","Fourth, we have three new marketing initiatives planned for the second half of 2019. First, we plan to open Blue Box Cafes in both the new Hong Kong location at 1 Peking Road as well as the next Shanghai flagship at Hong Kong Plaza. This will be the first permanent Blue Box Cafes in Tiffany stores outside of New York. And just as in New York, we expect it will generate substantial customer attention and store traffic. ","Secondly, we will be conducting a series of consumer facing Diamonds of Tiffany events across Greater China to educate consumers on our unparalleled casting and polishing partnership to reinforce our diamond authority in this market. ","Last and perhaps most importantly, on September 23rd, in Shanghai, we will inaugurate Tiffany & Company Vision & Virtuosity, the largest ever Tiffany brand exhibition. The brand will celebrate its over 180-year history and heritage in a unique experiential setting. ","Instead of being just a retrospective, over 350 archival product, along with numerous high value jewelry pieces and exclusive previews from the 2019 Blue Book high jewelry collection will be displayed in a more experiential thematic environment, which matches the DNA of the Tiffany brand. We expect these initiatives to drastically increase the awareness and the depth of knowledge of our brand among the Chinese, including importantly, the millennial segment. ","Now that we have provided additional insight on how our efforts are aligning across Greater China, let's shift back to the broader company for which we keep progressing on the roadmap that we shared with you about 18 months ago. Many of you have asked us about our excitement from the second half of product newness, which will be taking place all across the world. While we don't want to take the surprise away from our customers, we can mention that we have already pre-launched a colorful new extension to our iconic Tiffany T collection. ","We have also already pre-launched in selected stores a reinvigorated men\u2019s line up. And as we mentioned on last quarter's call, we are moving forward with an additional fragrance offering later this year. So while we acknowledge that we still have much to do before the full effect of the strategic investments we have made and continue to make across the business, are fully implemented across all product categories and key markets, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making, particularly in the areas where we have dedicated the most time and resources. ","Let me now turn the call over to Mark, so he can share a few additional thoughts before we open up the call to your questions.","Mark Erceg","Thanks, Alex. Since you've likely already reviewed our filings, and our prepared remarks are expected to run a bit longer than recent quarters and we want to make sure we leave plenty of time for your questions, I'm going to focus my comments today on just a few salient matters. ","First, gross margin in the second quarter was 130 basis points below a year ago just like it was during the first quarter. There was a little bit of negative sales leverage on fixed manufacturing other costs but our factory loads were better balanced as we built inventory to support our second half launches in anticipation of a stronger holiday season. ","So the real driver of lower gross margin in the quarter was a mix impact from a meaningful increase in high jewelry sales, which as you know is an area we've been focusing on this past year. And over the balance of the year, since our second half product launches should increase the sales mix for our gold and diamond jewelry collections relative to higher margin silver jewelry, we'd expect some additional pressure on gross margin. However that should be more than offset by volume leverage as we expect to regain sales momentum and the absence of certain costs such as a bankruptcy filing of a metal refiner we recorded in the third quarter of last year. ","Looking even further out, we plan to invest even more behind our high jewelry offerings and have plans to continue introducing even more gold with and without diamonds and diamond products as part of our strategic efforts with more emphasis on increasing our average unit selling price in the years ahead. ","Importantly, our multi-year product and marketing plans call for moving a larger percentage of our overall sales mix, the higher price points gradually by focusing on and growing gold and diamond jewelry collections and high jewelry at a faster pace than engagement and silver jewelry. ","That said it is important to note, we still have plans for both engagement and silver jewelry to grow going forward, just at rates below that was expected to be achieved in high jewelry and across our gold and diamond jewelry collections. It is for this reason that some of you might have noticed, we reframed the product imagery on all of our e-commerce sites, along with the products featured in our digital and social campaigns recently to showcase gold and diamond jewelry collections more prominently. ","Second, SG&A expenses were well contained during the second quarter with total SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales dropping from 46.3% last year to 45.2% this year, a reduction of 110 basis points. Prudent cost management particularly on the labor line as we seek to create organizational efficiencies and ongoing global procurement efforts, which achieved a notable milestone this past quarter with the implementation of our new source-to-pay solution in the United States, both contributed. We also took the decision to hold back some advertising dollars in the second quarter, so that could be more effectively deployed against our strong second half product introduction plans. ","Finally, from a store network perspective and in addition to the Greater China stores Alex referenced earlier, we just announced the opening of two stores in India later this fiscal year and next year, one each in Delhi and Mumbai through a joint venture with an India-based luxury retail leader. And we are continuing to make good progress on the New York flagship transformation. ","From a guidance standpoint you may recall that at the start of the year and again during our first quarter earnings release, we called for a soft first half followed by a rebound during the second half, which would result in full year reported sales growth of low-single-digits. And while our first and second quarter sales results were a couple points lower than we would have liked, the reasons we have discussed, they have been generally speaking consistent with our overall expectations. ","As Alex mentioned earlier tourism patterns are volatile and the situation in Hong Kong remains very fluid. In addition, the Japanese government has announced its intention to increase its sales consumption tax rate from 8% to 10% in October of this year, which is adding even more unpredictability to an already challenging macroeconomic environment. This is because in the past, business has significantly accelerated in Japan prior to consumer sales tax increases of this magnitude, and then decelerated in the months thereafter. Whether or not the same phenomenon will occur this time around is very hard to predict. ","Against the backdrop of these uncertainties and after balancing our first half results against our strong second half marketing and product plans, we still expect to grow full year reported sales by low-single-digits. And relative to the bottom-line, our guidance also remains unchanged at low to mid-single-digit growth in diluted earnings per share. ","Now that said, if for example, the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong persists much longer at its current rate, we may find ourselves towards the lower end of our full year reported sales and EPS guidance range. And if the situation were to deteriorate even further, or if the current level of unrest is maintained for the balance of the fiscal year, we may find ourselves toward the bottom end of our ranges. ","I'll now turn the call back to Jason and we can take your questions. ","Jason Wong ","Thank Alessandro and Mark. Operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. So we'll take our first question from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Regarding your comments on gold and diamond versus silver, silver is a nice margin business and also featuring gold and diamonds seems very brand appropriate. But how does that interplay with your thoughts on the evolution of a longer term operating margin? Also, as you spoke to a lot of your comments regarding the caution points and things happening geopolitically, what are your thoughts on the guidance level and being more conservative on guidance in light of the softer top-line than you would have wanted? Thank you. ","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Oliver. As for the gold versus silver evolution, silver although is the smallest part of our business in terms of metal where the order is -- the largest portion is platinum, the second is by far gold and silver is the smaller one, it's an important segment for us. And it\u2019s a segment in which we believe. We believe as part of our heritage of our portfolio and we have planned to grow it going further as any other segment. It's true that in this particular moment, we are experiencing a stronger momentum more in the gold rather than in the silver.","So it's something that is happening in this moment, but we know also that these times can vary from season-to-season from time-to-time. And our efforts are both -- on both sides of the collections.","Mark Erceg","Yes. And I'll just add that, jewelry collection gold and gold with diamonds has very strong gross margin in its own right. I mean we're obviously not saying that we don't want to see the concept that the silver business grow, we just want to see the gold and the diamond business grow at a faster rate. ","As far as the second portion of your question with respect to how we're thinking about the full year. Honestly, at this point it\u2019s playing out largely as we anticipated. We said we have a softer first half and a stronger second half driven by the product and marketing plans that we had in place. We feel good about those programs. And we will continue to be very communicative with our owners about where we see the business trending. But right now, we see low single-digit reported sales growth and low to mid diluted EPS growth in the current context with the caveats that have been provided. ","Oliver Chen","Okay. And just to follow up, last year there was an opportunity to do the marketing earlier, the customers quite dynamic and behaving earlier in some respects and the digital aspect has gotten very competitive online. So how will you approach them in terms of timing and key catalysts for marketing that's different this year versus last year as you approach the important holiday season? Thank you. ","Alessandro Bogliolo","We have been analyzing very carefully the results of last year and all the good things and also the things that could have improved. And we feel very confident about the plans we have for this year in terms of campaigns, content and timing. ","Jason Wong ","Operator, next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","So as we think about your six strategic outline priorities and the 2021 timeline that you cited earlier, I guess maybe since taking the helm, Alex, what do you see as your biggest wins versus areas you would say are taking longer than you initially expected?","Alessandro Bogliolo ","Well, in terms of product, I have to say that, it was very clear to me that with the 18 months developing time for new product in jewelry and considering that there is only a limited number of new lines that you can -- units that you can introduce during the year, it would have been a multi-year process. This is why you will remember that already in this -- when we announced the first quarter results last year we were very clear mentioning a long and exciting journey, because it was clear to me that to revamp a product assortment of a brand like Tiffany is a multi-year progress -- process.","So this is -- this was -- didn't come as a surprise. And I think on the marketing, we have been acting very quickly and effectively and we changed the communication, and we keep on tweaking and changing and evolving every quarter. So, to be honest with you, the longest time needed is, of course in efficiencies and especially in the cultural shift, which are the two last priorities that we mentioned in our roadmap. ","And on efficiencies, we start seeing already some signs of managing costs more effectively in this quarter. But honestly, it's just the beginning, because this is a process that will take years in order to really show a significant impact on traffic. And the cultural change is something that is progressing well, but is obviously the one that takes the most because it has do with human beings and 14,000 people in the company. But I have to say, it's -- I mean there are no situations where I feel that we had a problem of where we stop, we keep on progressing on the roadmap we put together.","Matthew Boss","And then mark, maybe just on the back half of the year embedded within your full year guide. Help us to think about top-line and earnings growth that you're expecting in the third quarter relative to the fourth quarter. Any guideposts I think would be really helpful?","Mark Erceg","No, I do appreciate that, but that's something that I think we would be a little bit reticent to provide. We obviously guide on the full year with respect to the quarters, we wouldn\u2019t want to be overly prescriptive there. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Just two quick ones from me. I guess, I'm trying to -- the first point for Alex. Just trying to marry the comments about the assortment refresh really not being completed till fiscal '21 kind of combined with the outlook for improving fundamentals and top-line to the rest of the year. Why would you think that the top-line and fundamentals can improve, if you're thinking that the product assortment really won't be refreshed until next year? And then a quick one for Mark, we've heard from some companies -- I know that you guys are not a promotional brand. I understand that. But in terms of competitively when you look across the globe, are you seeing some of the wholesalers and e-tailers, retailers being a little bit more competitive on pricing year-to-date? We've heard some rumblings of that? Any kind of would be helpful.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Okay, well. As for the product assortment I mean I don\u2019t want to be misunderstood in the sense that it just an area in which we are progressing literally every quarter. And if you look also at the past 12 months, we have had important launches like PAPER FLOWERS, T True diamond, then we had Return to Tiffany Love Bugs and we are now talking about a colorful version of Key et cetera. So it's a progress, a continuous to progress. The point is that what is important is that to reach a critical mass of newness in order to really see results being steady growing because it's a process, it's a path, it's a journey. So I'm confident about the second part of this year because we will be in a much better position than we were one year ago, but I expect one year later to be in a much better position than we will be in the second half. So it's really a path with steady growth.","Mark Erceg","Yes. The other thing I would offer on that as you think about where we are fiscal year-to-date, reported sales are down 2.7%, contained within that is about over -- slightly over 2 points of FX scrape, which we think is going to be based on current spot rates, largely a push, it might cost us 20, 30 basis points in the balance of the year, but it's not going to be nearly as consequential. ","If you think about the comps that we're going to be starting to dial up against last year in Q1 and Q2, for both quarterly posted plus 7s. That was a plus 3 in Q3 and it was flat basically in Q4. New stores is also going to be contributing a lot more in the second half than it did in the first half. You heard out talk about some very large stores that are going to be coming online, so that should be a contributor. And of course, the biggest thing is just the product and the marketing and the holiday plans and everything else that we\u2019ve been doing. ","So you feel good about where we sit right now based on the way we've laid out the year. As far as the question on price promotional activity, you're right. We don't engage in any of those types of activities. And frankly, while we continue to do the scrapes, we haven't seen anybody out there doing things in our particular space that gives us at this point any cause or concern.","Operator","Our next question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","It sounds like the newness will ramp and have a greater impact on sales starting in the fourth quarter. Do you expect to launch sufficient newness next year that you'll be able to continue to grow top-line more sustainably from here on?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Absolutely, that is exactly the plan and I am glad because thanks to a different approaches feeding the company, thanks also to the JW workshop that we have set together for prototyping a new product. I have to say that the company has been -- has accelerated a lot the place of product design and development. And we are now in a situation where we have a very clear assortment already prototype for 2020, and we are working now on 2021. So we have really a long-term visibility on our assortment that was not the case just one year ago. So yes, I think the things have been working very well in this. And we will have a very strong pipeline for next year and the year to come.","Operator","We'll take your next question from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Alex I wonder, I just wanted to follow up on the newness question. Sorry to beat the drum. You guys made the point in the prepared remarks that there's a certain mix of newness that without overloading the system or overloading the customer but without becoming too distracting. Could you elaborate on that? Are you saying there's too much newness now or not enough or the wrong kind of newness or you need more of a different type of newness, I'm just trying to understand what the bottleneck is?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Omar. My assessment is that -- and it\u2019s quite clear on the market, that in the past few years our number of introductions of distinctive new products was below industry standard. We have decided one and half year ago to increase the level to industry standard that is roughly speaking around 15% of sales coming from newness. ","Now more than that would be too much, because experience has said, so that\u2019s also because there is only a number of new products that customers can absorb during one year. Because jewelry is different from fashion, it\u2019s not every season everything changes, and so there is only a certain cadence. And this was clear since the beginning. It\u2019s part of the rules of luxury jewelry. And we are following on this path. So there is no slowdown, there is no acceleration. We are just following the path that we have set. And I\u2019m very pleased about it I have to say.","Omar Saad","Could you also maybe discuss the decline in SG&A dollars? And are you guys pulling back on investment or marketing? How much of this is sustainable? And should we worry about the need to invest, especially with the flagship renovation coming up making sure that there's dollars in the budget for that? Thank you","Mark Erceg","That\u2019s a great question I would say. We did make a comment that we did pull back a little bit of some of the marketing spending in the second quarter in order to put that specifically against the new large wave of product and marketing endeavors we have planned for the second half of the year. In total, for the full year, we have planned to spend in a dollarized basis very similar levels of marketing funds in '19 we spend versus '18. And you'll recall that from 2018 we made a meaningful step up in the amount of marketing dollars that we\u2019re investing behind the business.","So the second quarter itself is specifically concerned while certainly a little less in marketing versus a year ago in the quarter of that in the prior period had to launch PAPER FLOWERS. Obviously it wasn\u2019t structure economics. I can tell you the amount of dollars by the waiver items and the benefit items and other cost takeout items we affected in the quarter was much larger than any marketing shift that you might have seen.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the tourist levels in the in North America. Did they worsen in 2Q versus 3Q? And if you could talk about the local North America customer and the performance there and your outlook? And just lastly, I believe your guidance had included an outlook for tourism in the United States to flatten out by the end of the year. And I'm just wondering what's embedded in guidance if that's changed or not? Thanks so much.","Alessandro Bogliolo","So about -- well first of all, I would like to underline that the domestic trade, to domestic customers on a global basis were positive once again plus 2% versus plus 3% the previous quarter. And this for me is a very important point because it's a largest part of sales in which where the brand is suited for future growth. Having said so, it\u2019s true that under two reasons we have been suffering in the second quarter as well. I have to say that the decrease in sales to Chinese tourists on a global basis has been similar in the second quarter, as well as during the first quarter. And the same would apply to non-Chinese tourists, because also there especiallly due to the strong dollar there has been a decrease in sales to tourists.","So it's something that was already there in the first quarter and basically in the same order of magnitude also in the second quarter. Now as it refers to U.S. or North America consumers, we have experienced since few quarters quite softer trend. This quarter, the sales to -- domestic sales in the U.S. was slightly down. But I'm very confident that with all the marketing activities and the push we have in the second part of the year if things remain the same, we will a good performance, because we are really focusing on the second part of the year.","Janet Kloppenburg","And just as a follow-up, Mark, just a clarification on marketing. I know that this second half will benefit from contraction in the first half. But overall marketing spend for fiscal '19, will it be relatively flat year-over-year or what will that dynamic look like? Thanks.","Mark Erceg","Yes, yes. For the full year, we expect the marketing dollar spent in 2019 to be very comparable to 2018, which again is a significant step up in '17.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erwan Rambourg with HSBC.","Erwan Rambourg","I wanted to come back on Hong Kong. I'm just wondering, if you could tell us what Hong Kong is as a proportion of either sales or profits and what you're losing in Hong Kong today? Do you think, you're recouping it partly elsewhere whether it's Mainland China, or Japan or Korea or elsewhere? And then maybe quite surprising, timing for development of flagship in Kowloon and in the airport, will that help you mitigate the pain somewhat?","Secondly, I just wanted to from Mark have a clarification around how the pipeline of products in H2 plays out from a gross margin perspective? I understand your comment in terms of pressure for the long-term linked to the fact that you're going higher end. I'm not sure I understood what we need to have a mindful gross margin in H2, could that stabilize or could that rebound after H1? ","And then thirdly and lastly, if you have any updates on how the space -- the temporary space near the flagship in New York plays out into the holiday season, what setup will you have for the holiday season in New York? Thank you.","Mark Erceg","I was trying to wind it up and knock him down. I don't have to probably really ask people to try and hold themselves to one question. So with respect to Hong Kong, it\u2019s our fourth largest markets, it\u2019s critically important for us. We talked about the fact that we lost six store days during the second quarter, but that's just indicative of what's happening in that market today. Obviously right now there's a lot of folks focused on various matters and shopping may not be their primary concern. For us Hong Kong is a country or is a market that is mid-single-digits of total sales. If that was to be down by 20%, hypothetically, that would take 1 point off the full year sales block. If it was down by 40% and it was mid-single-digits, it would take off 2 full points for the year, just to give you some sense of it. ","As far as the gross margin question is concerned, we really talked about happening in the first quarter in the second quarter was very strong high jewelry sales, which has a lower gross margin associated with it. And we talked about that in the past. As we think about the first half, second half, inflection points on gross margin, one of the key things to note is that we believe we will restore our volume momentum, and we'll get fixed cost leverage as a result of that going into the second half.","We also believe that there's some one-time items like the filing of a metal refiner that went into bankruptcy during the third quarter of last year and a few other items, some of which are related to obsolescence and a few other things that are coming to pass. ","We are confident that we can continue to expand our operating margin on a going forward basis, once we get to a sustainable profit sales growth, because of all the things that that will do to the P&L as well as our cost takeout initiatives. And then as far as the flagship store is concerned, I\u2019ll let Alex address your questions about the temp space.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. Well, about the flagship store, it's -- as you know it\u2019s a huge project that we are following very closely and we are now in the process of building the temporary store next door and we are evaluating the plans for not only for these holidays but also for then the shifts that we have to go to, the moving, the physical moving next year. So we are still working in the plans in order to maximize the benefit not only short but also medium-term. So we don't have a clear decision at this point in time.","Erwan Rambourg","Thank you. But will that temp space to be open for the current holiday season?","Mark Erceg","Will the temp space be open for the holiday season?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes, this is what we are evaluating. ","Erwan Rambourg","Okay. ","Alessandro Bogliolo","But just to clarify, but the flagship store will be fully operating during the holiday. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.","Marni Shapiro","I'm excited about all the product launches in the back half of the year. So if you could just talk a little bit about -- you've touched on the marketing effort, you've pushed the marketing into the back half of the year. Are these launches global launches and is the marketing push global? Sometimes you launch things here in North America, sometimes and roll them out across the country. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about that? And do the launches hit across multiple categories? So from silvers through gold, fashion through the highest end or they\u2019re more concentrated into the area where you're sort of leaning on anyway, which is the more gold and fashion jewelry?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you for your question. That is actually a great point because in the past 12 months, as we were in the process of accelerating our launches, we were forced to have staggered launches around the world while -- and this is the reason why we have postponed launches to the second part of the year in order to be able to have truly global launches. So the answer is yes, there will be global launches worldwide in the second part of the year.","As for the kinds of products, let me say there is a good range of price points. Main focus is actually on gold, plain and with diamond, but there are also newness in more entry price both in gold as well as silver as well as of course in the fine jewelry $20,000 up to I would say $80,000 that will be introduced. So it's quite I would say price wise and as a kind of absorbing it\u2019s quite widespread. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. ","Brian Nagel ","So the question I have, we spent or we talked a lot about today and in prior calls, just about the impact of the headwind of softer sales to foreign tourists in key markets. As you look at this issue, are there levers that Tiffany can pull or is the company more just at the mercy of this, whether it would be currencies or other factors. And I guess the levers, are there marketing levers? Or are there -- either shorter or longer term there to help really offset this top-line headwind?","Alessandro Bogliolo ","Well, thank you for the question. It's actually tourists flows are important for Tiffany and for all luxury brands and this is something of course that goes beyond our control, because it as to do with exchange rates but also simply arrival of customers, tourists in different countries, et cetera. Now there are ways of course we have and we have put in place in order to try to address this. First of all is, when there are less -- there is lesser spending abroad to concentrate on the domestic markets. So try to get to the consumers in the local market where they are. And in this we have a strong position, because we have a network that is truly global. So we are capable to reach out to customers if they travel but also if they stay at home.","The second kind of activity we are doing and this was one of the examples I was making about China is, to be present selectively but in very important airport locations. Because, for example, this is the reason for having a store in the Beijing airport because Chinese tourists at that point can purchase at Beijing while they are flying out regardless of the destination of their flight or the reason for enlarging the Hong Kong airport store is because on Hong Kong is crucial point, where people not only as a final destination but also a connecting flight and is a very nice shopping environment. So this is another activity we have -- we can do.","And then the third we are doing -- and the third one is that of balancing our inventory. So for example, this is why I mentioned before during the prepared remarks, we have shifted high jewelry assortments to mainland China, to stores in Shanghai and Beijing, because as Chinese tourists tend to spend less abroad then they -- we have more availability of high jewelry products in the country in that way we can partially offset the sales approach.","Now all of this is what is in our hands. Of course, all this can only partially offset the new sales abroad, because it's normal but somebody when the tourist tends to spend more freely, more heavily and -- but this is what we can do and we are doing it actively.","Brian Nagel ","Thank you for all the color, Alex. If I could just slip one more unrelated question. Just any update on the engagement category. Particularly following the launch of the new setting a little while ago, and just how overall sales track there and any idea from a market share perspective? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, about our engagement jewelry in constant currencies in the second quarter was basically flat, so I think it was down 1%. In the previous quarter, it was minus 3% I think. So it has been trading a little bit better, but it has been, let me say, basically in line with also the other collections. The other collections were at constant currencies at plus 1%, engagement jewelry was minus 1%. So I would say, it's in line with the overall trend, actually doing a little bit better than global sales.","Operator","And our next question will come from Rick Patel with Needham & Company.","Rick Patel","Thank you. Good morning. So guidance assumes a comp improvement in the back half. Can you provide some color by region in terms of where do you see the most opportunity to drive an inflection? And perhaps, where you anticipate sales softness will persist? You talked about or you touched on softness in the UK and Japan potentially continuing as pressure point, but curious how you're thinking about the other regions?","Mark Erceg","So I think what we would say at this point as we look across the geographic landscape, we would expect markets like mainland China to continue to perform well. Europe, while it has been kind of flattish. We do believe that the product and marketing plans we have there will allow us to grow comparable store sales and constant currency in those regions. North America is probably the single largest opportunity for us. Last year, we had a relatively soft holiday and with the programs we have in place this year, we really believe that we should be able to do a better job of connecting with the U.S. consumer, and given its size, that's clearly the largest opportunity for us.","Japan, we've talked about Japan and the consumption tax change there, that's a little bit of a wildcard. Back in 2014, when the consumption tax went from 5% to 8%, we saw a meaningful pull forward of business in the two month period prior to the implementation of that tax increase and then it kind of fell away. So how that breaks over the third and fourth quarters is a little bit of a wildcard for us. But generally speaking, we expect the regions to perform better in the second half than they did in the first for all the reasons we've cited.","Rick Patel ","And can you also provide some color on the performance of your newly revamped websites. Are you getting the responses that you expected from consumers in terms of traffic and conversion? And is there anything to call out in terms of regions or categories that may be working particularly well online in light of your marketing pullback in the first half?","Alessandro Bogliolo ","Well, this moment is little bit of a delicate moment for our online sales, because as you know, we just replatformed during the end of April and May our website. So basically there is -- there are many newness, new features, new imagery, new copies that have been put in the website, which is totally new. So we have -- on one side, we are constantly learning from this newness. And we are AB testing in order to see what's better, what that can be improved, so it's a work in process. And especially, you know that when you change completely your platform, especially also the wording et cetera, that has an impact on the surcharging engine optimization because of the algorithms of Google's and the other search engines that take a few months in order to come back to the normal efficiency.","So all these to say that these three months had been a bit disruptive, quite disruptive I should say, with a negative trend in our online sales. But we are -- we were expecting that and we are seeing an improvement in that. This is the reason why we did all these changes during the summer in order to be ready for the second part of the year, which is when the most important season is also for online sales. Consider also that simultaneously, we have opened the China website as e-commerce so it could be another big effort. The start has been has been very positive, but it's just one month. But we are off to a good start.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jay Sole with UBS.","Jay Sole ","Mark, I just have a question about tariffs. Did tariffs in China have any impact on gross margin in the quarter? And does some of the recent news from China about the increase in tariffs that they're making have any -- will that have any impact on the business going forward? Thank you.","Mark Erceg ","That's great question. And the tariff is an area that we've been spending a lot of time. And it's important to point out just how much movement there has been. If you go back to before July 1st of 2018 and you look at the product types, whether it's silver or yellow gold, white gold, platinum, what have you, our all-in blended weighted average tariff was roughly 28%. Then in July of 2018 with the tariff cuts that went into effect, that dropped down to high-single-digit percentage. We dialed back around in September, mid-September of '18, it went up into the mid-teens. And by June of this year, we are basically back to the mid 20s.","With the current discussion taking place, what could be triggered in December, what actually take us above where we were when this whole thing started. So instead of being at 28%, we could be in the low 30s potentially. So it's an area that we're watching very, very closely. Because of the way we ship product typically from the U.S, there is a bit of a lag effect in when that tends to hit us. We don't expect a large additional impact if those December tariffs were to take effect this fiscal. That said, we have used some pricing in the past to help mitigate some of these areas. But as the pricing also would go in the opposite direction to follow the tariffs down, we've had to be very flexible and responsive in marketplace.","The biggest concern that we have frankly on a longer term basis is the tariff differential between a company such as ourselves who manufacturers most things in the U.S. versus some of the European competitors. And that's where, when we got together last quarter, we talked about the fact that we didn't feel it would be appropriate to take pricing actions and maybe do that unilaterally and get ourselves into and uncompetitive price situation, so we did have to eat that last round of tariffs. Whether or not we have to do something like that again, we have to make that determination over the next many weeks and months. But for now for the fiscal, I think we're in a reasonably good place. But longer term, it's an area that we obviously have a lot of concern about and are watching very closely.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul ","Hi, Mark. Just a question for you on the systems investments that you're making. I was just wondering if you could just give us an update on any milestones that you're at with the systems piece of it and anything that we should be looking forward for the next several quarters? Thanks.","Mark Erceg ","Yes. No, that's great. Thank you. And Alex alluded to one of the big system thing that we just did recently, which was standing up our e-com platform in China. That took a lot of work by a lot of folks. And I think we are going to be very well served by that. And in the first quarter discussion, we talked about the advanced planning system we just stood up in the merchandising supply chain side of the house. And we did mention that we just stood up our source-to-pay system -- our Coupa system, in the U.S. this past quarter. So we are making good progress.","We still have a lot of work to do, but we have a very strong dedicated team toward making sure that we stand these things up one after the next to allow us to really start running the company with global platforms and global processes and global systems. And frankly that's also one of the things that ultimately will allow us to just be more efficient in total as we look to find ways to create additional investment dollars that we can put into top-line growth.","Jason Wong","Thanks, Bob. It's now 9:30. So in the interest of everyone's time, we'll now wrap up the Q&A session. Please note on your calendars that Tiffany expects to report its third quarter results on Thursday, December 5th, before the market opens and we'll host a conference call. Thanks to all of you who were participating on this call and to so many of you for your continued interest in Tiffany. I look forward to hearing from you with any additional questions or comments as I begin my IR role here at Tiffany.","Operator, we can now conclude the call.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:TIF) Q2 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call August 25, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mark Aaron - Vice President, Investor Relations","Analysts","Operator","Good day and welcome to this Tiffany & Company Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations.","At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Alicia. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining me for a review of Tiffany's second quarter financial results and the full year outlook that we reported earlier today. By now I hope you have had a chance to read the news release.","Before proceeding, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law or regulation.","Okay. Now let's look at the results. Taking an overall assessment of the second quarter, a modest increase in EPS on a GAAP basis and a modest decline on an adjusted basis that excludes the prior year charge were better than the expected decline that we had communicated three months ago.","Worldwide sales were close to what we anticipated, declining 6% on both a GAAP basis and on a constant exchange rate basis, and generally continued to reflect the soft trends across regions that we've experienced for several quarters, which we attribute partly to domestic customer spending, but also to lower tourist spending, predominantly by Chinese tourists.","However, we had a solid increase in gross margin and experienced less deleveraging of SG&A expenses than we had anticipated due to a slight SG&A expense decline, and our balance sheet remains strong.","Looking forward, while the results for the quarter were a little better than we expected, we think it's prudent to maintain our existing outlook for the full year. A number of well known challenges and uncertainties that we've discussed over the past several quarters continue to persist.","And while we believe we are managing costs efficiently and of course, continuing to pursue opportunities to more effectively reach customers with extraordinary products, marketing campaigns, and experiences, we think it is most appropriate to maintain a stance of near-term caution. Our long-term goal remains to strengthen Tiffany's position as one of the world's most important luxury brands.","So looking at second quarter sales results in more detail, the 6% decline in worldwide sales reflected varying degrees of softness in all regions. There was no translation effect on total sales as the stronger yen offset the negative translation effects from the stronger US dollar against other currencies.","In the Americas, both total sales and comparable-store sales declined 9%, which we attribute to generally soft demand in US customer spending, as well as lower spending in the US by Chinese and other tourists, especially in New York and in other high tourism markets.","Beyond the US, results were mixed in our stores in Latin America and Canada. The overall sales declines in the second quarter in the Americas reflected unit-related softness across all jewelry categories and total sales and comps declined 8% and 9% on a constant exchange rate basis.","We can only speculate on why domestic US consumer spending at the high end has been generally soft, but we believe that macro market and political uncertainties are likely playing a role in restrained consumer behavior.","Regardless, our long-term plan is to mitigate these headwinds by better engaging with existing and potential customers and enhancing their experiences, both in our stores and online.","We added one store in the Americas during the second quarter when we opened in the luxurious new Holt Renfrew store at the Square One Centre in Mississauga, which is the sixth largest city in Canada. Beyond opening new stores, our strategy to optimize our store base includes renovations, relocations and closings.","Right now we are in the midst of major renovation of our stores in San Francisco, Beverly Hills, and Vancouver, similar to the renovation last year in Chicago of our Michigan Avenue store.","In the Asia Pacific region, total sales and comparable-store sales declined 6% and 12% in the quarter. The sales declines were due to a combination of lower average price, lower unit volume, and a shift in mix and reflected softness across much of the region.","We were pleased with healthy total and comparable store sales growth in China, as well as in Korea. However, continued meaningful sales declines in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, and Singapore contributed to the overall regional softness.","On a constant exchange rate basis, the total and comp store sales declines in the Asia Pacific region were 3% and 9%. During the quarter, we expanded our successful presence in Australia when we opened two stores, one at the Pacific Fair Center on the Gold Coast and one at the Sydney International Airport, and we now operate nine stores in Australia.","In Japan, total sales and comparable store sales increased 10% and 13% in the quarter, but that increase entirely reflected the translation benefit from the recent and substantial strengthening of the yen against the dollar.","This translation benefit more than offset lower spending that we estimate comes from foreign tourists, especially from China. There was also a decline in wholesale sales. An increase in average price was currency related, but we did have a modest increase in jewelry unit volume as well.","On a constant exchange rate basis, however, total and comp store sales declined 5% and 3%, reflecting the lower tourist spending I just mentioned, as well as the decline in wholesale sales.","We've noted that, based on our estimates, spending by local customers held up reasonably well in the quarter despite Japan's weak economy. The store count in Japan remained at 55 locations at the end of the quarter, although we are pursuing a number of renovations and three store relocations this year.","In Europe, soft demand on the continent continued the weak trend that began in last year's fourth quarter with the tragedy in Paris. Total sales and comparable-store sales in Europe declined 12% and 17% in the quarter.","The sales declines were due to lower jewelry unit volumes and we believe the sales declines reflected softness in foreign tourist spending across the continent, with a smaller decline in local spending by Europeans.","On a constant exchange rate basis, total European sales dropped 8% and comp store sales declined 13%. On a positive note, we continued to see strong sales growth in Russia and it's also worth noting that we saw solid sales growth on a constant exchange rate basis in the UK in the quarter, although it was slightly down on a GAAP basis.","There's obviously uncertainty and anxiety regarding the economic implications of Brexit, but, interestingly we saw an uptrend in the UK sales almost immediately following the vote. We believe that the weakening of the pound has made London a more attractive tourist shopping destination.","During the second quarter, we opened a store in the de Bijenkorf luxury department store, representing our second store in Amsterdam, and we closed a small store in the Frankfurt airport.","Lastly, other sales declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting continued weak retail demand in the five stores we operate in the UAE with comps down 22% and lower wholesale sales in other Middle East countries. However, those declines were mostly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds.","Our multidimensional initiatives to improve sales performance revolve around a few core elements, enhancing the customer experience through in-store training and systems to more effectively engage with our customers, optimizing our store base with renovations, relocations, and select closings, introducing new designs across product categories and price points, and effective messaging through marketing campaigns to communicate Tiffany's relevancy to a wide audience. The overall objective of these efforts is to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores and the conversion rate.","With respect to our store base, in total we opened four stores during the quarter and closed one. For the full year we expect to add 11 stores, close nine, and relocate six, which will represent about a 2% net increase in gross retail square footage, and we expect to maintain that low single-digit growth rate in the foreseeable future.","Beyond our stores is a strong web presence around the world, with e-commerce sales in 13 countries accounting for 6% of worldwide sales in 2015. Worldwide e-commerce sales in the second quarter were roughly unchanged from the prior year, but we also believe that our online presence enhances brand and product awareness and can drive store traffic, too.","From a merchandising perspective in the quarter, performance among the product categories was pretty consistent with the first quarter. All categories were below prior year to one degree or another, but once again the fashion jewelry category and the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category performed relatively better than the statement, fine, and solitaire jewelry category.","Within that category, statement jewelry, representing the highest price points has been the weakest performer in 2016 after posting very impressive growth last year.","We're encouraged with steady progress toward improving sales in the fashion jewelry category as we have seen a moderation in year-over-year sales declines. Our plan is to grow gold jewelry sales and to stabilize sales in silver jewelry.","Through recent innovations with more to come and with support from new advertising campaigns, we believe we are well positioned to provide a compelling message to consumers across a wide age range and by doing so, improve our performance in this category.","One example of innovation in the fashion jewelry category is our new Return to Tiffany Love designs and the supporting #LoveNotLike, social digital marketing campaign. Also recently, Tiffany became the first luxury brand to sponsor a Snapchat lens on July 28 that was instrumental to the campaign. The Snapchat lens received millions of user plays and substantial media coverage.","Additional new silver designs are intended to address softness at price points under $500. In fact, we've increased the number of silver jewelry SKUs under $500 by a double-digit percentage versus a year ago. At higher price points we focused on new designs in our important Tiffany T and Atlas Collections.","The engagement jewelry and wedding band category also posted a relatively modest sales decline this quarter relative to last year. We believe we're increasing awareness of Tiffany's competitive strength in this category via a bold new advertising campaign this year that accentuates the rarity of our diamonds, as well as our craftsmanship and heritage.","While Tiffany is certainly renowned for its classic six-prong setting, our Harmony diamond ring collection is generating strong results, as is our extraordinary assortment of wedding bands.","Lastly, in the statement, fine, and solitaire jewelry category, the softness in statement jewelry has overshadowed more mixed results in other parts of that category. We are pleased with continued success in our recently expanded Victoria collection, but saw mixed performance in other collections. And later this year we plan to add new designs within our Keys collection among others.","I should point out our new ad campaign, Legendary Style, which will be debuting in the coming days, highlighting a few of our important jewelry collections. Created in collaboration with fashion visionary Grace Coddington, this campaign features women of style and substance known for their unique points of view wearing iconic Tiffany designs. The campaign will appear in print, video, and across digital properties.","Beyond jewelry, we're pleased with progress in building our watch business as we intend to introduce new designs in our CT60 and East West collections, add new jeweled watches, and increase customer appreciation of Tiffany's heritage in that category, which dates back to the 1800s.","Also extending beyond jewelry, during the second quarter we were pleased to announce our collaboration with renowned designer Reed Krakoff to develop gift, home, and accessory collections for introduction in 2017.","So that completes the sales review. Let's now take a look at the rest of the results. Gross margin rose 2 points to 61.9% in the quarter, which was higher than we expected largely due to sales mix.","We continued to see margin improvement from a continuation of favorable product input costs and price increases taken over the past 12 months, as well as the shift in sales mix toward fashion jewelry in contrast with lower statement jewelry sales.","We continue to assume some increase in gross margin for the full year, but at a rate in the second half considerably less than what we experienced in the first half. This is because we will anniversary the benefits from last year's pricing actions and also have a smaller benefit from favorable product input costs.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses came in lower than we expected, declining 4% in the quarter. The decline was 2% when excluding the effect of a loan impairment charge last year. Measured either way, higher store related costs were more than offset by lower variable costs, as well as lower benefit and incentive compensation expenses.","Marketing expense also declined, although a portion of the marketing variance was timing related and will occur later in the year, as we intend to maintain the marketing-to-sales ratio at a level roughly equal to the prior year.","Even with the lower SG&A we experienced sales deleverage on SG&A expenses due to the sales decline, and despite the expected improving sales trends in the second half, we still expect some deleveraging for the full year.","Putting it all together, the operating margin of 18.8% in the second quarter was slightly higher than last year, but the first half margin of 17% remained below last year. There is not much to say about the effective tax rate, which at 34.5% in the quarter was roughly in line with last year's rate. For the full year, our earnings outlook continues to be based on an assumed rate slightly lower than in 2015.","As I said in my opening remarks, we're investing in a number of initiatives related to our store base, product assortment, marketing, and systems that are all intended to better engage and excite our customers and to grow sales.","Having a strong balance sheet and generating healthy free cash flow enables us to continue to invest, but it also enables us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend growth and generate an attractive total shareholder return over the long-term.","Net inventories at the end of the quarter were 1% below a year ago. We intend to manage inventories with consideration of our sales performance, while at the same time maintaining high availability and deep assortments in our stores which we believe is a competitive advantage.","Accounts receivable was 20% higher than a year ago, partly reflecting, as it did in the first quarter, the timing of third-party credit card collections when the quarter ends on a weekend.","In addition, there was increased use of in-house credit related to higher priced jewelry sales and a small increase related to timing of sales in our wholesale business. The rate of receivable turnover was a high 20 times per year.","Capital expenditures were $101 million in the first half of the year versus $98 million in last year's first half and the vast majority of CapEx is related to stores and IT spending. We maintained an active pace of share repurchases in the quarter, spending $72 million to repurchase shares at an average cost of $63 per share.","And we've spent $150 million for share repurchases in the first half of this year and at July 31 had $344 million available for repurchases under the program that expires in January 2019.","Tying it all together, we have cash and short term investments of $720 million on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter. Total short term and long-term debt of $1.1 billion, represented 37% of stockholders' equity.","I just want to make a couple of comments about our outlook. I mentioned earlier that sales were close to what we had anticipated for the second quarter, gross margin was better and SG&A was somewhat lower than expected, partly due to a shift in marketing spending.","However, in light of the many macro challenges that we believe are affecting consumer behavior, we believe it is prudent to not change our sales and earnings outlook for the full year.","Therefore, we continue to expect net worldwide sales declining by a low single digit percentage for the full year and EPS declining by a mid single digit percentage from last year's adjusted EPS, which had excluded loan impairment and certain staffing and occupancy charges.","In terms of currency translation, we are now assuming that the dollar is unchanged from current spot rates for the balance of the year and we are continuing to expect operating cash flow of at least $660 million for the year and free cash flow of at least $400 million, based on these and other assumptions and plans.","Of course, there are risks in any outlook and in a volatile environment it's even more challenging to predict the timing of a sustainable improvement in US activity or when a turnaround will occur in Europe or the patterns of travel and tourist spending by Chinese and other nationalities.","However, we believe we can expect improving trends in sales and earnings in the second half of the year as we continue to execute on the plethora of initiatives we are pursuing and also benefit from what we consider to be easier year-over-year comparisons.","In summary, we intend to remain focused on key strategic pillars that call for effectively communicating with and serving our customers, optimizing our store base, delighting customers with new product designs, and improving our cost structure and enhancing our supply chain. We believe our brand and management team are well suited to achieve those objectives.","Question-and-Answer Session","End of Q&A","That wraps up my remarks, which I hope you have found informative. Please call me with any questions.","A replay of this call is available on our website or by dialing 888-203-1112 in the US or 719-457-0820 outside the US and entering passcode 2533894. Finally, please note on your calendars that we expect to report third quarter results on Wednesday, November 29.

Earlier today we reported Tiffany's first quarter results and I hope by now you\u2019ve had chance to review the news release. On today's call, Ralph and I will comment on those results and how they are linked to our growth strategies, and then wrap up the call with a few comments on the outlook for the rest of the year.","Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.","Okay. Starting with the first quarter overview, while, results were admittedly far from robust, they did exceed our expectations and we were pleased with continued progress in executing our key store, product and marketing-related initiatives.","Net worldwide sales declined 5% in the first quarter, which was better than the 10% decline we had expected, due to strong performance in Europe and a smaller than anticipated year-over-year decline in Japan. On a constant exchange rate basis excluding the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar, worldwide net sales increased 1%.","Going from a 5% sales decline as reported to a 1% sales increase on a constant exchange rate basis, shows just how much of a headwind we are feeling from the strong U.S. dollar in translation alone. We expect that to continue to one degree or another for the remainder of the year.","Regional total sales performance again on a constant exchange rate basis ranged from a 21% increase in Europe, benefiting from strong foreign tourist and local customers spending there to an 18% decline in Japan after a surge in spending there in last year's first quarter.","In addition, we continued to experience solid growth in fashion jewelry sales highlighted by the Tiffany T collection. We enjoyed growth in statement jewelry sales and we began the rollout of our new CT60 watch collection.","The operating margin decline but the higher gross margin was more than offset by higher fixed SG&A expenses, specifically higher marketing spending in support of our bridal category and the introduction of our new watches.","In total, the better than expected sales performance resulted in net earnings declining 17% to $0.81 per diluted share, which again was better than our guidance that had call for an approximate 30% decline.","Let\u2019s now look at regional sales performance. In the Americas on a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comp store sales rose 1% on top of an 8% comp increase in last year's first quarter.","This minimal sales growth in the Americas reflected an increase in domestic spending, which was mostly offset by lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S., especially in New York, which we attribute to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Elsewhere in the Americas we achieved healthy sales growth in Canada and Latin America on a constant exchange rate basis.","In dollars, the 1% increase in total Americas sales resulted from favorable average price and mix being largely offset by lower jewelry unit volume tied to weakness at entry-level silver jewelry price points.","We opened one store in the Americas during the quarter in the new Miami design district. We now operate 123 stores in the region with additional openings planned this year, including Tiffany's first store in Chile in Santiago this summer as well as another store in Canada in Ottawa.","Performance in the Asia-Pacific region was mixed in the quarter. On a constant exchange rate basis, total sales increased 4% and comp store sales increased 2%, compared with a 10% comp increase in last year's first quarter. We continue to see strong sales growth in China as well as in Australia and Singapore but we continued to experience softness in Hong Kong and Macau as we believe some Chinese tourists have been traveling to and shopping in other regions.","Measured in U.S. dollars, Asia-Pacific sales declined 1% in the quarter. We experienced higher average price and mix which was outweighed by a decline in jewelry units sold in the region, reflecting the meaningful sales weaknesses in Hong Kong and in entry-level silver jewelry.","During the first quarter, we opened two stores in China in Hangzhou and in Shanghai and finished the quarter, operating 75 Tiffany stores in the Asia-Pacific region. So far in the second quarter, we've opened a store in [Hangzhou] [ph], China and just today we opened in the newly expanded Galaxy Macau. We have additional openings planned for the rest of the year, including our first store in Thailand in Bangkok.","Now let's turn to Japan where the focus in the quarter was frankly all about getting past a very difficult year-over-year comparison. In last year's first quarter, we achieved 30% comp store sales growth in yen when customer demand surged in anticipation of a consumption tax increase on April 1st. Though, it was not surprising to us that comp store sales in this year's first quarter declined 24% in yen.","We now face easier year-over-year comparisons in Japan for the rest of the year. That 24% comp decline in yen in the quarter or 18% on a total sales basis was due to a substantial decline in jewelry units sold. The yen was 12% weaker on average than in the first quarter of last year. So when translated into dollars, total sales in Japan declined 30% in the first quarter.","We believe such a substantial weakening of the yen has affected spending by Japanese tourists when they travel but might be supporting some local spending in Japan. In addition, we're benefiting in Japan from increasing spending by foreign tourists, especially from China.","The store count in Japan was unchanged at 56 company-operated locations. All-in-all our business in Japan has experienced substantial volatility over the past year. And we definitely look forward to some stabilization going forward.","In Europe, strong foreign tourist spending as well as higher local customer demand drove a substantial 21% increase in total sales on a constant exchange rate basis, with double-digit growth across most of continental Europe. Comp stores sales on the constant exchange rate basis rose 17%, compared with a 3% comp decline in last year's first quarter.","The euro and the pound have weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar over the past year. And when translated into U.S. dollars, total sales in Europe rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting favorable price and mix, with total unit volume unchanged from last year but varying by category. Those weaker currencies have certainly made it increasingly attractive at the moment for foreign tourist to shop in Europe and Tiffany is benefiting from it.","It was almost a year ago when we opened a major store in Paris on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, which is serving considerable numbers of foreign tourists and local customers too. We see significant long-term opportunities to further expand our company-operated store base in made for European markets.","As examples, last week, we opened our first store in Geneva. The 550 square meter two-level store is located on the Rue du Rhone, marking our third store in Switzerland and 39th store in Europe. And later this year, we plan to open on the fashionable Via Condotti in Rome, representing Tiffany\u2019s third store in that important city.","Lastly, sales in our other segment, which is a small component of our overall sales rose 1% in the quarter on a constant exchange rate basis with flat comps and declined 6% in dollars. This segment includes retail store sales in the United Arab Emirates and Russia, as well as wholesale diamond sales and some third-party licensing revenues.","From a store expansion perspective, we remain on track to increase our company-operated stores by a net of approximately 12 to 15 stores this year. More than half of the openings are planned in Asia-Pacific, with the balance in the Americas and Europe. This represents a 4% to 5% net increase in our company-operated store base and in worldwide square footage.","Beyond opening new stores, however, we are also pursuing a strategy to enhance the existing store base through renovations, as well as by relocating some stores to more favorable locations. In fact, we are scheduled for approximately 10 relocations this year and we're always focused on adding interesting and relevant content to our website that can also help to drive store traffic. We intend to be active in all of these areas in 2015, supporting our broader strategy to elevate the in-store and online experience and ultimately better engage and strengthen relationships with existing and new customers.","In terms of noteworthy highlights within our product categories and collections, fashion jewelry was a strong performer in the quarter. The strength in fashion continued to be led by gold jewelry designs. A significant contributor to fashion jewelry sales is the TIFFANY T collection that we launched last fall. The collection continues to be well received by customers globally and is an important part of our strategy to expand our reach among style seeking self purchasers. And as we mentioned on our last call, TIFFANY T has been posting our highest ever transaction size for a new fashion collection.","Also in fashion jewelry, our T\u2019s collection continues to perform quite well, especially benefiting from its expanded assortment. However, we continue to experience weakness in silver jewelry sales before $500. We are focused on addressing this issue over the balance of the year through product development and advertising targeted at what we call our little luxuries.","Sales in the engagement jewelry and wedding bands category were soft year-over-year, with Japan accounting for most of the sales decline tied to the surge in spending in last year\u2019s first quarter. So going forward, we hope to see better performance in that category and we continue to be pleased with sales in the harmony collection and its recently expanded assortment.","Spanning the engagement and the statement, fine and solitaire jewelry categories is our beautiful Soleste collection, which performed well in the quarter. In addition, we are planning to introduce some compelling additions to existing fine jewelry collections later this year to address softness in the fine jewelry category.","In contrast to that softness in fine jewelry performance, we\u2019re very pleased with strong growth in statement jewelry sales in the quarter. In April, we hosted our Annual Blue Book event in New York with select customers in fashion media attending from around the world to see our new couture collection of magnificent jewelry with the theme, The Art of the Sea. It was a truly memorable and successful event.","Rounding out the product review, in April we launched our CT60 collection of watches inspired by designs in Tiffany\u2019s archives. This brilliant collection is now being rolled out globally to Tiffany stores and consistent with our strategy, we are supporting the launch with extensive marketing to strengthen credibility and success in that category.","While it\u2019s way too early to talk about results, we can say that initial reaction from customers and the media has been very good.","In summary, we remain keenly focused on our key strategies surrounding stores, customer engagement, products and marketing.","I will now turn the call over to Ralph to continue the financial and strategic review.","Ralph Nicoletti","Thank you, Mark, for the sales review. First, I would like to point out a few overall highlights of the quarter. The strong U.S. dollar was a significant headwind on the translation of results transacted outside the U.S., having a 6% negative effect on worldwide sales, as well as impacting foreign tourist spending in the U.S.","Gross margin continued to improve as expected. We brought into our marketing focus beyond the Tiffany T collection with new engagement and watch campaigns. Our sales results contributed to a smaller than expected decline in net earnings.","However, as it is early in the year and in light of continuing macro challenges and our assumptions about the direction of currency movements, we think it is prudent to maintain and not increase our earnings outlook for the year.","Let\u2019s now take a look at the rest of the earnings statement. Gross margin of 59.1% in the quarter was nine-tenths of a point higher than last year reflecting many factors. We continue to benefit to some degree from lower product input costs while also taking some single-digit price increases globally in the first quarter that partly offset the effect of the weaker foreign currencies.","Part of the gross margin increase also came from the absence of a one-time charge that we incurred in last year\u2019s first quarter for the closing of a diamond polishing facility. In addition, the favorable effect from higher margin fashion jewelry sales was offset by solid growth in much lower margin statement jewelry sales as well as the sales decline in Japan, which had a negative effect on gross margin.","We continue to expect a modest increase in gross margin in 2015 as those favorable product input costs diminished over the remainder of the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5% in the quarter, largely due as expected to marketing spending partly tied to our new Will You? engagement campaign, and the launch of the CT60 watch collection.","In addition, incremental U.S. pension and postretirement benefit cost affected the SG&A expense increase. We continue to expect that SG&A expenses will grow at a rate exceeding sales growth for the full year, reflecting the items that I just mentioned. The increased expense for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans will total approximately $30 million for the full year. However, we do expect some improvement in the ratio of SG&A expenses to sales in the second half of the year.","Our forecast continues to reflect operating earnings for the full year approximately equal to the prior year. Interest and other expenses net declined in the quarter as expected from our debt refinancing in 2014. In addition to a lesser extent, we benefited from some year-over-year changes in foreign currency transaction gains.","We continue to assume interest and other expenses net at approximately $50 million in 2015. The effective tax rate of 34.7% in the first quarter was slightly lower than the 35.1% rate in the first quarter of last year.","We also continue to base our earnings forecast on an effective tax rate in 2015 virtually unchanged from last year\u2019s 34.4%. In total, we were projecting net earnings to decline 30% in the first quarter due to the pressures from the strong dollar, the difficult comparison in Japan and softness in the U.S. However, the smaller sales decline led to a smaller-than-expected 17% decline in net earnings.","Although, let\u2019s keep in mind that the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year. We\u2019re also pleased with the strength of Tiffany\u2019s balance sheet, which is consistent with our financial strategy. Cash and short-term investments totaled $715 million at April 30th. Short and long-term debt totaled almost $1.1 billion or 37% of stockholders equity versus 35% a year ago.","We have more than adequate resources to support the growth of our business and to provide for potential opportunities to return some excess cash to shareholders. Net inventories of $2.4 billion at April 30th were 2% lower than a year ago.","That overall decrease included a small increase in finished goods that was more than offset by a decline in combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. On a constant exchange basis, inventories would have increased 2%, due to new stores and product introductions.","Our strategy for this year and over the long-term is to keep inventory growth below the rate of sales growth through better productivity in our stores, as well as in our overall supply chain. Accounts receivable of $192 million at April 30th was virtually unchanged from a year ago with receivable turnover staying at 21 times per year.","Capital expenditures were $37 million in the first quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Our forecast continues to be based on CapEx at about $260 million for 2015, with considerable spending devoted to stores and for new IT systems, such as Global CRM and inventory management, among others.","In terms of share repurchases, we spent $33 million in the first quarter to buy approximately 380,000 shares. At April 30th, we had approximately $240 million available for future repurchases under the current authorization that runs through March of 2017.","On a trailing basis at April 30th, Tiffany's return on assets was 9% and the return on stockholders equity was 16%, both of which are close to our long-term objectives to achieve a minimum of 10% ROA and a 15% ROE.","Before including my remarks, I want to comment on our full-year financial forecast. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, we were pleased that the sales and earnings came in somewhat better than our expectations for the first quarter, but because it's still early in the year, we believe we should maintain our existing forecast in light of the strong dollar and lingering macro and market conditions and uncertainties.","Our full year assumption of mid single-digit percentage worldwide sales increased on a constant exchange basis, assumes varying degrees of growth across all regions. However, we expect continued pressures from the strong dollar that may possibly only begin to abate much later in the year, if at all, resulting in a low single-digit full year worldwide sales increase when translated into dollars.","Our unchanged forecast of minimal earnings growth versus the $4.20 per share we earned last year on a non-GAAP basis continues to incorporate an expected earnings decline in the second quarter at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter, as well as our assumptions of minimal sales growth, but higher growth in SG&A expense again tied to marketing spending.","We then continue to expect double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year. So it\u2019s a plan built on progressively improving sales and earnings performance as we move through the year.","And as we said on our last conference call, that minimal expected growth in earnings for the year will be more like a high single-digit increase, if we excluded the estimated negative translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar and the cost from the incremental $30 million of pension expense.","In conclusion, we believe that Tiffany is increasingly well-positioned as one of the world's most important luxury brands and has the potential to be more productive and profitable over the long-term.","We have the growth opportunities, very sound strategies, a talent management -- talented management team and we\u2019re investing in important systems and capabilities, and have financial resources to pursue those strategies. We believe we\u2019ve had a decent start to the year all things considered and appreciate your interest in Tiffany.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks Ralph. We hope all of you now have a fuller understanding of our financial results and our plans. A replay of the call is available on our website or by dialing (888) 203-1112 in the U.S. or (719) 457-0820 outside the U.S. and entering passcode 3506887.

Today's call is being recorded. Participating on today's call is Mr. Mark Aaron, Vice President of Investor Relations; Mr. Mark Erceg, Tiffany's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany's Chief Executive Officer.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Aaron. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today. On today's call, Alessandro will begin with some strategy-related remarks, I will review sales results, and then Mark Erceg will review other financial highlights of the second quarter and our outlook before we answer some of your questions. I hope you've all had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today.","Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from the planned, assumed, or expected results expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances except as required by applicable law or regulation.","Additional information concerning factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, as well as the required reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures referenced in this presentation to their comparable GAAP measures, is set forth in Tiffany's Form 10-K filed earlier today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the news release filed today under cover of Form 8-K. Those filings could be found on Tiffany's investor Web site, www.investor.tiffany.com, by selecting Financial Information in the left-hand column.","Now I believe we can now proceed, so I'll turn the call over to Alessandro.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Mark. I am pleased to have this opportunity to update you on strategic progress we are making at Tiffany. Our team's focus on the six key strategic priorities we had previously communicated is intended to drive further excitement among our customers as well as enthusiasm among our colleagues, and strong performance that rewards our shareholders.","The 12% worldwide sales growth for the second quarter was slightly above our expectations, and this I believe indicative of some of our early achievements on what I previously described as a long journey. And I am pleased that the sales growth continued to be driven largely by increased demand that we attribute to local customers in every region, which included increased jewelry unit volume.","At the same time, we have increased our spending in various aspects of our business, which we expect to continue for the rest of the year, and which we believe is necessary to generate sustainable sales and earnings growth in the future. I want to mention a few relevant examples. To address the priority to amplify an evolved brand message, we have increased marketing spending across a range of media in the second quarter, and spending for the remainder of the year is planned to be well above prior year levels. And I think our recent Believe In Dreams campaign created a modern interpretation of the historical legacy of Tiffany, with addition of the beautiful things that can happen at Tiffany. And I won't share any details, but we have a whimsical holiday campaign planned for later this year.","To address the priority to renew our product offerings, we are pleased with initial results of the Paper Flowers collection that we launched in May, in North America, and more recently, we have been rolling out globally. This exquisite floral collection in platinum and diamonds is filling an important need in our assortment. And I'm very pleased to share with you that in the coming weeks, and into 2019, we will be introducing a new engagement jewelry design called Tiffany True.","Also from a product and marketing perspective, we are addressing substantial customer interest in personalization with our new Make it My Tiffany program, which allows customers to create one-of-a-kind designs that can be engraved on jewelry and charms. We now offer that in-store immediate service in our New York Flagship store and in more than 100 of our other stores globally. During the quarter, we opened a pop-up store, near London's Covent Garden, that embraces individuality and the art of self expression. I have to say that this new initiative seems to be resonating very well with customers.","And to expand with Tiffany's digital presence in China, I am pleased to say that we will partner with Luxury Pavilion, the luxury retail platform of Tmall, with an exclusive popup online store that will debut in September. This follows the digital popup we did earlier in the year with WeChat in China. It is also worth highlighting our priority to enhance our in-store presentations in order to create a more interesting and interactive environment for our customers. We introduced a new look in our Chicago Michigan Avenue store during the quarter, and expect that our global display enhancement initiative will touch all North America stores by this November, and then other regions in 2019.","And we recently announced that we will be embarking on a complete renovation of our New York Flagship store beginning in spring 2019, with an anticipated completion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan is perhaps one of the most important luxury intersections in the world, and our Flagship store is arguably one of the most iconic and recognized retail destinations in the world. While the Flagship has undergone several renovations since its opening in 1940, the last of which was completed more than 15 years ago, our plans now call for much more, a transformation that is aimed to delight our customers.","We are still finalizing the details, but we have a unique opportunity to temporarily relocate most of our retail operations in the back-end space next door for the duration of the construction. We are thinking boldly on this project, that while respecting the building's historical significance, we create an environment that we intend will be second to none. And the related objective is to significantly increase the store's sales productivity in the future.","I was pleased to meet many investors during the second quarter, and look forward to seeing many more of you in the coming months. I am certainly pleased to hear your feedback and enthusiasm about our strategic initiatives. We have many opportunities to pursue in the coming years, and I appreciate your interest.","Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Aaron.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Alessandro. Well, it was clearly another quarter of solid results, similar to the first quarter, with strong growth in worldwide sales in total and on a comparable basis that spanned most regions and exceeded our expectations. There's certainly a lot of energy and enthusiasm throughout the Tiffany organization. The Americas performed well due to growth across much of the region that we attributed almost entirely to higher spending by local customers. While spending attributed to foreign tourists was not materially different from the prior year.","During the quarter, we opened our relocated store in Waikiki, Hawaii, and the store design and the location are truly amazing, and we have great expectations for it. Sales growth continued to be strong in Asia Pacific, which primarily reflected spending attributed to local customers. But we did experience growth in sales to foreign tourists as well. We experienced growth across Greater China and in some other countries, and we also continue to see growth in the wholesale sales in the region.","During the quarter, we further enhanced our store base in China by opening stores in Changsha IFS and in Hefei in the InTime Department Store, brining us to 34 locations in China. And we relocated two stores in Nanjing and Harbin. And I should just mention that we made some retail price adjustments in China after import duties were lowered on July 1st.","Our business in Japan continued to perform well, and now is on top of good results in last year's second quarter. This reflected strong demand that we attribute more to local customers, but also to an increase in spending by Chinese tourists. Our business in Europe showed modest signs of improvement, with growth in the U.K. and some parts of Continental Europe due to higher spending attributed to local customers.","During the quarter, we continued to experience pressure from lower spending attributed to foreign tourists, albeit at a lesser rate of decline than in the first quarter. We were also delighted to expand our European store base in the quarter when we entered the Scandinavian market with a store in Demark, in Copenhagen's Illum Department Store, and added a second store in Munich in the Oberpollinger Department Store. And while sales in the other segment declined due to a reduction in wholesale sales of diamonds, we were pleased with comparable sales, up 5% in the stores we operate in the UAE. And during the quarter, we opened a new store in the Galleria Mall in Abu Dhabi.","Lastly, I should add that contributing to worldwide comparable sales growth in the quarter was strong ecommerce sales with those sales increasing across all product categories. The strong results from a regional retail and ecommerce perspective were correlated with good performance across all product categories.","Sales in our jewelry collections category rose 18% in the quarter; the same growth rate as the first quarter, based on the continued popularity of collection such as Tiffany Tea, Victoria, Keys, and Return to Tiffany. In addition, we were pleased with the initial response to our new paper flowers collection which was only in limited distribution in the second quarter. We continue to be encouraged with growth in our engagement jewelry category consisting of diamond rings and wedding bands where sales rose 8% in the quarter.","We are pleased with the response to our engagement ring customization program in North America. And we are expanding the program to additional geographies. And as Alessandro mentioned, we will soon be introducing a beautiful new engagement ring design. Sales in the designer jewelry category which includes the designs of Elsa Peretti, Paloma Picasso, and Jean Schlumberger were up 5% in the quarter. And beyond jewelry we experienced growth in watch sales. We are pleased with sales in our home and accessories collection. And we expanded our fragrance collection during the quarter with the introduction of Tiffany Eau de Parfum Intense, a richer and deeper version of the signature fragrance.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark Erceg.","Mark Erceg","Thanks, Mark. I'll briefly comment on our second quarter financial performance before touching on our outlook for the balance of the year. As Alex already indicated, we are pleased with the 4% increase in worldwide sales growth we achieved during the quarter and with our 3% increase in earnings from operations. This was not only expected but fully consistent with the investments we are making in technology, marketing, digital, visual merchandising, and store presentation, all of which are intended to help generate sustainable and earnings growth over the longer term.","High targeted spending across these five key investment areas drove a substantial increase in SG&A expense during the second quarter which more than offset a higher gross margin largely tied to a reduction in the wholesale sale of diamonds, sales leverage on fixed cost, and favorable product input cost. And without getting too granular, we do expect SG&A expending to continue at an elevated rate the remainder of this year and to achieve sales growth for the full-year.","On operating earnings, we are clearly benefiting from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate enacted early this year. And we reported a small gain on a discrete tax matter which was favorably resolved during the quarter. The combination of these two items led to an effective tax rate of about 21% which in turn helped us achieve a 26% increase in net earnings. You'll also recall that Tiffany Board approved a program in May to repurchase up to $1 million of our shares and which included authorization for a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program.","We are pleased to report that we completed the ASR in the second quarter and also repurchased some shares under the previous program. These actions reduced the number of shares outstanding and allowed diluted earnings per share to grow slightly faster than net earnings. Specifically diluted net earnings were $1.17 per share versus $0.92 per share last year, an increase of 27%.","Tiffany ended the second quarter with more than $800 million of cash and short term investments. And total short term and long term debt represented just 32% of stockholder's equity. With working capital being effectively managed and inventory growing below the rate of sales, our balance sheet remains very strong. In terms of our outlook for the full-year, we continue expect strong high single-digit sales growth in total which factors in our assumptions regarding comparable sales growth as well as the U.S. dollar remaining at levels stronger than a year ago.","At current levels, the U.S. dollar would have some negative affect on currency translation and also perhaps on the pattern of foreign tour spending. Relative to EPS in addition to factoring in our second quarter B on the top line, we believe it is reasonable and prudent to adjust our full-year forecast to account for a number of items.","First, we now expect our all and effective tax rate to be in the mid 20s, this is down versus our prior estimate, which called for an effective tax rate in the high 20s. Second, the decision to lower retail prices in China effective July 1st in response to lower duty and tariff rates, brings with it negative P&L consequences in the near-term as we continue to sell product from inventory, which has already incurred the higher duty and tariff rates.","Finally, the strategic decision to transform our New York City flagship store is expected to lower 2018 earnings per share by approximately $0.07 due to accelerated depreciation charges related to the existing store and preliminary development costs. Both of which have been included in our updated 2018 guidance range.","However, the incremental costs associated with renting and fitting out the adjacent space is not expected to begin until fiscal 2019. At that time and over the planned three-year construction project, total dilution should be somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15 per share in each of those years.","It is also worth noting that we expect to remain open for business, utilizing this adjacent space to minimize disruptions during the renovation period. So with this context and in total, we are increasing our full-year EPS guidance from $4.50 to $4.70 to a new range of $4.65 to $4.80 per share.","From a cash flow standpoint, there are three quick updates we'd like to provide. First, we remain comfortable with our 2018 planned CapEx spending of approximately $280 million. However, we do expect as indicated in our recent press release to spend 7% to 9% of sales on CapEx during fiscal 2019 through 2021 versus our typical spending of 6% to 7% of sales.","This is being done in order to support the flagship renovation. Second, just as we made the decision at the start of the year to increase investment spending in five key areas which are now affecting SG&A expense growth, we plan to make additional investments in our high jewelry inventory assortment over the balance of the year in order to further strengthen that portion of our business.","So we are now forecasting approximately $600 million of cash flow from operations for the year versus $700 million previously and now expect to generate at least $300 million of free cash flow versus our previous estimate of at least $400 million. Finally, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million through our purchased shares during fiscal 2018.","That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Alessandro and Mark. We're now ready to take some questions, but again we request that you ask single-part questions so that we can get to as many of you as possible in the next half hour or so.","Operator, let's take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Omar Saad of Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I actually wanted to ask if you could expand a little bit on the decision around the New York City flagship, maybe talk a little bit about how you vision that store from an experiential standpoint versus a commercial standpoint, are you going for both in terms of the renovation there. I know you had mentioned in the past some of the stores could take a better opportunity to kind of highlight their newness and the iconic products as well. Maybe, Alessandro, if you could talk a little bit more about how your vision has evolved for the key flagship? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Omar, for your question. Well, the flagship is really an important project for us and a lot of resources internal and external resources have been devoted to this project. Actually, you might know that we own the entire building, which is 124,000 square feet, and only 45,000 square feet are actually dedicated to customers to retail. So the reason why we really think it's going to be transformational is that we will repurpose the space to maximize the client-facing space. And this means that we will increase the surface dedicated to retail, but also to events, to hospitality for our customers as we leverage on the success of the Blue Box Caf\u00e9 and also space for VIP customers.","So when we say it's going to be a revolution, I think it's going to be a revolution, because first of all, we will improve dramatically the customer service. We will increase capacity of the store, because you must know that in peak season, that store is running actually in full capacity. So we will increase the capacity of the store. We will - to the shopping also heritage brand and the product and different product categories experience in many different ways. We will enhance the high jewelry customers' delight and treatment and we will definitely integrate in that historical building our omni-channel approach. So I would say that we really believe that it will be the most amazing luxury flagship in the world. And apart from being a big statement for the New York market, I'm really confident that it will enhance the brand and the customer perception of Tiffany on a worldwide basis.","So we have big expectations for this project. Of course, it's a multi-year project and I think it's also worth spending few words on the temporary arrangement, because this is going to be a three-year project. But we have also -- leasing the space adjacent to our flagship. We will be able to really provide a great service and we will have great capacity during the renovations, and -- because you have to consider that during the renovations of our flagship building that we would be mainly in 2020 and 2021, fill the ground floor of our current flagship will be operating for most of the time. So we will have, for most of the time, our current ground floor plus the adjacent buildings, which makes us feel more confident for the renovations in order to entertain our customers and sell to them.","Omar Saad","Thanks for the insight.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Omar.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, good morning, let me add my congrats on a nice quarter, and thanks for taking our question here. Mark, would you mind helping me with a little bit more clarity on the reduced operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance for the year. I'm surprised -- it seems like the inventory outlook or the working capital outlook took a tick in the favorable direction versus what you previously had. I think the EBIT has planed down a little bit because of some new expense related to the flagship store. I don't know if that affects cash flow and then CapEx is not changing. I think you mentioned something related to the jewelry inventory I didn't quite understand. If you wouldn't mind helping us just understand the tweak to the cash flow guide for the year?","Mark Erceg","Yes, absolutely. And you're right we are doing a very nice job managing working capital across the entirety of the business. But we have chosen to make an additional investment in our high jewelry assortment over the balance of the year. We have a pretty strong high jewelry business, but we see an opportunity to strengthen that even further. So we're going to be bringing in additional high jewelry items and that's what's really driving the full reconciliation between our prior commentary on cash flow and where we are today.","One thing I would point out is that as people look at inventory, particularly on the high jewelry side, where buying here is high quality, large size, gems and gem stones, these are things that generally speaking do not depreciate in any way, shape or form as years roll on. And we believe that this is again a way for us to compete effectively and win across all of our product categories at all price segments. So it's something we're very excited about and I think it's a good use of funds.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Okay. Next question?","Operator","And at this time we will hear from Erwan Rambourg of HSBC.","Erwan Rambourg","Yes, hi good morning and congratulations; Erwan Rambourg from HSBC. Just wanted to come back on the flagship project to understand what assumptions you make in terms of what portion of the business you believe will be transferred while the store is being refurbished? Let's say you had 100, what happens during the two years, do you recoup, 80%-90% of that? And related to the flagship, will this be a one-off concept or is there a new concept being built there that you can then leverage and roll out to other locations across the world? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you. Well, as said, during the renovation, we don't expect to have major disruption for our customers and especially also for our business. So we think we really have the best possible ideal kind of arrangement for this major renovation. And between our ground floor of the existing building and the adjacent building, I think, we have enough space to really run our business and without inconvenience for our customers. Now, when it comes to the concept it's -- here we are talking about an institution and a landmark building.","So what we want to do is first and foremost to respect the historical significance of the building. We want to be respectful, we don't want to do something fancy that would not preserve the long-term value of that building and also the experience of the customers. But at the same time we will integrate better, for example, circulation -- vertical circulation in the upper floors and -- but it will not be, let me say, something like an exercise of decoration and style, but it will really something more respectful of the building and especially of the experience of the customers.","Erwan Rambourg","Thank you.","Mark Erceg","And I would just add Erwan, we publicly disclosed that about 45,000 square feet of that 124,000 square foot building is devoted to retail and customer-facing areas. That percentage devoted to it will certainly be meaningfully higher once this project is done. We're not saying how much, but customers will experience a lot more in more of the store.","Erwan Rambourg","Thank you.","Mark Erceg","Thank you. ","Operator","And moving on, we will go to a question from Alexander Wallace of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Wallace","Good morning, thanks for the question. Our question was around the store environment. You've innovated a lot with respect to the store environment in recent months, for example, the new visual displays around the Paper Flowers launch. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'd be rolling out enhanced visual displays within your stores to more of the U.S. through the back half of this year and then further afield. What has happened in those stores where you have those enhanced displays and enhanced environments to make you confident of the more broad rollout? And what elements of, for example, the Chicago store should we expect to be replicated elsewhere? And finally, are there any elements of things like in London pop up that we should expect to see in stores in the U.S.? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, thank you for your question. To be very factual, now, I think what we were talking about six months ago about enhancement of our visual merchandising is getting clear, because it starts being a reality. So the two things that we have already -- the two programs we have already rolled out is -- one is the Paper Flowers launch, and the other one is Make it My Tiffany personalization.","Now, For Paper Flowers, what I can say is that the VM -- the visual merchandising that we have done is definitely a change compared to the past and is attracting a lot of attention by customers. If I have to look at the sales results, we are satisfied with the sales of Paper Flowers, but even more meaningful for me is that we are experiencing no cannibalization at all on any similar price points or other lines of jewelry. Actually, we are seeing even a halo effect of the launch of Paper Flowers on other diamonds and platinum collections.","As for personalization, we are at the beginning of the program. It's quite wide, it's not only in the U.S., it's running globally. I was actually, just last week, in Australia for example, and in our stores in Sydney and Melbourne area where these installations, these sort of shopping shops and I have to say it was the hottest part of the store. And also talking with sales people, they were confirming to me that the reaction of customers was positive, which is good in terms of vibe in the store, but it's also good for the average transaction, because of course this is a service that is normally charged and so it helps on one side to make the product memorable for the customer, but on the other side helps also to sell an additional service. So I would say, so far so good, also in terms of ROI of these initiatives.","As far as the Chicago store is concerned, that has been really the pilot of what we plan to do in the rest of the stores, so with some call clicks, but this is basically what we are going to rollout in the rest of North America in the end of this year, and then in the rest of the world in the spring. And as far as the popup in Covent Garden, well that has received an enormous interest by customers, by press, and through sales by competitors. And it's all based around personalization. And it shows how this concept is really resonating with customers. And it's really elevating jewelry, also sliver jewelry, that thanks to this personalization is made even more special to customers. So I see it as a business as a traffic driver, but also as an elevation of all our price points, including the lower ones.","Alexander Wallace","Great, thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you. Okay, next question?","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks. I'll add my congrats as well. I was wondering, Alessandro and Mark, maybe if you can talk about the SG&A buckets a little more here. I think broadly you generally talk about technology, visual merchandising, marketing and communications. Can you maybe talk about do you expect SG&A to grow faster than sales heading into next year too? Where do you think you're getting the most bang for the buck right now in the SG&A, and where is the most catch-up still left to come? Thank you very much.","Mark Erceg","Yes, but we've been very clear and very specific in calling out those five areas as a group because they're all areas that we feel warrant additional investment spendings. And frankly, they all kind of reinforce and work in harmony with one another. So it'd be very hard for us to call out an isolate and say one is more important than another or one is having a larger effect on the other. I think you're seeing the total brand resonance in the Q1 results and in the Q2 results. And you are correct in saying that we do believe that the SG&A growth over the balance of the fiscal year will be in excess of sales growth. That's something that we called out very clearly as far this year, and we have chose to reinvest in this beautiful 181-year-old legendary brand.","So, we don't really want to tease out and parse it, we believe that collectively the investments we're making are the right ones. [Technical difficulty] we have a long way to go still. Alex and I and others have been very open about the fact that this is the beginning of a very long and exciting journey. And we'll continue to keep everyone updated as we make our plans for future years. But the key here is to create long-term sustainable sales and earnings growth in a lot underpinned cash flow.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes. That's only about seasonality that, of course, the third and fourth quarter is really the best moment for us as a brand in order to increase our marketing spend, because of course it's the higher selling season, but there is also the launch of Paper Flowers that finally now is at the beginning of Q3 is really rolled out on a global basis, so we have the full potential of it. And on the other side, there will also the launch of Tiffany True in the United States. So this is an additional reason for increasing our marketing spending in Q3 and Q4.","Mark Erceg","And we been clear in saying that over the course of this year we expect operating margin to go down. But we've also been very clear in saying that after this year we would expect operating margin to continue to expand again.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Exactly.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit more about the Paper Flowers performance thus far? Do you feel you bring in a younger customer, and if there is any way to quantify that we'd love to hear about that? Also just curious on SG&A spend, did any specific regions spend ahead of the other regions where there might be a catch-up in future quarters? Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, about Paper Flowers, I have to say that from the initial sales results and analysis we have it's attracting both new customers as well as repeated existing customers. And we have seen really both kinds of customers, so we judge this very positive. On the other question\u2026","Mark Erceg","And in a wide age range too.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes.","Mark Erceg","Yes. And as far as whether or not the SG&A spend is somewhat regionalized, Alex made the point earlier that Paper Flowers began in the U.S., it's now rolling out to other markets. Alex was in Europe recently for the launch there, it's coming to Asia. So there will be some spending that will follow, obviously, those types of large global product introductions. We've also talked about the IT foundational programs. We talked about, in the last quarter, how we stood at China. Obviously that drives some spending in that of a region. And as we go to other geographies that spending will follow. But we're really looking at it more from a global standpoint and how to allocate our resources globally for maximum impact. And obviously we want to reinvigorate the brand doing that domestically with the U.S., and certainly with the Chinese and others you could figure that this is going to be a big focus area for us.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes, China is for sure an important area of focus for our investment, also marketing-wise. I was there with three of the -- just a couple of months ago for the launch of Paper Flowers and also reviewing the marketing plans there, which are pretty solid. But it's one of the key markets among others where we are investing.","Paul Lejuez","Great, thanks guys. Good luck.","Mark Erceg","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research.","David Schick","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's exciting to see the sustained growth in engagement. So maybe not think about the quarter, but think about this year, the first-half, is that coming from -- could you talk more about units, price. I know there's more plans, as you mentioned, but just a little more detail on this sustained strength and engagement would be helpful. Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes, so we are very pleased with this continued growth in engagement. And also because it was in this first two quarters, it was driven purely by customer demand and communication with the Believe In Love campaign that we have, but actually no product innovation. So it's even stronger in that respect. And going forward, with the launch of Tiffany True, I think we will benefit also from a newness in this important category, even if we know that newness in solitaire, diamonds -- I mean, is diamond solitaires takes time to establish a new setting, a new design as a classic and as a bestseller. So we are very encouraged by this. We will keep on promoting our new -- a bold brand message about diamond jewelry in being really not only an expressing of by this love, but love in all its expressions. And I think it's working very well with customers. So we are really confident.","Mark Erceg","And, David, in the second quarter that increase in engagement jewelry sales was entirely driven by higher units. So we're really pleased with that.","David Schick","Very helpful, thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the pricing action in China. Can you talk a little bit about the magnitude of the declines in prices? I understand the P&L impact, but maybe your expectations about how that might impact the comp your efforts to get the customer to trade back up into the price point that they might have been in before this price decline?","Mark Erceg","Yes, I'll start, and maybe then Alex can join on as well. The announcement about the change in the tariff and duties was fairly sudden, and we wanted to be very responsive. And so, effective July 1, we did pass through the full differential that would other have accrued to us from the reduction in tariff and duties. So the full value of that was passed through effective and immediately upon that day. When we talked about the fact that there was some negative near-term P&L effects, it's exactly that. It's simply the fact that the retails went down immediately, but we still had held inventory that had already paid those higher rates. As far as what happened thereafter as far as price elasticity and other things it's still very early days, we'll see. But we did want to be responsive to the Chinese government's changes, and so did in fact have to pull value through.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Yes, and also because it's even more difficult to measure which is the impact of the price reduction on sales because it's a country market where our sales are growing strongly. They were growing in Q1. They kept on growing at the same rate in Q2. So just we have to be good citizens, transfer these savings to customers really very much on time, and then we hope to keep on having good results there.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question at this time will come from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. Just two questions, if I could. The first one is can you talk about just the outlook for gross margin consolidated in the back-half of the year and the drivers over the next few years. And then the second question is, can you elaborate a little bit on the trends throughout Europe, I think U.K. got a little bit better. But if you could maybe give us a little bit more color in the various markets that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Mark Erceg","Yes, first gross margin, I'll jump in there, and then Alex can answer the second-half of your question. We do expect gross margin to continue to improve into the second-half. Generally speaking, as we talked at the start of the year, we are still seeing favorable pricing actions as it relates to the input costs for rough diamonds. Metals are bouncing around a little bit. You know that we go out fairly far into the metal markets, and so our exposure there for the near-term is pretty well locked in. We have had a very favorable multi-year cycle here where generally speaking metal inputs have come down. We have not expected that to continue at the same rate going forward. But certainly as we get sales leverage through the P&L based on the reinvigorated brand we see no reason why gross margin shouldn't continue progress as part of our real goal, which is to drive operating margin expansion starting with '19 and beyond.","Bob Drbul","All right.","Alessandro Bogliolo","As far as European sales, well, we have seen a slight improvement in the second quarter compared to the first one, where we had constant exchange rate comp sales were still negative at minus four, but not as negative as -- well, I think it was about 9% negative in the first quarter. Now, this negative comp sales is first and foremost due to the lower purchases from tourists, because all over the region we had positive and solid positive sales growth with domestic customers. This was both in the first quarter as well as the second quarter. And going forward we expect reasonably this comp sales to improve also because there is a change in the network of comp stores as we will be anniversarying the opening of big stores last year.","So let me say, of course, tourist flows is -- I mean, we cannot control. There is obviously now a moment where Chinese tourists demand is there, it's very strong. It's shifting more from Europe and also from United States to Asia, not only in domestic China, but in general in Hong Kong, in Macau, in Korea, in Japan. And so we are benefitting more of these flows in that part of the world rather than in Europe. And also in the U.S. we have seen during the quarter a decrease in sales to Chinese consumers, tourists. But that was totally offset by a strong increase in sales to domestic customers as well as to tourists of other nationalities. So this is always, it's a part of our business. The traffic of tourism can shift from one region to the other. The positive thing is that being a global brand we are equipped to get benefit of that business wherever it moves.","Bob Drbul","Great, thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Okay, thank you. Next.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Janet Kloppenburg of JJK Research.","Janet Kloppenburg","Good morning everyone, and congratulations on the nice quarter. Alessandro, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the rather dramatic marketing that you conducted in the first part of May, the impact that had on the millennial customer, and if you've been able to analyze if you've been able to attain a greater share with that customer worldwide? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you. Well, we have -- we constantly monitor the results of our campaign. So both for the Believe in Love, so let's say solitaire diamond campaign as well as for the Believe in Dreams so the one of Paper Flowers and other design collections, what we have found and that we are very encouraged by that is that, yes, it's a very effective language message to attract new customers. But at the same time is also not alienating and on the contrary is attracting as well as existing customers. We have a lot of existing customers that were a bit lapsed, but bit slient in the last few years that thanks to these new messaging have come back. And so, we witnessed this in all the market, and this is what basically is the engine behind the numbers you have seen in the last two quarters.","Janet Kloppenburg","Thank you and good luck.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS.","Jay Sole","Great. Thank you. Mark, I just want to follow-up on the comment in the press release that earnings per share in the third quarter is expected to be below the prior year. Can you talk about gross margin little bit at the back half? Could you give us a sense of maybe where you see SG&A for 3Q? So just give us a sense of the magnitude of the decline in 3Q EPS versus last year?","Mark Erceg","Yes, I mean that's something that we want to be overly specific on. But I will tell you that as Alex said, our business is somewhat seasonal. And if you are really going to make a big statement, one of the times to do it is in the lead up to the holiday period. So, we are going to see a significant increase in SG&A as we support the business in a much more robust way. There is also additional spending that will be coming from as I talked earlier about some of our IT programs, you know, we stood up China, we said they were now going in parallel ways with multiple markets and so the cost will also follow along with respect to that to some extent. But we just make sure people understood that as we thought about the balance of the year with our revised guidance, which obviously we took things up, how we are seeing the third quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the fourth quarter. The third quarter we expect to be down. You do the math, the fourth quarter we expect to be up.","Jay Sole","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","And moving on\u2026","Alessandro Bogliolo","Okay, maybe one more question.","Operator","All right. We'll go to a question from Laurent Vasilescu of Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I want to followup on marketing. Marketing was 7.6% of FY '17 revenues, where should that rate go this year? Should it go increase by 50 to 100 bps for the year? And then secondly if I could just add in, the Japan comp came in mostly high 8% despite the toughest compare. Can you provide a little bit more color on the factors driving the strength in Japan?","Mark Erceg","Without being you know, vague or evasive of your question, I guess all I would say is that it's going to go up as far as marketing percent of sales. And obviously when you are posting 15% sales increases in the first quarter, 12% in the second, that helps. But we do expect marketing percent of sales this year to increase.","Alessandro Bogliolo","And as far as Japan is concerned, of course, as I think also other luxury brands, we are experiencing in Japan, a good flow of Chinese tourist. But I have to say that most -- that far largest portion of our sales in Japan is to domestic customers. And we have seen very solid strong sales to our customers in Japan. But again, I think it resonates with the marketing messaging and the initiatives we are taking globally. And they resonate very strongly with a market like Japan where we are present since many years. And we are clearly a leader there.","Mark Aaron","Okay, excuse me. In the interest of everyone's time, I think we will now conclude this call. We hope people found it to be informative and productive. Of course, please feel free to call me with any other questions. And please note that we expect to report third quarter results on November 28th, with a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Thanks for listening.","Operator","And so that does conclude the call. We would like to thank everyone for your participation today. You may now disconnect."],"20416":["Tiffany & Co.

Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Aaron","Thank you everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. I hope you have all had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. Alessandro and Mark have some brief comments to share with you, and then we will be pleased to take your questions.","Before continuing, please note that statements made on this call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

The details of our financial results are contained in today\u2019s news release and 10-Q filing, so we decided to abrogate our formal comments in order to have more time to answer your questions. But before taking any questions, I want to spend a few minutes commenting on some highlights of those results and the relevance to our long-term strategy. Mark Erceg will then address the financial results and the outlook.","I joined Tiffany a little more than one year ago and I cannot be more pleased with and appreciative of what our team has accomplished in a short time. Worldwide net sales have increased 10% in the year to date with balanced performance throughout the business. We have modernized our marketing communications and accelerated new product innovations, and enhanced our store base. I previously said that we are on a long and exciting journey, and I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a good start.","Earlier this year, we laid out our six key strategic priorities and also said that we would be increasing investment spending in several areas in order to support sustainable sales growth. Despite some external factors that have mitigated a portion of our recent sales growth and the related near-term uncertainties, I am encouraged and as confident as ever about the long term path that we are on.","Communicating brand relevance and desirability begins at home to local customers in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe. In this objective, we are making good progress. We have increased the sales attributed to local customers in each of the first three quarters of the year and in all regions. Such gains were partly offset in the third quarter in some markets by lower sales attributed to foreign tourists, particularly to Chinese. Of course, jewelry sales for Tiffany and the overall industry can be volatile due to currency shifts, regulations, travel patterns and other factors.","In the third quarter, sales attributed to Chinese tourists were lower in the Americas and in Hong Kong, as well as wholesale sales to Korean duty-free operators related to Chinese jewelry purchases, which had been very strong for several quarters. But on the contrary, we have achieved healthy double-digit sales growth in mainland China throughout the year with even stronger momentum in local currency in the third quarter. We can speculate on the reasons for the tourist spending slowdown outside of China, but the reality is that the Tiffany brand is appealing to Chinese customers, as evidenced by the continued strong sales growth in mainland China in the quarter.","Another objective is to achieve increased jewelry unit volume, and I\u2019m pleased that overall jewelry unit volume has increased in all three quarters of the year. Consistent with this, product innovation that is more frequent and distinctive is one of our priorities, and we have been exciting customers this year with the launches of the Paper Flowers and Tiffany True collections, as well as making additions to existing jewelry collections such as Tiffany T, Tiffany Keys, HardWear, and Return to Tiffany. In fact, in September we celebrated the launch of Paper Flowers in Shanghai with a major event attended by hundreds of customers, celebrities, and influencers. The resonance across digital and traditional media all over China has been spectacular.","As we disclosed three months ago, we are also investing more in our High Jewelry assortment which we believe offers meaningful long-term opportunities in key global markets. In October, we held our annual Blue Book event in New York for select customers who reacted enthusiastically to the extraordinary creations [indiscernible] the ninth High Jewelry offering that we presented. We were very pleased with sales results.","Introducing new products and communicating an inclusive and culturally relevant message are intended to increase store and online traffic and conversion rates. Both metrics have increased in the quarter and year to date. We are pleased with customer reaction to our Make It My Tiffany program to personalize pieces of jewelry and we recently launched a powerful holiday marketing campaign, for which I hope you have watched the whimsical video on YouTube or our social platforms.","Another strategic point is to invest in digital and omni-channel, and we are seeing the benefits. Our website serves as a powerful marketing vehicle to further enhance brand and product awareness, and online shopping has been increasing. In fact, we have been very pleased with double-digit ecommerce sales growth in the quarter and year to date.","To improve the in-store experience, our sales professionals are engaging with customers in a more consultative way, and we are increasingly seeing the benefits from utilizing our global CRM system capabilities. We are also addressing the look and feel of the stores with visual merchandising enhancements in our North American stores this year, and will do so in all stores globally next year.","In closing, our third quarter results came in close to our expectations. We are certainly mindful of external uncontrollable factors but will not be distracted by them, so I believe that we are taking the right steps on this long and exciting journey.","I will now turn the call over to Mark Erceg.","Mark Erceg","Thanks Alex. Reported sales grew 4% during the third quarter, and as predicted, earnings per share came in slightly below year ago at $0.77 per share as an increase in gross margin and a lower than expected tax rate on the quarter was offset by a substantial increase in SG&A-related investment spending as well as an unexpected charge of $0.05 per share for the estimated net loss from the recent bankruptcy filing of a precious metals refiner.","Net inventories were 6% above prior year as we built stock in anticipation of the holiday season and made incremental investments in our High Jewelry assortment, which was in part and as Alex already mentioned, responsible for a very strong Blue Book event this past October. With total debt representing only 31% of stockholders equity and $655 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at quarter end, our balance sheet remains strong.","As we have clearly and repeatedly communicated, we are increasing strategic investment spending this year across a number of areas and intend to maintain these higher levels of support going forward in order to drive sustainable top line sales growth, margin expansion, and higher asset productivity. One of those areas is information systems, where we\u2019re happy to report that seven additional countries were placed onto our new IT platform during the third quarter. These countries are in addition to China, which was converted during the first quarter of this year. You will recall that this suite of IT tools enables a common order and inventory management system, a single financial instance, and for the first time a source to pay procurement system. The multi-functional teams responsible for these efforts are working very hard and we remain pleased with the progress being made to improve our systems and processes as part of this multi-year modernization effort.","In terms of our financial outlook for the year, we continue to expect high single digit sales growth and diluted earnings per share of $4.65 to $4.80 per share. We expect our tax rate to be in the low to mid-20s, share repurchases of approximately $400 million, and we expect to generate nearly $300 million of free cash flow.","Finally, as is our normal practice, we will provide a holiday sales update in January and comment on our initial financial guidance for 2019 when we report our full-year results in March.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mark.","Mark Aaron","Thanks, Alessandro and Mark. Operator, I think we\u2019re ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll go first to Paul Lejuez at Citi Research.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks guys. Can you talk about the pricing actions you took in China? When were prices lowered and on what percentage of the assortment? I\u2019m curious what the response has been and whether or not you think that might have contributed to strength on the mainland, maybe a little bit of a weaker Chinese tourist business. Thanks.","Mark Erceg","Yes, I think what we would tell you is that we did make some pricing adjustments in China. The first one was in July - that was in response to the change in tariffs. We talked about that during our last call and felt that it was important for us to be mindful of what was happening in that marketplace, so we did pass through in effect the full value of that tariff\/duty reduction. Now subsequent to that, we have continued to look at our global pricing, as we always do, and we have made some adjustments since that point in time to our global pricing strategies, which went into effect towards the very later stages of the month of August, and China was part of that.","Paul Lejuez","And how did the consumer respond there?","Mark Erceg","So far, as Alex indicated, we\u2019ve been doing exceedingly well with mainland Chinese. Our domestic business there was very strong for the first two quarters of the year, and it\u2019s only accelerated into the third.","Paul Lejuez","Is that unit driven or is that ticket driven, Mark?","Mark Erceg","Both.","Paul Lejuez","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Omar Saad at Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks for all the information this morning. Good morning. Could you talk about if you saw in the quarter or in the weeks leading up to the quarter, and since if you\u2019re willing to comment, the financial market volatility, are you seeing that because especially in Asia, having an effect on the customer base, or do you see customer behavior that\u2019s still really separated from what we\u2019re seeing in the financial markets? I know there\u2019s a lot of concern out there that financial market volatility will eventually start to weigh on consumers\u2019 minds, especially the luxury consumer. Any thoughts you have around that would be really appreciated, thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Omar, for your question. What we have clearly seen in the quarter has been a shift in Chinese tourism and spending, so we have seen spending of Chinese tourists going down in important markets outside of China, and we have seen strong sales in mainland China. Our sales in mainland China were actually double digit in the first two quarters and they even accelerated in local currency in the third quarter, so this is the clear pattern that we have seen now since a few months.","As far as the general market, stock market is doing, this is something we look closely because this can be an effect on the perceived wealth of people. So far, we have not seen a direct impact of it on sales because our sales to local customers around the world has kept being positive, very positive also in the third quarter, but of course it\u2019s something that we look closely because we know that it may have an effect on luxury consumption.","Omar Saad","Thank you, nice job.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","Good morning, appreciate you taking my questions. I also wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the issue of spending on the part of Chinese tourists. Could you help us do the math - maybe for Mark - on just what weaker sales to Chinese tourists, how large that impact was to your total company comps? Then a second question, I guess as maybe a follow-up to what Paul was asking initially, is Tiffany just really at the mercy of these currency shifts or are there actions you can take to help offset the impacts in your business?","Mark Erceg","I think maybe I\u2019ll start and then Alex can provide additional commentary. Clearly if you look at our business and you say what was different in the first and second quarters relative to the third, there\u2019s not a lot to point to specifically outside of some of these macro factors that we\u2019re now contending with. Alex in his prepared remarks said very clearly that unit volume growth was strong throughout the quarters. With domestics, we talked about domestic sales being strong pretty much in all regions and all product categories for the first, second and third quarters of the year, so with strong product, with a store that is improving each and every day with strong communicating and higher share of voice, brand message, I think you could then in some ways answer your own question, that clearly the tourism impact that we did see in the third quarter was one of the largest delineating factors between the sales results we posted in the first half of the year versus the third quarter trends.","We look at Chinese tourist travel very closely, we look at it market by market. We have a very strong business with the mainland domestic Chinese. We also look at Hong Kong and Macau and we look at global tourism flows and patterns, and we do know that Chinese tourists, not surprisingly, as for all global luxury players, they are an important part of the equation today and going forward. We believe that we have strong programs and plans that speak directly to them, and we think the evidence of that is clearly shown in our mainland domestic results in the third quarter which, as we said, were even stronger than the first half of the year.","Alessandro Bogliolo","I would add to that, that--let\u2019s take an example, a practical example. If we take Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government issued some statistics recently about Chinese tourist arrivals in Hong Kong, and for the first eight months of the year the increase of Chinese arrivals was ranging between plus-10 and plus-20%, depending on the month. In September, it went down to very low single digits. Now, you can imagine that our people, our organization in Hong Kong, there is little they can do to compensate for this. Of course, we have marketing that is really focused to tourists, but of course it depends a lot--its effectiveness depends a lot on the number of tourists that come to a single place.","To answer your question, what is important for me, is to keep the relevance of the brand with Chinese customers in general, because we know this is a huge engine of growth and is an important portion of our business. This is why I\u2019m so pleased about the launch of Paper Flowers in China that has been really amazing. The sales to Chinese in mainland China accelerating - this is the sign of the fundamental health and appeal of the brand to Chinese customers. Unfortunately when it comes to travel patterns, this is something that we have seen--the entire industry has seen it several times in the past changing suddenly one quarter to another, in one way and another, and this is only very marginally influenced by our actions.","Mark Erceg","Travel patterns, currency moves, regulations - all of that.","Brian Nagel","Very helpful, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Binetti at Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions here. I know you don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on 2019 today, but I think the burning question really is as you think about the framework that you\u2019ve already spoken to, to help guide us over a multi-year pass, I think you commented that this year would be the SG&A reset year to the algorithm with very low EPS growth on the same mid-single digit comp, but next year it would be back to a more normalized algorithm with margin leverage. You signed up for some very long-dated investments here that are no doubt the right thing to do for the business over the long term, but if we are in for a period of extended subdued tourism trends, how much flexibility do you have with the investment schedule next year to manage SG&A inflation in that kind of a global consumer scenario?","Mark Erceg","I think we want to take things one step at a time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate just to say too much about 2019, other than the fact that we have stated very publicly that we do expect to have operating margin expansion in 2019. You\u2019re right - this has been earmarked as a bit of an investment year across the five key areas that we identified, where we had lagged and hadn\u2019t made sufficient investments in prior years to really drive sustainable top line sales growth.","Some of those elements, you\u2019re right, will continue to roll forward to some extent, so for example when you think about IT systems, we are now standing up multiple geographies simultaneously, and if you look back to the first quarter this year, we stood up China, so you could argue that there will be more IT spending in maybe the first quarter of \u201919 relative to the first quarter of \u201918, and that might be a fair assessment. We\u2019re continuing to roll out our CBM elements into the stores and we\u2019ve done a lot of that in the current year, but that will continue into next year, so there will be some areas that carry forward in effect as it relates to that. But we have very clearly stated that we expect to drive operating margin expansion in 2019 and are committed to that, and we\u2019ve certainly built plans internally to allow for that as well. We\u2019re doing that by getting really aggressive on the procurement side and a lot of the other work take-outs that we have, have been affecting here corporately as a team.","Michael Binetti","Okay, and then I guess you\u2019d have that same confidence away from your control year in a bit of a--if the same store trajectory comes in at the low end of what you guys think about historically, you feel like you have ample flexibility to continue that commitment on the operating line next year?","Mark Erceg","I guess what I would say is we have said very clearly that we need to be able to extract P&L leverage at a lower rate of overall sales growth, and we are putting programs and processes in place to allow for that. Now, obviously we\u2019d like to see more top line as opposed to less - that makes things considerably easier, and we can\u2019t be too predictive of where things will be a quarter from now with respect to Chinese tourism. What I can tell you is that we feel very good about the long term trends.","One of the things that we\u2019ve talked often about is the fact that when you do look at tourism, people tend to spend more when they are traveling, when they are on holiday. We\u2019ve had these types of shifts before where certain key groups like the Chinese might be traveling more heavily to Japan one quarter and then maybe to the U.S. the next and Europe the one thereafter - those things we can\u2019t control, but as Alex said, if we have the right messages tailored to the Chinese themselves and they find the brand appealing, that provides some real ballast there.","If you also think about just long term trends, I think the estimate right now that is only, what, 6, 7, 8% of total Chinese even have a passport, so the long term trend of the Chinese who are having an emergence of their middle class and their high net worth folks, there\u2019s going to be more and more Chinese traveling the world, which is a good thing for all of us. We welcome that, and we think that they will continue to frequent our stores when they make those purchase occasions.","Michael Binetti","All right, thanks for all the help. I really appreciate it, Mark.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to David Schick with Consumer Edge Research.","David Schick","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think that one of the things that\u2019s been so interesting to all of the observers on the street is your connectivity with the consumer in different ways, whether it\u2019s product, the stores--new product, the stores, and the marketing. I guess sales move around, as you said, and you want to build the model for the long term, but could you talk about markers, whether it\u2019s in your CRM, in your interactions that give you the confidence that those newness pathways are going to mean more than just the latest change in sales direction? What I\u2019m trying to say is whether it\u2019s what you\u2019re hearing at the store level around engagement - I know that moved around a little bit this quarter, or customers asking about new gift catalogs. Just a little more, I think, anecdote around your relationship with customers and what that could mean over time.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, David, because I think this question is really the core matter that we are focusing on, which we have taken--we have started taking a lot of actions in the past quarters in modernizing our marketing, in innovating products, etc., so as management, my constant obsession really is to see day by day how these things impact on the fundamentals of our business. There are several things that are really encouraging us and are clearing from certain concerns that at the beginning I could have. Let me make a few examples.","First of all, we have seen in the last nine months an increase, a substantial increase in traffic both in our stores, physical stores, as well as our website. We have seen conversion rates increasing in the first part of the year as well as in the last quarter. Now, difficult to say if this is directly related to the activities that we have done in the stores, but for example we have enhanced our visual merchandising in the United States and the conversion rate that was growing in the first two quarters after these enhancements has grown at an even faster pace. Now, is it totally due to the enhanced visual merchandising? Nobody knows, but for example, talking--I\u2019ve been to several stores in the U.S. after this new VM project and our teams were enthusiastic. They were reporting customers saying, oh, what did you do to the store, it\u2019s new, etc. Well, in reality it was simply new visual merchandising.","But let me make some more examples. What I constantly look at is what\u2019s happening to our sales between existing customers and new customers, because you know that we have quite radically changed our communication in the past year and so this was an area of concern for me, to monitor is it working or is not working. I\u2019m very pleased because constantly, including the last quarter, we have seen an increase in sales both to new customers as well as an increase to existing customers. This to me shows two things: one is that the new messaging of the brand is resonating with new customers but is not alienating existing customers. Now, this growth to existing customers is due more to the new communication or is due more to the enhanced CRM we have, that I\u2019m not able to tell you. But what I can see is that the fundamentals of the business that at the end of the day is local customers, traffic, conversion rates, they are all positive throughout the geographies.","Even if we have a slowdown to a mid-single digit growth in the third quarter, when we look at the products, I didn\u2019t see--there is not a product-related pattern. The pattern that we have seen is more geography and tourism flow-related, so all this is of course we\u2019d be more pleased with double digit growth than mid-single digit growth, but when it comes to the fundamentals, we are really encouraged by the actions we are taking.","David Schick","Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go move next to Oliver Chen at Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. What are your thoughts about the duration of the Chinese consumer and your own plans, and what happened with the product assortment in terms of the composition of products and what that may mean for how you should plan globally? Just related to that is your thoughts on if this is a continued shift as more people consume domestically in mainland China, and how long you think that will go on for and how we should characterize this shift versus a reduction in spending, or some combination of both. Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Oliver, for your question. Difficult to tell for us how long this will last. I mean, here we\u2019re getting to macroeconomic speculation that we are not the best people to answer to this. It\u2019s obviously the fact that the tariffs in China have decreased the fact that the Chinese government has declared that they want to enhance and push the local consumption. These are all factors that affect any retail business, including ours. This is unfortunately outside of our control and it\u2019s impossible for me to preview how long this will last.","On the other side, what we can do and we have been doing, and we started doing, is that following the flows of Chinese customers and now having them spending more in mainland China rather than abroad. Of course, we are making adjustments to our inventory in order to make sure that we are not missing any sales in mainland China, where the demand now is really very, very strong. Operationally we are doing a lot in order to follow, or try to follow where customers are buying with the best possible offer, and so far in mainland China this is paying back.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Lastly, digital engagement has been really improving and a lot more exciting. What are the features that you are planning ahead, and where do you think the biggest opportunities are? The digital will manifest in both inventory as well as features as well as engagement. Just would love your thoughts on what that will--how that will evolve and what it means for luxury. Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, our ecommerce sales, we have 13 countries where we operate our direct ecommerce, and the sales growth in this channel has been strong double digits to date and is exactly in line also in the third quarter, even slightly higher, so we are pleased with this because it shows that the investments we are making in the ecommerce to improve our platforms, our assets and our offer there are paying back, and the growth is much higher than in the brick and mortar.","Of course, we are just at the beginning of the journey. I keep on repeating this because we have been working very hard in the last three quarters, but I think we have years in front of us and when it comes specifically to ecommerce, we are working very hard now for major improvements next year and in the years to come. This is not something--this, like anything else, is not something that is fixed in a couple of quarters, but I can tell you this we take very seriously the ecommerce opportunity in western countries as well as in Asia, and we are investing in it in order to further grow our performance of the last three quarters.","Oliver Chen","Happy holidays. Thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Erwan Rambourg at HSBC.","Erwan Rambourg","Hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Sorry to belabor the point around Chinese tourism flows, but when you speak to your teams in the different markets, can you assess what you believe is down to psychology, i.e. what was asked around equity markets and potentially tariffs and trade or other elements of stress that could impact consumer confidence, and what is more linked to FX, i.e. is it just that when your wealth is in renminbi, basically the world looks pretty expensive to you. Can you split what you think is linked to psychology of Chinese consumption versus just FX matters?","Then related to that, how does that impact the U.S., i.e. the local U.S. consumer seems to be doing really well, Chinese flows here into the U.S. seem to be affected. What is the case for--you know, what\u2019s the split between the two, and are you seeing anything different from other nationalities of tourism, i.e. is every nationality impacted by the strength of the dollar or are you seeing certain nationalities do well into the U.S.? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Erwan. Well, let\u2019s look a little bit at our comp sales. I would look at it in constant exchange rates because this is more meaningful business-wise. Year-to-date, we are growing comp sales at 6%, and in the quarter is plus-3% globally. Now in the Americas, the growth went from 7 year-to-date to 5 in the quarter. Now, this can be mainly attributed to Chinese--general foreign spending, but I will say mainly Chinese spending because if I look at sales to domestic local customers in North America, we have seen very solid growth in the first two quarters and exactly the same growth also in the third quarter.","Now, you are asking me about the stock market, seems you asked now. It\u2019s true that two quarters, six months ago, nobody was talking about technology share prices being weak, and this is something that has happened more recently, so I\u2019m not able to tell you about the future, but as far as the year-to-date and the third quarter, we have seen no slowdown in demand from local customers in USA.","Where there has been a slowdown is clearly in Japan because if you look at comp sales, they go from 6% year-to-date to 2% last quarter, and this is due both to Chinese tourists but also to a softer demand in Japan, where sales to local customers have been soft in the last quarter. But this--I mean, you never hear me talking about the weather and these kinds of things, but we have to admit that there was an earthquake in Japan that affected of course a lot of consumption, and honestly I don\u2019t see any problem of the brand with Japanese consumers. We have a very strong leadership position there, there is no matter of lack of confidence or change of something.","So I would say what is really meaningful in a nutshell for me is that sales to local customers in the third quarter have remained strong. Let\u2019s hope that these trends continue or even improves going forward, but you know that in our business, this is a very special moment because we are now in November and you now that December, the single month of December is more than enough of our last quarter, so naturally the gates are open. Everything will happen in the four weeks that are in front of us, and I think internally we have put down all the actions in terms of products, marketing, training, CRM that we could do. Now, really everything is in the hands of customers and their intention to buy, and we hope that they will be good.","Erwan Rambourg","Okay, thank you very much. Best of luck. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Francesca Di Pasquantonio with Deutsche Bank.","Francesca Di Pasquantonio ","Yes, hi. Good afternoon. I have three follow-up questions, please. The first one is regarding your global footprint of stores, whether you feel it is adequate or somehow it\u2019s not allowing you to express your full potential in terms of capturing the traffic and the demand in the different regions, especially by the Chinese tourists travelling around. The second question is following up on what you just said on December. Would it be a good, let\u2019s say, description to say that you are feeling good about the forthcoming holiday season, given what we have seen in terms of the strength of the U.S. consume recently? The third question is on diamond prices. I know it doesn\u2019t affect you, but De Beers lowering the selling prices, the prices for their lower quality diamonds, how do you see this and do you see it as a signal for future trends in diamond prices? How do you feel about the idea of diamonds as a store of value on one hand and De Beers signaling something else? Many thanks.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Francesca, thank you for your questions. First of all about the store network, I think we have a very strong store network. It\u2019s covering--it\u2019s truly global, and if we think specifically to the latest trend of this increasing demand in mainland China, even in mainland China we have a network that is really comparable with our best competitors, and it is a network where we have been investing a lot. If you think even this year, we have opened new stores in China in Suzhou, in Changsha, in Hefei. We have two locations, one in Nanjing, one in Xi An, so we are investing in the network not only in China but particularly in China, and we will keep doing so in the future where we have plans of enhancing our store network in China and elsewhere for next year. Honestly, I see that as a strength of the brand, not as a weakness.","Now, if you ask me if there are opportunities for Tiffany to open 10, 20, 30, 40 stores - yes, but we tend to be more conservative about this in the sense that we are really focusing on the efficiency and productivity of existing stores. We are more working on the like-for-like rather than taking the easy way of just adding additional stores. That is a nice thing, is the reserve that we have there, and we will in due time exploit it, but this is not really our main focus. That is more on productivity.","Mark Erceg","Yes, the long term plan is still to grow global square footage about 2% a year.","Francesca Di Pasquantonio","Okay, thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","In answer to your second question about my feeling about the next four, five weeks, honestly it\u2019s something that in general we don\u2019t comment on the current business, even less so on the future. Honestly, I think it\u2019s a little bit difficult for anybody in the world to have these answers, so I\u2019m really not able to comment on this.","Mark Erceg","Then relative to the third question about diamond prices and what De Beers recently did, that was on low end quality stones. I really don\u2019t think that has any bearing on what we purchase and what we buy. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we basically reject 99.96% of the world\u2019s gem quality stones, and you talked about diamonds as a store of value and whether or not this will be impeded or affected by this, I think the answer is clearly no. Think about high end, classic luxury cars - those hold their value, they\u2019re an asset class unto themselves. You buy a lower end car, it\u2019s a depreciation, wasting asset. I think the types of diamonds that we deal in and the diamonds that we provide our customers are of such high quality that they will always be a store of value and they will always appreciate going forward as a general rule.","Francesca Di Pasquantonio","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Simeon Siegel at Nomura Instinet.","Dan Stroller","Hi, this is Dan Stroller on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our question. Mark, can you quantify how much the gross margin expansion was due to fewer wholesale sales of diamonds, and then just any thoughts going forward on the use of those sales? Thank you.","Mark Erceg","Yes, that\u2019s not something that we would typically break out specifically. What I will tell you is that we have been working really hard to ensure that we uncover every rock as it relates to cost savings opportunities. We\u2019ve talked about our procurement function a little bit in the past and how it\u2019s a relatively recent construct - it was only begun a couple years back, but just by way of an example, we currently have a portfolio, a project portfolio in the procurement team that is over 300 projects, and we have dedicated groups that are looking at ways to have cost take-out across design and construction, information technology, a strategic sourcing team, a corporate services team. We have teams dedicated towards marketing and design and construction as well as packaging. IT contracts is a specific area that we have dedicated groups again as well, and so maybe just for the purposes of an example, I can point out one thing that was just recently done.","This was a project that started in September, it was completed in October of this year. We basically took 18 credit card processing providers - 18 that we had used across the EMEA region, this was across 11 different countries, and we put in place an RFP process where we worked with the business to understand exactly what the requirements were, and we were able to go from 18 providers across EMEA for credit card processing down to one. We did that in a way where we can now have more customer payment forms accepted, like Alipay and WeChat, which again makes it more consumer friendly, and in doing so we also reduced the costs that we were paying for the credit card processing fees by over 40%, as an example.","So gross margin, there\u2019s a lot of things that go into that. We don\u2019t want to get too specific or too granular on teasing out any one given element, but I can assure you that the cost take-out programs that we have across the company are pervasive and becoming more and more so each and every day.","Dan Stroller","Got it, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Tunick at Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Great, thanks. Good morning guys. Curious, maybe Alex, if you could talk about how you feel about product innovation, pipeline, and maybe some more details on the product categories specifically as you head into 2019. How do you think Tiffany looks position-wise from product newness, any big ideas versus maybe previously before you joined the company? Second question maybe on Europe, maybe give some more color on the improvement there and if you think the worst is behind the company from a macro perspective in Europe. Thank you very much.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Brian. Well, this year in 2018, we started accelerating product innovation. This was the beginning of our program. It happened with Paper Flowers. The results so far are encouraging and especially there is another factor on the entire platinum, gold and diamond jewelry that is very positive, so we are very pleased with it. Difficult to say on Tiffany True - it\u2019s a pre-launch now since a few weeks in North America. Anecdotally, our sales people are very enthusiastic about it, but it\u2019s early to say about the total results. But definitely, we have a strong pipeline for innovation for next year, and you have to understand that this is a process that started when I joined 14 months ago and the lead time for product development takes 1.5 years normally, so we have--yes, we have very solid plans for next year. We are confident on what internally we are doing about it, and so far the results are positive and we see it from, as I said, traffic, conversion rates, and growth in existing and new customers with domestic customers everywhere.","Brian Tunick","And maybe some more color about Europe, trends and thoughts?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Well, about Europe, also there what we said about Chinese customers buying less abroad is valid also in Europe. We have also there very strong programs for the holidays. We have an amazing initiative in the U.K., in London. We have the pop-up store there in Covent Garden that has had enormous coverage in terms of press and enormous traffic. We have an initiative with our partners in perfume in [indiscernible] Station. I received hundreds of pictures of friends and of the house about that amazing installation, so let me say the teams have been working very hard in order to really get the most out of local customers.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll move to Laurent Vasilescu at Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Greater China. I think the 10-K parses out that it\u2019s approximately 60% of 2017 Asia Pacific revenues, which I think equates to 16% of total company revenues. Can you parse out how much the Chinese consumer represents of overall total company sales? If you include shopping in other regions, is it fair to say 25%? Then can you maybe quantify if Greater China grew overall this quarter if we include Hong Kong and Macau?","Alessandro Bogliolo","When we take luxury brands, and there are many studies that are public about this, typically around one-third of the total business nowadays is made with Chinese nationals, and typically the split is of these, 33% - one third is made in mainland China and two-thirds is made up of Chinese national spending abroad.","Now, these are industry general data. As Tiffany, we are more or less in that range as well, so this explains also the concerns we have about Chinese travellers because it\u2019s an important portion of our business, and on the other side explains why we are satisfied with the growth in mainland China, because that is the real engine of growth.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much. Then just a quick follow-up - year to date, the free cash flow is slightly down. To get to the $300 million in free cash flow for the year, Mark, maybe can you walk us through the fourth quarter cash from operations to get to the full year guide?","Mark Erceg","Yes, what I would tell you is that we modified our language just a little bit as it relates to free cash flow. The short answer, in the interests of time, is that it relates to tax payments. As you can imagine, there\u2019s been a lot of moving parts on the corporate tax law changes, and the tax payments will be what drives the slight differential on our free cash flow guidance.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi guys, good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk to the Blue Book event, how that was received generally and if you did anything different this year versus last year, and just an update on the investment you are making in the high end jewelry and where we are in that initiative as well. Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thanks Bob. That is an important initiative, and we haven\u2019t had the opportunity to expand on that. You know that every year we have two major High Jewelry events, one in the first semester and the second one in the second semester in addition to more regular activities that we do [indiscernible]. This year, the event that we held in New York, we call it Blue Book, it was held in the second part of the year, actually in October, while last year it was in the first part of the year. But still, there were two events in the two parts of the year, both last year and this year.","Now, the difference about this Blue Book was there were two major differences. One is that we have a new Chief Artistic Officer, so this is why we decided to have the New York event in the fall instead of the spring, in order to allow him to have more time with his team to design these amazing pieces. The second thing is that, as we announced a couple of quarters ago, we had invested more in more important stones that of course go in this High Jewelry, so in this Blue Book event there were more important pieces and stones than normally.","I have to say that the reaction of customers has been very, very positive to both factors, both the design and innovation brought by Reed and his team, as well as by the extremely--I would say the exceptional stones that we offered to our customers that were very, very well received.","Bob Drbul","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dana Telsey at Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Hi, good morning everyone. As you think about the collections, the category performance in jewelry, engagement and designer jewelry, how does it break out between the regions? Is there anything you saw differently, particularly relative to the change in performance in designer jewelry? Thank you.","Alessandro Bogliolo","Overall, looking at product performance by category and even at a more granular level than the collections, etc., there was not a change in pattern between the third quarter and the first part of the year. The only exception is about designers, specifically Peretti, that there were several factors. Probably the most relevant one is that the Peretti collection is traditionally very strong in Japan, and Japan has been more affected because of the reasons that we cited in this last quarter. But apart from this detail, I would say really no product-related changes in performance.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Laura Champine at Loop Capital.","Laura Champine","Thanks, and good morning. In your 10-Q today, you spelled out that over the next three years, you\u2019ll see about $0.10 to $0.15 of pressure each year on EPS from the New York flagship remodeling. Can you put that in context by telling us about how much pressure you\u2019ll see from the remodeling in the chain overall globally over the next three years?","Mark Erceg","I guess what I would say is I\u2019d offer two things. One, just to provide additional clarity on what we said about the flagship project, we did say that it would be about $0.10 to $0.15 of cost during the construction build-out, in effect. We did say that about $0.07 of that would be already absorbed and incurred in the current fiscal year, and so the year-over-year differential would be another, call it $0.07 or $0.08 incrementally year versus year.","As far as the other question is concerned, we\u2019ve been building out our store network over the last many years, and the amount of capex we plan to spend going into \u201919 and the amount of money that we spent in \u201918 for the base store network will be comparable to what we spent in effect in \u201916 and the prior year. I wouldn\u2019t expect there to be a meaningful change in our burn rate or our costs as it relates to the underlying store network, and then of course the flagship does come on top, but that\u2019s what spoke to that $0.10 to $0.15.","Laura Champine","Got it, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alexandra Walvis at Goldman Sachs.","Alexandra Walvis","Great, thank you so much for taking the question. I was wondering if we could reflect for a moment on some of the new launches in the last year, in particular Everyday Objects and Paper Flowers. A year into that process of some of these new collections, I was wondering if there was anything that had surprised you in terms of the shape of demand following the launches. For example, was the initial pop in demand higher than expectations, and how persistent has demand for those product areas been since the initial launch? Then finally, have the trends that you\u2019ve observed in that respect changed the way at all that you think about how you\u2019re introducing newness into the collection in the future?","Alessandro Bogliolo","Thank you, Alexandra, for your question. We are very pleased actually with the performance of Home and Accessories, as well as Paper Flowers. It\u2019s in line with our expectations. You have to understand that in our business in jewelry, newness is important, but it\u2019s not--it\u2019s extremely important when it comes to messaging, to driving traffic. It\u2019s not so radical when it comes to sales, in the sense it\u2019s a different intention when you have a new collection that can represent 20, 30, 40, 50% or even more of your sales. This is absolutely not the case in jewelry, where the strength of the brands are the pillars of iconic designs that remain successful for decades, and this is the case of Tiffany with T, with Peretti, with HardWear, with Keys as it is for the best jewelers in the world.","Overall, we are pleased, and I think that we wouldn\u2019t have had an increase in traffic in our stores if our launches were not well received, that people would have not come to the stores. Then they come to the store and some buy new products, but most of customers tend to buy iconic existing product, which makes us very happy.","Also, because this allows efficiencies when it comes, for example, to manufacturing, to the gross margin. We didn\u2019t talk so much about gross margin until now in this call, but t this is something that has improved in the year and in the quarter, and I think it\u2019s a sign of a healthy business and of also efficiencies on the manufacturing point of view, for which we are very happy. Thank you.","Alexandra Walvis","Thanks.","Mark Aaron","Operator, it\u2019s now 9:30, so I think we\u2019re going to wrap it up.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Again, thank you for your participation."]}}
